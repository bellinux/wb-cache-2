50|$|<b>Deglazing</b> is {{a process}} by which the surface of an engine {{cylinder}} is roughened to create friction between the moving parts and allow engine oil to grip the sides of the cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|Jus is a rich, lightly reduced stock {{used as a}} {{sauce for}} roasted meats. Many of these are started by <b>deglazing</b> the {{roasting}} pan, then reducing to achieve the rich flavour desired.|$|E
50|$|Red-eye gravy is a gravy {{made from}} the drippings of ham fried in a skillet/frying pan. The pan is <b>deglazed</b> with coffee, and uses no {{thickening}} agent. This gravy is a staple of Southern United States cuisine and is usually served over ham, grits or biscuits.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{in vitro}} study {{compared}} {{the effect of}} five different techniques on the surface roughness of feldspathic porcelain. Materials and Methods: 100 feldspathic porcelain disk samples mounted in acrylic resin blocks were divided into five groups (n= 20) according to type of surface treatment: I, hydrofluoric acid (HFA); II, <b>Deglazed</b> surface porcelain treated with Neodymium:yttrium- aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser; III, <b>Deglazed</b> porcelain surface treated with Erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser; IV, Glazed porcelain surface treated with Neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, V; Glazed porcelain surface treated with Erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser. The surface roughness of porcelain was measured with a noncontact optical profilometer. For each porcelain sample, two readings were taken across the sample, before porcelain surface treatment (T 1) and after porcelain surface treatment (T 2). The roughness parameter analyzed was the average roughness (Ra). Statistical analysis was performed using Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: Mean Ra values for each group were as follows: I, 12. 64 ± 073; II, 11. 91 ± 0. 74; III, 11. 76 ± 0. 59; IV, 3. 82 ± 0. 65; V, 2. 77 ± 0. 57. For all porcelain groups, the lowest Ra values were observed in Group V. The highest Ra values were observed for Group I, with a significant difference with the other groups. Kolmogorov–Smirnov showed significant differences among groups (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Surface treatment of porcelain with HFA resulted in significantly higher Ra than laser groups. Both Er:YAG laser or Nd:YAG laser on the <b>deglaze</b> porcelain surface can be recommended as viable treatment alternatives to acid etching...|$|R
25|$|White {{wines are}} often used as an Apéritif during the meal, with dessert, or as a {{refreshing}} drink between meals. They are often considered more refreshing, and lighter in both style and taste than {{the majority of their}} red wine counterparts. In addition, due to their acidity, aroma, and ability to soften meat and <b>deglaze</b> cooking juices, white wines {{are often used}} in cooking.|$|R
50|$|Italian chefs {{sometimes}} use clam juice as {{an ingredient}} in seafood dishes and pasta sauces. It is sometimes {{used during the}} <b>deglazing</b> process in cooking. It may provide a mineral-like flavor to dishes, {{and serve as a}} substrate to assist in combining flavors present in a dish.|$|E
5000|$|According to writer Tony Polombo, pans {{that are}} not {{non-stick}} are better for producing pan gravy, because the fond (the caramelized drippings that stick to the pan when meat is cooked) sticks to them, and {{can be turned into}} pan gravy by <b>deglazing</b> them - dissolving them in liquid.|$|E
50|$|For some cooking {{preparations}} a non-stick {{frying pan}} is inappropriate, especially for <b>deglazing,</b> where {{the residue of}} browning is to be incorporated in a later step such as a pan sauce. Since little or no residue can stick to the surface, the sauce will fail for lack of its primary flavoring agent.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} correct the situation, a {{mechanic}} can take the engine apart, and <b>deglaze</b> the cylinders, usually using an abrasive. This creates a roughly 45 degree angle crosshatching of tiny grooves in the cylinder wall, and restores the engine's performance. Crosshatching that deviates too far from 45 degrees can either cause an unwanted accumulation of oil or be unable {{to hold on to}} the oil entirely.|$|R

5000|$|Verjuice ( [...] from Middle French vertjus [...] "green juice") is {{a highly}} acidic juice made by {{pressing}} unripe grapes, crab-apples or other sour fruit. Sometimes lemon or sorrel juice, herbs or spices are added to change the flavour. In the Middle Ages, it was widely used all over Western Europe as an ingredient in sauces, as a condiment, or to <b>deglaze</b> preparations. It is still used to some extent in the American South.|$|R

During that time, he changes the pastry codes by incorporating techniques originally used only in savoury cooking (reduction of sauces, minute cooking, <b>deglazing,</b> seasoning... …).|$|E
5000|$|This {{method of}} food {{preparation}} involves using the Maillard reaction to [...] "brown" [...] the meat or vegetables and then <b>deglazing</b> with stock or water and simmering the mixture {{over low heat}} {{for an extended period}} of time. It is often done in a cast iron pot or dutch oven, so the heat can be evenly applied and distributed.|$|E
50|$|During {{the cooking}} process, the dish can be deglazed {{with the use}} of wine, and wine can be used as an {{ingredient}} in and of itself without <b>deglazing.</b> The dish can be flavored with lemon juice, various herbs and seasonings, salt and pepper. Additional ingredients such as minced green onions and shallots can also be used. The dish is vegetarian, and may have a meat-like texture.|$|E
50|$|Haute cuisine {{versions}} require mixing pre-cooked roasted meats with beans {{that have}} been simmered separately with aromatic vegetables, but this runs counter to cassoulet's peasant origins. In the process of preparing the dish it is traditional to <b>deglaze</b> the pot from the previous cassoulet {{in order to give}} a base for the next one. This has led to stories, such as the one given by Elizabeth David, citing Anatole France, of a single original cassoulet being extended for years or even decades.|$|R

50|$|Pieces {{of chicken}} are coated with flour, salt and pepper, and then sautéed. Some recipes call for {{various types of}} cooking oil, some call for butter, and some call for both. Some recipes call for sauteing an onion with the chicken. After the chicken is browned, white wine {{is added to the}} cooking pan. Some recipes call for leaving the chicken in the pan while the wine is reduced, while others call for first {{removing}} the chicken, then using the wine to <b>deglaze</b> the pan, and then pouring the wine sauce over the chicken.|$|R
50|$|Ingredients for sautéing {{are usually}} {{cut into pieces}} or thinly sliced to {{facilitate}} fast cooking. The primary mode of heat transfer during sautéing is conduction between the pan and the food being cooked. Food that is sautéed is browned while preserving its texture, moisture, and flavor. If meat, chicken, or fish is sautéed, the sauté is often finished by <b>deglazing</b> the pan's residue to make a sauce.|$|E
5000|$|The meat dish {{is usually}} made using a pan grilled method: {{grilling}} the meat {{on both sides}} in a little olive oil, then adding the sauce composed of chopped vegetables (mushrooms, potatoes, zucchini, onions, garlic, parsley, celery, ...et.c) which are steam sauteed in a separate pan, then a sauce made with that either with 35% cream, or tomato paste. The sauce was always added to the meat pan so in the process <b>deglazing</b> it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deglazing</b> {{can also}} be used while cooking vegetables, {{especially}} ones which have left sugars {{at the bottom of a}} pan. It is commonly used in caramelizing onions. Because vegetables do not produce as much fat, they do not need to be removed from the pan to pour off excess grease. Instead, the liquid can be added directly to the pan and stirred, allowing the fond to meld with the vegetables, rather than creating a separate sauce.|$|E

5000|$|Rice {{and gravy}} - Rice and gravy dishes are {{a staple of}} Cajun cuisine [...] and is usually a brown gravy based on pan drippings, which are <b>deglazed</b> and simmered with extra {{seasonings}} and served over steamed or boiled rice. The dish is traditionally made from cheaper cuts of meat and cooked in a cast iron pot, typically for an extended time period in order to let the tough cuts of meat become tender. Beef, pork, chicken or any of a large variety of game meats are used for its preparation. Popular local varieties include hamburger steak, smothered rabbit, turkey necks, and chicken fricassee.|$|R
2500|$|Slotted rotors have shallow {{channels}} machined {{into the}} disc {{to aid in}} removing dust and gas. Slotting is the preferred method in most racing environments to remove gas and water and to <b>deglaze</b> brake pads. Some discs are both drilled and slotted. Slotted discs are generally not used on standard vehicles because they quickly wear down brake pads; however, this removal of material is beneficial to race vehicles since it keeps the pads soft and avoids vitrification of their surfaces. On the road, drilled or slotted discs still {{have a positive effect}} in wet conditions because the holes or slots prevent a film of water building up between the disc and the pads.|$|R
50|$|Sauces may be {{used for}} sweet or savory dishes. They may be {{prepared}} and served cold, like mayonnaise, prepared cold but served lukewarm like pesto, cooked and served warm like bechamel or cooked and served cold like apple sauce.Sauces may be freshly prepared by the cook, especially in restaurants, but today many sauces are sold premade and packaged like Worcestershire sauce, HP Sauce, soy sauce or ketchup. Sauces for salad are called salad dressing. Sauce made by <b>deglazing</b> a pan are called pan sauces.|$|E
50|$|The {{flavor of}} some foods, such as meat and onions, can be {{improved}} by gently cooking with a little pre-heated cooking oil, butter or other fat in the open pressure cooker over medium heat (unless the manufacturer advises against this) before pressure cooking. It is important both not to overheat the empty pressure cooker and never to heat the empty cooker with the lid and gasket in place. Overheating can cause warping and other damage. The pressure cooker needs to cool briefly before adding liquid; otherwise some of the liquid will evaporate instantly, possibly leaving insufficient liquid for the entire pressure cooking time; if <b>deglazing</b> the pan, {{this has to be}} taken into account.|$|E
5000|$|The meat {{is removed}} and the {{majority}} of the fat is poured off, leaving a small amount with the dried and browned meat juices. The pan is returned to the heat, and a liquid such as vegetable or meat stock, a spirit, some wine, or verjuice is added to act as a solvent. Dairy, however, is not recommended for <b>deglazing,</b> as it may curdle when added to high heat. The solvent allows the cook to scrape the dark spots {{from the bottom of the}} pan and dissolve them, incorporating the remaining browned material at the bottom of the pan into a basic sauce.The culinary term fond, French for [...] "base" [...] or [...] "foundation", refers to this sauce, although it is also sometimes used to describe the browned food bits instead (commonly in the United States). Burned pieces should not be confused with fond, which is dark brown.|$|E
5|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{techniques}} used. Each morning, 36 chickens were roasted for their juices rather than the meat being used on the menu. Each chicken was pressed in a colander to ensure that all the liquid was expressed. These juices were mixed with those from the roasting trays after they had been <b>deglazed</b> with Madeira wine and then added a small amount of veal stock. The actual roasted chickens ended up being too dry to serve following the process, and so were used for staff lunches or were discarded. These 36 chickens produced enough juice for the sauces to accompany 30 chicken dishes. Similar processes were conducted with lamb shoulders, where they were pressed only for the creation of sauces.|$|R

He noted on the reality show that he missed Louisiana Creole cuisine so Louisiana Lt. Governor Jay Dardenne established a [...] "Feed the Dream" [...] project with the state's Seafood and Marketing Board to ship Ledet food each week including tamales, crawfish, boudin (a Cajun sausage), (chicken, duck and andouille) gumbo and jambalaya, donated by Louisiana restaurants and food manufacturers. He said a dish he probably could not live without is rice and gravy, from Creole cuisine, usually a brown gravy based on pan drippings, which are <b>deglazed</b> and simmered with extra seasonings and served over steamed or boiled rice.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to verify, in vitro, the effect of various porcelain surface treatments on the shear strength of orthodontic brackets bonded to porcelain and the mode of fracture after debonding. Eighty-eight samples of metallic supported feldspathic porcelain were randomly divided into four groups according to their surface preparation as follows: the porcelain was maintained intact (GI), roughened with a diamond bur (GII), etched with 10 % hydrofluoric acid (GIII), or sandblasted with aluminum oxide (GIV). The specimens were treated with silane (Scothprime) and brackets were bonded with Concise. Each sample was subjected to a shear load at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min and a recording was made at the point of failure. Bond strengths, adequate to withstand the application of orthodontic forces, were achieved in all groups. The Kruskal-Wallis statistical test showed no significant differences in bond strength between the groups (p> 0. 05). However, many more porcelain fractures occurred on <b>deglazed</b> porcelain. This study indicates that with the appropriate material selection, the silane/composite procedure alone may be adequate for bonding...|$|R
