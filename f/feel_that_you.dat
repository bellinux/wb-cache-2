25|$|In {{common with}} the great {{majority}} of Americans, you have, no doubt, made up your mind as to what country should be held responsible for this tragedy, but these papers may be found useful for reference, and because they contain the incontrovertible facts, I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will probably welcome them in this form.|$|E
25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks you what city you're traveling to, but you <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would recognize the name if you saw it on a map of the country.|$|E

[...] In 1899, members of the Household again insisted that Karim not accompany the royal party when the Queen took her annual holiday at Cimiez. The Queen duly had Karim remain at Windsor, then when the party had settled into the Excelsior Regina hotel, wired Karim to come and join them.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{said he did}} {{not feel}} {{responsible}} that a U2 song was used in a murder defence, but stated [...] "I still <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have to go down those streets in your music. If that's where the subject is taking you, you have to follow. At least in the imagination. I'm not sure I want to get down there to live. I'll take a walk occasionally, and have a drink with the devil, but I'm not moving in with him." [...] The Edge said that the song's defence in the trial was [...] "very heavy", stating [...] "Should any artist hold back from putting out something because he's afraid of what somebody else might do {{as a result of his}} work? I would hate to see censorship come in, whether from the government or, from my point of view, personal." ...|$|E

500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 than I was when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are closer to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|... "SIR:– Among {{the members}} of the Legislature of West Virginia there is a general desire to express to you in some formal way their {{appreciation}} of the great zeal, ability and untiring industry that have marked your course in the Legislature this session. As chairman of the Finance Committee and one of the Judiciary Committee of the House, the duties incumbent upon you have been exceeding [...] important and exacting, both in committee room and {{on the floor of the}} House. In the performance of these duties you have been so zealous, industrious, painstaking and conservative as to attract the attention and win the respect and confidence of the entire legislature and to deserve thanks and gratitude not only of your fellow members but of the people of the state at large. Permit us, therefore, to tender to you some expression of our appreciation of the benefit of the State derived from your earnest labors to say that we all <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have fully deserved not only our commendation but a right to the gratitude and respect of your fellow citizens throughout the State of West Virginia." ...|$|E
500|$|Mylod {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} filming the final {{scenes of the}} episode, the foot chase between Arya and the Waif, in the behind the scenes featurette published by HBO after the airing of the episode. Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of cinema, but trying to take from that something that would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> find in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it be great if she leapt off that, and then tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in my head that I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, but it looked pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're {{not going to be able}} to see that, and we're not going to stick around to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing and I think, for me, a very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Mosby's, [...] "The {{abdominal}} exam {{is performed}} {{as part of}} the comprehensive physical examination or when a patient presents with signs of symptoms of an abdominal disease process." [...] In other words, your doctor will often perform an abdominal exam as part of a routine examination. However, your doctor might perform additional tests if your doctor <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might have an abdominal disease.|$|R

At the age of 98, Evans was asked about his age over a pub lunch, where he was quoted to have responded [...] "Part of <b>you</b> <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't be here.". He celebrated his 100th birthday at the Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 2009.|$|R

2500|$|During this time, Lee {{began to}} feel that God was calling him to quit his job {{and serve as a}} {{full-time}} minister, which he did in August 1933. Soon afterward, he received a letter from Watchman Nee that read, “Brother Witness, as for your future, I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should serve the Lord with your full time. How do you feel? May the Lord lead you.” Lee [...] felt this letter strongly confirmed his decision. From that point onward, Lee began to work closely with Nee.|$|E
2500|$|Sibelius {{followed}} Madetoja's {{rise with}} {{the pride of}} a teacher. Early on he recognized his pupil's potential as a symphonic composer ("What you wrote about your symphonic business delights me exceedingly," [...] Sibelius wrote to Madetoja. [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will achieve your greatest triumphs in that genre, for I consider that you have precisely the properties that make a symphonic composer. This is my firm belief."), and the 10 February 1916 premiere of Madetoja's First Symphony found Sibelius's remarking on its beauty. The 17 December 1918 premiere of Madetoja's Second Symphony similarly impressed Sibelius, who was again in attendance.|$|E
2500|$|Palmer's {{supporters}} in Congress responded with {{an attempt to}} impeach Louis Post or, failing that, to censure him. The drive against Post began to lose energy when Attorney General Palmer’s forecast of an attempted radical uprising on May Day 1920 failed to occur. Then, in testimony before the House Rules Committee on May 7–8, Post proved [...] "a convincing speaker with a caustic tongue" [...] and defended himself so successfully that Congressman Edward W. Pou, a Democrat presumed to be an enthusiastic supporter of Palmer, congratulated him: [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have followed your sense of duty absolutely." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{would not}} find this a problem if {{students}} were informed that this was possible, for privacy's sake. However, what was appalling was {{that not only did}} the District not inform parents and students of this fact … hile you may <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can say that this access will not be abused, I feel that this is not enough to ensure the integrity of students, and that even if it was no one would have any way of knowing (especially end-users). [...] I feel it would be best that students and parents are informed of this before they receive their computers.... I could see not informing parents and students of this fact causing a huge uproar.|$|E
2500|$|Endorsing {{the book}} Lokayata Joseph Needham wrote: [...] "Your book {{will have a}} truly treasured place on my shelves. It is truly {{extraordinary}} {{that we should have}} approached ancient Chinese and ancient Indian civilisations with such similar results...." [...] About Chattopadhayay's 1977 book, Science and Society in Ancient India, he said: [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have entirely proved your case that the Caraka-samhita and the Susruta-samhita have an ambiguous character, which, when dissected, reveals the intense struggle between the theological philosophers on the one hand, and the doctors who strove for a truly scientific view of the world, on the other. It is unmistakably a chapter in the 'warfare of science with religion'...I do feel that your philological and philosophical analysis has been here a really splendid contribution." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{released}} {{one more}} album with Columbia Records in 1988. It was released {{under the name}} Hide Your Heart in Europe, and Notes From America in the United States. Prolific songwriters for the album included Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Desmond Child, who also produced the album. The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from Hide Your Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When looking back over this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've never even seen her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, so when she stands there and sings, she closes her eyes. She's in a sacred space and you <b>feel</b> <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> can say a lot of things about Bonnie Tyler, but you cannot say she does not feel her music.|$|E

2500|$|A {{review of}} the book in Publishers Weekly was favorable, and commented, [...] "All of the essays ... exhibit a {{timeless}} prose {{in the midst of}} meeting deadlines. But many also resonate with a special sense of timeliness". Contributing editor of The Quarterly Conversation Elizabeth Wadell reviewed the book, and commented, [...] "these articles almost unanimously engage". Wadell lamented that the profile of Karl Lagerfeld by Vanessa Grigoriadis seemed lighter fare compared {{to the rest of the}} articles in the book, [...] "Though it is cleverly written, it really does seem to be, well, all style." [...] Wadell recommented the book for readers, and observed, [...] "You can skip a lot of articles in a magazine and still <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> 'got through' the whole thing; a book isn't over till it's over. So how then, should we read the Best American Magazine Articles? Out of order, I'd say, skipping at least one article, but keeping it to read again." [...] Colin Murphy reviewed the book for The Irish Times, and wrote favorably of the piece by Christopher Hitchens on Agent Orange. Murphy also wrote positively of the book as a whole, and his review concluded, [...] "the best in this volume stands with the best anywhere, essays with the compulsive readability of a good novel, but the immediacy and moral power of good journalism." ...|$|E

60|$|And this {{instruction}} it is {{much better}} to give not in direct connection with the occurrence which indicated the want of it. If you attempt to explain to your boy the folly of boasting in immediate connection with some act of boasting of his own, he <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are really finding fault with him; his mind instinctively puts itself into a position of defense, and the truth which you wish to impart to it finds a much less easy admission.|$|R
