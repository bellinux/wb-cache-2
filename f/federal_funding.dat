We show that the improved communication and transparency regarding the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate target has significantly increased the Fed?s influence on the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate since 1994. By contrast, the declining role of required reserves in the U. S. has contributed to higher <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate volatility.

40|$|To {{combat the}} {{financial}} crisis that intensified {{in the fall of}} 2008, the Federal Reserve injected a substantial amount of liquidity into the banking system. The resulting increase in reserve balances exerted downward price pressure in the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> market, and the effective <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate began to deviate from the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee. In response, the Federal Reserve revised its operational framework for implementing monetary policy and began to pay interest on reserve balances in an attempt to provide a floor for the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate. Nevertheless, following the policy change, the effective <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate remained below not only the target but also the rate paid on reserve balances. We develop a model to explain this phenomenon and use data from the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> market to evaluate it empirically.

This sector-analysis is conducted over a recent time period, when the Federal Open Market Committee has adopted a policy of immediate disclosure of its <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> target rate changes. Our results indicate that the Consumer Discretionary and Technology sectors’ equity returns are negatively and significantly related to changes in the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> target rate. This negative relationship appears to be especially pronounced for decreases in the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> target rate. A positive and significant relationship exists between equity returns in the Consumer Staples Sector and <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> target rate changes, which is again concentrated in <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> target rate decreases. A surprising finding is that Utility Sector returns tend to decrease in response to decreases in the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> target rate.

40|$|Many {{estimated}} macroeconomic models assume {{interest rate}} smoothing in the monetary policy equation. In practice, monetary policymakers adjust a target {{level for the}} <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate by discrete increments. One often-neglected consequence of using a quarterly average of the daily <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate in empirical work is that {{any change in the}} target <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate will affect the quarterly average in the current quarter and the subsequent quarter. Despite this clear source of predictable change in the quarterly average of the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate, the vast bulk of the literature that estimates policy rules ignores information concerning the timing and magnitude of discrete changes to the target <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate. Consequently, policy equations that include interest rate smoothing inadvertently make the strong and unnecessary assumption that the starting point for interest rate smoothing is last quarter's average level of the <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> rate.
