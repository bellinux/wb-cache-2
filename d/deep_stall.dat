5|$|In 1953, Tank {{constructed}} a fourth prototype (No. 04) and, {{in an attempt}} to resolve the design's <b>deep</b> <b>stall</b> problems at high angles of attack, added stall fences on each wing and four strakes on the rear fuselage. Other refinements included a pressurized cockpit, additional fuel capacity and it was also the first prototype to be fitted with the definitive four 20mm Hispano Mark V cannon armament. Lt. Jorge Doyle piloted the fourth IAe 33 on its maiden flight on 20 August 1953 and, along with Lt. Gonzalez and Lt. Balado, began armament testing in 1954.|$|E
5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid <b>deep</b> <b>stall</b> conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of the horizontal stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem of}} <b>deep</b> <b>stalling,</b> {{revealed}} {{by the loss of}} the BAC One-Eleven prototype in 1963, was overcome through various changes, including the introduction of vortilons, small surfaces beneath the wing's leading edge used to control airflow and increase low speed lift.|$|R

A sinusoidal pitching motion with a 10 Â° amplitude and a reduced frequency of 0. 1 is imposed around two different mean angles of attack of 10 Â° and 15 Â°. The comparison of the airloads curves and of the pressure distribution over the airfoil surface shows that a three-dimensional numerical model can better reproduce the flow structures and the airfoil performance for the <b>deep</b> dynamic <b>stall</b> regime.

25|$|On 8 November 1978, the {{prototype}} aircraft took off at Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The {{second and third}} prototypes flew in 1979. A test flight on 3 April 1980 in the Mojave Desert resulted in disaster, the aircraft crashing due {{to the failure of}} the release mechanism to detach the recovery chute after a <b>deep</b> <b>stall,</b> killing one of the test pilots (the other test pilot and the flight test engineer parachuted to safety).|$|E
25|$|The first Tu-124A {{prototype}}, SSSR-45075, first flew on 29 July 1963. On 22 October 1963, {{the prototype}} British BAC One-Eleven, {{which had a}} similar layout, crashed {{with the loss of}} all crew while testing its stalling properties. The aircraft had entered pitch-up: the high-mounted tailplane became trapped in the turbulent wake produced by the wings (<b>deep</b> <b>stall),</b> which prevented recovery from the stall. As a result, the tailplane on Tu-124A was enlarged by 30% for greater control authority. Since Aeroflot's requirements dictated a larger aircraft than initially planned, the Soloviev Design Bureau developed the more powerful D-30 low-bypass turbofan engines. On 20 November 1963, the new airliner was designated Tu-134.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the last}} 727 vestiges, the T-tail, was dropped in mid-1979 {{in favor of a}} {{conventional}} tail. This avoided the risk of an aerodynamic condition known as a <b>deep</b> <b>stall,</b> and allowed for more passengers to be carried in a less tapered rear fuselage. At [...] in length, the [...] was [...] longer than the , and with a greater proportion of its internal volume devoted to cabin space, seating was available for 239 passengers, or 50 more than its predecessor. The fuselage cross-section, whose upper lobe was common to the 707 and 737, was the only major structural feature to be retained from the 727. This was mainly to reduce drag, and while a wider fuselage had been considered, Boeing's market research found low cargo capacity needs and reduced passenger preference for wide-body aircraft on short-haul routes.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{airplane}} is stalled, the flight control software enters an automatic recovery mode which automatically tries to roll level, cancel spin, and reduce angle of attack. However, this mode can not handle <b>deep</b> <b>stalls.</b> Theoretically, the pilot could have recovered by disabling the automatic mode to directly control the {{flight control surfaces}} (direct link mode), and then executing a [...] "pitch rock" [...] maneuver. But such a recovery maneuver {{is not part of}} ordinary pilot training; the direct link mode was only intended for use by test pilots. Ultimately the pilot had to abandon the aircraft.|$|R

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics {{simulations}} {{were carried}} out in two and three spatial dimensions to assess the suitability of numerical models for the simulation of <b>deep</b> dynamic <b>stall</b> experiments. The numerical results were compared to pressure measurements and Particle Image Velocimetry flow surveys carried out on a pitching NACA 23012 airfoil. The pitching cycles considered as test cases reproduce the <b>deep</b> dynamic <b>stall</b> condition for a helicopter rotor retreating blade section. The comparison of the airloads curves and of the pressure distribution over the airfoil surface shows that a three-dimensional numerical model can better reproduce the experimental airloads behaviour during the pitching cycles. The three-dimensional simulation results show also a better reproduction of the vortical structures observed by P 1 V. The solution of the simulation obtained over a three-dimensional grid independent from the wind tunnel geometry highlighted the relevance of three-dimensional effects on the flow field that are mainly due to the intrinsic three-dimensional nature of dynamic stall...|$|R
2500|$|The {{high angle}} of attack {{investigations}} on the Gulfstream II indicated that stable trim conditions existed up to 45 degrees {{angle of attack}}. [...] The elevator deflection required to trim to the primary stall at most forward center of gravity was sufficient to trim a <b>deep</b> <b>stall</b> at the aft center of gravity, but recovery from <b>deep</b> <b>stall</b> was immediate upon forward stick motion, and more than adequate nose-down elevator control was available. [...] The acceptability of the Gulfstream II high angle of attack characteristics {{and the absence of}} a <b>deep</b> <b>stall</b> influence on configuration sizing and arrangement was attributed to the mitigating influence of the nacelle-wing overlap on nacelle contribution. Configuration buildup studies revealed the adverse nacelle influence on tail pitching moment contribution above 30 degrees angle of attack was not unduly severe and no appreciable effect on elevator or stabilizer effectiveness was found.|$|E
2500|$|At 16:10:43 (133 seconds), the Trident {{entered a}} <b>deep</b> <b>stall.</b> It was {{descending}} through , its nose was pitched up by 31°, and its airspeed had fallen below the minimum indication of [...] At 16:10:47 (137 seconds) and , the Trident was descending at [...] Impact {{with the ground}} came at 16:11, precisely 150 seconds after brake release.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{suffered a}} <b>deep</b> <b>stall</b> {{in the third}} minute of its flight and crashed to the ground, narrowly missing a busy main road. The ensuing inquest principally blamed the captain for failing to maintain airspeed and configure the high-lift devices correctly.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} {{had become}} an attractive method to carry out researches on structure design and aerodynamic performance prediction of straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine, while the prediction accuracy was the major concern of CFD. Based on the present two-dimensional CFD model, a series of systematic investigations were conducted to analyze the effects of computational domain, grid number, near-wall grid, and time step on prediction accuracy. And then efforts were devoted into prediction {{and analysis of the}} overall flow field, dynamic performance of blades, and its aerodynamic forces. The calculated results agree well with experimental data, and it demonstrates that RNG k-ε turbulent model is great to predict the tendency of aerodynamic forces but with a high estimate value of turbulence viscosity coefficient. Furthermore, the calculated tangential force is more dependent on near-wall grid and prediction accuracy is poor within the region with serious dynamic stall. In addition, blades experience mild and <b>deep</b> <b>stalls</b> at low tip speed ratio, and thus the leading edge separation vortex and its movement on the airfoil surface {{have a significant impact on}} the aerodynamic performance...|$|R
5000|$|It also {{incorporated}} two conspicuous modifications pioneered {{on earlier}} Learjets: the [...] "delta fins" [...] (twin ventral fins, positioned to help stabilize the aircraft in flight, and help right the aircraft in a <b>deep</b> aerodynamic <b>stall)</b> - and winglets (upturned wingtips to reduce induced drag and improve stability). Among other characteristics, the design has reportedly yielded the most benign stall characteristics of any [...] "light" [...] business jet to date (as of 2017).|$|R
2500|$|On 18 June 1972, British European Airways Flight 548, a Trident 1 {{registered}} G-ARPI, {{entered a}} <b>deep</b> <b>stall</b> due to pilot error and crashed at Staines shortly after takeoff from Heathrow Airport.

As of , it is still the worst aviation accident to have occurred on British soil (Pan Am Flight 103 was a terrorist incident).|$|E
2500|$|While {{technically}} advanced, the Trident (and other aircraft with a T-tail arrangement) had {{potentially dangerous}} stalling characteristics. If its airspeed was insufficient, and particularly if its high-lift devices were not extended {{at the low}} speeds typical of climbing away after take-off or of approaching to land, it could enter a <b>deep</b> <b>stall</b> (or [...] "superstall") condition, in which the tail control surfaces become ineffective (as {{they are in the}} turbulence zone of the stalled main wing) from which recovery was practically impossible.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1968, {{the captain}} of a Trident 1C departing Paris-Orly Airport for London tried to improve climb {{performance}} by retracting the flaps shortly after take-off. This was a non-standard procedure, and shortly afterward he also retracted the leading-edge droops. This configuration of high-lift devices at a low airspeed {{would have resulted in}} a <b>deep</b> <b>stall,</b> but the co-pilot noticed the error, increased airspeed and re-extended the droops, and the flight continued normally. The event became known as the [...] "Paris Incident" [...] or the [...] "Orly Incident" [...] among BEA staff.|$|E
40|$|The {{unsteady}} flow {{field in the}} wake of an NACA 23012 pitching airfoil was investigated by means of triple hot-wire probe measurements. Wind tunnel tests were carried out both in the light and <b>deep</b> dynamic <b>stall</b> regimes. The analysis of the wake velocity fields was supported by the measurements of {{unsteady flow}} fields and airloads. In particular, particle image velocimetry surveys were carried out on the airfoil upper surface, while the lift and pitching moments were evaluated integrating surface pressure measurements. In the light dynamic stall condition, the wake velocity profiles show a similar behaviour in upstroke and in downstroke motions as, in this condition, the flow on the airfoil upper surface is attached for almost the whole pitching cycle and the airloads show a small amount of hysteresis. The <b>deep</b> dynamic <b>stall</b> measurements in downstroke show a large extent of the wake and a high value of the turbulent kinetic energy due to the passage of strong vortical structures, typical of this dynamic stall regime. The comprehensive experimental database can be considered a reference for the development and validation of numerical tools for such peculiar flow conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{unsteady}} flowfield above a NACA 0012 airfoil pitching under <b>deep</b> dynamic <b>stall</b> conditions {{has been}} investigated in a low-speed wind tunnel by means of Particle Image Velocimetry measurements. The results show the characteristic features of the dynamic stall process: formation and development of an organized vortex structure for increasing incidences, subsequent separation and complex flow behaviour during the downstroke regime. Furthermore, small-scale structures could be obtained in the separated flowfield and even within the dynamic stall vortex. These results can {{be considered to be}} a good data basis for the validation of numerical codes...|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} model's {{potential to}} enter a <b>deep</b> <b>stall</b> was highlighted in the crash of Trident 1C G-ARPY on 3 June 1966 near Felthorpe in Norfolk during a test flight, {{with the loss of}} all four pilots on board. In this accident, the crew had deliberately switched off the stick shaker and stick pusher as required by the stall test schedule, and the probable cause was determined to be the crew's failure to take timely positive recovery action to counter an impending stall. The Confidential Human Factors Incident Reporting Programme (CHIRP), an experimental, voluntary, anonymous and informal system of reporting hazardous air events introduced within BEA in the late 1960s (and later adopted by the Civil Aviation Authority and NASA), brought to light two near-accidents, the [...] "Orly" [...] and [...] "Naples" [...] incidents: these involved flight crew error in the first case and suspicion of the Trident's control layout in the second.|$|E
2500|$|The danger {{first came}} to light in a near-crash during a 1962 test flight when de Havilland pilots Peter Bugge and Ron Clear were testing the Trident's {{stalling}} characteristics by pitching its nose progressively higher, thus reducing its airspeed. The Trident entered a <b>deep</b> <b>stall</b> after a critical angle of attack was reached. Eventually, it entered a flat spin, {{and appeared to be}} about to crash, but a wing dropped during the stall, and when corrected with rudder the other wing dropped. The aircraft continued rolling left and right until the nose pitched down and the crew were able to recover to normal flight. The incident resulted in the Trident being fitted with an automatic stall warning system known as a [...] "stick shaker", and a stall recovery system known as a [...] "stick pusher" [...] which automatically pitched the aircraft down to build up speed if the crew failed to respond to the warning.|$|E
5000|$|Canard-configured {{aircraft}} {{are also at}} risk of getting into a <b>deep</b> <b>stall.</b> Two Velocity aircraft crashed due to locked-in deep stalls. Testing revealed that the addition of leading edge cuffs to the outboard wing prevented the aircraft from getting into a <b>deep</b> <b>stall.</b> The Piper Advanced Technologies PAT-1, N15PT, another canard-configured aircraft, also crashed in an accident attributed to a <b>deep</b> <b>stall.</b> [...] Wind tunnel testing of the design at the NASA Langley Research Center showed that it was vulnerable to a <b>deep</b> <b>stall.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{comprehensive}} experimental campaign are compared to computational fluid dynamics simulations results to assess the modelling capabilities for a NACA 23012 pitching airfoil in <b>deep</b> dynamic <b>stall</b> regime. The experimental campaign involved fast unsteady pressure measurements and particle image velocimetry. Two-dimensional simulations were carried out with EDGE, developed by FOI. The investigated test case consists in a sinusoidal pitching motion with a 10 amplitude and a reduced frequency of 0. 1 around a mean angle of attack of 10. The behaviour of the experimental lift and pitching moment coefficients is {{in close agreement with}} the two-dimensional simulations results, also during the downstroke motion where the flow field is characterised by severe unsteadiness conditions. A three-dimensional numerical model was built to evaluate the relevance of three-dimensional effects on the experiments. Three-dimensional simulations were carried out using the commercial code FLUENT. During upstroke motion, three-dimensional simulations results are in better agreement with the experiments, in particular in terms of the lift coefficient curve slope and of the pitching moment coefficient peak. The flow fields evaluated by particle image velocimetry surveys show strong vortical structures moving on the airfoil upper surface during the downstroke motion that are captured only by the three-dimensional model; then, the flow fields comparison demonstrates the importance of three-dimensional effects for a <b>deep</b> dynamic <b>stall</b> condition...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{activity was}} performed on a NACA 23012 pitching airfoil to investigate the effectiveness of an active trailing edge L-shaped tab for <b>deep</b> dynamic <b>stall</b> control. The active control system, based {{on the use of}} micro pneumatic actuators, was designed to control the deployment and retraction of the tab along the oscillating cycle. In particular, the tab was designed to behave as a Gurney flap when deployed as its end prong protrudes at the airfoil trailing edge, while in retracted position the tab behaves as a trailing edge flap. The L-shaped tab design presents interesting features to be employed on rotor blades, due to an easier integration at the trailing edge with respect to a deployable Gurney flap. Wind tunnel tests were carried out considering two pitching cycles producing <b>deep</b> dynamic <b>stall</b> regime. Unsteady pressure measurements were performed at the model midspan section to obtain the phase-averaged aerodynamic loads curves. The tests results showed that the deployment of the tab during the upstroke produces a conspicuous increase of lift with respect to the clean airfoil case, corresponding to a higher level of available thrust on the retreating blade. The retraction of the tab before stall onset does not introduce a valuable effect in terms of pitching moment peak reduction with respect to clean airfoil. Moreover, the active control system produces a conspicuous reduction of the negatively-damped portions of the pitching cycles and of the negative aerodynamic damping peak that could account for stall flutter divergence...|$|R
40|$|The {{unsteady}} flowfield above a NACA 0012 airfoil pitching under <b>deep</b> dynamic <b>stall</b> conditions {{has been}} investigated in a low-speed wind tunnel by means of Particle Image Velocimetry measurements and lasersheet visualizations. The PIV results show the occurrence of small-scale structures in the separated flowfield and even within the dynamic stall vortex for increasing incidences, and the complex flow behaviour during the downstroke regime. Due to the finite shutter speed of the video camera, the visualization technique cannot record such structures: instead, we obtain a large scale vortex rolling up in the upstroke. Thus it is seen that PIV allows to better analyze the qualitative unsteady separated flow- fields...|$|R

5000|$|The name [...] "deep stall" [...] {{first came}} into {{widespread}} use after {{the crash of the}} prototype BAC 1-11 G-ASHG on 22 October 1963, which killed its crew.

Stick shakers are now a standard part of commercial airliners. Nevertheless, the problem continues to cause accidents; on 3 June 1966, a Hawker Siddeley Trident (G-ARPY), was lost to deep stall; <b>deep</b> <b>stall</b> is suspected to be cause of another Trident (the British European Airways Flight 548 G-ARPI) crash - known as the [...] "Staines Disaster" [...] - on 18 June 1972 when the crew failed to notice the conditions and had disabled the stall recovery system.
