5|$|There are {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{the origin of the}} rings. One <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn. The second <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn formed. Some ice in the E ring comes from the moon Enceladus's geysers.|$|E
5|$|A recent (2005) <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the star}} of Bethlehem was a {{supernova}} or hypernova occurring in the nearby Andromeda Galaxy. Although {{it is difficult to}} detect a supernova remnant in another galaxy, or obtain an accurate date of when it occurred, supernovae remnants have been detected in Andromeda.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} sibling of Nyuserre is known with near-certainty: Neferefre, {{who was a}} son of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was Nyuserre's elder brother. Since the {{relation}} between Shepseskare and Nyuserre remains uncertain, {{it is possible that}} the two were brothers too, as suggested by Roth, although the dominant <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Shepseskare was a son of Sahure and hence Nyuserre's uncle.|$|E
30|$|The null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> a {{significant}} difference between measured parameters between tilted and axially inserted implants. The alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the differences would be purely random. A significance level of 5 % was determined as statistically significant.|$|R

5000|$|The {{sign test}} example in Conover [...] {{examined}} consumer preference for product A vs. product B. The null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> consumers do not prefer product B over product A. The alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> consumers prefer product B over product A, a one-sided test. In the study, 8 of 9 consumers who expressed a preference preferred product B over product A.|$|R
5|$|Kohlberg's {{scale is}} about how people justify {{behaviors}} and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.|$|E
5|$|The loss {{of species}} from {{ecological}} communities, defaunation, is primarily driven by human activity. This has resulted in empty forests, ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates. In the Quaternary extinction event, the mass die-off of megafaunal variety coincided {{with the appearance of}} humans, suggesting a human influence. One <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> humans hunted large mammals, such as the woolly mammoth, into extinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Earth–Moon system {{formed as}} a result of the impact of a Mars-sized body (named Theia) with the proto-Earth (giant impact), that blasted material into orbit about the Earth that then accreted to form the present Earth-Moon system.|$|E

40|$|As {{the title}} of the thesis indicates, I {{addressed}} the number of the staff and their qualification representation at the individual departments of the hospital in Písek. I cooperated with head nurses as well as other nursing staff in the hospital and acquired information from them. The first <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the number of the nursing staff work load at standard surgical departments corresponds with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed as the average number of staff at surgical departments was higher than the methodology states. The second <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the number of the nursing staff work load at standard internal departments corresponds with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method. The number of staff at internal departments was also higher than the recommendations of the method; neurology was the only department where the number of staff was lower than recommended. The second <b>hypothesis</b> also <b>was</b> not confirmed. The third <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the number of the nursing staff work load at nursing beds corresponds with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method. The number of the staff at nursing beds was higher than recommended by the method. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed. The fourth <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the qualification representation of the nursing staff at standard surgical departments corresponds with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> not confirmed. The fifth <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the qualification representation of the nursing staff at standard internal departments does not correspond with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed. The last, sixth <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the qualification representation of nursing staff at nursing beds does not correspond with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method and this <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> also confirmed. I believe that the thesis can be used in practice as a template and groundwork for determining the correct number and qualification representation of nursing staff at various medical facilities...|$|R

5|$|There {{are many}} {{differences}} between SDOs and JFCs, {{even though many}} of the Jupiter-family comets may have originated in the scattered disc. Although the centaurs share a reddish or neutral coloration with many SDOs, their nuclei are bluer, indicating a fundamental chemical or physical difference. One <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> comet nuclei are resurfaced as they approach the Sun by subsurface materials which subsequently bury the older material.|$|E
5|$|Using fossil evidence, {{there are}} three main {{theories}} for the origin of modern amphibians. One is that they evolved from dissorophoid temnospondyls. Another is that they evolved from lepospondyls, most likely the lysorophians. A third <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> caecilians descended from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolved from dissorophoids.|$|E
5|$|A {{subject of}} {{on-going}} {{research is the}} formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya. A working <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object, named Theia, impacted Earth. In this scenario, the mass of Theia was approximately 10% of that of Earth, it impacted Earth with a glancing blow, and some of its mass merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.1 and , numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon, and by inference, to that of Earth.|$|E
30|$|Our <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the IAH {{produces}} a heterogeneous compromise in {{the circulation of}} intra-abdominal organs and that norepinephrine restores such disorders.|$|R
50|$|Dick's leading <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he had <b>been</b> {{contacted}} by a transcendental, mystical mind he called VALIS (vast active living intelligence system).|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study, therefore, was to {{investigate}} the microscopic anatomy of the ACL femoral enthesis and {{to determine whether or not}} there are regional differences within this structure. The primary null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there would <b>be</b> no regional difference in the relative area of CF, the average depth of UF, or the ligament entheseal attachment angle. The secondary null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> all entheses, including entheses from the same donor, have similar tidemark profiles.|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2. The <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Anahim hotspot is {{supplied}} by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have {{their roots in}} the upper mantle but they may later originate from the lower mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based on the notion that giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more {{powerful}} build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride. Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group. An alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend {{their relationship to the}} pride from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with the pride.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> motor neglect {{may be due}} to {{a deficit}} in, or {{inhibition}} of, automatic actions involving the right hand. Patients with motor neglect fail to program movements of the right hand. In practice, limb movement is disturbed which produces either a slowing of limb movement or the inability of the movement itself. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> tested through the use of an experimental paradigm for the study of inhibitory control automatic.The second <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> motor neglect can be attributed to a disorder of intention motor.|$|R
30|$|The null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> no {{difference}} on the shear bond strength between FP and tested CR, regardless of adhesive application.|$|R
30|$|Our null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> no {{mechanical}} difference {{exists between}} lateral plating and medial plating in this simulated supracondylar femur fracture with medial comminution.|$|R
5|$|In the Aleutian Islands, {{a massive}} and {{unexpected}} disappearance of sea otters {{has occurred in}} recent decades. In the 1980s, the area was home to an estimated 55,000 to 100,000 sea otters, but the population fell to around 6,000 animals by 2000. The most widely accepted, but still controversial, <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> killer whales have been eating the otters. The pattern of disappearances {{is consistent with a}} rise in predation, but there has been no direct evidence of orcas preying on sea otters to any significant extent.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why {{secondary}} infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It {{may be caused by}} poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction. There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications, and various lines of research have implied a role for T cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and the complement system.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the local protein synthesis <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it provides a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein synthesis would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein synthesis, synapse specificity, and associativity.|$|E

30|$|The first <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the HCP would {{increase}} the intervention group’s perceptions of autonomy-support from their teachers in comparison to a control group (hypothesis 1 (H 1)). The second (H 2) and third (H 3) <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> intervention group’s needs satisfaction and intrinsic motivation {{would increase}} through the mediation of autonomy support. Lastly, hypotheses four (H 4) and five (H 5) <b>were</b> <b>that</b> the intervention would, respectively, indirectly enhance MVPA and well-being, through the autonomy support, needs satisfaction and intrinsic motivation sequential pathway [11].|$|R
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Spanish flu pandemic, and the {{relationship}} between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease. Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} about why the hoard was buried. One is that the hoard represented a deliberate attempt to keep wealth safe, perhaps in response to one of the many upheavals facing Roman Britain in the early fifth century. This is not the only hypothesis, however. Archaeologist Peter Guest argues that the hoard was buried because the items in it were used as part of a system of gift-exchange, and as Britain separated from the Roman Empire, they were no longer required. A third <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Hoxne Hoard represents the proceeds of a robbery, buried to avoid detection.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{correlation}} between location of Stylidium species and proximity of known carnivorous species, like sundews (Drosera), bladderworts (Utricularia), the Albany pitcher plant (Cephalotus follicularis), and the rainbow plant (Byblis). While this alone does not prove that Stylidium species are themselves carnivorous, the <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the association arose because Stylidium species and the known carnivorous plants obtain scarce nutrients using the same source, namely captured insects. Preliminary proof is given that the trapping mechanisms of two associated plants are the same (the tentacles of Byblis and Drosera), though this may be only a coincidence and further research must be done.|$|E
40|$|Childhood maltreatment is {{associated}} with increased risk for lifetime and current PTSD (Davis 2 ̆ 6 Siegel, 2000; Widom, 1999). This study examined a model of PTSD in which dissociation, depression, and posttraumatic cognitions related to heightened PTSD symptoms for maltreated youths. This study then evaluated the model 2 ̆ 7 s fit across variations in intelligence, gender, age, ethnicity, and maltreatment type. Participants (n= 360) included youths from Department of Family Services-related sites in Las Vegas. The first <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the model would display goodness-of-fit across various indices. The second <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the model would better fit youths with below average intelligence (FSIQ = 55 - 84) than youths with average intelligence (FSIQ = 85 - 114). The third and fourth <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> the model would better fit females than males and younger youths (aged 9 - 13 years) than older youths (aged 14 - 18 years). The fifth and sixth <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> the model would better fit multiracial, Hispanic, and African American youths than Caucasian youths, as well as victims of sexual maltreatment than victims of neglect, physical maltreatment, or multiple maltreatment types. <b>Hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> tested via structural equation modeling using EQS. <b>Hypothesis</b> one <b>was</b> supported. <b>Hypotheses</b> two, three, and four <b>were</b> not supported. <b>Hypotheses</b> five and six were partially supported.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{whether there is}} a relationship between fatigue and sickness absence. Two additional <b>hypotheses</b> <b>were</b> based on the theoretical distinction between involuntary, health related absence and voluntary, attitudinal absence. In the literature, the former term is usually used to describe long term sickness absence, the latter relates to short term sickness absence. In line with this, the first additional <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> higher fatigue would correspond with a higher risk of long term, primarily health related absence. The second additional <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> higher fatigue would correspond with a higher risk of short term, primarily motivational absence...|$|R
