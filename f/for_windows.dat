40|$|In this paper, the {{evaluation}} of the levels of radiation emission from electric light bulbs were carried out, using a Gamma Scout portable (GS 20 model). At varied distances from 2 to 10 cm with 7 energy saver bulbs and 4 incandescent bulbs were used. The readings <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 1, window 2 and windows 3 were obtained in µSv/h and pulse counts. The results of the measurement and analysis carried out revealed that, there are possible x-ray and UV radiation emission from the electric light bulbs and at a distance of 2 cm. The emission was highest for the Compact fluorescent lamps which ranged from 0. 71 µSv/h to 3. 22 µSv/h <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 1, 0. 67 µSv/h to 2. 83 µSv/h <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 2 and 0. 64 µSv/h to 2. 61 µSv/h <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 3. But at farthest distance of 10 cm, the emission decreased from 0. 43 µSv/h to 0. 30 µSv/h <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 1, 0. 78 µSv/h to 0. 26 µSv/h <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 2 and 0. 40 µSv/h to 0. 25 µSv/h <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 3.

40|$|In this paper, the {{comparison}} of radiation levels emission between compact fluorescent lamps and incandescent bulbs were carried out with four (4) compact fluorescent lamps and four (4) incandescent bulbs using a Gamma scout (GS 20 model). The measurements were taken at varied distances of 20 to 100 cm. The readings <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 1, window 2 and window 3 were obtained in µSv/h. At distance of 20 cm, the emissions for the compact fluorescent lamp ranged from 7. 10 µSv/h to 32. 2 µSv/h <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 1, 6. 70 µSv/h to 28. 3 µSv/h <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 2 and 6. 40 µSv/h to 26. 1 µSv/h <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 3 and <b>for</b> the incandescent bulbs they ranged, from 2. 50 µSv/h to 3. 60 µSv/h <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 1, 2. 50 µSv/h to 4. 00 µSv/h <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 2 and 2. 50 µSv/h to 3. 80 µSv/h <b>for</b> <b>window</b> 3.
