The soil study presented here examined the pools of inorganic N in different microsites emanating from a simulated disc trenching, i. e. the mound with underlying soil, the furrow bottom and the undisturbed soil. The study was made {{five years after}} scarification. The mound itself with underlying soil had a larger pool of inorganic N than the undisturbed soil. This was mainly because {{of an increase in}} the embedded humus layer, thus implying a larger net N mineralisation and/or lower losses. However, when pools of inorganic N per hectare were calculated, taking into consideration that a scarified area comprises 25 % mounds, 25 % furrows and 50 % undisturbed soil, there was no increase in pools of inorganic N when compared with an area not subjected to scarification.

40|$|Private forest {{owners in}} {{southern}} Sweden consider wind damage {{to be one}} of the most problematic risks from an economic perspective. A potential climate change also raises the question of the possible impact of such a climate change on the risk of wind damage. Taking into consideration the spatial aspects, and the uncertain occurrence of windstorms over time and in space, this thesis aims at providing information to support the management of the risk of wind damage in south Swedish forestry. Computer models were used to assess the probability of wind damage to forest stands, and to project forest stands within case study landscapes in southern Sweden. Although the topography is relatively gently in southern Sweden, it significantly influences the probability of wind damage on a landscape scale. A possible cost-effective means to manage the risk of wind damage can be to target risk-reducing <b>forestry</b> <b>measures</b> to topographically induced wind exposed locations. To support the targeting of risk-reducing <b>forestry</b> <b>measures</b> a tool was constructed, accounting for different risk-preferences among forest owners, for the identification of stands with a high probability of wind damage. The results emphasize the possibility to reduce the risk of wind damage by spatial forestry planning, taking wind shelter from topographic features and surrounding stands into consideration. Based on regional climate change scenarios, it cannot be ruled out that a climate change can lead to an increasing probability of wind damage in southern Sweden. In southernmost Sweden, a climate change very likely can lead to an increasing probability of wind damage. With implications for spatial forestry planning, the probability of strong wind from the sector west to southwest is indicated to remain comparatively high. Shortening the lengths of rotation periods appears to be one possible means for forestry in southern Sweden to adapt to climate change...|$|E

40|$|The Italian {{forestry}} sector {{represents a}} controversial {{reality in the}} national rural context. While the forest area covers almost {{one third of the}} Italian surface (10. 4 million ha according to InFc 2005), the sector has a marginal economic role in the country (1. 0 % of total production of primary sector and 1. 5 % of the generated added value). The marginality is due to the localization of forest in mountain and hilly areas (85 % above 300 m a. s. l.) and in steep slope areas (> 20 %). This makes the forest access very difficult and the logging operations cost very high, ranking the Italian forest productivity among the lowest in Europe. Moreover there is a dualism among few well managed public bodies that control almost 44 % of forestry surface and a high number of small size private owners, localized in rural and marginal contexts. In order to support rural development (RD) and to maintain economic, ecological and social function of forests in rural areas, European Union have taken a series of <b>forestry</b> <b>measures</b> (Council Regulation EC 1698 / 2005, EAFRD) with the aim to improv...|$|E

In circumstances where foreign species {{are used for}} most of the posts and beams, we are not certain whether Japanese sawmills for domestic species could take market share from foreign forest products by increasing their scale. Thus, the calculation of a mill 2 ̆ 7 s consumption is done by considering the break-even-point, assuming the price of domestic species and that of foreign species to be equal. Another point to consider is the necessary methods to transfer logs in line with the mill capacity. As a result, in the case of sawmills for laminated products, we found that the log consumption of approximately 300, 000 cubic meters per year is required base on the lumber price of 2, 300 yen per piece and the log price of 10, 000 yen per cubic meter. In order to collect the logs, the following is needed: Contract-based trade as the primary means; provide an incentive with respect to the price with suppliers who makes a large shipment, and; reduce the transportation cost by making it round-trip. In addition, setting up satellite yards in every region also seems necessary for realizing the above.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show how}} nature {{oriented}} <b>forestry</b> <b>measures</b> {{in a typical}} temperate forest type in combination with bioenergy systems could lead to continuous and permanent removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere. We employ a forest growth model suited for modeling uneven-aged mixed temperate stands and analyze the interaction with biomass energy systems that allow for CO 2 removal and long-term sequestration in geological formations. On global scales this technological option to convert the global energy system from a CO 2 emitter to a CO 2 remover has been overlooked by both the science and policy communities. Removal of the major Greenhouse Gas (GHG) CO 2 from the atmosphere is possible using biomass energy to produce both carbon neutral energy carriers (e. g., electricity and hydrogen) and, at the same time, offer a permanent CO 2 sink by capturing carbon at the conversion facility and permanently storing it in geological formations.

40|$|Individual {{trees have}} been shown to exhibit strong {{relationships}} between DBH, height and volume. Often such studies are cited as justification for forest volume or standing biomass estimation through remote sensing. With resolution of common satellite remote sensing systems generally too low to resolve individuals, and a need for larger coverage, these systems rely on descriptive heights, which account for tree collections in forests. For remote sensing and allometric applications, this height is not entirely understood in terms of its location. Here, a forest growth model (SERA) analyzes forest canopy height relationships with forest wood volume. Maximum height, mean, H 100, and Lorey’s height are examined for variability under plant number density, resource and species. Our findings, shown to be allometrically consistent with empirical measurements for forested communities world-wide, are analyzed for implications to forest remote sensing techniques such as LiDAR and RADAR. Traditional <b>forestry</b> <b>measures</b> of maximum height, {{and to a lesser extent}} H 100 and Lorey’s, exhibit little consistent correlation with forest volume across modeled conditions. The implication is that using forest height to infer volume or biomass from remote sensing requires species and community behavioral information to infer accurate estimates using height alone. SERA predicts mean height to provide the most consistent relationship with volume of the height classifications studied and overall across forest variations. This prediction agrees with empirical data collected from conifer and angiosperm forests with plant densities ranging between 102 – 106 plants/hectare and heights 6 – 49 m. Heigh...|$|E

The following is a discussion on the problems and current state of administrative policies in breakwater works and the relationship of the region's inhabitants to the beaches in regard to religious ceremonies of the region. Coastal environments in Okinawa are deeply ingrained in the cultural life, in particular religious ceremonies, of the region's residents. The disaster prevention projects that have been carried out in coastal areas in Okinawa to date have been done so without consideration to the nature and culture of the region. Instead, they have been undertaken with a view to functionality alone. Results of surveys on the relationship between the natural coastal vegetation and the stepped / low-lying upright hollow tide embankments show that the number of plant varieties tends to decrease with the transition from a natural beach environment to these man-made structures. While the number of plant varieties is greater with the low-lying upright hollow embankments, they cut off the beach from the inland areas and thus vegetation continuity is lost. On the other hand, the steps on the stepped tide embankments support vines and creepers that grow out towards the inland areas.

We have been able to conclude that, within this protection period, the forest has evolved to a certain degree of maturity, but with nefarious consequences due to the amount of felling that was performed, which resulted in a homogenous age group among tree species and a dominance of certain species, resulting in the extinction of various other tree species, a tendency to the ageing of the forest structure with absence of regeneration and a stability of the surrounding area supported by the results of the analysis of their biological cycle, which show a decreased radial growth with time and a 3 year periodicity in fruit production.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of potential adaptation options in forestry in Europe based on three pillars: a review of the scientific literature, an analysis of current national response strategies, and an expert assessment based on a database compiled in the COST Action ECHOES (Expected Climate Change and Options for European Silviculture). The adaptation measures include responses to both risks and opportunities created by climate change and address all stages of <b>forestry</b> operations. <b>Measures</b> targeted to reduce vulnerability to climate change may either aim to reduce forest sensitivity to adverse climate change impacts or increase adaptive capacity to cope with the changing environmental conditions. Adaptation measures mitigating drought and fire risk such as selection of more drought resistant species and genotypes are crucial. For adaptation to be successful it is of the utmost importance to disseminate the knowledge of suitable adaptation measures to all decision makers from the practice to the policy level. The analysis of the ECHOES database demonstrates that this challenge is well recognized in many European countries. Uncertainty about the full extent of climate change impacts and the suitability of adaptation measures creates a need for monitoring and further research. A better understanding of how to increase adaptive capacity is also needed, as well as regional vulnerability assessments which are crucial for targeting planned adaptation measures...|$|R

The damages result in great consequences, not only economical due to quality and production loss, they also effect the biodiversity in the forest. The main principle in Swedish forestry is that damages should be avoided.

The report Survey of forest damages and wild deer {{is the result of a}} cooperation with Södra forest owner association. With 50 000 members and 36 000 connected forest farms, Södra is the largest forest owner association in Sweden. The purpose of the study Survey of forest damages and wild deer is to examine and map how members within Södra experience problems caused by wild deer, what kind of help is requested from Södra and which measures are made by the members to prevent damages. The report is based on a survey sent to members within the Kinna region. The survey contained 31 questions and was sent to 152 randomly selected members. 41 answers were returned and later processed. The answers collected shows that almost every one of the respondents conducts measures to prevent unacceptable damages caused by wild deer. The most common measure is hunting. The most common measure to save value in already damaged forest is pruning. Among the measures to provide game with feed, environmental regard in connection to <b>forestry</b> <b>measures</b> is most commonly occurring. The main part of the forest owners state that they have little problems with damages caused by fallow and red deer while damages caused by elk and roe deer are more common.

How to create feed for wild game, how to save value in already damaged forests and how to avoid unacceptable damages caused by wild deer are other areas where the members want more information from the association...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSignatory {{countries}} to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its supplementary Kyoto Protocol (KP) {{are obliged to}} report greenhouse gas emissions and removals. Changes in the carbon stock of living biomass should be reported using either the default or stock change methods of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) under the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry sector. Traditionally, volume estimates are used as a <b>forestry</b> <b>measures.</b> Changes in living biomass may be assessed by first estimating {{the change in the}} volume of stem wood and then converting this volume to whole tree biomass using biomass expansion factors (BEFs). However, this conversion is often non-trivial because the proportion of stem wood increases with tree size at the expense of branches, foliage, stump and roots. Therefore, BEFs typically vary over time and their use may result in biased estimates. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate differences between biomass estimates obtained using biomass equations and BEFs with particular focus on uncertainty analysis. Assuming that the development of tree fractions in different ways can be handled by individual biomass equations, BEFs for standing stock were shown to overestimate the biomass sink capacity (Sweden). Although estimates for BEFs derived for changes in stock were found to be unbiased, the estimated BEFs varied substantially over time (0. 85 – 1. 22 ton CO 2 /m 3). However, to some extent this variation may be due to random sampling errors rather than actual changes. The highest accuracy was obtained for estimates based on biomass equations for different tree fractions, applied to data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory using a permanent sample design (estimated change in stock 1990 – 2005 : 420 million tons CO 2, with a standard error amounting to 26. 7 million tons CO 2) Many countries have adopted such a design combined with the stock change method for reporting carbon stock changes under the UNFCCC/KP...|$|E
40|$|Forestry and {{reindeer}} herding {{are the two}} geographically {{most extensive}} forms of forest utilisation throughout the northern parts of Sweden today. Until the 18 th century the interior parts of northern Sweden were predominately occupied by native Sami people. From the mid- 18 th century the area was rapidly colonized by farmers. In the late 19 th century forestry, first {{in the form of}} high-grading of the larger trees and later as sustainable forest management, was introduced to the vast inland forests of northern Sweden. The overall aims of this thesis were to characterise and analyze different aspects of the effects of reindeer herding and modern forestry on the forest ecosystem in inland northernmost Sweden in the past, up to present time, and their consequent effects on each other. Two aspects have been of particular interest: (i) the effects of the practice by reindeer herders to cut trees to feed their reindeer with arboreal lichens, and (ii) the effects of modern forestry practices on forests important for reindeer winter grazing. The investigations have been based on a combination of field surveys, dendrochronological analysis, analysis of historical records including maps and forest surveys, and landscape analysis. The main findings of this thesis are 1) cutting of lichen trees for reindeer fodder have been a widespread and important practice up until the beginning of the 20 th century. Scots pine and Norway spruce trees with abundant lichen cover were cut, and the practise were performed for different purposes, including emergency feeding during harsh winters and to gather the reindeers during movements. 2) Early forestry (logging of larger trees in old sparse forests) did not adversely affect winter grazing conditions for reindeer. 3) The fragmentation of the forest landscape and the use of various <b>forestry</b> <b>measures</b> greatly accelerated with the introduction of clear-cutting in the mid- 20 th century and this have had a predominantly negative influence on reindeer winter grazing areas. The overall conclusion is that forestry has mainly had negative influence on reindeer herding, especially since the mid- 20 th century. Despite this, reindeer herding have been able to adjust to major changes in overall land-use during the last few centuries. Historical information, preferably achieved from a combination of several methods, provide a background for the current land-use conflicts in reindeer herding areas and give important insights into longer trends of ecosystem changes...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} tested whether {{demonstration of}} the long term effect of different forest management scenarios in a large forested area changes people's forest values and attitudes. Forestry professionals and other forest users in Central Labrador were shown simulation results of three alternative forest management scenarios illustrating possible long term effects on various indicators. Forest values and attitudes towards <b>forestry</b> were <b>measured</b> {{before and after the}} presentation. Our conception of values and attitudes is based on the cognitive hierarchy model of human behaviour which states that values are more enduring and more difficult to change than attitudes. It was thus hypothesized that attitudes would change but not values and that change in forestry professionals would be less than in other forest users since foresters are trained to think about long-term effects and large-scale processes of forest management scenarios. We also hypothesized that a greater number of people would have an opinion on forest management after the presentation. All three hypotheses were partially supported by the results. The results indicated that some attitude change occurred, but that values also changed somewhat. Most of the significant changes occurred when persons with no clear opinion on several forest-related questions formed an opinion. Long-term, landscape simulation results provide valuable information and enhance understanding of both forestry professionals and other forest users. However, being provided the same information, the two groups learned different things. While forest users gained more confidence in the current forest management plan and were motivated to further participate, professionals learned more specific things. This reflects differences between technical and local knowledge. Attitude change Attitude formation Forest simulation SELES Scale SFM...|$|R
40|$|In {{this era}} of ever {{increasing}} water demands and rapidly depleting water resources coupled with overpopulation, it has become necessary to develop the means to recharge the ground water resources which arenecessary for future requirements. This paper presents one such case study where large amount of rainwater is directed to recharge ground water resources. Somwar Peth is a small village located at distance of 15 Kms. from Kolhapur city. Under Social <b>Forestry</b> Department, some <b>measures</b> have been adopted to recharge the ground water resources, ut {{it has been found}} that these measures don’t work with full apacity in some cases. Hence it is planned to take such engineering and biological measures which will direct this extra runoff to ground water storage. The most significant feature of the work is that if such technologies are developed and adopted at larger scale in rural areas, it will prevent thousands of villages of the country from water supply by tankers. Moreover this will also help us to tackle the issue of flood which mainly occurs due to excess runoff...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} Ips typographus generations {{developed}} in a year might be indicative of its population size and of risk to Norway spruce forests. Warm weather and unremoved fallen trees after natural disturbances are thought of as key factors initiating large population increase. We studied I. typographus development in a spruce forest of the Tatra National Park, which was heavily affected by large-scale disturbances in the last decade. Repeated windthrows and consequent bark beetle outbreaks have damaged almost 20, 000 hectares of mature Norway spruce forests, what is a half of the National Park forest area. Current I. typographus population size and its response {{to the environment and}} to <b>forestry</b> defense <b>measures</b> attract attention of all stakeholders involved in natural resource management, including public. In this paper we analyse the potential I. typographus population size in two consecutive years 2014 and 2015, which represented a climatologically normal year and an extremely hot year, respectively. We used bark temperature and phenology models to estimate the number of generations developed in each year. In 2014, the average bark temperature of standing living trees at study sites was 14. 5 °C, in 2015 it increased to 15. 7 °C. The bark temperature of fallen logs was 17. 7 °C in 2014, and 19. 5 °C in 2015. The bark temperature of standing living trees allowed to develop one and two generations in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The elevated bark temperature of fallen logs allowed to develop two generations in 2014 and three generations in 2015. The good match between the predicted and observed timing of each generation emergence as well as the large {{increase in the number of}} catches in pheromone traps in 2015 indicated a dramatic increase of the I. typographus population in the extremely warm year, especially at the unmanaged windthrown site...|$|R
