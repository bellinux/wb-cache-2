40|$|Specific {{targets of}} {{cellular}} immunity in human premalignancy are largely unknown. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) represents a precursor lesion to myeloma (MM). We show that antigenic targets of spontaneous immunity in MGUS differ from MM. MGUS patients frequently mount a humoral and {{cellular immune response}} against SOX 2, a gene critical for self-renewal in embryonal stem cells. Intranuclear expression of SOX 2 marks the clonogenic CD 138 − compartment in MGUS. SOX 2 expression is also detected in a proportion of CD 138 + cells in MM patients. However, these patients lack anti-SOX 2 immunity. Cellular immunity to SOX 2 inhibits the clonogenic growth of MGUS cells in vitro. Detection of anti-SOX 2 T cells predicts favorable clinical outcome in patients with asymptomatic plasmaproliferative disorders. <b>Harnessing</b> <b>immunity</b> to antigens expressed by tumor progenitor cells may be critical for prevention and therapy of human cancer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Dendritic cells (DCs) {{enhance the}} quality of anti-tumor immune {{response}} in patients with cancer. Thus, we posit that DC-based immunotherapy, in conjunction with toll-like receptor (TLR) - 3 agonist poly-ICLC, is a promising approach for <b>harnessing</b> <b>immunity</b> against metastatic or locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (PC). Methods We generated autologous DCs from the peripheral blood of HLA-A 2 + patients with PC. DCs were pulsed with three distinct A 2 -restricted peptides: 1) human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT, TERT 572 Y), 2) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; Cap 1 - 6 D), and 3) survivin (SRV. A 2). Patients received four intradermal injections of 1 × 107 peptide-pulsed DC vaccines every 2  weeks (Day 0, 14, 28, and 42). Concurrently, patients received intramuscular administration of Poly-ICLC at 30  μg/Kg on vaccination days (i. e., day 0, 14, 28, and 42), as well as on days 3, 17, 21, 31, 37, and 45. Our key objective was to assess safety and feasibility. The effect of DC vaccination on immune response was measured at each DC injection time point by enumerating the phenotype and function of patient T cells. Results Twelve patients underwent apheresis: nine patients with metastatic disease, and three patients with locally advanced unresectable disease. Vaccines were successfully manufactured from all individuals. We found that this treatment was well-tolerated, with the most common symptoms being fatigue and/or self-limiting flu-like symptoms. Among the eight patients who underwent imaging on day 56, four patients experienced stable disease while four patients had disease progression. The median overall survival was 7. 7  months. One patient survived for 28  months post leukapheresis. MHC class I –tetramer analysis before and after vaccination revealed effective generation of antigen-specific T cells in three patients with stable disease. Conclusion Vaccination with peptide-pulsed DCs in combination with poly-ICLC is safe and induces a measurable tumor specific T cell population in patients with advanced PC.

40|$|SummaryVaccinologists {{strive to}} <b>harness</b> <b>immunity</b> at mucosal sites of {{pathogen}} entry. We studied respiratory delivery of an attenuated vaccine against Blastomyces dermatitidis. We created a T cell receptor transgenic mouse responsive to vaccine yeast {{and found that}} mucosal vaccination led to poor T cell activation in the draining nodes and differentiation in the lung. Mucosal vaccination subverted lung T cell priming by inducing matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP 2), which impaired {{the action of the}} chemokine CCL 7 on egress of CCR 2 + Ly 6 Chi inflammatory monocytes from the bone marrow and their recruitment to the lung. Studies in Mmp 2 −/− mice, or treatment with MMP inhibitor or rCCL 7, restored recruitment of Ly 6 Chi monocytes to the lung and CD 4 + T cell priming. Mucosal vaccination against fungi and perhaps other respiratory pathogens may require manipulation of host MMPs in order to alter chemokine signals needed to recruit Ly 6 Chi monocytes and prime T cells at the respiratory mucosa...|$|R
40|$|Oropharyngeal {{candidiasis}} is an {{opportunistic infection}} of the oral cavity caused by Candida albicans, a fungal member of the human commensal flora that causes disease only under conditions of immunosuppression. In HIV+ individuals, the onset of disease is directly correlated to a decrease in CD 4 + T cell counts (< 200 cells/mm 3), suggesting that CD 4 + T cells are important mediators of anti-Candida immunity. Previous studies demonstrated that IL- 17 receptor A (IL- 17 RA) signaling is absolutely required for immunity to OPC. IL- 17 is produced by a CD 4 + T helper cell subset, Th 17, and {{by a variety of}} innate immune cell types. Although it has always been assumed that CD 4 + T cells are the primary mediators of immunity to C. albicans, the relative contribution of Th 17 cells in the context of other, innate, sources of IL- 17 had never been studied until now. We demonstrate that protective, antigen-specific Th 17 cells develop upon secondary infection with C. albicans and contribute to fungal clearance from the tongue. Surprisingly, in the absence of CD 4 + T cells, compensatory sources of IL- 17, such as CD 8 + T cells and CD 3 +CD 4 -CD 8 -, protect susceptible hosts from OPC. Our findings have important implications for designing vaccines targeted to immune compromised populations where it is necessary to <b>harness</b> residual <b>immunity...</b>|$|R
40|$|OCT 4 is a {{transcription}} factor {{critical for the}} pluripotency of human embryonal stem (ES) and induced pluipotency stem (IPS) cells. OCT 4 is commonly expressed in germ-cell tumors as well as putative cancer stem cells in several tumors, and is a key determinant of oncogenic fate in germ-cell tumors. The capacity of the human immune system to recognize this critical stem-cell gene is not known, but has implications for preventing tumors with ES/IPS-based therapies and targeting stem-cell pathways in cancer. Here we show that OCT 4 -specific T cells can be readily detected in freshly isolated T cells from most (> 80 %) healthy donors. The reactivity to OCT 4 -derived peptides resides primarily in the CD 45 RO+ memory T-cell compartment and consists predominantly of CD 4 + T cells. T cells reactive against OCT 4 -derived peptides can be readily expanded in culture using peptide-loaded dendritic cells. In contrast to healthy donors, immunity to OCT 4 was detected in only 35 % of patients with newly diagnosed germ-cell tumors. However, chemotherapy of germ-cell tumors led to the induction of anti-OCT 4 immunity in vivo in patients lacking such responses at baseline. These data demonstrate the surprising lack of immune tolerance to this critical pluripotency antigen in humans. <b>Harnessing</b> natural <b>immunity</b> to this antigen may allow immune-based targeting of pluripotency-related pathways for prevention of cancers, including those {{in the setting of}} ES/IPS-based therapies...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} cancer {{immunotherapy}} reveals {{the power of}} host immunity on killing cancer cells and the feasibility to unleash restraints of anti-tumor immunity. However, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and low immunogenicity of cancer cells restrict the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapies in {{a small fraction of}} patients. Therefore deciphering the underlying mechanisms promoting the generation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is direly needed to better <b>harness</b> host anti-tumor <b>immunity.</b> Early works revealed that deregulated metabolic activities in cancer cells support unrestricted proliferation and survival by producing macromolecules. Intriguingly, recent studies uncovered that metabolic switch in immune and endothelial cells modulate cellular activities and contribute to the progression of several diseases, including cancers. Herein, we review the progress on immunometabolic regulations on fine-tuning activities of immune cells and discuss how metabolic communication between cancer and infiltrating immune cells contributes to cancer immune evasion. Moreover, we would like to discuss how we might exploit this knowledge to improve current immunotherapies and the unresolved issues in this field...|$|R
