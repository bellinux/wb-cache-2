The light armed troops were brought up, and the work of damming the channel at a dozen points, was covered by a shower of javelins and arrows. The Britons, however, had during the past month made shields of strong wicker work of Roman pattern, but long enough to cover them from the eyes down to the ankles, and the wicker work was protected by a <b>double</b> <b>coating</b> of ox hide.

As soon as the road across the channel was completed the Romans poured over, believing that now they should scatter their invisible foes; but they were mistaken, for the Britons with levelled spears, their bodies covered with their bucklers, burst down upon them as they crossed, while a storm of darts and javelins poured in from behind the fighting line.|$|E

40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of various application methods of one-step self-etch adhesives to microtensile resin-dentin bond strength. Materials and Methods Thirty-six extracted human molars were used. The teeth were assigned randomly to twelve groups (n = 15), according to the three different adhesive systems (Clearfil Tri-S Bond, Adper Prompt L-Pop, G-Bond) and application methods. The adhesive systems were applied on the dentin as follows: 1) The single coating, 2) The <b>double</b> <b>coating,</b> 3) Manual agitation, 4) Ultrasonic agitation. Following the adhesive application, light-cure composite resin was constructed. The restored teeth were stored in distilled water at room temperature for 24 hours, and prepared 15 specimens per groups. Then microtensile bond strength was measured and the failure mode was examined. Results Manual agitation and ultrasonic agitation of adhesive significantly increased the microtensile bond strength than single coating and <b>double</b> <b>coating</b> did. <b>Double</b> <b>coating</b> of adhesive significantly increased the microtensile bond strength than single coating did and there was no significant difference between the manual agitation and ultrasonic agitation group. There was significant difference in microtensile bonding strength among all adhesives and Clearfil Tri-S Bond showed the highest bond strength. Conclusions In one-step self-etching adhesives, there was significant difference according to application methods and type of adhesives. No matter of the material, the manual or ultrasonic agitation of the adhesive showed significantly higher microtensile bond strength...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Total hip {{arthroplasty}} {{could fail}} due to many factors {{and one of}} the most common is the aseptic loosening. In order to achieve an effective osseointegration and reduce risk of lossening, the use of cemented implant, contact porous bearing surface and organic coating were developed. Aim of this study was to evaluate clinical and radiological mid-term outcomes of a porous titanium alloy/hydroxyapatite <b>double</b> <b>coating</b> manufactured cementless femoral stem applied with "plasma spray" technique and to demonstrate the possibility to use this stem in different types of femoral canals. Methods: Between January 2008 and December 2012, 240 consecutive primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) were performed using a porous titanium alloy/hydroxyapatite <b>double</b> <b>coating</b> manufactured cementless femoral stem. 182 patients were examined: 136 were females (74. 7 %) and 46 males (25. 2 %); average age was 72 years old (ranging from 26 to 92 years old). For each patient, Harris Hip Scores (HHS) and Womac Scores were collected. All X-ray images were analyzed in order to demonstrate stem survival rate and subsidence. Results: Harris Hip Score was good or excellent in 85 % of the cases (average 90 %) and mean WOMAC score was 97. 5 (ranging from 73. 4 to 100). No cases of early/late infection or periprosthetic fracture were noticed, with an excellent implant survival rate (100 %) in a mean period of 40 months (ranging from 24 and 84 months). 5 cases presented acute implant dislocation, 2 due to wrong cup positioning in a dysplastic acetabulum and 3 after ground level fall. Dorr classification of femoral geometry was uses and the results were: 51 type A bone, 53 type B bone and 78 type C bone. Stem subsidence over 2 mm was considered as a risk factor of future implant loosening and was evidenced in 3 female patients with type C of Dorr classification. No radiolucencies signs around the proximally coated portion of stem or proximal reabsorption were visible during the radiographic follow-up. Conclusions: Concerning the use of porous titanium alloy/hydroxyapatite <b>double</b> <b>coating,</b> this study reported an excellent implant survival rate in a mid-term period with a rate of 1, 64 % of subsidence in patients with type C of femoral canal but with an optimal HHS and Womac Score results. Regarding this stem, primary stability is guaranteed by trapezoid shape of proximal region and tapering in frontal plane through press-fit technique. Radiological absence of pedestal has been accepted as sign of no excessive stress transmission to distal cortex due to its tapered diaphyseal region. Thanks to the reported data, Authors can consider this <b>double</b> <b>coating</b> a valid choice with an excellent mediumterm survival and encouraging subsidence results. Further studies are needed to ensure these results can be replicated...|$|E

30|$|Bacterial counts {{decreased}} significantly {{during the}} study period (P <  0.001). In the case of L. rhamnosus the rate of this decline was significantly faster in free form in comparison with single (P =  0. 002) and <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> (P <  0.001) form and <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> bacteria were more resistant than single coated form (P =  0. 001). The differences between single and <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> was not statistically significant in L. acidophilus (P =  0.127), but the rate of decline in bacterial count in free form was significantly higher than single coated (P =  0.002) and <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> bacteria (P =  0.001). In conclusion, microencapsulation with alginate-chitosan-Eu S 100 nanoparticles is a novel and efficient method for better viability of L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus bacteria. Nevertheless, more studies are required to assess the viability of further probiotic strains as well as examine the guard effect of encapsulation and coating on the probiotic viability in animal and human models.|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveFocal {{cartilage}} lesions {{according to}} International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade 3 – 4 in the medial femoral condyle may progress to osteoarthritis. When treating such focal lesions with metallic implants a sound fixation {{to the underlying}} bone is mandatory. We developed a monobloc unipolar cobalt-chrome (Co-Cr) implant with a double coating; first a layer of commercially pure titanium (c. p. Ti) on top of which a layer of hydroxyapatite (HA) was applied. We hypothesised that such a <b>double</b> <b>coating</b> would provide long-lasting and adequate osseointegration. Design (materials and methods) Unilateral medial femoral condyles of 10 sheep were operated. The implants were inserted in the weight-bearing surface and immediate weight-bearing was allowed. Euthanasia was performed at 6 (three animals) or 12 months (six animals). Osseointegration was analysed with micro-computer tomography (CT), light microscopy and histomorphometric analyses using backscatter scanning electron microscopy (B-SEM) technique. ResultsAt 6 months one specimen out of three showed small osteolytic areas at the hat and at 12 months two specimens out of six showed small osteolytic areas at the hat, no osteolytical areas were seen around the peg at any time point. At both time points, a high total bone-to-implant contact was measured with a mean (95 % confidence interval – CI) of 90. 6 (79 – 102) at 6 months and 92. 3 (89 – 95) at 12 months, respectively. ConclusionsA <b>double</b> <b>coating</b> (Ti + HA) of a focal knee resurfacing Co-Cr implant was presented in a sheep animal model.

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} problem of a screw {{dislocation}} interacting with a double-coated cylindrical inclusion in a dissimilar matrix.

Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effect of <b>double</b> <b>coating</b> on the force of interaction. It is found that, for certain material combinations, the presence of a double-coated cylinder gives rise to two equilibrium positions of the dislocation.
