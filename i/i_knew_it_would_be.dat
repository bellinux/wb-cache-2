25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola came to my studio {{a couple of times}} and I went to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interesting and fun to work together.|$|E
500|$|When {{casting the}} two leading {{actors in the}} film, Bertino sought Liv Tyler {{for the role of}} Kristen. Tyler, who had not worked for several years after the birth of her son, {{accepted}} the part after being impressed by the script: [...] "I especially liked Bryan's way of saying a lot, but not saying everything. Often in movies, it's all spelled out for you, and the dialogue is very explanatory. But Bryan doesn't write like that; he writes how normal people communicateâ€”with questions lingering. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interesting to act that." [...] Canadian actor Scott Speedman was cast as James. Speedman was also impressed by the script, stating that [...] "the audience actually gets time to breathe with the characters before things get scary as hell. That got me interested from the first pages".|$|E
2500|$|After {{a series}} of {{appearances}} in low-budget films and guest roles on TV series in the mid and late 1990s, he gained media attention {{once again in the}} 1999 Emmy-nominated TNT original movie Pirates of Silicon Valley, co-starring Noah Wyle as Apple Computer's Steve Jobs. Hall was widely praised for his portrayal of Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates. [...] "I really fought for this part because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the role of a lifetime," [...] Hall said. [...] "It was a thrill and a daunting challenge to play someone of his stature and brilliance." [...] Hall described his physical appearance as 20-year-old Gates to the San Francisco Chronicle: ...|$|E

'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> grieve {{him most}} dreadfully, {{if it came}} to an end now, dear fellow. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> break my heart, too, but never mind that, I would go away, out of his reach, and he might get over <b>it.</b> <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> not be better than his being always ashamed of an inferior, incompetent creature, always {{dragging}} after him?' ...|$|R

2500|$|On May 23, 1959 Shunryu Suzuki {{arrived in}} San Francisco {{to attend to}} Soko-ji, {{at that time the}} sole Soto Zen temple in San Francisco. He was 55. Suzuki took over for the interim priest, Wako Kazumitsu Kato. Suzuki was taken aback by the Americanized and watered-down Buddhism practiced at the temple, mostly by older {{immigrant}} Japanese. He found American culture interesting and not too difficult to adjust to, even commenting once that [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like this, I would have come here sooner!" [...] He was surprised to see that Sokoji was previously a Jewish synagogue (at 1881 Bush Street, now a historic landmark). His sleeping quarters were located upstairs, a windowless room with an adjoining office.|$|E
2500|$|Anger {{has always}} been an [...] "extremely private individual," [...] {{although}} he has given various interviews over the years, with one interviewer, David Wingrove, describing him in 2008 as [...] "a joy. Gentle, soft-spoken, immaculately tanned, he looks a good two decades younger than his 78 years". In such interviews, he refuses to disclose information on his name change from Anglemeyer to Anger, telling an interviewer who brought the topic up in 2004 that [...] "You're being impertinent. It says Anger on my passport, that's all you need to know. I would stay away from that subject if I were you." [...] In a 2010 interview, however, he stated that [...] "I just condensed my name. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like a label, a logo. It's easy to remember." [...] Anger is openly gay, with one of his friends describing how he [...] "was attracted to people who were either well endowed or the Arnold Schwarzenegger type." [...] He once joked that he was [...] "somewhat {{to the right of the}} KKK" [...] in his views about black people, opening him up to criticism for racism. He is a passionate supporter of the Tibetan independence movement.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, Derby {{rejected}} {{an offer}} from Burnley for Bryson. Bryson was however given permission to speak to Burnley, later saying that [...] "it doesn't matter what team it is, when someone puts an offer in for you I think you owe them the respect {{to sit down and}} speak to them... but just because I did that didn't mean I was going to sign for them." [...] Soon afterwards, he agreed a new five-year contract with Derby, saying that his bond with the fans was {{part of the reason that}} he chose to stay: [...] "I've got a good bond with the fans as well and that was a big part in my decision to stay here. The fans have been excellent ever since I walked through the door. When you come to a new club it can take time to win over the fans, but they have been fantastic with me... they helped me make the biggest decision of my career, if not my life. I took a while to think about it and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a massive decision. I went through stages where one minute I thought I was leaving and then the next minute I think I'm staying. But in the end it turned out to be an easy decision for me because Derby are such a great club to be part of." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coonan's casting as Carl was {{announced}} on 6 May 2013, {{when it was}} revealed that the character is Kirsty Branning's (Kierston Wareing) ex-boyfriend and has been in prison, where he had shared a cell with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Coonan said of his casting, [...] "EastEnders {{has been a part of}} my life since I was 12 years old. I even remember talking about the storylines in school playgrounds in Tottenham and I am very happy and proud to now be a small part of its life." [...] Executive producer Lorraine Newman said: [...] "It's wonderful to have Daniel Coonan joining us in Walford to play Carl White. Oozing confidence and with a dangerous edge, will Kirsty be able to resist his bad boy charms for long, or can [...] Max [...] save her from the lure of the dark side?" [...] This is Coonan's second role in EastEnders, as he played David Priors in 2011. Coonan said the four-episode role helped him prepare for a bigger role in the programme, though describing his first day on set as Carl, he said, [...] "it still hits you when you walk on to the Square for the very first time. It's like walking into your TV." [...] Coonan filmed his first scene on the Bridge Street market set. Heat reported that Carl's introduction was part of a [...] "rescue plan" [...] to increase ratings for EastEnders, especially with the announced departures of popular characters Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), saying [...] "with ever-dwindling ratings and an unusually bare trophy cabinet, producers have been forced to plan some major shake-ups in an attempt to revive the ailing drama with new characters, returning familiar faces and exciting storylines." [...] Coonan later said of being cast, [...] "When they offered the part of Carl to me, I thought about it as long as it takes to blink your eyelids. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a great character and fun to play. Something like this can massively raise your profile. I'm beaming into thousands of people's homes four times a week." [...] Coonan was originally contracted to appear in 28 episodes over a six-month period, but instead filmed over 60 episodes. After Danny Dyer was cast as Mick Carter in the show, he revealed that he was approached to play Carl.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{all right}} {{from the first time}} you spoke to me! Yes, indeed, I knew {{directly}} you came up to me that evening. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> all right, if you only cared to make it so; but of course I could not tell if you meant it. 'Command me,' you said. Funny thing for a man like you to say. Did you really mean it? You weren't making fun of me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> difficult. Indeed, I {{was anxious}} about you; the {{wilderness}} has claimed {{so much from}} me. But did you--" ...|$|E

40|$|Recently I set {{myself the}} task of {{learning}} the French language. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the undertaking would be fraught with frustration. <b>I</b> did not <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> provide me with insights into the demands made upon the child who is learning to read and write. Neither did <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> so soundly reaffirm my belief in the whole language approach to literacy instruction...|$|R

60|$|I rode on. I {{could not}} help riding on, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> safer to keep away. I reached the edge of that big rock. Saduko and Umbelazi were fighting there.|$|E

6000|$|Agatha {{looked at}} her in evident bewilderment, but she nodded. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "of course, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> come. Everybody <b>knows</b> by now that you have fallen out with Gregory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to do that mantel for me," [...] she said. [...] "I don't know what you mean by 'low relief,' but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be up to these, and they are right!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{not exactly}} {{for you to}} laugh, Hilary," [...] he said. [...] "It's all {{of a piece with}} your cursed sentimentality about those Hughs, and that girl. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> end in a mess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is; I forget why. She {{told me a}} long story, but I didn't listen, as <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> mostly fibs. She's {{probably}} up to some mischief. Let's {{go round}} to her place and have tea, shall we?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have come}} {{two or three}} miles {{out of my way}} on account of you,' said Sol sullenly. 'And all this time lost. I don't see why you wanted to come here at all. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a waste of time.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, ma'am, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be just as}} {{it ought}} to be. I cannot repeat what ladies say on such occasions, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>it</b> {{is what makes the}} hearts of the gentlemen leap for joy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So am I,' responded the prim man, 'because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have afforded so much amusement. Never mind; I {{dare say}} I shall manage to {{recollect}} it, {{in the course}} of half an hour or so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was {{something}} strange about him," [...] said Andy. [...] "I wish Ritter {{would tell us}} more about him. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be useless to ask Reff. He hasn't spoken to me since the fight." ...|$|R
