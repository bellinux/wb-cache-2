30|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War, the US {{has become}} the undisputed global hegemon. Fukuyama (1992) was able to declare the End of History with liberal {{democracy}} as the ultimate form of governance. Ideologically claiming the moral high ground, the West set the structure of the global financial system, which is also regulated by the West, to reinforce the doctrine of liberal democracy at the expense of creating dependency in the developing world. Consequently, aid from the US is made conditional upon the recipients introducing liberal democratic reforms under the doctrine of the Washington Consensus. Yet, following the 911 terrorist attack on American soils in 2001, former US President <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> to ask “Why do they hate us?” a The US sub-prime crisis ultimately triggered the question of whether liberal democracy should be the universal norm of governances.|$|E

Although I disagreed with most of his political policies, I could admire his personal dedication to exercise. It is always a bit of a shock to hear of someone who exercises regularly having heart troubles. So, why exercise? I know enough about atherosclerosis to know that it is an insidious disease often without symptoms. Most coronary atherosclerosis even when severely advanced often has few symptoms. It is often missed on routine screening treadmill stress tests and even with coronary angiography the extent of the disease can be underestimated. Also, there is a strong component of genetics in coronary atherosclerosis and it is definitely more common as we age. Is it inevitable if we live long enough? The news flash about George Bush did make me think more about the role of exercise in prevention and treatment of coronary atherosclerosis. How worthwhil...|$|E
40|$|The US and {{its allies}} might have got better value for their dollar by {{boosting}} health and aid rather than waging war on Iraq, argues John Quiggin THE war in Iraq exemplifies two striking features of the style of warfare that has been adopted by America and, inevitably, its allies. The first is the lopsided ratio of casualties. In the main phase of the war, the US lost 137 soldiers and Britain 37 (happily no Australians were killed). By contrast, the Iraqi casualties will never be counted, but are almost certainly {{in the tens of}} thousands. Hospital estimates from Baghdad and Basra suggest up to 2000 civilian fatalities in both places. Given the sophistication of modern weapons, these unintended deaths are presumably few in relation to the carnage inflicted on the Iraqi army, and particularly on Republican Guard divisions that simply disintegrated under sustained bombing. The other striking feature of modern war is its expense. President <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> been allocated $US 73 billion ($ 113. 5 billion) for the war, but the total cost appears likely to be much higher. The money spent directly on the war seems to have been about $US 50 billion, a substantial sum given that active combat lasted only a few weeks. The cost to Australia will be clarified in the forthcoming budget, but seems likely to be about $ 1 billion. Is there any way of making sense of these numbers? The economic concept of opportunity cost provides one approach. Consider, for example, the alternative option of allocating the money to improved health care or public safety. Under current conditions, marginal health care and public safety interventions in the US typically cost about $US 5 million per life saved. Thus, if the direct war budget of $US 50 billion had been allocated to public health instead, the lives of about 10, 000 Americans could have been saved. This is far from being a hypothetical choice. At the very moment Federal Congress was voting funds for the war, hard-pressed state governments were cutting benefits for the poor under the Medicaid program, including subsidies for lifesaving drugs. Both sides have paid a high price in lives for this war. The same issues arise in Australia. Because the greater cost-effectiveness of our health system roughly cancels out the lower value of our dollar, the marginal cost of health-care interventions is also about $ 5 million per life saved, implying that about 200 Australian lives could have been saved. And of course, as in the US, federal spending on defence comes at the expense of state spending on health and education services. Depending on what is ultimately discovered about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, this {{may turn out to be}} a small price to pay. At this stage, however, it appears that any weapons not destroyed before the war have been looted in the ensuing chaos. Benefits on this account are likely to be small or, if the weapons get into the wrong hands, possibly negative. In the absence of large-scale discoveries of weapons, attention has focused on the benefits of overthrowing an evil and oppressive dictator. This is a form of foreign aid and can usefully be compared to other aid programs. The total budget of USAID, the main US agency for development and humanitarian assistance is $US 8. 7 billion for the coming year. The money spent on the Iraq war could have doubled USAID’s budget for the next five years. It seems certain that the war will herald a sustained increase in military expenditure of at least $US 100 billion a year. A more reasonable comparison, therefore, is the ambitious proposal of the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, led by Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, which aimed to achieve for all poor countries a two-thirds reduction of 1990 child mortality levels, a three-quarters reduction of 1990 maternal mortality ratios and an end to the rising incidence of major diseases, especially HIV/AIDS. As the commission pointed out, in addition to the humanitarian benefits of saving as many as 8 million lives per year, reductions in mortality are directly correlated with a reduced frequency of military coups and state collapse. These provide the breeding ground for terrorism and dictatorship and ultimately lead, in many cases, to US military intervention. The estimated cost for the commission’s seemingly utopian program over the next decade is estimated at between $US 50 billion and $US 100 billion a year. War is sometimes necessary in self-defence. But when war is adopted as an instrument of policy, it is often counterproductive and almost never cost-effective.
