5|$|Gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are giant planets {{primarily}} {{composed of}} {{hydrogen and helium}} and are the most massive planets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System.

5|$|Also if {{assuming}} a radius of one AU, then {{there may not}} be sufficient building material <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System to construct a Dyson shell. Anders Sandberg estimates that there is 1.82 kg of easily usable building material <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of 600kg/m2—about 8–20cm thick on average, depending on the density of the material. This includes the hard-to-access cores of the gas giants; the inner planets alone provide only 11.79 kg, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of just 42kg/m2.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{remaining}} irregular moons, Sao and Laomedeia follow prograde orbits, whereas Halimede, Psamathe and Neso follow retrograde orbits. Given {{the similarity of}} their orbits, {{it was suggested that}} Neso and Psamathe could have a common origin in the break-up of a larger moon. Psamathe and Neso have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> system to date. They take 25 years to orbit Neptune at an average of 125 times the distance between Earth and the Moon. Neptune has the largest Hill sphere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System, owing primarily to its large distance from the Sun; this allows it to retain control of such distant moons. Nevertheless, Jupiter's S/2003 J 2 orbits at the greatest percentage of the primary's Hill radius of all the moons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System on average, and the Jovian moons in the Carme and Pasiphae groups orbit at a greater percentage of their primary's Hill radius than Psamathe and Neso.|$|E

5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} {{skeptical of the}} {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System, nevertheless speculates that at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System, might have been ejected from the Solar System during a dynamical instability in the early Solar System. Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud if one has entered a stable orbit.|$|E

30|$|Like <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> photons <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> wind {{particles}} {{induce a}} drag force onto the zodiacal dust grains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heliosphere. For <b>the</b> distant <b>solar</b> wind with high Mach numbers the drag coefficient is a constant, but {{close to the}} Sun, where Mach numbers become small, the drag coefficient is a complicated function of the ion sound speed, density and temperature. We discuss the dynamics of dust particles due to this drag force and compare it with that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distant <b>solar</b> wind. Especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near <b>solar</b> wind <b>the</b> eccentricity varies <b>in</b> a complicated way with the inclination of the orbits, also the semimajor axis decreases faster closer to the Sun. These variations are quite different <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distant <b>solar</b> wind.|$|R
5|$|For {{most of its}} orbit, it is {{even farther}} from the Sun than at present, with its {{aphelion}} estimated at 937AU (31 times Neptune's distance), {{making it one of}} the most distant-known objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System other than long-period comets.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede (Jupiter III), {{the third}} Galilean moon {{is named after}} the mythological Ganymede, cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus's beloved. Ganymede is the largest natural {{satellite}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System at 5262.4 kilometers in diameter, which makes it larger than the planet Mercury – although only at about half of its mass since Ganymede is an icy world. It is the only satellite <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System known to possess a magnetosphere, likely created through convection within the liquid iron core.|$|E
5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> summer, <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> panels {{generate}} 60% more electricity {{than the}} super-insulated house needs. The excess is stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of hydrogen {{which is used}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter—when <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> panels can't meet all the domestic demand—to make electricity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fuel cell.|$|R
5|$|Jupiter is {{the fifth}} planet from the Sun and the largest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but {{two and a half}} times that of all the other planets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an {{apparent}} magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.|$|E
5|$|Lead's per-particle {{abundance}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System is 0.121 ppb (parts per billion). This {{figure is}} {{two and a}} half times higher than that of platinum, eight times more than mercury, and seventeen times more than gold. The amount of lead in the universe is slowly increasing as most heavier atoms (all of which are unstable) gradually decay to lead. The abundance of lead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System since its formation 4.5 billion years ago has increased by about 0.75%. The solar system abundances table shows that lead, despite its relatively high atomic number, is more prevalent than most other elements with atomic numbers greater than 40.|$|E

5|$|Saturn (9.5AU), {{distinguished}} by its extensive ring system, has several similarities to Jupiter, {{such as its}} atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it {{is less than a}} third as massive, at 95 Earth masses. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 62 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity. Titan, the second-largest moon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System with a substantial atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The Sun, which {{comprises}} {{nearly all}} the matter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System, is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium. Jupiter and Saturn, which comprise {{nearly all the}} remaining matter, are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. A composition gradient exists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System, created by heat and light pressure from the Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points. The boundary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System beyond which those volatile substances could condense {{is known as the}} frost line, and it lies at roughly 5 AU from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The Uranian {{satellite}} {{system is the}} least massive among those of the giant planets.
