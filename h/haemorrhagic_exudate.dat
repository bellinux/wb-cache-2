40|$|Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) {{is a rare}} neutrophilic {{dermatosis}} {{of unknown}} aetiology, characterized by primarily sterile, painful ulcers with typical violaceous undermined borders and mucopurulent or <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>exudate.</b> PG is commonly associated with other systemic disorders. Diagnosis of primary idiopathic forms is reached following the exclusion of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatic disorders, monoclonal gammopathy and solid tumours (1, 2). Treatment is generally based on corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy; however, the recent use of biological drugs has shown their effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|Three {{cases of}} the {{neonatal}} respiratory distress syndrome are described. The babies were treated by prolonged oxygen given by intermittent positive pressure respiration after endotracheal intubation. Two of the infants died and at necropsy the lungs in both cases were consolidated. Both showed widespread <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>exudate</b> and interstitial oedema. Early organization of the exudate was apparent in one case. The third infant survived but developed a similar exudative condition and a `honeycomb' lung. It is suggested {{that many of the}} changes found in the lungs of these cases could be attributed to the toxicity of oxygen...|$|E
40|$|In March 2007, {{cutaneous}} nodules {{were observed}} on the neck, shoulder {{and back of}} a breeding bull imported from France in November 2006. The nodules opened spontaneously and produced a <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>exudate.</b> The cause was Parafilaria bovicola, a filariid nematode not endemic to the Netherlands. The worm can cause substantial economic loss {{because of the need}} to trim carcasses and because of the diminished value of hides. The infection is spread by the fly Musca autumnalis, which is common in the Netherlands. Because treatment does not stop the infection from spreading, the bull was culled to prevent the risk of infection of the national herd. To our knowledge, this is the first case of Parafilaria bovicola in the Netherlands...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHydrocarbons {{are major}} {{contaminants}} {{that may affect}} biota at various trophic levels in estuaries and coastal ecosystems. The effects of accidental pollution by light cycle oil (LCO), a refined product of heavy fuel oil, on bioaccumulation, depuration processes and immune-related parameters in the European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, were investigated in the laboratory after 7 days of exposure and a 2 -week recovery period. Exposure of fish to the soluble fraction of LCO (1600 ng L(- 1)) for 7 days led to the bioaccumulation of some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in muscles: naphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene and anthracene. After 7 days of recovery period, half-elimination of naphthalene was reported in fish muscles due to facilitated diffusive loss by the epithelium and a faster elimination rate proven {{by the presence of}} a high level of naphthalene biliary metabolites. The other bioaccumulated molecules displayed a slower deputation rate due to their elimination by the formation of hydrophobic metabolites excreted through bile or urine. Three days after the beginning of the recovery period, each contaminated fish showed severe external lesions (tissue necrosis, suppurative <b>exudates,</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> area). The hypothesis of a possible link with inflammatory phenomenon was supported by (i) an inversion of the leucocyte sub-population percentage, (ii) a significant up-expression in the spleen of the tumour necrosis factor alpha gene, (iii) a significant increase in ACH(50). Moreover, the lack of C 3 gene regulation in the spleen suggested a non-renewal of this component. The reduction of phagocytic activity and lysozyme concentration reflected immune suppression. Finally, LCO toxicity in this fish was clearly demonstrated to be related to inflammatory reaction and immune depletion...|$|R
40|$|In March 2007 {{cutaneous}} nodules {{were observed}} in the neck-, shoulder- and back-region of a breeding bull, imported from France in November 2006. The nodules opened spontaneously and produced a <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>exudate.</b> After suspicion of parafilariosis, the bull was treated with moxidectin, but without effect. Treatment with ivermectin stopped the bleedings. To prevent spread of this imported infection, the bull was euthanised and necropsied. Worms {{were found in the}} subcutis which could be identified as Parafilaria bovicola. This is the first diagnosed case of parafilariosis in the Netherlands. In the following period, all cattle on the farm were carefully examined for signs of parafilariosis and provided with permethrin containing ear tags. Till July 2008, no new cases on the farm were observe...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The brown tumour of {{hyperparathyroidism}} is {{a result}} of a metabolic disorder caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. Report. We described a case of a 37 -year-old female patient presenting bimaxillary intraoral lesions and swelling in the neck. Incisional biopsy of the oral lesion was performed and histopathological examination revealed a central giant cell lesion composed by intense <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>exudate,</b> abundant presence of giant cells, and areas with hemosiderin pigment. The patient also presented high levels of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone, hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue, bilateral parenchymal nephropathy, and densitometry lower than expected, showing an advanced stage of osteitis fibrosa cystica. Synchronous parathyroid adenoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma were confirmed by imaging exams and histopathologically. Conclusion. The composition of all the clinical, pathological, and imaging findings led to the final diagnosis of brown tumour of hyperparathyroidism. The occurrence of parathyroid adenoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and brown tumours of hyperparathyroidism in their late stage (osteitis fibrosa cystica) associated with oral brown tumours involving the mandible and maxilla is extremely rare...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS Three {{cases of}} the {{neonatal}} respiratory distress syndrome are described. The babies were treated by prolonged oxygen given by intermittent positive pressure respiration after endo-tracheal intubation. Two of the infants died and at necropsy the lungs in both cases were con-solidated. Both showed widespread <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>exudate</b> and interstitial oedema. Early organiza-tion of the exudate was apparent in one case. The third infant survived but developed a similar exudative condition and a 'honeycomb ' lung. It is suggested {{that many of the}} changes found in the lungs of these cases could be attributed to the toxicity of oxygen. The prolonged use of oxygen in tensions above that found in air has been employed in space research and deep sea diving. In medicine it is used in radiotherapy and in intensive care of both adults and infants. The toxic effects of oxygen depend on its partial pressure and on individual and species sensitivity (Bean, 1965). At very high tensions, above 3 atmo-spheres, the primary disturbances are noted in the nervous system while at lower pressures, up to 2 atmospheres, the lung appears to react first (Ledingham, 1967). The effect of oxygen at 3 - 7 atmo-spheres ' tension on the central nervous system in man is well illustrated by the work of Donald (1947) who showed that the tolerance of 36 subjects varied from seven to 96 minutes. Convulsions and twitching were the first symptoms to develop. At lower ten-sions minor constriction of the vessels of the adult cerebrum and retina may occur as well as retrolental fibroplasia in premature infants (Klaus and Meyer, 1966). That the lung could be affected by lower tensions of oxygen was illustrated by Lorraine Smith in 1899 who showed that mice exposed to 79 % of an atmosphere oxygen tension developed pulmonary congestion and consolidation and about half the animals died. In human volunteers at oxygen tensions of 1 atmosphere the average tolerance was from 53 to 75 hours, while the onset of symptoms varied from six to 30 hours. The first symptom in most cases was substemal distress (Welch, Morgan, and Clamann...|$|E
