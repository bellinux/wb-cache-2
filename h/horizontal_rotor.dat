50|$|The Pitcairn-Cierva Autogiro Company, {{established}} by Harold Frederick Pitcairn, designed the PCA-2 {{based on the}} autogiros of Juan de la Cierva. The resulting design had a standard aircraft fuselage and powerplant, with a standard tail. However, it sported short, stubby wings, angled up at the wingtips. Above the cockpit was the rotor, consisting of three blades. The engine usually drove a standard propellor, on a vertical plane, {{in front of the}} aircraft. However, the engine could be geared to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>rotor</b> during takeoff or landing. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>rotor,</b> while in flight, did not draw energy from the engine but rather generated lift from airspeed. A minimum speed of 30 mph was needed to keep the aircraft in flight. Thus, in moderate winds, the aircraft could behave like a helicopter, except that it could not hover.|$|E

50|$|Counterrotating rotors are {{rotorcraft}} configurations {{with a pair}} or more {{of large}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>rotors</b> that turn in opposite directions to counteract the torque effect on the aircraft without relying on an antitorque tail rotor. This lets the aircraft apply the power that would have driven a tail rotor to the main rotors, increasing lifting capacity. Primarily, three common configurations use the counterrotating effect on rotorcraft. Tandem rotors are two rotors—one mounted behind the other. Coaxial rotors are two rotors mounted one above {{the other on the}} same axis. Intermeshing rotors are two rotors mounted close to each other at a sufficient angle to let the rotors intermesh {{over the top of the}} aircraft. Another configuration—found on tiltrotors and some early helicopters—is called transverse rotors, where a pair of rotors are mounted at each end of a wing-type structure or outrigger.|$|R

In 1922, he bought a surplus Nieuport 23 fighter's fuselage, added a Bentley 220 hp engine on the front, and connected it by geared shafts to two horizontal rotors mounted on a truss extending sideways from the fuselage. A third <b>horizontal</b> <b>rotor</b> at the rear provided pitch control.This was demonstrated at College Park, Maryland to the U.S. Navy’s Bureau of Aeronautics on June 16, 1922, and is often given (though disputed) as the debut of the helicopter.|$|E

Diagnostic information discernable from probes at the bearing is explored and compared to midspan response, where previous research has concentrated.

Good agreement between the analytical model and experiment demonstrates that the analysis presented can be useful to diagnose and balance residual shaft bow from probes located at the bearings, where vibration data are typically more available than midspan probes.

50|$|For {{helicopters}} with contra-rotating rotors—also {{known as}} Coaxial mounted—one {{over the other}} on the same rotor shaft (Like a Kamov KA-50), helicopter control requires interaction between the two rotors. Howevererent rotor masts (Like a Boeing CH-47 Chinook) uses differential collective pitch to change the pitch attitude of the aircraft. To pitch nose down and accelerate forward, the pilot decreases collective pitch on the front rotor and increases collective pitch on the rear rotor proportionally. Conversely, the synchropter and transverse-mounted rotor counter rotating rotorcraft have two large <b>horizontal</b> <b>rotor</b> assemblies mounted side by side, (like a Bell/Boeing V-22 tilt rotor) helicopters use differential collective pitch to affect the roll of the aircraft. All of these configurations use differential cyclic pitch to control movement about the yaw axis, tilting the rotors in opposite directions to cause the aircraft to spin {{in the direction of the}} tilted rotors.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. In this thesis, sliding mode control (SMC), one of nonlinear control theories is designed based on the original nonlinear active magnetic bearing (AMB) system with 4 degrees of freedom. It is applied to the regulation/stabilization and large motion tracking of the nonlinear rotor AMB system. For the regulation of rotor, the vertical rotor AMB system with the imbalance disturbance due to the eccentricity of mass is considered for cylindrical and conical mode initial conditions. For the large motion tracking, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>rotor</b> AMB system with uncertain parameters, e. g., the force constant, nominal air gap from AMB actuator, the cut-off frequency of power amplifier, is considered. The large motion tracking is composed of two parts: radial motion tracking (RMT) and axial motion tracking (AMT). For RMT, the whirling and conical motions are used as desired tracking trajectories. For AMT, Albemet and Steel are used as the material of rotor. MATLAB/SIMULINK software is used to simulate both the AMB systems with SMC's. From the simulation results, it is shown that (1) for the vertical rotor, SMC designed based on nonlinear AMB system can attenuate uncertain imbalance disturbance for both cylindrical and conical mode initial conditions, (2) for RMT of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>rotor,</b> the AMB system for conical desired motion is more robust to parametric uncertainty and energy-efficient, and (3) for AMT of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>rotor,</b> according to the maximum shooting target and the total heat loss generating from the axial bearings, Albemet rotor, which has low weight and high stiffness is recommended. It is also verified that bias current of AMB actuator is important factor to reduce the total heat loss...|$|E

50|$|The {{yaw drive}} is an {{important}} component of the horizontal axis wind turbines' yaw system. To ensure the wind turbine is producing the maximal amount of electric energy at all times, the yaw drive is used to keep the rotor facing into the wind as the wind direction changes. This only applies for wind turbines with a <b>horizontal</b> axis <b>rotor.</b> The wind turbine is said to have a yaw error if the rotor is not aligned to the wind. A yaw error implies that a lower share of the energy in the wind will be running through the rotor area. (The generated energy will be proportional the cosine of the yaw error).|$|R

The primary objective was to develop the capability to study tilt-wing aircraft. Experienced Tilt-wing pilots subjectively evaluated the model using programmed-flap control to assess the quality of the simulation.

40|$|Magnetic {{bearings}} {{are selected}} as the physical systems because of the recent tremen-dous research activity in their use in high performance machines. The input-output characteristic makes such a system inherently nonlinear and unstable, so it is neces-sary to implement a desired control to it. However, if the system dynamic behavior and the limitations from the control system hardware as a whole are not incorpo-rated into the electro-mechanical and the control system design, the desired system performance may not be realizable. This thesis treats the equations of motion of a rigid, <b>horizontal</b> <b>rotor</b> magnetic bearing system. Through LQ feedback linearization and describing function method-ology to approximate the saturation nonlinearity at the input level, the open-loop system characteristic is analized. This system is then simulated to demonstrate dis-turbance rejection properties and its robustness to parameter uncertainty and un-modelled dynamics.

The dynamic model takes under consideration contact forces derived by the hertzian theory of elasticity between the balls and the races, {{the effect of}} varying compliance, the internal radial clearance and the rotor's speed fluctuations. The effect of variation in speed fluctuations is examined for periodic, unstable periodic and chaotic responses {{with the use of}} frequency distributions, higher order Poincare maps, and Lyapunov exponents. All results presented show a dominant stabilization effect of the speed fluctuations to the system behavior. From the analysis performed, it is concluded that even a minimum fluctuation of the rotor speed may result to major changes of the system dynamics, indicating that speed fluctuations of the rotor are a governing parameter to the dynamic behavior of the system.
