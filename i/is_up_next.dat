Well, as I say, a month or two after I came to it, he went away on leave down to Calcutta, where he was to meet a young lady who had been engaged to him before he left home. They were married, and he brought her up country. Before she had been with us a month we had one of those outbreaks of cholera. It wasn't a very severe one. I think we only lost eight or ten men, and no officer; but the Doctor's young wife was attacked, and in three or four hours she was carried off. It regularly broke him down. However, he got over it, as we all do, I suppose; and now I think he is married to the regiment. He could have had staff appointments a score of times, but he has always refused them. His time <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> year, and he could go home on full pay, but I don't suppose he will." ...|$|E

50|$|At {{the ranch}} weigh-in, the Red Team is up first, as they're {{the only team}} without {{penalties}} this week. Rob loses nine pounds, Jordan loses six, and Scott loses five. Blake <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> - she feels a lot of emotional weight has been lifted this week, and wonders whether that will translate on the scale. She steps on the scale and loses only three pounds, to 196, leaving her devastated and terrified of going home. The Red Team's total weight loss is 23 pounds, or 2.01%. The White Team <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>next,</b> and it's {{time to find out}} whether they were sinners or winners during their week in Vegas. They must lose more than 28 pounds to stay safe. Rondalee weighs in first and loses three pounds. JJ <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>next,</b> and everyone is concerned his partying will have taken its toll. But for the third week in a row, he drops a solid seven pounds. Toma loses eight and Woody is overjoyed to have lost seven. Overall, the team really stepped it up in Vegas, losing a total of 31 pounds, or 2.22%. It's the moment of truth for the Blue Team. Damien and Lori need to lose a collective 11 pounds, or they'll be down to a team of one. Lori loses only three and is heartbroken. It's once again up to Damien to pull through... and he does! Damien drops nine pounds, saving his team and bringing their total weight loss to 12 pounds, or 2.05%. But their joy is bittersweet, as this means that Blake has fallen below the Red Line and must leave the ranch. She's upset, but determined to keep working hard at home. Back at home, Gina weighs 172 lbs. and wants to do a triathlon by the finale.|$|E

50|$|At {{the ranch}} weigh-in, {{everyone}} is nervous {{to see how}} the new teams will shake out. The White Team is up first and starts off with their one-pound advantage. Scott steps on the scale and loses nine pounds to 268 pounds. Lori drops four pounds to 245 pounds. Rondalee is hoping to get below 218 pounds, her plateau weight since high school. Unfortunately, she only loses three pound to 221, which Jen thinks {{has to do with the}} fact that she still hasn't gotten to the bottom of why Rondalee doesn't value herself. The White Team's total weight loss is 17 pounds, 2.27%. The Red Team needs to lose more than 18 pounds to stay safe from the Red Line. Sonya is up first and at 206 pounds, is shooting for Wonderland - she hasn't been in the 100s since she was in high school. She loses six pounds to 200, narrowly missing her goal. Rob <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> and loses eight pounds to 366, followed by Toma, who loses nine pounds to 246. In total, the Red Team loses 23 pounds, or 2.75%, meaning they are safe for the week.Last but not least is the Blue Team, which needs to drop 20 pounds. JJ steps up and loses eight, landing him at 309 pounds. Jordan <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> and loses a mere two pounds to 246, meaning the pressure is on Woody. He needs to lose 11 pounds to save Jordan, and after a few bad weigh-ins, he personally needs a win. Woody steps on the scale... and loses an incredible 15 pounds! The team's total is 25 pounds, 2.79%. This means that Rondalee has fallen below the Red Line, and must leave the ranch. Jackie now weighs 208 lbs. and wants to create a health and wellness program at her Native American community.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, over at Comeback Canyon, former {{teammates}} Damien and Jackie are {{now going}} head-to-head. Bob believes if anyone can beat NFLer Damien, it's the Queen of Comeback Canyon. Jackie steps on the scale first with a previous weight of 243 pounds. Her current weight is 239, meaning she lost four pounds, or 1.65%. She's happy to have finally {{made it into the}} 230s. Damien <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>next,</b> with a previous weight of 314. He needs to lose at least six pounds to dethrone Jackie, and loses an impressive eight, or 2.55%. He is psyched to be so close to the 200s, and to stay at Comeback Canyon another week. Jackie is happy to go home a different, stronger, happier person who can't wait to teach her kids a healthier lifestyle.|$|E

5000|$|Over at Comeback Canyon, it's {{time for}} Jackie and Gina to weigh in. Bob {{has been working}} with the two moms all week on putting {{themselves}} first and focusing on their needs, and not just the needs of their families. Gina is five pounds away from [...] "One"derland, and hasn't weighed less than 200 pounds since high school. Jackie's husband has never seen her under 250, and at 252, she's ready to reach that milestone. Jackie steps on the scale and loses three pounds, reaching her goal of weighing in the 240s. Gina <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>next,</b> and at 204 pounds, she needs to lose at least three pounds to stay in the game. Sadly, she only loses two, meaning she not only failed to reach [...] "One"derland, she must also leave Comeback Canyon.|$|E
50|$|At {{the ranch}} weigh-in, the White Team is up first. Rondalee {{steps on the}} scale and is thrilled to have lost seven pounds, {{breaking}} the 50-pound weight loss mark. JJ <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> and loses four pounds, while Toma loses eight. Woody is disappointed to have only lost three, but Sonya knocks {{it out of the}} park, losing a whopping nine pounds. The team's total weight loss is 31 pounds (2.27%). The Blue Team <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>next,</b> and needs to lose more than 12 pounds to stay safe. Lori drops six, so it's up to Damien to lose more than six pounds. But when he gets on the scale, he and everyone else are shocked to see he only dropped three pounds. That three does not reflect the work he did this week. The Blue Team's total is nine pounds (1.57%). The Red Team needs to lose more than 14 pounds to avoid the Red Line. Scott is up first and loses six pounds, followed by Jordan, who loses five. If Rob loses four pounds, he not only keeps the Red Team safe, but also his the 100 pounds lost mark. He gets on the scale... and loses an incredible 13 pounds! He has now lost a total of 109 pounds since arriving at the ranch. The Red Team's total weight loss is 24 pounds (2.60%), which means the Blue Team lost the weigh-in and must face the Red Line. Sadly for Damien, despite posting big numbers week after week, the scale wasn't in his favor this time, and he is automatically eliminated. It {{will be interesting to see}} him take on the reigning champion Jackie at Comeback Canyon next week. When Blake started the Biggest Loser she weighed 251 lbs. She now weighs 161 lbs. and lost 90 lbs. She hopes to be in an adult soccer league and win the At-home prize.|$|E

50|$|At the ranch, it's {{time to see}} if Toma's {{tailgate}} temptation backfires on the White Team. JJ gets on {{the scale}} first and loses seven pounds, bringing him to 335 pounds.

Jackie drops five pounds, followed by Lori, who loses four. Gina only posts three pounds, leaving Damien to make up the slack for his team. He needs to lose 13 pounds, but only loses seven and is upset with himself for being unable to come through at a clutch moment. The Blue Team's total weight loss is 19 pounds, 1.77%. The Red Team now needs to lose more than 21 pounds to stay in the game and send the Blue Team to elimination. Scott posts seven pounds, followed by Jordan, who loses six, and Blake, who loses five. Rob is up last and needs to lose more than three pounds. He's very concerned after his poor performance last week, but he manages to drop an impressive 11 pounds! Crying, he expresses how grateful he is to still be here and that he's finally learning to love himself. The Red Team's total is 29 pounds, 2.42%, meaning they have won this week's weigh-in. Unfortunately for the Blue Team, that means they must send one of their own home. This week it's Gina, whose 1.43% weight loss landed her below the red line. We'll see how she matches up against Matt at next week's Comeback Canyon weigh-in. Mike is back at home now weighing 279 lbs. and visits his son's grave and thanking him for being on the ranch and is now not a Type II diabetic. He plans on walking 9 miles and swimming 4 miles every day and weighing at 250 lbs. by the finale.|$|E
5000|$|At the weigh-in, it's time to {{see whether}} the Blue Team can sweep Week 7, or whether the other teams can prove they can do it on their own. The Red Line is also in play again this week, meaning the player on the losing team with the lowest {{percentage}} of weight loss will automatically be sent home. The Red Team is up first, and it's time to find out how they did without Dolvett. Rob steps on the scale and loses nine pounds. At 396 pounds, he's excited to say goodbye to the 400s and can't believe he weighed 501 when he first looked at the Biggest Loser website. Jordan and Scott both lose seven pounds, followed by Blake who loses five, and also falls into [...] "one"derland. The Red Team's total is 28 pounds, or 2.39% of their combined weight. The Blue Team <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> and needs to lose more than 20 pounds. Lori is up first and loses five pounds, followed by Jackie who loses a mere two. Once again, it's all up to Damien, who must lose more than 13 pounds to keep his team safe. Damien steps on the scale and loses five, meaning the Blue Team lost a total of 12 pounds, 1.42%. Jessie is upset and thinks he needs to reevaluate how he's training his team. The White Team is up last, and must lose more than 20 pounds, despite only having Jen for one day. JJ drops a solid seven, while Toma and Woody only lose four. Rondalee <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> and posts just two pounds, which means Sonya has to lose at least four to save her team. Sonya steps on the scale… and loses six pounds! She is elated {{to have been able to}} pull through for her team. Their grand total is 23 pounds, 1.62%. This means that despite their challenge win, the Blue Team has lost and must face the Red Line. Sadly, it's Jackie's time to leave the ranch, as she only lost 0.79% of her body weight. She is at peace with that, and is so proud to go home to be a role model to her two girls. Now the Blue Team is down to two players... what will happen to them next week? Since Matt first started the show, he now weighs at 272 lbs. and married his girlfriend at Adam's Canyon. He plans on getting the six-pack abs by the finale and plan his wedding.|$|E
50|$|Back at the ranch, it's {{time to see}} {{who will}} face off against Andrea next week. The Red Team is up first and has lost a {{collective}} 52 pounds (2.67%). Despite a rough week, Rob managed to lose 12 pounds, but doesn't {{see it as a}} victory. Dolvett does, however, and announces he'll celebrate for the both of them. The White Team <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>next,</b> and beats the Red Team by losing 57 pounds, 2.89% of their total body weight. But in the second underdog victory of the day, the Blue Team comes out on top by losing 44 pounds (2.90%). Jessie and his team are overjoyed that they proved the White Team wrong, and are relieved to not have to face elimination two weeks in a row. The Red Team is sent to the elimination room, where they choose to send home Emmy, {{based on the fact that}} she lost the lowest percentage of weight this week. Emmy is sent packing but is in for a surprise when she meets Bob and learns her journey is not over yet. After being at Comeback Canyon for 2 weeks, Vanessa now weighs 321 lbs. and plans on wearing her dream wedding dress at her wedding.|$|E
