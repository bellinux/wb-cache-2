500|$|National media {{attention}} inadvertently turned to Musial {{a month before}} the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine. Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players [...] "who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats". Cobb went on to refer to Musial as [...] "a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime." [...] In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, [...] "Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> as good as Joe DiMaggio." ...|$|E

He {{finished}} second in the NL with a [...]367 batting average, a [...]545 slugging percentage, 11 home runs, 59 extra-base hits, and 297 total bases. He also engaged in a fistfight with Lajoie that caused Lajoie to miss five weeks due to a broken thumb. The race for the batting title came down {{to the end of the}} season. The title winner, Honus Wagner, later said, [...] "I've had a lot of thrills, but don't think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> happier than in 1900 when I won after battling Elmer Flick to the last day of the season for the title." ...|$|E

Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws," [...] says Scott. [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there was no way <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> going to learn to surf – no way! Because I can imagine my legs, my little pinkies hanging underneath the surfboard and I know I'm going to be the one." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{wedding dress}} was a Vera Wang {{original}} dress from {{a while ago}} that I actually wore on a certain occasion and had it in storage and when {{we came up with}} the concept for the video that had the element of a wedding in it, I said, ‘well, I do have my old wedding dress,’. 'It’s still worth [...] for me ’cause I can’t believe <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> married but whatever, end of story. And I knew that we wouldn’t {{be able to get a}} fabulous dress like in two days so I just took that dress out of the storage – it has a 27-foot train and it was just all hand-beaded and stuff and so I figured we might as well get a use out of it.' ...|$|E
500|$|The Spanish {{government}} made Wellington commander-in-chief of all allied armies, providing an extra 21,000 Spanish troops after Salamanca. Although not completely undefeated {{he never lost}} a major battle. His greatest defeat came at the Siege of Burgos in 1812, where {{he had hoped to}} prevent French forces concentrating. After losing 2,000 men and causing only 600 French casualties he was forced to raise the siege and retreat, calling it [...] "the worst scrape <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> in." [...] Retiring to winter quarters, where he received reinforcements that brought his regular army up to 75,000 men, Wellington began his final offensive in June 1813. He advanced north, through the Pyrenees, and into France itself. The French were no longer fighting to keep Spain but to defend their own border.|$|E
500|$|Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim {{described}} von Neumann as the [...] "fastest mind I ever met", and Jacob Bronowski wrote [...] "He was the cleverest man I ever knew, without exception. He was a genius." [...] George Pólya, whose lectures at ETH Zürich von Neumann attended as a student, said [...] "Johnny was {{the only}} student <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> afraid of. If {{in the course of}} a lecture I stated an unsolved problem, the chances were he'd come to me at the end of the lecture with the complete solution scribbled on a slip of paper." [...] Eugene Wigner writes: [...] ""Jancsi," [...] I might say, [...] "Is angular momentum always an integer of h? He would return a day later with a decisive answer: [...] "Yes, if all particles are at rest."... We were all in awe of Jancsi von Neumann".|$|E

500|$|Some of {{the stories}} she wrote spoke of {{the wealth of the}} region being in its [...] "inevitable development", and she {{supplemented}} her income with $100 a week from writing copy advertisements that praised the development of South Florida, something she would reconsider later in her life. She wrote a ballad in the 1920s lamenting the death of a 22-year-old vagrant who was beaten to death in a labor camp, titled [...] "Martin Tabert of North Dakota is Walking Florida Now". It was printed in The Miami Herald, and read aloud during a session of the Florida Legislature, which passed a law banning convict leasing, in large part due to her writing. [...] "I think that's {{the single most important thing}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> able to accomplish as a result of something I've written", she wrote in her autobiography.|$|E
500|$|Butler devoted much of {{his second}} year to {{executing}} arrest warrants, cracking down on crooked police and enforcing prohibition. On January 1, 1926, his leave from the Marine Corps ended and the President declined {{a request for a}} second extension. Butler received orders to report to San Diego and he prepared his family and his belongings for the new assignment. In light of his pending departure, Butler began to defy the mayor and other key city officials. On the eve of his departure, he had an article printed in the paper stating his intention to stay and [...] "finish the job". The mayor was surprised and furious when he read the press release the next morning and demanded his resignation. After almost two years in office, Butler resigned under pressure, stating later that [...] "cleaning up Philadelphia was worse than any battle <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> in." ...|$|E
500|$|Early 20th-century biographer André Maurois {{argues that}} [...] "what Byron {{was capable of}} loving in another was {{a certain kind of}} innocence and youthfulness" [...] and that the {{relationship}} was one of Byron's [...] "protective passions". Likewise, G. Wilson Knight, in his 1953 biography of Byron, believes that Byron became protective over Giraud just as he did with all of the children he met during his travels. Giraud was special to Byron, and, according to Knight, [...] "it was probably of Nicolo that he was thinking when he wrote that Greece was 'the only place <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> contented in. In Byron: A Biography, published in 1957, Marchand points out that Byron [...] "wished Hobhouse there to share the nonsensical gaiety" [...] of when Byron and Giraud were together, but changed his mind after remembering that Hobhouse's personality would not be conducive to entertainment. Their time together [...] "was a relaxed pleasure that [...] was to remember more fondly than most of the adventures of his travels".|$|E

500|$|The British premiere at the 1988 Edinburgh Festival brought {{critical}} praise: [...] "Through its sheer cleverness, wit, lyrical {{beauty and}} sense of theater, it sweeps aside most of the criticism to which it lays itself open." [...] When the work was finally performed in London, 13 years after its Houston premiere and after {{a long period of}} theatrical neglect, Tempos critic Robert Stein responded to ENO's 2000 production enthusiastically. He particularly praised the performance of Maddalena, and concluded that [...] "Adams's triumph... consists really in taking a plot chock-full of talk and public gesture, and through musical characterisation... making a satisfying and engaging piece." [...] Of the ENO revival in 2006, Erica Jeal of The Guardian wrote that [...] "from its early visual coup {{with the arrival of the}} plane, Sellars' production is an all-too-welcome reminder of his best form". In Jeal's view, the cast met admirably the challenge of presenting the work in a non-satirical spirit. Reviewing the 2008 Portland Opera production (the basis of the 2011 Canadian Opera Company presentation in Toronto), critic Patrick J. Smith concluded that [...] "Nixon in China is a great American Opera. I suspected that it was a significant work when I saw it in 1987; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> more convinced of its stature when I heard it subsequently, on stage and on disc, and today I am certain that it is one of the small handful of operas that will survive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Members of the Frist {{family have}} been major donors to Princeton University, {{pledging}} a reported $25 million in 1997 {{for the construction}} of the Frist Campus Center. Frist has said that, a few years after his 1974 graduation from Princeton, [...] "I made a commitment to myself that if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> in a position to help pull together the resources to establish a center [...] where there could be an informal exchange of ideas, and to establish an environment that is conducive to the casual exchange of information, I would do so." [...] Daniel Golden, a Wall Street Journal journalist {{and author of the book}} The Price of Admission: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges — and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates, has suggested that two of Frist's sons (Harrison and Bryan) were admitted to Princeton as recognition of this donation rather than their own academic and extracurricular merit.|$|E
