500|$|Beginning {{with the}} periodical's 30th issue in 1979, Greenwood {{published}} {{a series of}} short articles that detailed the setting in The Dragon magazine, {{the first of which}} was about a monster known as the curst. Greenwood wrote voluminous entries to Dragon magazine, using the Realms as a setting for his descriptions of magic items, monsters, and spells. In 1986, the American game publishing company TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game, and assigned Jeff Grubb to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in Dragon. According to Greenwood, Grubb asked him [...] "Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?"; Greenwood answered [...] "yes" [...] to both questions. TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than the epic Dragonlance setting, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish AD 2nd Edition. Greenwood agreed to work on the project, and began working to get the Forgotten Realms officially published. Greenwood sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the Realms for a token fee. Greenwood noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that we could travel to from our world, [...] "Concerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to 'find a gate') led TSR to de-emphasize this meaning".|$|E
