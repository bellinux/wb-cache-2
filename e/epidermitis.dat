50|$|If the {{exposure}} to beta radiation is intense, the beta burns may first manifest in 24-48 hours by itching and/or burning sensation that last {{for one or two}} days, sometimes accompanied by hyperaemia. After 1-3 weeks burn symptoms appear; erythema, increased skin pigmentation (dark colored patches and raised areas), followed by epilation and skin lesions. Erythema occurs after 5-15 Gy, dry desquamation after 17 Gy, and bullous <b>epidermitis</b> after 72 Gy. Chronic radiation keratosis may develop after higher doses. Primary erythema lasting more than 72 hours is an indication of injury severe enough to cause chronic radiation dermatitis. Edema of dermal papillae, if present within 48 hours since the exposition, is followed by transepidermal necrosis. After higher doses, the malpighian layer cells die within 24 hours; lower doses may take 10-14 days to show dead cells.

The results showed that both virulent and avirulent strains were present simultaneously on diseased piglets. This constitutes a diagnostic problem. Concentrated culture supernatants from nine virulent strains injected in the skin of healthy piglets produced a crusting reaction in all piglets.

This study investigated the location of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the porcine desmoglein 1 gene (PIG) DSG 1 in correlation to the cleavage site as well as if the genotype of the SNPs is correlated to susceptibility or resistance to the disease. Results DNA from 32 affected and 32 unaffected piglets with exudative <b>epidermitis</b> were diagnosed clinically as affected or unaffected.

Serological evidence that these molecular species of toxins are distinct from each other is given. The molecular weights of SHET from plasmidless strain P- 1 (SHETA) and from plasmid-carrying strains P- 10 and P- 23 (SHETB) were almost equal. Both of the serotypes of SHET exhibited exfoliation in 1 -day-old chickens. The plasmid-cured (P−) substrains (P- 23 C 1 and P- 23 C 2) of S. hyicus P- 23 did not cause exfoliation in 1 -day-old chickens, whereas P− substrains (P- 10 C 1 and P- 10 C 2) of strain P- 10 caused exfoliation, but they decreased their exfoliative activity. These findings suggest that SHETB was synthesized along with SHETA by strain P- 10, whereas the P- 23 strain synthesized SHETB alone.

Records from all cases of IE in Iceland during this period were sampled. Vegetations were confirmed in all patients by echocardiography and in cases of culture negative IE the diagnosis was made on clinical grounds and on the response to antibiotic treatment. During this period eight children were diagnosed with IE. Five of these cases occurred in a cluster during a two months period last year (1993). Four patients had a known heart defect, three had a central venous catheter (CVC) and one patient had no factors known to predispose IE. The most common site of infection was the tricuspid valve seen in six cases, one in the aortic valve and one in the aortic arch. All patients survived without neurological sequel. A positive blood culture was obtained in six cases. The infective organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (three patients), Staphylococcus <b>epidermitis</b> (one patient), Streptococcus sanguis (one patient) and Candida albicans (one patient). The results show that the spectrum of IE in Icelandic children is similar to the changing spectrum elsewhere where infected CVC's are now responsible for relatively high proportion of the cases. This is most likely due to greater use of CVC's especially in neonatal intensive care units. A relatively few cases of typical IE, i. e. in children with an underlying heart lesion or following cardiac surgery, suggests effective prophylactic therapy and follow up.

The analysis of the results has made it possible to verify that out of the total of samples, 28 % did not meet the standards of potability established by the American Dental Association: Regarding the origin of analyzed S. aureus., the most contaminated sites were high-speed handpicces in private offices (761 %) and in, ental care plan offices (71 %), followed by air-water syringe in dental care plan offices (64 %). For S. <b>epidermitis</b> samples, the most contaminated sites were high-speed handpieces in SUS (Brazilian Government Health System) dental offices (22 %) and in dental care plan offices (14 %) The most contaminated sites were dental offices that saw Patients under dental care plans, Concerning tested antibiotics, the ones that presented better results as to sensibility to strain S. epidermidis were vancomycin and ciprofloxacin (100 %) and, as to sensibility to strain S. aureus, it was ciprofloxacin (97 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{randomized}} trial was to verify some experimental and clinical data suggesting a possible potentiating effect of bleomycin when used concomitantly with radiotherapy. Out of 220 patients with a biopsy proven epidermoid carcinoma of the oropharynx, 186 evaluable cases are reported here. One group of 87 patients was treated with radiotherapy alone (Cobalt 60 ∼ 6400 rad ∼ 7 - 8. 5 weeks), the other group of 99 patients received radiotherapy combined with bleomycin, the latter administered at the dose of 15 mg i. m. twice a week for 5 weeks (total dose: 150 mg). Analysis of the treatment groups showed their comparability {{with regard to the}} most important prognostic factors (TNM, sites of primary, sex, age.). Complication rates of mucositis and <b>epidermitis</b> were significantly increased (71 %) in the radiotherapy + bleomycin group and were considered responsible of frequent denutrition and weight loss in this group. Such side effects necessitated a delay of radiotherapy in 22 % of patients and definitive interruption in 5 % in the combined treatment group whereas in the radiotherapy alone group no interruption of treatment was recorded and only 5 treatments (6 %) were postponed. Considering tumor regressions measured 6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy, total regression rates were not significantly different in both groups as far as primary tumor (67. 9 - 67 %) or neck nodes (49 - 62 %) are concerned. Survival curves obtained by the actuarial method showed the same 50 % survival in both groups at 15 months of follow-up. © 1977. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Burn {{injury is}} one of the most health-threatening {{problems}} in the world. Malva sylvestris (M. sylvestris) flowershave a high mucilage content and are used as a remedy for cut wound and dermal infected wounds in Iranian folklore Medicine. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of M. sylvestris cream on the second degree burn injury in rats. Materials and Methods: Five groups of 10 rats per group were burned with hot metal plate. Animals were administrated divided as control, normal saline, standard silver sulfadiazine 1 % (SSD), 5 % M. sylvestris, and 10 % M. sylvestris into separate groups. Wound area, percentage of wound contraction, and histological and bacteriological assessments were evaluated. Results: Wound sizes were not significantly different among groups on 1 st and 3 rd days after burn injury, while they were significantly different among groups after 7 th day post-burn injury. The average areas of wounds on the 15 th day were 7. 5 ± 2. 9, 6. 7 ± 2, 10. 5 ± 1. 6, 4. 7 ± 2, and 4. 5 ± 2 cm 2 for base cream, normal saline, SSD, 5 % M. sylvestris, and 10 % M. sylvestris, respectively. The results of histology exhibited well-formed horizontally-oriented collagen fibers in MS topical treatment groups. Microorganisms existed in the SSD group were most probably Staphilococcus <b>epidermitis</b> and for NS group were staphylococcus saprophiteccus. Conclusion: M. sylvestris cream improved histological changes of tissue components in the process of healing when compared with SSD cream. Therefore, it can be used as a topical treatment agent for burn wound...|$|E
40|$|Porcine circoviruses type 1 {{and type}} 2 (PCV- 1 and PCV- 2) {{are very small}} (17 nm), nonenveloped, {{icosahedral}} viruses (Tisher y col., 1982), with circular, single stranded DNA genomes of approximately 1, 700 nucleotides length, encoding 2 major ambisense open reading frames (Mankertz y col., 1998; Hamel y col., 1998). Together {{with a number of}} avian viruses with similar molecular characteristics, the porcine circoviruses are classified in the genus Circovirus within the family Circoviridae. Although PCV- 1 persists in the pig population, the presence of PCV- 1 has not been associated with any recognised clinical signs or pathology. In contrast, PCV- 2 has been implicated as the mayor causative agent of Postweaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS). It is characterized mainly by loose of weight, general wasting, and severe immunosuppressive effects with premature death of piglets. PCV- 2 effects are generated by inhibition of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdc) so called natural interferon-Î± producing cells (NIPCs) unlinking the innate and acquired immune systems, and renderinga host susceptible to secondary or concomitant microbial infections. Therefore, PCV- 2 additionally is associated with other porcine diseases and syndromes, such as reproductive failure, respiratory disease complex, congenital tremor, porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, nectrotizing tracheitis and exudative <b>epidermitis,</b> together with other viral and bacterial agents, including Parvovirus, PRRSV (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus), Influenza, Aujeszky and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis and Pastereulla multocida. Nowadays, these diseases are known as PCVAD or PCV- 2 -associated diseases, in order to group all the diseases attributed to porcine circovirus type 2. The PCV- 2 -associated diseases, mainly PMWS, at present are considered to be the greatest economic problem associated with the pig industry world-wide...|$|E
40|$|Advances in the {{identification}} of infections and early diagnosis of Osteomyelitis have led to the improved management of Osteomyelitis. This study was undertaken to determine the bacteriological profile of Osteomyelitis and the antibiotic resistance pattern of various isolates obtained as it is an important cause of morbidity. A total of 50 patients of Osteomyelitis either attending the outpatient department or admitted in the wards of a teaching and tertiary care hospita l in Sikkim from October 2013 to October, 2014 were included in the study. All those patients who were clinically and/ or radiologically suspected of having Osteomyelitis were enrolled as cases. Pus/ pus swabs or sequestrum samples taken aseptically were c ultured aerobically at 37 0 C for 18 - 24 hours in Blood and Mac Conkey agar plates. Culture isolates were identified by a series of standard biochemical reactions. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested on Mueller Hinton agar by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion met hod. Betalactamase production of S. aureus strains were verified by iodometric filter paper and acidometric agar plate methods. S. aureus strains were screened for methicillin resistance by using conventional microbiological methods. S. aureus turned out t o be the most common organism isolated. Other organism isolated were P. Aeruginosa, Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., E. coli, Enterobacter spp., S. <b>epidermitis,</b> Streptococcus pyogens and Enterococcus spp. Beta - lactamase production and methicillin resistance was seen in S. aureus strains respectively. Multidrug resistance was observed in other strains. Infection caused by Methicillin resistant S. aureus and multidrug resistant organisms are posing a major challenge in the treatment of Osteomyelitis. So, appropriate drug selected by antibiotic sensitivity testing should be used to treat Osteomyeliti...|$|E
