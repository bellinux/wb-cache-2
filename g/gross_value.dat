5|$|The {{smallest}} geographical {{region for}} which <b>Gross</b> <b>Value</b> Added {{information is available}} is the NUTS3 area, Bournemouth and Poole. The latest figures, , are for the year 2009 which showed that the Bournemouth and Poole area enjoyed the strongest annualised growth in the South-West region. In 2009 the South West Regional Accounts showed that the Financial Services sector in Bournemouth was worth £1,031.8 million in <b>Gross</b> <b>Value</b> Added. Important employers in this sector include: JPMorgan, Nationwide Building Society, and the Liverpool Victoria, Tata Consultancy Services (formerly Unisys), and RIAS insurance companies. The manufacturing sector is predominantly based in neighbouring Poole, but still employed 2% of the workforce in 2010 and 2.6% in 2011.|$|E

The Plan regarded <b>gross</b> industrial output <b>value</b> accounting for 70% of the <b>gross</b> output <b>value</b> of industry and agriculture and means of production accounting for 60% of the <b>gross</b> industrial output <b>value</b> as indicators of industrial modernization, which ignored the development of agricultures in some sense.|$|R
40|$|Charcoal {{production}} {{stands out}} as a raw material {{for the production of}} renewable energy. To assess wood quality in energy terms, studies have focused more on the holocellulose and lignin content than on the role of extractives. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the relationship between the extractive content in cold water, in dichloromethane and total on energy properties of wood and charcoal, from six trees species. The extractives were removed with different solvents to be recorded and <b>gross</b> calorific <b>value</b> of wood was determined. The wood was carbonized at 1. 67 °C/min heating rate until maximum of 450 °C and residence time of 30 min. The extractive content was correlated with the gravimetric yield, apparent relative density, ash, volatile matter, fixed carbon and <b>gross</b> calorific <b>value</b> of charcoal. The removal of total extractives and extractives soluble in dichloromethane reduced the <b>gross</b> calorific <b>value</b> of wood of most species evaluated. The extractives removed in cold water did not correlate with the parameters of carbonization. The extractives content in dichloromethane correlated with volatile matter, fixed carbon and <b>gross</b> calorific <b>value.</b> Total extractive content correlated with gravimetric yield, apparent relative density and <b>gross</b> calorific <b>value</b> of charcoal...|$|R
5|$|In 2014, West Wales was {{identified}} as the worst-performing region in the United Kingdom along with the South Wales Valleys. The <b>gross</b> <b>value</b> added economic indicator showed a figure of £14,763 per head in these regions, as compared with a GVA of £22,986 for Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. The Welsh Assembly Government is aware of this, and helped by government initiatives and local actions, opportunities for farmers to diversify have emerged. These include farm tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and added-value food products.|$|E

5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Industrial Revolution, {{development}} of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales, mainly in and around Cardiff (the capital), Swansea and Newport, and in the nearby valleys. Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, Wales' economy depends on the public sector, light and service industries and tourism. Wales' 2010 <b>gross</b> <b>value</b> added (GVA) was £45.5 billion (£15,145 per head, 74.0% of the average for the UK, and the lowest GVA per head in Britain).|$|E

The creative industry workforce is 3.1% of total employment in the European Union (EU), which creates a revenue that is 2.6% of the EU <b>gross</b> <b>value.</b> Creative industries have attained an unprecedented average annual growth rate of 8.7 per cent across the EU between 2000 and 2005.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the last}} 250 years, Wales has been {{transformed}} first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and now a post-industrial economy.

Total headline <b>Gross</b> <b>Value</b> Added (GVA) in Wales in 2010 was £45.5 billion, or £15,145 per head of population; 74.0 per cent of the average for the UK total, the lowest GVA per head in the UK.

30|$|In this study, an {{investigation}} {{on the effects}} of compaction pressure, drying temperature and binder ratio on briquette combustion and physical properties was done. Mathematical models for predicting <b>gross</b> calorific <b>value,</b> ash content, relaxed density, moisture content and shatter index as function of input factors were determined. It was established that molasses mass fraction had predominant effects on all properties investigated. As molasses amount were increased, ash content, moisture content, relaxed density and shatter index were significantly increased while fixed carbon and <b>gross</b> calorific <b>value</b> were significantly reduced. Drying temperature did not have major influence on shatter index, relaxed density, ash content and <b>gross</b> calorific <b>value.</b> However, drying temperature had a dominating influence on the moisture content. Compaction pressure had negligible influences on all briquette properties. Therefore, such high pressure which involves energy consumption is not necessary during production of charcoal dust briquettes. Optimized <b>values</b> of <b>gross</b> calorific <b>value</b> and shatter index were established as 29.031  MJ/kg and 80.363 %, respectively, for 50  MPa compaction pressure, 29.512  °C drying temperature and 10 % molasses mass ratio.|$|R

The unemployment rate in Northern England is 5.3% compared to an England-wide and UK-wide average of 4.8%, and the North East has the highest unemployment rate in the UK, at 7.0% as of December 2016, more than one percentage point higher than any other region. As of 2015, the <b>gross</b> <b>value</b> added (GVA) of the Northern English economy was £316 billion, and if it were an independent nation, it would be the tenth largest economy in Europe.

It {{has been observed}} {{that there has been}} a slow but steady decline in the percentage share of industry and agriculture over the years. Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane, and wheat are the top five crops of the state. Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high quality teas. State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and the Haldia port region. The Durgapur–Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of major steel plants. Important manufacturing industries are engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches, and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals, and fertilisers. Natural resources like tea and jute in and nearby parts has made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.|$|E

This study aims to forecast the demand for qualified quantity surveyors in Hong Kong from 2013 to 2015. Literature review indicates that the demand for quantity surveyors {{is a function of the}} <b>gross</b> <b>values</b> of building, civil engineering and maintenance works. The proposed forecasting method consists of two steps. The first step is to estimate the <b>gross</b> <b>values</b> of building, civil engineering and maintenance works by time series methods and the second step is to forecast the manpower demand for quantity surveyors by causal methods. The data for quantity surveyors and construction outputs are based on the ‘manpower survey reports of the building and civil engineering industry’ and the ‘gross value of construction works performed by main contractors’ respectively. The forecasted manpower demand for quantity surveyors in 2013, 2014 and 2015 are 2, 480, 2, 632 and 2, 804 respectively. Due to the low passing rate of the assessment of professional competence (APC) and the increasing number of retired qualified members, there will be a serious shortage of qualified quantity surveyors in the coming three years. </p...|$|R
