5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its <b>inducibility.</b> With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E

50|$|CYP1A1 is {{the enzyme}} {{responsible}} for the metabolic activation of PAHs. Persons {{with a high degree}} of CYP1A1 <b>inducibility</b> (phase I metabolism) are more susceptible to health risks caused by exposure to PAHs. The metabolites are epoxides which are carcinogenic/mutagenic. The genetic variation in the degree of CYP1A1 <b>inducibility</b> could be a determining factor for susceptibility to many cancers, including lung and laryngeal cancer.Another genetic factor that could increase the risk of cancer is a deficiency in the glutathione transferase (phase II metabolism), which is inheritable. Deficiencies of CYP1A1 and glutathione transferase do not only increase the risk of cancers induced by exposure to PAHs, but also increases the risk of other cancers.|$|E

50|$|BALT {{is similar}} in most mammal species, but it differs in its {{maintenance}} and <b>inducibility.</b> While it is normal component of lungs and bronchus in rabbits or pigs, in mice or humans it appears only after infection or inflammation. In mice and humans it is thus called inducible BALT (iBALT). BALT and iBALT are structurally and functionally very similar, so {{in this article is}} used only BALT for both structures.|$|E
50|$|The developmentally {{active and}} heat shock {{inducible}} hsromega or hsrω gene in Drosophila produces multiple long non-coding RNA transcripts. This gene is transcriptionally active {{in almost all}} cell types of Drosophila and is the most actively induced following heat shock. A unique feature of the hsromega gene, which led to discovery of the 93D puff in 1970, is its singular <b>inducibility</b> with benzamide {{and a variety of}} other amides.|$|E
50|$|Positive {{interdependence}} {{can also}} be understood by its effects on the psychological processes of learners in a group setting. It promotes substitutability (the degree to which actions of one group member substitutes {{for the actions of}} another), positive cathexis (investment of positive psychological energy in objects outside one's self), and <b>inducibility</b> (openness to influencing and being influenced by others), whereas Negative Interdependence creates nonsubstituability, negative cathexis and a resistance to being influenced by others.|$|E

50|$|The <b>inducibility</b> of the CRABP2 gene {{suggests}} that this isoform is important in retinoic acid-mediated regulation of human skin growth, differentiation and development. CRABP2 {{is involved in the}} metabolism and transportation of retinoic acid from the cytosol to the RARs (retinoic acid receptors) located in the nucleus. CRABP2 is specifically co-expressed with RAR-β and cellular retinol binding protein 1 genes in certain tissues. It has been postulated that the CRABP2 gene is transcriptionally regulated by a newly synthesized regulatory protein.|$|E
50|$|Chrysosporium keratinophilum {{produces}} a thermostable, keratinolytic alkaline protease when grown in medium containing keratin. When grown {{in a medium}} that lacked keratin, it had no enzymatic function indicating the <b>inducibility</b> of the enzyme. The keratinolytic protease had maximum activity at pH 9.0 and a temperature maximum of 90 °C, whereas many other fungi, such as T. mentagraphytes, Microsporum gypseum, T. rubrum, had maximum activity below pH 9.0. Alkaline proteolytic keratinases are important for leather tanning as a ready means of removing hair from hides.|$|E

The same three letters are typically used (lower-case, italicized) to label the genes involved in a particular phenotype, where each different gene is additionally distinguished by an extra letter. The lac genes encoding enzymes are lacZ, lacY, and lacA. The fourth lac gene is lacI, encoding the lactose repressor - [...] "I" [...] stands for <b>inducibility.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This led to {{the major}} {{theoretical}} contribution Deutsch made during his early career; the [...] "Theory of Cooperation and Competition", which studies interdependence among goals (cooperative versus competitive) and types of actions taken (effective versus bungling). The study uses three concepts to develop their implications for the social processes and personal relations that occur in groups: substitutability (how a person's actions are able to satisfy the intentions of another), cathexis (an individual's disposition to evaluate themselves or their surroundings), and <b>inducibility</b> (the readiness of an individual to accept the influence of another person). The theory was first presented in a paper published in 1949.|$|E

50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{is a member}} of the dual {{specificity}} protein phosphatase subfamily. These phosphatases inactivate their target kinases by dephosphorylating both the phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine residues. They negatively regulate members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase superfamily (MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, p38), which are associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation. Different members of the family of dual specificity phosphatases show distinct substrate specificities for various MAP kinases, different tissue distribution and subcellular localization, and different modes of <b>inducibility</b> of their expression by extracellular stimuli. This gene product inactivates ERK1/2, is expressed in a variety of tissues with the highest levels in pancreas and brain, and is localized in the nucleus.|$|E
50|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} (MHC) class II molecules are transmembrane {{proteins that}} have {{a central role in}} development and control of the immune system. The protein encoded by this gene, along with regulatory factor X-associated protein and regulatory factor-5, forms a complex that binds to the X box motif of certain MHC class II gene promoters and activates their transcription. Once bound to the promoter, this complex associates with the non-DNA-binding factor MHC class II transactivator, which controls the cell type specificity and <b>inducibility</b> of MHC class II gene expression. This protein contains ankyrin repeats involved in protein-protein interactions. Mutations in this gene have been linked to bare lymphocyte syndrome type II, complementation group B. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene, with only one isoform showing activation activity.|$|E

5000|$|When plants {{continuously}} {{release a}} baseline level of volatiles, these defenses {{are said to}} be constitutive. Upon an instance of herbivory, however, the plant may respond by considerably increasing its production of volatiles or by producing a new profile of volatiles. This plasticity is controlled by either the jasmonic acid pathway or the salicylic acid pathway, depending largely on the herbivore; these substances are often called herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Though volatiles of any kind have an attractive effect on natural enemies, this effect is stronger for damaged plants than for undamaged plants, perhaps because induced volatiles signal definitive and recent herbivore activity. The phenomenon of <b>inducibility</b> gives rise to the idea that plants are sending out a [...] "distress call" [...] to the third trophic level in times of herbivore attack.|$|E

Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Upregulation of MKP-3 has been shown to alleviate chronic postoperative pain.|$|E
50|$|The Tet {{system has}} {{advantages}} over Cre, FRT, and ER (estrogen receptor) conditional gene expression systems. In the Cre and FRT systems, activation or knockout {{of the gene}} is irreversible once recombination is accomplished, whereas, in Tet and ER systems, it is reversible. The Tet system has very tight control on expression, whereas ER system is somewhat leaky. However, the Tet system, which depends on transcription and subsequent translation of a target gene, is not as fast-acting as the ER system, which stabilizes the already-expressed target protein upon hormone administration. Also, since the 19bp tet-o sequence is naturally absent from mammalian cells, pleiotropy {{is thought to be}} minimized compared to hormonal methods of control. When using the Tet system in cell culture, it is important to confirm that each batch of fetal bovine serum is tested to confirm that contaminating tetracyclines are absent or are too low to interfere with <b>inducibility.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pelham was knighted by Elizabeth II in the 2011 Birthday Honours {{and elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1988. His {{certificate}} of election reads: [...] Distinguished for {{his contributions to}} protein biosynthesis, the control of gene activity and intracellular sorting. He developed a sensitive in vitro translation system, with which he discovered that naturally [...] "leaky" [...] termination codons exist in plant virus RNAs, and achieved the first correct synthesis and processing of viral polyproteins in vitro. He showed that the transcription factor TFIIIA, which is required in Xenopus oocytes for 5S rDNA transcription, binds to the gene product, %S RNA and is present in large amounts in oocytes. From studies on heat shock genes, he identified the first regulatory DNA sequence (the [...] "Pelham" [...] box) in a eukaryotic gene, proving this alone could confer heat <b>inducibility</b> on another gene. He has shown that this sequence is the binding site for a transcription factor which is modified by heat shock, thus establishing the basic mechanism of induction of these genes. He has clarified the function of heat shock proteins, finding that two of these reside in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. This led to his discovery that a C-terminal amino acid sequence is a novel sorting signal, preventing proteins from being exported from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E

40|$|In a {{consecutive}} {{series of}} 53 cases of oral leucoplakia, smoking history, oro-dental status and arylhydrocarbon-hydroxylase (AHH) <b>inducibility</b> were assessed. There was an increased association of leucoplakia with smoking, {{particularly in the}} male cases, but no remarkable findings as to dental status. Overall, there was a slightly higher frequency of cases with high AHH <b>inducibility</b> than expected from a normal control population. This difference was confined to the smokers, {{where there was a}} statistically highly significant over-representation of high AHH <b>inducibility</b> and under-representation of low AHH <b>inducibility.</b> The figures in the non-smoking patients were close to the expected...|$|E
40|$|To {{test the}} {{validity}} of previous results the <b>inducibility</b> of amylase {{as well as other}} biochemical parameters was measured using 45 homozygous strains of Drosophila melanogaster from Akayu, Japan. Only the <b>inducibility</b> (but not protein contents or specific activity of the enzyme) was highly correlated with productivity measured using a starch food regime (rp = 0. 41, P < 0. 005, rg = 0. 73 ± 0. 21). <b>Inducibility</b> was also negatively correlated with developmental time using starch food; namely, the one with high <b>inducibility</b> developed the fastest. Population cage experiments using 1600 genomes from the same natural population showed that the <b>inducibility</b> responded positively to natural selection (1. 6 -fold increase in <b>inducibility</b> in cages using starch food relative to those using normal food), but little frequency change of allozymes was observed. All of these results were consistent and indicated that polymorphisms of inducing factors or regulatory genes were major determinants of fitness differences in a particular environment and may be the genetic materials responsible for the adaptive evolution of organisms, at least in amylase loci...|$|E
40|$|A {{crossover}} {{comparison of}} intravenous procainamide, disopyramide and quinidine {{was made in}} 32 patients. All three drugs had dosage-related effects on electrocardiographic intervals, refractory periods and cycle length of ventricular tachycardia. Significant linear relations between serum drug levels and changes in refractory periods and ventricular tachycardia cycle length were also observed. Ventricular tachycardia was no longer inducible {{on at least one}} drug in 11 patients but concordance of this effect on both of the others was 36 % and on either of the others it was 45 %. Ventricular tachycardia remained inducible on at least one drug in 28 patients and concordance of this effect on both of the others was 75 % and on either of the others was 79 %. Continued <b>inducibility</b> on quinidine, the drug producing the greatest electrophysiologic effects, was the best individual predictor of continued <b>inducibility</b> on the others. Subdivision of continued <b>inducibility</b> into 1) easier to induce, 2) <b>inducibility</b> unchanged, or 3) harder to induce dramatically decreased concordance of this effect. Thus the antiarrhythmic effects of these drugs are discordant in individual patients despite electrophysiologic similarities. Nevertheless, continued <b>inducibility</b> after high dosages of any one of these drugs is clinically useful for screening for continued <b>inducibility</b> on the others and this is dose-related rather than drug specific...|$|E

40|$|The auxin-responsive soybean GH 3 gene {{promoter}} {{is composed of}} multiple auxin response elements (AuxREs), and each AuxRE contributes incrementally to the strong auxin <b>inducibility</b> of the promoter. Two independent AuxREs of 25 bp (Dl) and 32 bp (D 4) contain the sequence TGTCTC. Results presented here show that the TGTCTC element in D 1 and D 4 is required but not sufficient for auxin <b>inducibility</b> in carrot protoplast transient expression assays. Additional nucleotides upstream of TGTCTC are also required for auxin <b>inducibility.</b> These upstream sequences showed constitutive activity and no auxin <b>inducibility</b> when part {{or all of the}} TGTCTC element was mutated or deleted. In D 1, the constitutive element overlaps the 5 ‘ portion of TGTCTC; in D 4, the constitutive element is separated from TGTCTC. An 11 -bp element in D 1, CCTCGTGTCTC, conferred auxin <b>inducibility</b> to a minimal cauliflower mosaic virus 35 s promoter in transgenic tobacco seedlings as well as in carrot protoplasts (i. e., transient expression assays). 60 th constitutive elements bound specifically to plant nuclear proteins, and the constitutive element in D 1 bound to a recombinant soybean basic leucine zipper transcription factor with G-box specificity. To demonstrate further the composite nature of AuxREs and the ability of the TGTCTC element to confer auxin <b>inducibility,</b> we created a novel AuxRE by placing a yeast GAL 4 DNA binding site adjacent to the TGTCTC element. Expression of a GAL 4 -c-Rel transactivator in the presence of this novel AuxRE resulted in auxin-inducible expression. Our results indicate that at least some AuxREs have a composite structure consisting of a constitutive element adjacent to a conserved TGTCTC element that confers auxin <b>inducibility...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of alanine aminotransferase (EC 2. 6. 1. 2), an enzyme that is inducible in the liver, has been examined in somatic hybrid cells formed by crossing well-differentiated rat hepatoma cells with rat diploid epithelial cells, the former characterized by high activity and <b>inducibility</b> of the enzyme, {{and the latter}} {{by the absence of}} detectable activity. The hybrid cells that contain essentially complete chromosomal sets of the two parents show only very low activity and little <b>inducibility.</b> Among numerous “segregated” hybrid subclones, which have lost up to 40 % of the chromosomes initially present, several show {{expression of}} intermediate levels of enzyme activity and very little <b>inducibility,</b> and two independent subclones are characterized by full re-expression of both baseline and inducible enzyme activity. The electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme from the latter hybrids, from the hepatoma parental cells, and from rat liver is identical. The absence of a correlation between total chromosome number of the hybrid cells and re-expression of alanine aminotransferase suggests that the loss of specific chromosomes is required for re-expression. In these hybrid cells, the re-expression of alanine aminotransferase baseline and <b>inducibility</b> is independent of that of tyrosine aminotransferase <b>inducibility...</b>|$|E
40|$|Transient {{expression}} of IFN-γ and IL- 2 mRNA and its control by post-transcriptional and suppressive mechanisms were analysed in phytohaemagglutinin-induced {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) from 47 patients with SLE and 31 age-matched normal donors, using quantitative hybridization with antisense RNA probes. In SLE, basal levels of gene expression did not deviate {{from those of}} normal donors, but strongly aberrant patterns were obtained upon induction. The ratio of subjects exhibiting highly inducible IFN-γ gene expression in their PBMC to those showing moderate or low <b>inducibility</b> was increased five-fold in SLE (P = 0. 003). High <b>inducibility</b> was observed for 43 % of SLE patients and was equally pronounced in partial remission, mild or active disease. <b>Inducibility</b> of IL- 2 mRNA, by contrast, remained similar to that for normal donors. However, regulation of IFN-γ gene expression differed for mild SLE. Patients with mild disease showing high <b>inducibility</b> of IFN-γ mRNA in their PBMC not only had the highest frequency of responders, but also the highest extent of an individual response, defined by superinduction of mRNA, to agents that relieve suppression (γ-irradiation) or post-transcriptional down-regulation (cycloheximide). By contrast, patients with active SLE showing high IFN-γ mRNA <b>inducibility</b> had normal suppressive capacity as well as post-transcriptional control. Hence, both high <b>inducibility</b> of the IFN-γ gene and its suppression are relevant to disease. Hyperactivation of the IFN-γ gene may be alleviated in mild SLE by a vigorous, concomitant activation of post-transcriptional control and of cell-mediated suppression...|$|E

On the contrary, class I induction of both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes occurs {{as a consequence}} of normal cultivation procedures in both susceptible and resistant strains. Increased expression of class I antigens on rat astrocytes and oligodendrocytes is not related to JHM viral infection {{as it is in the}} mouse. These data indicate that strain differences in Ia <b>inducibility,</b> rather than <b>inducibility</b> of class I antigens, by JHM virus may explain higher levels of T cell-mediated damage to myelin during infection in susceptible rat strains compared with resistant strains...|$|E
40|$|Inducibility" of amylase in Drosophila melanogaster {{was defined}} and {{investigated}} {{in a natural}} population from Japan. <b>Inducibility</b> represents the effects of factors remote from the structural gene that control the amount of enzyme produced. <b>Inducibility</b> of an isogenic line is measured as {{the ratio of the}} enzyme's specific activity in two different inducing environments. There was considerable genetic variability with respect to <b>inducibility</b> of amylase in 44 isogenic lines derived from a natural population of D. melanogaster. Net fitness and its components in these isogenic lines were also measured. The results indicated that, although the <b>inducibility</b> of the enzyme was positively correlated with the net fitness (rg = 0. 63 ± 0. 2), the enzyme activities in the normal medium were not (rg = 0. 12 ± 0. 37). The analysis of the data shows that the differences in inducing factors are mainly responsible for the differences in the fitness of lines and are the genetic materials for the adaptive evolution of organisms...|$|E
