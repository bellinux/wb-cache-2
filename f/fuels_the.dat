5|$|Beginning {{with the}} surge in coal use which {{accompanied}} the Industrial Revolution, energy consumption has steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil <b>fuels.</b> <b>The</b> early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20thcentury {{in the face of}} the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and petroleum.|$|E
25|$|The inverse is {{also true}} when the {{aircraft}} is in inverted flight. The float becomes submerged as <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> is pulled downward by gravity {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl. <b>The</b> float lifts upward toward the bottom of <b>the</b> inverted <b>fuel</b> bowl. With <b>the</b> float at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> inlet valve opens, as it would when there is not enough <b>fuel</b> in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl. With <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> inlet valve open, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> pump continues pumping <b>fuel</b> into <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl, where <b>the</b> resulting excess <b>fuel</b> causes <b>the</b> fuel-air ratio to become lower than nine to one, which is then too rich for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|R

5|$|Biofuel {{emphasis}} in Germany is on biodiesel, and no specific incentives {{have been granted}} for E85 flex-fuel cars, however there is complete exemption of taxes on all biofuels {{while there is a}} normal tax of €0.65 per liter of petroleum <b>fuels.</b> <b>The</b> distribution of E85 began in 2005, and with 219 stations as of September 2008, Germany ranks second after Sweden with the most E85 fueling stations in the EU.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium–uranium–titanium and plutonium–uranium–zirconium were {{investigated}} {{for use as}} nuclear <b>fuels.</b> <b>The</b> addition of the third element increases corrosion resistance, reduces flammability, and improves ductility, fabricability, strength, and thermal expansion. Plutonium–uranium–molybdenum has the best corrosion resistance, forming a protective film of oxides, but titanium and zirconium are preferred for physics reasons.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, {{and with}} some exceptions, lithophile heavy metals can be {{extracted}} from their ores by electrical or chemical treatments, while chalcophile heavy metals are obtained by roasting their sulphide ores to yield the corresponding oxides, and then heating these to obtain the raw metals. Radium occurs in quantities {{too small to be}} economically mined and is instead obtained from spent nuclear <b>fuels.</b> <b>The</b> chalcophile platinum group metals (PGM) mainly occur in small (mixed) quantities with other chalcophile ores. The ores involved need to be smelted, roasted, and then leached with sulfuric acid to produce a residue of PGM. This is chemically refined to obtain the individual metals in their pure forms. Compared to other metals, PGM are expensive due to their scarcity and high production costs.|$|E

50|$|Fuel is transported from <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> tank (via fuel lines) and {{pressurised}} using <b>fuel</b> pump(s). Maintaining <b>the</b> correct <b>fuel</b> {{pressure is}} done by a fuel pressure regulator.

5|$|Ecosystems are {{regularly}} confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances {{over time and}} geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity <b>fuels</b> <b>the</b> resilience of ecosystems acting {{as a kind of}} regenerative insurance.|$|E
5|$|However, {{soon after}} the {{encounter}} with Cardinal Draclau, Ramza discovers that an elaborate plot was set by the Murond Glabados Church. In their desire to control Ivalice, the Church, particularly the High Priest, Marge Funeral, uses {{the legend of the}} so-called holy Zodiac Braves to gather the Zodiac Stones, and <b>fuels</b> <b>the</b> Lion War between Larg and Goltana. To stave off Ramza's interference, Draclau uses the stone to transform into a legendary Lucavi demon, and Ramza {{has no choice but to}} slay him/it. As a result, Ramza is regarded a heretic of the Church, and he is approached by the Heretic Examiner Zalmo at Lesalia Imperial Capital.|$|E

This study focuses on the variation of the mass burning rate of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> with varying initial temperatures of <b>the</b> <b>fuel,</b> which is kept in a metal bowl surrounded by ice. Kerosene is chosen as <b>the</b> <b>fuel.</b> <b>The</b> bowl diameters have been varied from 30 mm to around 50 mm. <b>The</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl is kept surrounded in an ice bath and is ignited after it attains a particular temperature.

The results show that with increase in the initial temperature of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>the</b> mass burning rate also increases. The mass burning rate also increases as <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl diameter increases. The surface temperature of <b>the</b> <b>fuel,</b> just after quenching, increases with an increase in the initial temperature of <b>the</b> <b>fuel.</b> <b>The</b> ignition time of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> is reduced with increase in initial temperature of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> and with increase in bowl diameter.
