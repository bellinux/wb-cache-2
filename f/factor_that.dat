5|$|Another <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> fishers select for are forest floors {{that have}} {{large amounts of}} coarse woody debris. In western forests, where fire {{regularly}} removes understorey debris, fishers show a preference for riparian woodland habitat. Fishers tend to avoid areas with deep snow.

5|$|Larvae pupate 5 to 10cm {{below the}} soil surface. Pupae are brown in color; they measure 5.5mm wide and 17 to 22mm long. The biggest {{environmental}} <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> affects the pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality {{is high in}} wet soil, where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent. Dehydration {{can also lead to}} high death rates among pupae, if soil moisture is as low as 1 to 2 percent.|$|E

50|$|A {{preliminary}} {{sketch of}} {{the architecture of the}} network of human transcription <b>factors,</b> <b>that</b> is, <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> bind to DNA in order to promote or inhibit the expression of genes. The network was found to be quite complex, with <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> operate at different levels as well as numerous feedback loops of various types.|$|R
25|$|Many {{periodically}} expressed {{genes are}} driven by transcription <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> are also periodically expressed. One screen of single-gene knockouts identified 48 transcription factors (about 20% of all non-essential transcription <b>factors)</b> <b>that</b> show cell cycle progression defects. Genome-wide studies using high throughput technologies have identified the transcription <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> bind to the promoters of yeast genes, and correlating these findings with temporal expression patterns have allowed the identification of transcription <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> drive phase-specific gene expression. The expression profiles of these transcription factors {{are driven by}} the transcription <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> peak in the prior phase, and computational models have shown that a CDK-autonomous network of these transcription factors is sufficient to produce steady-state oscillations in gene expression).|$|R

An August 2010 poll showed that 70 percent of the country supports NATO membership, but results were very different in the two constituent entities.

5|$|A thread common {{throughout}} {{these early}} works is Monteverdi's {{use of the}} technique of imitatio, a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work.

5|$|Another <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> helped Tchaikovsky's music {{become popular}} was {{a shift in}} {{attitude}} among Russian audiences. Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself. Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity.|$|E

5|$|In 1495 the Italian Renaissance {{arrived in}} France, {{imported}} by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> promoted {{the spread of}} secularism was {{the inability of the}} Church to offer assistance against the Black Death. Francis I imported Italian art and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as FranÃ§ois Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as Jean Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also borrowed from the spirit of the Renaissance.|$|E
