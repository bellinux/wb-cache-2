25|$|The LB {{was formed}} {{at the same}} time as the {{bursting}} of the railway mania investment bubble, and so it found raising capital for expansion extremely difficult during the first years of its operation, other than to complete those projects that were already in hand. The L had experienced difficult relations with the SER where the companies shared facilities, notably Redhill and Hastings and on the approaches to London Bridge) In October 1849 the SER acquired the new Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway (RG) line, which the LB regarded as a major incursion into its territory. However, the LB had one important playing card not available to the L – control of the SER main line between New Cross and Croydon. In 1849 the LB appointed a new and capable chairman, Samuel Laing, who negotiated a formal agreement with the SER that would resolve their difficulties for the time being and would define the territories of the two railways. Under this agreement the LB would have free access to London Bridge, Bricklayers' Arms station and goods yard, and Hastings. The SER would have free use of the New Cross to Croydon line, and receive revenues from passengers at intermediate stations, but would not make or work competing lines to Brighton, Horsham, Chichester or Portsmouth. Laing also approved a modest <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>expansion,</b> most notably the acquisition of a branch line from the main line at Three Bridges to the market town of East Grinstead in July 1855.|$|E

BackgroundThe most important predictor of adverse outcomes (thrombosis and restenosis) after stent implantation with IVUS guidance is the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> stent <b>expansion</b> achieved. MethodsWe compared the relative <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> stent <b>expansion</b> (defined as the minimal stent area divided by {{the mean of the}} proximal and distal reference lumen areas) after OCT-guided stenting in patients in the ILUMIEN (Observational Study of Optical Coherence Tomography [OCT] in Patients Undergoing Fractional Flow Reserve [FFR] and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) (N = 354) and IVUS-guided stenting in patients in the ADAPT-DES (Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents) study (N = 586). Stent expansion was examined in all 940 patients in a covariate-adjusted analysis as well as in 286 propensity-matched pairs (total N = 572). ResultsIn the matched-pair analysis, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> stent <b>expansion</b> was not significantly different between OCT and IVUS guidance (median [first, third quartiles] = 72. 8 % [63. 3, 81. 3] vs. 70. 6 % [62. 3, 78. 8], respectively, p = 0. 29). Similarly, after adjustment for baseline differences in the entire population, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> stent <b>expansion</b> was also not different between the 2 imaging modalities (p = 0. 84). Although a higher prevalence of post-PCI stent malapposition, tissue protrusion, and edge dissections was detected by OCT, the rates of major malapposition, tissue protrusion, and dissections were similar after OCT- and IVUS-guided stenting. ConclusionsIn the present post-hoc analysis of 2 prospective studies, OCT and IVUS guidance resulted in a comparable <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> stent <b>expansion.</b> Randomized trials are warranted to compare the outcomes of OCT- and IVUS-guided coronary stent implantation...|$|R

That Steel is a substance made out of Iron, by means of a certain proportionate Vitrification of several parts, which are so curiously and proportionately mixt with the more tough and unalter'd parts of the Iron, that when by the great heat of the fire this vitrify'd substance is melted, and consequently rarify'd, and thereby the pores of the Iron are more open, if then by means of dipping it in cold water it be suddenly cold, and the parts hardned, that is, stay'd in that same <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>Expansion</b> they were in when hot, the parts become very hard and brittle, and that upon the same account almost as small parcels of glass quenched in water grow brittle, which we have already explicated. If after this the piece of Steel be held in some convenient heat, till by degrees certain colours appear up{{on the surface of the}} brightned metal, the very hard and brittle tone of the metal, by degrees relaxes and becomes much more tough and soft; namely, the action of the heat does by degrees loosen the parts of the Steel that were before streached or set atilt as it were, and stayed open by each other, whereby they become relaxed and set at liberty, whence some of the more brittle interjacent parts are thrust out and melted into a thin skin on the surface of the Steel, which from no colour increases to a deep Purple, and so onward by these gradations or consecutions, White, Yellow, Orange, Minium, Scarlet, Purple, Blew, Watchet, &c. and the parts within are more conveniently, and proportionately mixt; and so they gradually subside into a texture which is much better proportion'd and closer joyn'd, whence that rigidnesse of parts ceases, and the parts begin to acquire their former ductilness.|$|E
