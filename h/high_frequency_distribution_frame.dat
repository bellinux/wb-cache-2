The used signal is <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> and {{in the range of}} 1 to 30 MHz. For PLC applications, this paper presents the modeling of the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> network that includes overhead or underground cables and the MV/LV transformer by ATP/EMTP software. Impacts of several factors on the PLC attenuation such as frequency and line length are investigated. A method, that permits to evaluate the influence of 50 Hz power signal on the attenuation of PLC transmission, is proposed as well.

40|$|The multifractal {{analysis}} of binary images of DNA is studied {{in order to}} define a methodological approach to the classification of DNA sequences. This method {{is based on the}} computation of some multifractality parameters on a suitable binary image of DNA, which takes into account the nucleotide distribution. The binary image of DNA is obtained by a dot-plot (recurrence plot) of the indicator matrix. The fractal geometry of these images is characterized by fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity, and succolarity. These parameters are compared with some other coefficients such as complexity and Shannon information entropy. It will be shown that the complexity parameters are more or less equivalent to FD, while the parameters of multifractality have different values in the sense that sequences with higher FD might have lower lacunarity and/or succolarity. In particular, the genome of Drosophila melanogaster has been considered by focusing on the chromosome 3 r, which shows the highest fractality with a corresponding higher level of complexity. We will single out some results on the nucleotide distribution in 3 r with respect to complexity and fractality. In particular, we will show that sequences with higher FD also have a <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> of guanine, while low FD is characterized by the higher presence of adenine...|$|R

Study Design: Fifty human teeth were used. In each tooth two standardized Class II slot cavities (on mesial and on distal surfaces) were prepared: the buccolingual extension of the cavities was 4 mm; the gingival wall was located in dentin/cementum (2 mm beyond the CEJ). The prepared teeth {{were randomly assigned to}} 5 experimental groups (of 10 specimens and 20 cavities each) and restored. Group 1 : Filtek TM Supreme XTE Flowable (3 MESPE) + Universal Filtek Supreme XTE (3 MESPE), Group 2 : GrandioSO Heavy Flow (Voco) + GrandioSo (Voco), Group 3 : SDRTm (Dentsply Caulk) + Esthet-X® HD (Dentsply Caulk), Group 4 : SonicFill (Kerr), Group 5 : Grandio (Voco). After thermocycling, the specimens were immersed in a 0. 5 % basic fuchsine dye solution and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. The teeth were subsequently sectioned mesiodistally. All specimens were examined at 25 × in a stereomicroscope and standardized digital images were obtained. Dye penetration was measured from gingival margins.

40|$|Purpose To characterise the {{therapeutic}} profile of orphan medicines. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional study was performed during 2 {{months in a}} convenience sample of seven hospital pharmacy services, in the region of Lisbon. Data were collected, from pharmaceutical service's records. Results A total of 18 orphan medicines, were dispensed to 355 patients with rare diseases. Most patients were adults (76. 4 %). Premature and neonates accounted with 50. 0 % of the paediatric patients. Differences were not found between the proportion of male and female patients across age groups (p = 0. 762). Only 18. 3 % were inpatients. A high proportion of paediatric inpatients (58. 3 %) were seen in relation to adult inpatients (5. 9 %) (P = 0. 001). In general, anti-neoplastic and immunomodulating agents for rare cancers were the most frequent dispensed medicines (51. 3 %). In relation to paediatrics, Caffeine Citrate for primary apnoea of premature newborns had the <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> (57. 1 %). Five (71. 4 %) medicines dispensed for paediatrics, do not have market authorisation and the remaining (28. 6 %) were used off-label. For pulmonary arterial hypertension 19 of 27 patients (70. 3 %) were treated with Bosentan. According to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, Bosentan has a good level of evidence and substantial benefit: grade of recommendation A. Conclusions Most orphan medicines dispensed to paediatrics and adults were not licensed. A special pharmacovigilance program and a risk management plan through the entire life cycle should be implemented, towards effectiveness and safety of orphan medicines.

Juno) seedlings treated with two selected concentrations of Pb(NO 3) 2 : 150 and 350 mg l- 1, which were found to inhibit root growth by 50 % and 70 %, respectively [Rucińska et al. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 37 (1999) 37187 - 37194]. Roots exposed to those external lead concentrations took up about 50 and 70 mg l- 1 Pb 2 + g- 1 fresh weight (FW) over 48 h of incubation. A dose-dependent increase in the degree of root injury was observed in the presence of both tested concentrations. The genotoxicity of lead in lupin root cells was analysed using a mild alkaline comet assay at pH 12. 3, which allows the detection of single strand breaks. The quantity of the DNA fragments migrating away from the nuclear remnant (tail area) increased proportionally to the lead content inside the roots, and was positively correlated with the degree of root injury. At 150 mg l- 1 Pb 2 +, a <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> of nuclei having large values of tail lengths and moments was observed. By contrast, the number of nuclei with minimum values of these parameters increased at 350 mg l- 1 Pb 2 +.

The local spectrum representation is computed by the two-dimensional Wigner distribution, which gives the spatial-frequency information as a function of location. The change in texture density, or the so-called texture gradient, caused by the perspective projection of a surface in the three-dimensional world onto the two-dimensional image plane, is computed from this space-frequency representation by measuring the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> energy <b>distribution</b> at each location of the image.

40|$|The {{screening}} of a differential library from precursor and differentiated oligodendrocytes, obtained through the representational difference analysis (RDA) technique, has generated {{a number of}} cDNA recombinants corresponding to mRNA coding for known and unknown proteins: (1) mRNA coding for proteins involved in protein synthesis, (2) mRNA coding for proteins involved {{in the organization of}} the cytoskeleton, and (3) mRNA coding for proteins of unknown function. The expression profile of the mRNA was studied by Northern blot hybridization to the poly-A(+) mRNA from primary rat progenitor and differentiated oligodendrocytes. In most cases, hybridization to the precursor was higher than hybridization to the differentiated mRNA, supporting the validity of the differential screening. Hybridization of the cDNA to rat cerebral hemisphere and brain stem poly-A(+) mRNA, isolated from 1 - to 90 -day-old rats, confirms the results obtained with the mRNA from differentiating oligodendrocytes. The intensity of the hybridization bands decreases as differentiation proceeds. The pattern of expression observed in oligodendrocytes is different from that found in the brain only {{in the case of the}} nexin- 1 mRNA, the level of which remains essentially constant throughout differentiation both in the brain stem and in the cerebral hemispheres, in agreement with the published data. In contrast, the intensity of hybridization to the oligodendrocyte mRNA is dramatically lower in the differentiated cells compared with the progenitor oligodendrocyte cells. Some of the recombinant cDNA represent mRNA sequences present at <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>distribution</b> in the cells, while others belong to the rare sequences group. Six recombinants code for proteins of the ribosomal family, suggesting that of approximately 70 known ribosomal proteins, only a few are upregulated during oligodendrocyte differentiation.
