40|$|ABSTRACT Emulsification is {{generally}} {{carried out by}} introducing mechanical stirring in a two phase systems. However such methods are {{not always easy to}} apply and are often costly, particularly to produce the <b>extremely</b> <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> found in the so-called mini or nanoemulsions. The present talk deals with emulsification methods in which stirring has essentially no effect in the breaking mechanisms, which are based on one or several of the following dynamic processes: surfactant mass transfer, spontaneous emulsification, transitional or/and catastrophic phase inversion. They are all produced by interfacial transient events (most often under low-energy homogeneization), either by putting into contact non-equilibrated phases or by changing the formulation, temperature, or the water-oil ratio of an equilibrated system. A unified approach is presented here {{on the basis of the}} generalized formulation concept, and it is shown to be a handy tool to design industrial processes such as polymer coating manufacturing, cutting oil concentrate dispersion or heavy crude oil emulsification...|$|R
50|$|An {{ultrasonic}} humidifier uses {{a ceramic}} diaphragm vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency to create water droplets that silently exit the humidifier {{in the form}} of cool fog. Usually the mist gets forced out by a tiny fan, while some ultra mini models have no fans. The models without fans are meant mainly for personal use. Ultrasonic humidifiers use a piezoelectric transducer to create a high frequency mechanical oscillation in a film of water. This forms an <b>extremely</b> <b>fine</b> mist of <b>droplets</b> about one micron in diameter, that is quickly evaporated into the air flow.|$|R
50|$|Deionized {{water is}} used in water-fog fire-extinguishing systems used in {{sensitive}} environments, such as where high-voltage electrical and sensitive electronic equipment is used. The 'sprinkler' nozzles use much finer spray jets than other systems, and operate at up 35 MPa (350 bar; 5,000 psi) of pressure. The <b>extremely</b> <b>fine</b> mist produced takes the heat out of a fire rapidly, and the <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> of water are nonconducting (when deionized) and {{are less likely to}} damage sensitive equipment. Deionized water, however, is inherently acidic and contaminants (such as copper, dust, stainless and carbon steel, and many other common materials) rapidly supply ions, thus re-ionizing the water. It is not generally considered acceptable to spray water on electrical circuits that are powered, and it is generally considered undesirable to use water in electrical contexts.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{microchannel}} emulsification (MCE) system for mass-producing uniform <b>fine</b> <b>droplets.</b> A 60 × 60 -mm MCE chip made of single-crystal silicon has 14 microchannel (MC) arrays and 1. 2 × 104 MCs, and each MC array consists of many parallel MCs and a terrace. A holder with two inlet through-holes and one outlet through-hole was also developed for simply infusing each liquid and collecting emulsion products. The MCE chip was sealed well by physically attaching it to a flat glass plate in the holder during emulsification. Uniform <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> of soybean oil with an average diameter of 10 μm were reliably generated from all the MC arrays. The size of the resultant <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> was almost independent of the dispersed-phase flow rate below a critical value. The continuous-phase flow rate was unimportant for both the droplet generation and the droplet size. The MCE chip enabled mass-producing uniform <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> at 1. 5 mL h– 1 and 1. 9 × 109 h– 1, which could be further increased using a dispersed phase of low viscosity...|$|R
5000|$|Whether spiders that weave true orb webs form a {{coherent}} group, and so should be classified together, {{is a question}} that has a long history. Two groups of spiders that spin orb webs are the Uloboridae and the Araneidae. Although their webs have a very similar overall architecture, the sticky catching threads are created in different ways. Uloborid spiders have a cribellum - a flat plate from which a particular kind of silk emerges - and a calamistrum - a structure formed of bristles on the metatarsus of the fourth leg, used to [...] "comb" [...] the cribellate silk into <b>extremely</b> <b>fine</b> strands, that are adhesive without having any [...] "glue" [...] present. Araneid spiders have silk-producing organs that add <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> of a glue-like substance to silk of normal thickness to create viscid silk. (Spiders that do not spin orb webs can also be divided into those that produce cribellate silk and those that produce viscid silk.) ...|$|R

40|$|Crop {{protection}} {{products are}} usually applied as sprays. These spray droplets {{have a certain}} size distribution. <b>Fine</b> <b>droplets</b> are often required to achieve a good coverage of the plant and to guarantee the biological efficacy of an agrochemical product. At the same time very <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> in spray are not desirable. Due to their low mass and velocity, these droplets can be carried from the application site by crosswind and e. g. can contaminate surface water. Droplet drift can be minimized by {{reducing the number of}} very <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> in spray. Dilute emulsions produce coarser sprays compared to water when atomized through a standard flat fan nozzle. For this reason dilute emulsions can reduce drift risk. The mechanism of spray formation of dilute emulsions has been investigated in this thesis. The proposed mechanism also describes spray formation in more complex mixtures of dilute emulsions with surfactants or polymers.    ...|$|R

In this way, it eliminates the environmental and human health concerns mentioned earlier, as well as saving pesticide. In particular, the term refers to the spraying of <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> in a defined volume, smaller than the greenhouse.

40|$|Electrospraying is {{a method}} of {{generating}} <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> through high electrostatic charging. It involves an electrohydrodynamic process for forming <b>fine</b> <b>droplets.</b> These droplets are highly charged that promotes selfdispersion which results in the uniform coating on the substrate. Electrospraying can be successfully utilised as a coating technique to coat textile substrates. Textiles substrate coated with electrosprayed polymer droplets have a large specific surface area, and it facilitates submicron range coating compared to conventional coating methods like roller coating or knife coating. This research study investigates the electrospraying of thermoplastic polyurethane as a coating technique on the textile substrate. The results showed that electrospraying facilitated the submicron size droplets deposition on textile substrates which imparted the waterproof property to the substrate without altering the moisture management and surface properties of the textile substrate...|$|R

40|$|<b>Extremely</b> <b>fine</b> liquid <b>droplets</b> or solid particles, those remain {{suspended}} in the air, are known as aerosols. They are produced by natural sources and anthropogenic activities. Several types of aerosols produced by different processes {{are present in the}} atmosphere and every type of aerosol species exhibit different types of physical and chemical properties. Though making up {{only a small fraction of}} atmospheric mass aerosols are capable of altering Earth’s climate by scattering and absorbing incoming solar radiation and absorbing outgoing radiation. Adding to the complexity, they can act as cloud condensation nuclei and modify cloud properties. 	 Major objective of this thesis is to study absorption due to aerosols and factors controlling the absorbing efficiency of aerosols over various environments. We have demonstrated a new method to quantify the organic carbon in terms of optical depth. Our studies demonstrate large “anomalous” absorption in the UV wavelength region over several regions. Further investigations revealed that a major part of this additional absorption is contributed by organic carbon aerosols and partly due to dust aerosols. We show that it is possible to discriminate UV absorption by dust and organic carbon by making use of the fact that dust aerosols are much larger in size compared to organic aerosols. Examination of aerosol optical depth values measured at cities south of Saharan desert indicates high short wave absorption due to coarse mode aerosols probably dust. Even at low values of Angstrom wavelength exponent, which indicates the presence of large aerosols (e. g., dust over land), absorption was found reasonably high compared to that of pure dust. On the other hand, over regions in the northern part of the Sahara close to Europe, short wave absorption was found to be lower. The enhanced short wave absorption due to coarse particles is unexpected. It appears that the deposition of anthropogenic aerosols such as black carbon over dust aerosols is likely to be responsible for this enhanced short wave absorption. This is a typical example of how anthropogenic aerosols can modify the properties of natural aerosols. We have carried out source apportionment using backward air parcel trajectories by applying k-means method of clustering and obtained various aerosol terms corresponding to each cluster. We have selected three island sites and one site in the middle of Saharan desert for this study. High aerosol radiative forcing values are observed even over remote island locations. Our study demonstrates the role of aerosols transported from the main land in influencing the aerosol environment even over remote marine regions...|$|R

30|$|For {{eradication}} it {{is important}} to evenly distribute a lethal dose of active ingredient throughout the host canopy, thus minimising pest migration (and survival) to areas of lower doses. This is why the conventional broadcast application, ideally with <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> (volume median diameter (VMD) of 150  μm or less), is an effective method for eradication (Richardson 2002; Richardson and Kimberley 2010). Unfortunately, minimising off-target drift usually requires replacing the known effective <b>fine</b> <b>droplet</b> size (150  μm VMD) with a larger droplet size (250 + μm VMD), which compromises the efficacy of the treatment with less coverage, although evenly distributed. This is demonstrated when comparing the distribution of dye between the inner and outer portions of the canopy (Figure  1 A and C) and between the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces (Figures  1 and 2).|$|R
40|$|Separating <b>fine</b> liquid <b>droplets</b> from a {{gas stream}} is an {{important}} operation in many industrial applications. In this paper, the effect of surface roughness on the deposition of droplets was investigated {{in a series of}} wind tunnel experiments. The roughness was modelled by 2 -D rectangular ridges oriented at 45 degrees to the flow direction. The rate of droplet deposition onto the surface was measured by a conductivity method. It was found that the deposition of droplets onto the roughened surface was enhanced by the roughness and the enhancement increased with ridge size-based Reynolds number. The maximum enhancement of droplet deposition on roughened surfaces over that of the smooth surfaces was observed to be around 150 %. Data obtained for droplets with different sizes also indicated that the deposition rate of <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> was more dependent on the Reynolds than that of the large droplets. For relatively larger droplets, the enhancement of deposition is mainly caused by momentum-dominated impact. However, for <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> this is mainly due to the enhancement of local turbulence...|$|R

5000|$|The Entelegynae have a {{more complex}} {{reproductive}} anatomy: females have two [...] "copulatory pores" [...] {{in addition to the}} single genital pore of other groups of spiders; males have complex palpal bulbs, matching the female genital structures (epigynes). The monophyly of the group is well supported in both morphological and molecular studies. The internal phylogeny of the Entelegynae {{has been the subject of}} much research. Two groups within this clade contain the only spiders that make vertical orb webs: the Deinopoidea are cribellate - the adhesive properties of their webs are created by packets of thousands of <b>extremely</b> <b>fine</b> loops of dry silk; the Araneoidea are ecribellate - the adhesive properties of their webs are created by <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> of [...] "glue". In spite of these differences, the webs of the two groups are similar in their overall geometry. The evolutionary history of the Entelegynae is thus intimately connected with the evolutionary history of orb webs. One hypothesis is that there is a single clade, Orbiculariae, uniting the orb web makers, in whose ancestors orb webs evolved. A review in 2014 concluded that there is strong evidence that orb webs evolved only once, although only weak support for the monophyly of the Orbiculariae. One possible phylogeny is shown below; the type of web made is shown for each terminal node in order of the frequency of occurrence.|$|R
