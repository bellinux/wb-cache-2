60|$|In all {{countries}} which have passed beyond {{a very early}} stage in the progress of agriculture, every increase in the demand for food, occasioned by increased population, will always, {{unless there is a}} simultaneous improvement in production, diminish the share which on a fair division would fall to each individual. An increased production, in default of unoccupied tracts of fertile land, or of fresh improvements tending to cheapen commodities, can never be obtained but by increasing the labor in more than the same proportion. The population must either work harder or eat less, or obtain their usual food by sacrificing a part of their other customary comforts. Whenever this necessity is postponed, it is because the improvements which facilitate production continue progressive; because the contrivances of mankind for making their labor more effective keep up an equal struggle with Nature, and extort <b>fresh</b> <b>resources</b> from her reluctant powers as fast as human necessities occupy and engross the old.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{extension}} of the Î»-calculus is proposed, to study resource usage analysis and verification. Resources can be dynamically created, and passed / returned by functions; their usages have side effects, represented by events. Usage policies are properties over histories of events, and have a possibly nested, local scope. A type and effect system over-approximates the set of histories a program can generate at run-time. A crucial point solved here concerns correctly associating <b>fresh</b> <b>resources</b> with their usages within approximations. A second issue is that these approximations may contain an unbounded number of <b>fresh</b> <b>resources.</b> Despite of that, we have devised a technique to model-check validity of approximations. A program with a valid approximation is resource-safe: no run-time monitor is needed to safely drive its executions. ...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this dissertation is to introduce several algebraic procedures to the targeting of material recycle networks. The problem involves the allocation of process streams and fresh sources to process units (sinks) {{with the objective of}} minimizing fresh purchase and waste discharge. In the case of composition-limited sinks, allocation to process sinks is governed by feasibility constraints on flowrates and compositions. A systematic non-iterative algebraic approach is developed to identify rigorous targets for minimum usage of <b>fresh</b> <b>resources,</b> maximum recycle of process resources and minimum discharge of waste. These targets are identified a priori and without commitment to the detailed design of the recycle/reuse network. The approach is valid for both pure and impure <b>fresh</b> <b>resources.</b> The devised procedures also identifies the location of the material recycle pinch point and addresses its significance in managing process sources, fresh usage, and waste discharge. The dissertation also addresses the targeting of material-recycle networks when the constraints on the process units are described through flowrates and properties. This property-integration problem is solvedusing a non-iterative cascade-based algebraic procedure. Finally, for more complex cases with multiple fresh sources and with interception networks, a mathematical-programming approach is developed. Because of the nonlinear non-convex characteristics of the problem, the mathematical model is reformulated to enable the global solution of the problem. Several case studies are solved to illustrate the ease, rigor, and applicability of the developed targeting technique...|$|E
40|$|The process {{industries}} such as petrochemicals, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, among others, consume large amounts of material and energy resources. These industries are also characterized by generating enormous amounts of waste that significantly contribute to the pollution of the environment. Integrated process design is a very effective technique in conserving process resources and preventing pollution. The design and environmental constraints may involve a variety of component- and property-based restrictions. To date, most techniques {{have been developed to}} handle process constraints which is either composition-based (via mass integration) or property-based. No work has been reported to handle the synthesis of resource conservation network that is governed by both constraints. The objective of this work is to develop a systematic and cost-effective design technique that is aimed at minimizing the consumption of <b>fresh</b> <b>resources</b> and the discharge of pollutants simultaneously. Because {{of the nature of the}} component- and property-based constraints, this approach is based on mass and property integration and takes into account the process constraints and also environmental regulations. In this research work, a new approach has been developed to simultaneously address component-based recycle constraints as well as property-based discharge constraints. The proposed optimization technique is intended to minimize the consumption of <b>fresh</b> <b>resources,</b> the pollutant content in the waste streams, and the operational and waste treatment costs. Additionally, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation is solved for a case study of phenol production from cumene hydroperoxyde to illustrate the new problem and devised solution algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{consumption of}} energy, {{generation of waste}} as well as higher cost of <b>fresh</b> <b>resources</b> and waste treatment systems are the important driving forces for developing efficient, environmentally friendly and economic resource conservation techniques in the process industries. Process integration is being recognized as an useful systematic strategy for resource conservation and waste minimization. Up to date, less research works have been investigated on heat and property integration and these works are only focused on continuous processes. Since the application of batch processes is increasingly popular due {{to the development of}} technology-intensive industries such as pharmacy, fine chemistry and foods, it is necessary to consider both heat and property integration in batch processes simultaneously. In this thesis, a new mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) mathematical model is introduced to synthesize a property-based heat integrated resource conservation networks (HIRCNs) for batch processes. A source-HEN-sink superstructure is constructed to embed all possible network configurations. Then, an MINLP model that consists of propertybased resource conservation network (RCN) and heat exchanger network (HEN) models is developed. In the proposed model, the property-based RCN model is formulated based on supertargeting approach while HEN model is formulated via automated targeting method (ATM). The optimization objective is to minimize total annualized cost (TAC) for a batch process system. This includes the operating cost of <b>fresh</b> <b>resources,</b> hot and cold utilities as well as the capital cost of storage tanks. To demonstrate the proposed approach, three case studies were solved. Based on the optimized results, the proposed simultaneous targeting approach for property-based HIRCNs is more effective in term of TAC for HIRCNs than the presented sequential targeting approach...|$|E

In this paper we investi-gate nominal automata that accept infinite words. These automata are a generalisation of deterministic Muller automata to the setting of nominal sets. We prove decidability of complement, union, intersection, emptiness and equivalence, and determinacy by ultimately periodic words. The key to obtain such results is to use finite representations of the (otherwise infinite-state) defined class of automata. The definition of such operations enables model checking of process calculi featuring infinite behaviours, and resource allocation, to be implemented using classical automata-theoretic methods...|$|E

The distinctive feature of our machines is their use of unbounded memory sets (histories) where input symbols can be selectively stored and compared with symbols to follow. In addition, stored symbols can be consumed or deleted by reset. We show that the combination of consumption and reset capabilities renders the automata powerful enough to imitate counter machines, and yields closure under all regular operations apart from complementation. We moreover examine weaker notions of HRAs which strike different balances between expressiveness and effectiveness. Comment: LMCS (improved version of FoSSaCS...|$|E

40|$|The process {{industries}} {{are characterized by}} the enormous use of natural resources such as raw materials, solvents, water, and utilities. Additionally, significant amounts of wastes are discharged from industrial facilities. As the world moves toward sustainable progress, that is, meeting the demand of the current generation without affecting or compromising the new generation, future process facilities must focus on resource conservation and pollution prevention. The purpose of this work is to introduce a new process integration methodology for the conservation and optimization of resources in the {{process industries}}. The work is also geared towards reducing waste discharge from the processing facilities. The optimal management of <b>fresh</b> <b>resources</b> and waste disposal requires the appropriate allocation, generation, and separation of streams and species. Material recycle/reuse/substitution, reaction alteration, and process modification {{are some of the}} main strategies employed to conserve resources in the process industries. The overall problem addressed in this dissertation can be stated as follows: Given is a process with a number of streams (sources) that are characterized by certain criteria (e. g., compositions of certain compounds, targeted properties) where these streams can be utilized in a number of process units (sinks) if they satisfy given constraints on flow rate, compositions, and/or properties. Additionally, interception devices may be used to adjust stream criteria. The objective is to develop targeting procedures and synthesis tools for the identification of minimum usage of <b>fresh</b> <b>resources,</b> minimum discharge of waste, and maximum integration of process resources. The devised methodology addresses four classes of problems: ?? Targeting techniques using direct recycle strategies ?? Recycle and interception procedures for single-component systems ?? Recycle and interception procedures for multi-component systems ?? Property integration for direct recycle strategies The framework provided by this dissertation couples traditional mass integration with groundbreaking property integration techniques to target, synthesize and optimize a plant for maximal conservation of resources. In particular, this work introduces new techniques such as material recycle pinch analysis, simultaneous recycle and interception networks, and property-based allocation. Additionally, graphical, algebraic, and optimization approaches are developed and validated with case studies in order to illustrate the applicability of the devised procedures...|$|E

In a first step, a MILP model determines the minimum fresh resource flow rate necessary to satisfy all mass-related constraints. The model takes into account multicontaminants and multiproperties cases. It also includes the possibility to use several <b>fresh</b> <b>resources</b> (with different characteristics) and several waste sinks (with different limitations). Then, a second MILP model is used to design an optimal heat integrated resource allocation network. The objective function includes fresh resource, waste discharge and utilities costs. The fresh resource flow rate search space is restrained thanks to the first model results. The heat integration is realized with a modified transshipment model, where the temperature scale is discretized in order to account for non-isothermal mixing. Technical constraints, expressing real on site industrial restrictions, are introduced to lead the optimal solution towards a more realistic network. The methodology is demonstrated on a literature case study. It shows the interest of simultaneous optimization of both heat and resource compared to a sequential approach...|$|E
