6000|$|It was not {{surprising}} Gilbert Osmond should not have taken comfort in Miss Stackpole; his instinct had naturally set him in opposition to a young lady capable of advising his wife {{to withdraw from the}} conjugal roof. When she arrived in Rome he had said to Isabel that he hoped she would leave her friend the interviewer alone; and Isabel had answered that he at least had nothing to fear from her. She said to Henrietta that as Osmond didn't like her she couldn't invite her to dine, but they could easily see each other in other ways. Isabel received Miss Stackpole freely in her own sitting-room, and took her repeatedly to <b>drive,</b> <b>face</b> to face with Pansy, who, bending a little forward, on the opposite seat of the carriage, gazed at the celebrated authoress with a respectful attention which Henrietta occasionally found irritating. She complained to Isabel that Miss Osmond had a little look as if she should remember everything one said. [...] "I don't want to be remembered that way," [...] Miss Stackpole declared; [...] "I consider that my conversation refers only to the moment, like the morning papers. Your stepdaughter, as she sits there, looks as if she kept all the back numbers and would bring them out some day against me." [...] She could not teach herself to think favourably of Pansy, whose absence of initiative, of conversation, of personal claims, seemed to her, in a girl of twenty, unnatural and even uncanny. Isabel presently saw that Osmond would have liked her to urge a little the cause of her friend, insist a little upon his receiving her, so that he might appear to suffer for good manners' sake. Her immediate acceptance of his objections put him too much in the wrong--it being in effect one of the disadvantages of expressing contempt that you cannot enjoy {{at the same time the}} credit of expressing sympathy. Osmond held to his credit, and yet he held to his objections--all of which were elements difficult to reconcile. The right thing would have been that Miss Stackpole should come to dine at Palazzo Roccanera once or twice, so that (in spite of his superficial civility, always so great) she might judge for herself how little pleasure it gave him. From the moment, however, that both the ladies were so unaccommodating, there was nothing for Osmond but to wish the lady from New York would take herself off. It was surprising how little satisfaction he got from his wife's friends; he took occasion to call Isabel's attention to it.|$|E

40|$|This is an Author's Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} in the International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, available online at: [URL] present two methods for process planning of 2. 5 D machined parts. The first method is based on feature recognition from a 3 D model. We embedded the shape and the machining method of two generic classes of machining features in a set of OPS 5 rules to form a machining feature recognizer. When successfully recognizing a machining feature, machining instructions, in terms of the tool entrance face, <b>drive</b> <b>face</b> and part face, for cutting the machining feature will be generated and further processed to produce NC codes. The second method is based on learning the shape and the machining method of the machining feature. When a machining feature cannot be recognized by the former feature recognizer, the user can use the machining feature as a positive training example to instruct the system about the tool entrance face, <b>drive</b> <b>face</b> and part face of the machining feature. The system then builds a new rule, using the boundary shape of the unrecognized machining feature as the rule's matching condition and the acquired machining instruction as the rule's action. The new rule can be used subsequently for process planning of machining features that have shapes similar to the memorized one...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{perception}} of speech is inherently multimodal [16][22]. Auditory-visual speech recognition is more accurate than auditory only or visual only speech recognition [1][10]. Research shows that a synthetic talking face can help people understand the associated speech in noisy environments [16]. It also helps people react more positively in interactive services [20]. In some situations, reliable high bandwidth communication channel can hardly be guaranteed. Real-time speech driven avatar, which requires only very low bit rate channel to transmit information, provides an effective solution.

The face animation is synthesized by the unit concatenating, and synchronous with the real speech. The units are selected according to the cost functions which correspond to voice spectrum distance between training and target units. Visual distance between two adjacent training units {{is also used to}} get better mapping results. Finally, the Viterbi method is used to find out the best face animation sequence.

40|$|Abstract. In the paper, {{we present}} a {{framework}} of speech <b>driven</b> <b>face</b> anima-tion system with expressions. It systematically addresses audio-visual data ac-quisition, expressive trajectory analysis and audio-visual mapping. Based on this framework, we learn the correlation between neutral facial deformation and expressive facial deformation with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A hierar-chical structure is proposed to map the acoustic parameters to lip FAPs. Then the synthesized neutral FAP streams will be extended with expressive variations according to the prosody of the input speech. The quantitative evaluation of the experimental result is encouraging and the synthesized face shows a realistic quality. ...|$|R

It provides a guideline for building a complete face modeling and animation system. Based on the framework, we improved our face modeling and animation system, called the iFACE system [6].
