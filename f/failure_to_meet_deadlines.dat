For soft real-time systems (where a missed deadline is not catastrophic), using worst case task execution times leads to very inefficient use of processing resources. This is particularly true when worst case execution occurs very infrequently. Our performability analysis permits task schedules to slide (that is, require more time than predicted).

40|$|This thesis makes a {{contribution}} towards the certification of reconfigurable real-time mission critical software systems. In highly reconfigurable software systems {{it is possible}} for a situation to arise where the system expends most or all of its resources on reconfiguring, and thus cannot provide sufficient resources to conduct intended computing functions. This anomaly has been termed "configuration thrashing" by the author due to its loose analogy to memory thrashing. If configuration thrashing is not eliminated, or at least minimised, then {{it is possible for}} circumstance to occur where reconfigurable systems cannot be certified due to potential <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>deadlines</b> caused by configuration thrashing. The elimination of reconfiguration thrashing is a step towards certifiable dynamic reconfigurable systems capable of enforcing deadlines. The elimination of reconfiguration thrashing is necessary, though not sufficient, for this goal. In order to restrict configuration thrashing it is necessary to understand the possibilities available within reconfigurable software. A VDM-SL model is presented to explore the options available for reconfigurable architectures, and has allowed many operators to be formally specified providing a much greater understanding of the tasks involved in reconfiguration. The thesis demonstrates how model checkers can be used to check software processes for configuration thrashing using predefined CSP models, thus allowing system programmers to engineer configuration thrashing out of systems. However, model checkers are susceptible to state space explosion, particularly if models are large and / or complex, which may make the use of the model checkers impractical or even impossible for some systems. The thesis therefore also explores potential run-time solutions to configuration thrashing. These solutions allow developers to include additional logic / processes within their systems in order to eliminate configuration thrashing (without the use of model checkers). Several options are explored in-depth, from providing mechanisms for developers to choose when reconfiguration can / cannot occur, to a rule based solution. The exploration of the rule based solution explores issues such as rule expression, rule predictability, as well as potential core rules. The two approaches taken within this thesis to eliminate, or at least restrict sufficiently, configuration thrashing form a basis which would allow for the certification of reconfigurable real-time mission critical software systems.

ACP Ministers reiterated the need for improved 'market access for all agricultural products originating from ACP states, and the need for developed countries to eliminate export subsidies and to reduce trade-distorting support, especially when having a negative impact on ACP countries'. The Ministers also expressed regret at the WTO challenge to the EU sugar regime. More specifically the ACP called for: 'the Cancun Ministerial conference to take a decision on the rapid elimination of subsidies to cotton, and adopt measures so as to compensate those countries adversely affected by these practices'; 'developed countries to exercise restraint in applying TBT and SPS measures on products from ACP countries' provision to be made for special safeguard mechanisms, special treatment for 'special products' and for the special needs of net-food-importing developing countries to be addressed. Comment: Significantly improved market access for ACP agricultural exports can best be secured through modifying, on a case-by-case basis, the provisions of Declaration XXII of the Cotonou Agreement, since this restricts the benefits of any new EU liberalisation to ACP countries, while any multilateral commitments will benefit all WTO members, including the competitors of ACP countries.

40|$|Real-time {{computing}} is {{not just}} fast computing but time-predictable computing. Many tasks in safety-critical embedded real-time systems have hard real-time characteristics. <b>Failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>deadlines</b> may result {{in the loss of}} life or in large damages. Known of Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) is important for reliability or correct functional behavior of the system. As multi-core processors are increasingly adopted in industry, it has become a great challenge to accurately bound the worst-case execution time (WCET) for real-time systems running on multi-core chips. This is particularly true because of the inter-thread interferences in accessing shared resources on multi-cores, such as shared L 2 caches, which can significantly affect the performance but are very difficult to be estimate statically. We propose an approach to analyzing Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) for multi-core processors with shared L 2 instruction caches by using a model checking based method. Our experiments indicate that compared to the static analysis technique based on extended ILP (Integer Linear Programming), our approach improves the tightness of WCET estimation more than 31. 1 % for the benchmarks we studied. However, due to the inherent complexity of multi-core timing analysis and the state explosion problem, the model checking based approach currently can only work with small real-time kernels for dual-core processors. At the same time, improving the average-case performance and energy efficiency has also been important for real-time systems. Recently, Hybrid SPM-Cache (HSC) architectures by combining caches and Scratch-Pad Memories (SPMs) have been increasingly used in commercial processors and research prototypes. Our research explores HSC architectures for real-time systems to reconcile time predictability, performance, and energy consumption. We study the energy dissipation of a number of hybrid on-chip memory architectures by combining both caches and Scratch-Pad Memories (SPM) without increasing the total on-chip memory size. Our experimental results indicate that with the equivalent total on-chip memory size, several hybrid SPM-Cache architectures are more energy-efficient than either pure software controlled SPMs or pure hardware-controlled caches. In particular, using the hybrid SPM-cache to store both instructions and data can achieve the best energy efficiency. However, the SPM allocation for the HSC architecture must be aware of the cache to harness the full potential of the HSC architecture. First, we propose and evaluate four SPM allocation strategies to reduce WCET for hybrid SPM-Caches with different complexities. These algorithms differ by whether or not they can cooperate with the cache or be aware of the WCET. Our evaluation shows that the cache aware and WCET-oriented SPM allocation can maximally reduce the WCET with minimum or even positive impact on the average-case execution time (ACET). Moreover, we explore four SPM allocation algorithms to maximize performance on the HSC architecture, including three heuristic-based algorithms, and an optimal algorithm based on model checking. Our experiments indicate that the Greedy Stack Distance based Allocation (GSDA) can run efficiently while achieving performance either the same as or close to the optimal results got by the Optimal Stack Distance based Allocation (OSDA). Last but not the least, we extend the two stack distance based allocation algorithms to GSDA-E and OSDA-E to minimize the energy consumption of the HSC architecture. Our experimental results show that the GSDA-E can also reduce the energy either the same as or close to the optimal results attained by the OSDA-E, while achieving performance close to the OSDA and GSDA...|$|E

A real-time system is usually comprised of a set of cooperating tasks, which communicate by sharing resources or by message passing. A task typically senses the state of the system, performs certain computation, and if necessary sends commands to change the state of the system. Tasks in a real-time system are of two types, periodic tasks and aperiodic tasks [16]. Periodic tasks are invoked at regular intervals and their characteristics are known a priori. Whereas, aperiodic tasks are activated only when certain events occur and their characteristics are known only when they arrive.
