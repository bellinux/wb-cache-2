5|$|The {{player can}} use predatory tactics through stealthincluding silent takedowns, {{dropping}} from overhead perches and snatching enemies away, or using the explosive gel to knock foes off their feetto tilt the odds in their favor. Some areas feature sections {{that require the}} player to use these tactics to avoid alerting the Joker's henchmen and thus failing to meet an objective. Many areas feature stone gargoyles placed high above, helping Batman remain concealed. Batman can use his grapnel <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> reach the gargoyles, giving him a high vantage point over the area and the enemies. From the gargoyles, Batman can glide down to attack enemies or hang upside down from the gargoyles to grapple a nearby enemy and leave him tethered there. The player can use floor grates to attack from below, hide around corners, use batarangs to stun enemies from afar, and use the grapnel <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> pull enemies over ledges.|$|E

The M230E1 can be alternatively fixed to a locked forward firing position, or controlled via the Target Acquisition and Designation System (TADS).

5|$|The B-52 shared many {{technological}} similarities {{with the}} preceding Boeing B-47 Stratojet strategic bomber. The two aircraft {{used the same}} basic design, such as swept wings and podded jet engines, and the cabin included the crew ejection systems.

A prototype vehicle was authorized in October 1941 armed with an M1A1 75mm Pack Howitzer and a mount that was designed to fit on a simple box structure in the back of an M3 Half-track.|$|E
