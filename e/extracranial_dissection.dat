30|$|<b>Extracranial</b> <b>dissection</b> of {{the neck}} arteries, {{symptomatic}} or not, may occur as a complication of FMD lesions [4, 32]. However, it {{is not sufficient to}} establish a final diagnosis of FMD. In our experience, out of 64 patients with FMD, {{more than half of the}} cervico-encephalic artery dissections were discovered unexpectedly (unpublished data). Spontaneous dissection of a cervical artery is a frequent cause of stroke in young adults and may be associated with FMD in 15 – 20  % of cases [33, 34]. For this reason, physicians should consider FMD in patients with cervico-encephalic artery dissection, particularly if it is spontaneous, multifocal or in an atypical location. This situation should lead to further exploration of the renal arteries. The same approach could be proposed in case of a pseudoaneurysm that might correspond to the aftermath of a dissection.|$|E
40|$|OPINION STATEMENT Children who {{present with}} acute {{neurological}} symptoms suggestive {{of a stroke}} need immediate clinical assessment and urgent neuroimaging to confirm diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the investigation of first choice due to limited sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) for detection of ischaemia. Acute monitoring should include monitoring of blood pressure and body temperature, and neurological observations. Surveillance in a paediatric high dependency or intensive care unit and neurosurgical consultation are mandatory in children with large infarcts at risk of developing malignant oedema or haemorrhagic transformation. Thrombolysis and/or endovascular treatment, whilst not currently approved for use in children, may be considered when stroke diagnosis is confirmed within 4. 5 to 6  h, provided there are no contraindications on standard adult criteria. Standard treatment consists of aspirin, but anticoagulation therapy is frequently prescribed in stroke due to cardiac disease and <b>extracranial</b> <b>dissection.</b> Steroids and immunosuppression have a definite place in children with proven vasculitis, but their role in focal arteriopathies is less clear.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{compare the}} {{diagnosis}} and prognosis of extracranial versus intracranial vertebral artery dissections without intracerebral haemorrhage.  METHODS—Twenty two vertebral artery dissections were defined by intra-arterial angiography and classified in two groups: group 1,nine <b>extracranial</b> <b>dissections</b> (seven patients) and group 2, 13 intracranial dissections (nine patients), involving the basilar artery in five cases. Bilateral dissections were found in 38 % of the population. Before angiography, all the patients had been investigated by continuous wave Doppler, colour coded Doppler, and transcranial Doppler. Mean follow up was 44 months.  RESULTS—The two most important symptoms of both dissections (81 % of patients) were unbearable pain preceding stroke and progressive onset of stroke within a few hours. Severe ultrasonic abnormalities were present in 94 % of the patients whereas specific ultrasonic signs (segmental dilation with eccentric channel) were rare (19 %) in both groups. Major strokes and brainstem strokes represented respectively 67 % and 78 % in intracranial versus 43 % and 29 % in <b>extracranial</b> <b>dissections.</b> Severe sequelae (permanent disabling motor or cerebellar deficit) were more often associated with intracranial (44 %) than with <b>extracranial</b> <b>dissections</b> (14 %). No recurrence of dissection and no cerebral haemorrhage were found under heparin. Significant factors of poor outcome (P< 0. 05) were the initial severity of the stroke and the bilateral location of dissections.  CONCLUSION—The combination of a pain and a progressive onset of the stroke, corroborated by ultrasonic findings, could have helped to recognise most {{of these types of}} dissections.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{now clear}} that a number of {{paediatric}} emergencies with a neurological presentation, including hemiparesis, visual loss, seizures and coma, commonly have a vascular basis which may not be obvious on CT scan. Although many children do well, as there is significant mortality as well as morbidity for childhood stroke, in addition to a high risk for recurrence, making a diagnosis in the acute phase important. Venography and arteriography (including the neck vessels if the intracranial vessels are normal) are usually indicated despite the problems i. e. contrast CT requires a high dose of radiation while emergency MR usually requires anaesthesia and conventional arteriography carries a small risk of stroke. Surgical decompression may be life-saving in ischaemic as well as haemorrhagic stroke. It is unusual for children with anterior circulation stroke to be triaged quickly enough (< 4. 5 h) for thrombolysis but this may occasionally be appropriate in posterior circulation occlusion associated with coma, where the time window is longer (< 12 h). Anticoagulation carries relatively low risk and may be of benefit for children with venous sinus thrombosis (acutely and when at risk subsequently) or <b>extracranial</b> <b>dissection.</b> Aspirin to attempt to reduce the recurrence risk is appropriate in the medium term for the majority of patients with arterial ischaemic stroke.

40|$|Background: Dissection of Extracranial Internal Carotid Artery (EICA) and Extracranial Vertebral Artery (EVA) is an amportant {{cause of}} brain {{infarction}} with miscellaneous etiologies around the world. Methods: A prospective observational clinical {{study was conducted}} in Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran between 2008 - 2016. Diagnosis of brain infarction and TIA was made by stroke neurologist. Detection of EICA and EVA dissections were made by performing CT angiography  and MR angiography  or DSA in the suspected patients. Demographic features, clinical manifestations, territorial involvement, pathophysiology and pathogenesis of dissections were assessed in all of the patients. Pathogenesis of dissections was classified as Idiopathic, Trumatic, Postural and Genetic categories. Results: Twenty eight patients (21 males, 7 females) were admitted with extracranial arterial dissection. Mean age of males and females with dissection was 39. 81 ± 4. 2 and 35. 71 ± 6. 1 years respectively. Influence of gender on age of the patients was not significant, p> 0. 05. Among patients with <b>extracranial</b> <b>dissection</b> only 3. 6 % had atherosclerosis risk factors and 96. 4 % had no other cause for brain infarction. 100 % of extracranial dissections in males occured in carotid territory, while 28. 6 % of females had dissection in the EVA. The influence of gender in territory of dissection was significant, p< 0. 05. Idiopathic dissections and genetic susceptibility was found in 10. 7 % and 3. 6 % of extracranial dissections respectively. 53. 5 % of the patienrs had trumatic pathogenesis for extracranial dissections and 32. 1 % developed dissection due to special neck  postures. Important details in pathophysiology and pathogenesis of extracranial dissections will be presented in the lecture. Conclusion: Stroke patients with extracranial dissections have characteristic demographic and  territorial involvement.

Reliable epidemiological data on stroke incidence related to sCAD are scarce in Italy. This study aims to evaluate the incidence, clinical features, and outcome of cerebrovascular events related to sCAD and spontaneous intracranial arteries dissections (sIAD) in the city of Pisa (Italy). We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients admitted between December 1997 and June 2015 with a diagnosis of stroke, TIA, or Bernard-Horner syndrome due to acute cervical or intracranial artery dissection. Considering that our hospital collects presumptively all patients hospitalized with sCAD coming from the referral geographical area, data may provide a good approximation to real incidence of sCAD in our population. Clinical and radiological features, acute treatment and outcome were collected. Seventy-seven cases were included (mean age 48. 1 ± 10. 4  years, range 23 - 77, 72. 7 % males), 66 residents in the district of Pisa. Crude incidence rate of cerebrovascular events due to intra or <b>extracranial</b> <b>dissection</b> was 1. 88 / 100, 000 /year.

VAD was more prone to cause ischemic stroke and present with cervical pain or focal signs (p <  0. 01) than ICAD group, which had older age at onset. sIAD were more frequent in the posterior circle (p =  0. 01) and more associated with ischemic lesions. A good outcome (mRS 0 - 2) was observed in 79 % of patients. This is the first epidemiological attempt to investigate impact of sCAD and sIAD in Italy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background. Pulsatile {{tinnitus}} is {{an uncommon}} otologic symptom, {{which may be}} the presenting complaint of a potentially devastating pathology. Understanding this manifesta-tion as a possible symptom of a significant vascular abnormality is crucial to guide management and treatment. Methods and Results. We describe a 38 -year-old woman with sudden-onset right-sided pulsatile tinnitus. A right extracra-nial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection was diagnosed with MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and treated with anticoagulation. Follow-up MRI/MRA demonstrated complete re-solution. Two months later, left-sided pulsatile tinnitus evolved. An MRI/MRA of the neck demonstrated left-sided <b>extracranial</b> ICA <b>dissection.</b> She was treated in a similar fashion and a repeat MRI/MRA demonstrated its resolution. Conclusion. Spontaneous <b>extracranial</b> ICA <b>dissection</b> may present with pulsatile tinnitus as the only symptom in 4 % to 50 % of patients. Subsequent evolution of a contralateral dissection is even more uncommon. Generally, treatment of this phenomenon is conservative utilizing anticoagulation or aspirin; however, sur-gical intervention may be necessary. VC 2008 Wiley Periodi...|$|R

40|$|Background: Intra- and extracranial {{internal}} {{carotid artery}} dissections (ICD) are two different pathological conditions. <b>Extracranial</b> <b>dissection</b> {{is considered to be}} among the most frequent causes of stroke in the young and the segment generally reopens in 2 out of 3 cases, completely or partially, within 6 months. Intracranial ICD (IICD) is considered a rare occurrence in stroke and, accordingly, there are few systematic published data. However, it is a clinically significant condition that may cause severely disabling ischemic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage. In the past, sole availability of invasive imaging methods for its detection may have induced an underreporting. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze ultrasound findings, timing and predictors of recanalization in patients with IICD. Methods: IICD acute patients admitted to our Stroke Unit were submitted to carotid sonographic seriated monitoring, daily for the 1 st week after symptom onset, at day 14, at month 1 and every 3 months thereafter up to a follow-up of 4 years. Contrast carotid ultrasound was performed in patients with persistent occlusion after month 1. Results: Fourteen acute patients with IICD were enrolled. Extracranial internal carotid patency was observed in 8 patients at first ultrasound scans; all of these showed complete intracranial recanalization within the 1 st week and oral anticoagulants were withdrawn after 6 months. Conversely, in 6 patients retrograde extracranial internal carotid thrombosis was immediately observed, since the first ultrasound scans. In 4 of these the occlusion persisted after 4 years while 2 of them had only a partial recanalization, with evidence at contrast ultrasound of still late remodeling processes in the extracranial thrombus up to 2 years after the first observation; for this reason, in these 2 patients anticoagulation was not discontinued, while in the 4 patients with persistent, stable, occlusion, therapy was suspended 1 year after the diagnosis. Conclusions: Identification of the site of dissection - i. e. extra- versus intracranial - is fundamental in clinical studies for outcome and prognosis evaluation. Carotid ultrasound strict surveillance is important to monitor eventual recanalization in patients with ICD, even in a late phase. Retrograde internal carotid thrombosis seems to be correlated with persistent occlusion and partial recanalization. Remodeling of thrombotic material in the {{internal carotid artery}} may, however, continue for up to 2 years. In these cases, contrast ultrasound evidence of thrombus morphological changes may support the decision to continue anticoagulation. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To provide {{evidence}} for the endovascular repair of patients with <b>extracranial</b> carotid artery <b>dissection.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed whereby all studies that reported {{on the results of}} endoluminal repair of <b>extracranial</b> carotid artery <b>dissection</b> and provided information about primary technical and clinical success were identified. The Pubmed, Embase, and Medline databases were searched between January 1997 and February 2008 by two independent observers by using combinations of search terms "endovascular repair," "extracranial carotid artery," and "carotid dissection. " RESULTS: After studies were selected according to the given criteria, 13 studies were included in our statistical analysis. The number of reported patients was 62, with a total of 63 <b>extracranial</b> carotid artery <b>dissections.</b> The mean patient age was 43. 3 years. The mean follow-up period was 15. 7 months +/- 8. 7. Various causes were responsible for the disease, including a blunt neck injury in 28 patients (45 %), spontaneous dissection in 21 (37 %), and iatrogenic trauma during invasive radiologic procedure in 17. 7 % patients. The technical success rate was 100 % (63 of 63 procedures). The primary and 1 -year patency rate of the stents and/or stent-grafts was 100 %. The overall major adverse cardiovascular events rate was 11 % (seven strokes). The total follow-up mortality rate was 0 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Loeys-Dietz {{syndrome}} (LDS) is {{a recently}} described entity {{that has the}} triad of arterial tortuosity and aneurysms, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula or cleft palate. Its neuroradio-logic manifestations have not been well delineated. We sought to describe the neuroradiologic features of LDS and to assess the manifestations that would warrant follow-up imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two neuroradiologists retrospectively reviewed CT angiography (CTA), MR imaging, and plain film studies related to {{the head and neck}} in 25 patients ranging from 1 to 55 years of age, all of whom had positive genetic testing and clinical characteristics of LDS. Arterial tortuosity was evaluated by subjective assessment of 2 D and 3 D volumetric CTA and MR angiography data. Craniosynostosis and spinal manifestations were assessed by using plain films and CT images. MR images mostly of the head were reviewed for associated findings such as hydrocephalus, Chiari malformation, etc. Clinical manifestations were collated from the electronic patient record. RESULTS: All patients had extreme arterial tortuosity, which is characteristic of this syndrome. Thir-teen patients had scoliosis, 12 had craniosynostosis, 8 had intracranial aneurysms, 6 had spinal instability, 3 had dissections of the carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries, 3 had hydrocephalus, 4 had dural ectasia, 2 had a Chiari malformation, and 1 had intracranial hemorrhage as a complication of vascular dissection. CONCLUSIONS: Significant neuroradiologic manifestations are associated with LDS, predominantly arterial tortuosity. Most of the patients in this series were young and, therefore, may require serial CTA monitoring for development of intra- and <b>extracranial</b> <b>dissections</b> and aneurysms, {{on the basis of the}} fact that most of the patients with pseudoaneurysms and dissection were older at the time of imaging.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze {{angiographic}} findings and the presence and topography of cerebral ischemic and/or hemorrhagic lesions in cerebral CT or MRI, and to assess the long-term clinical outcome of a series of 136 consecutive cervicocephalic artery dissection (CCAD) patients. Pulsatile tinnitus was evaluated as a symptom of CCAD. Medical records and films were reviewed retrospectively. Irregular stenosis was found in angiography in 50 % and occlusion in 33 % of the dissected cervicocephalic arteries. Irregular stenosis normalized in 81 % and occlusion recanalized in 34 %. Other findings, such as pseudoaneurysms, intimal flaps, double lumens, and irregular dilatations were rare and often remained unchanged in follow-up. Pulsatile tinnitus was a presenting symptom in 12 % of the CCAD patients, but the majority of patients had concomitant head or neck pain, ischemic brain symptoms, Horner's syndrome, or cranial neuropathies. Of the 131 patients who underwent brain imaging, 73 (56 %) had signs of infarction in cerebral CT or MRI. Occlusion of the dissected vessel was accompanied by infarction in 76 %, irregular stenosis in 40 %, and other findings only rarely. Of the anterior circulation infarctions, 95 % (39 / 41) were territorial, subcortical, or territorial infarctions with fragmentation and could thus be considered embolic. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was found in CT in 5 of the 22 patients (23 %) with intracranial dissection. The patient's long-term clinical outcome was assessed using two methods: a classification into categories based on neurological symptoms and defects and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Of the 136 CCAD patients, 60 % recovered with no or mild disability and 79 % scored 0 – 2 on mRS. In the case of dissection of one or more cervicocephalic arteries without occlusion, the figures were 75 % and 89 %. In the case of occlusive dissection of one or more arteries, only about 35 % of the patients recovered well, having no or mild disability, and 61 % scored 0 – 2 on mRS. No significant differences were seen in recovery after intra- and <b>extracranial</b> <b>dissections.</b> In conclusion: irregular stenosis, which is the most common angiographic finding in CCAD, is associated with brain infarction less frequently than occlusion, and the long-term clinical outcome is good in most cases. Occlusion of the dissected vessel causes more brain infarctions, and only about 35 % of the patients recover well, having no or mild disability.

We encountered two consecutive cases of trauma-related extracranial internal carotid artery dissection, one in the suprabulbar portion and one in the subpetrosal portion. We managed the patient with suprabulbar dissection using a self-expandable metallic stent and managed the patient with subpetrosal dissection using a balloon-expandable metallic stent. In both patients the dissecting aneurysm disappeared, and at follow-up improved luminal patency was observed.

40|$|Partial oculosympathetic palsy {{followed}} by ischemic manifestations in brain or retina {{are the main}} symptoms of extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection. Unusually, cranial nerves may be affected. Isolated oculomotor nerve palsy is found only rarely. CASE: We present a 50 -year-old nondiabetic man who experienced acute onset of right occipital headache which spread to the right retro-orbital region. Five days later he noticed diplopia and right blurred vision sensation. Neurologic examination disclosed only impaired adduction and upward gaze of right eye, slight ipsilateral pupillary dilatation, without ptosis. Brain MRI was normal. Angiography showed right internal carotid artery dissection with forward occlusion {{to the base of}} the skull. Intravenous heparin {{followed by}} warfarin was prescribed. The headache and the oculomotor nerve deficit gradually resolved in the next three weeks. DISCUSSION: Isolated oculomotor nerve palsy is underrecognized as a clinical presentation of <b>extracranial</b> ICA <b>dissection.</b> If the angiographic evaluation is incomplete without careful study of extracranial arteries, misdiagnosis may lead to failure to initiate early treatment to prevent thromboembolic complications. For this reason we draw attention to the need for careful evaluation of cervical arteries in patients with oculomotor nerve palsy. Mechanical compression or stretching of the third nerve are possible mechanisms, but the direct impairment of the blood supply to the third nerve seems to be the most plausible explanation...|$|R
40|$|Ischemic stroke due to {{carotid artery}} {{dissection}} {{is more common}} among young people and it accounts about 2 - 5 % of all strokes. A 56 year old left landed male patient was evaluated for left-sided hemiparesis and aphasia in the emergency department. His cranial CT was assessed normal and NIH score was assessed 24 then he undergone thrombolytic therapy. His NIH score was decreased to 14 after 24 hours. At extracranial dupplex USG, cranial MRI and MR-Angiography, done the same day there were findings for carotid dissection. At MR-anjio repeated 5 days later, partial recanalization were seen. At control cranial CT only striocapsüler infarct was seen. There was no any evidence of bleeding as complication. Here we present a rare case of <b>extracranial</b> carotid artery <b>dissection</b> case undergone IV thrombolytic therapy and want to take attention that in carotid dissection IV thrombolytic therapy is quiet safe {{and there is no}} difference of complication such as hemorrhage and the prognosis is no different then those with no carotid dissection...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the natural history}} of dissecting aneurysm (DA) and whether DA is associated with an increased recurrent stroke risk and whether type of antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelets vs anticoagulants) modifies the persistence or development of DA. Methods: We included 264 patients with <b>extracranial</b> cervical artery <b>dissection</b> (CAD) from the Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study (CADISS), a multicenter prospective study that compared antiplatelet with anticoagulation therapy. Logistic regression was used to estimate age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios. We conducted a systematic review of published studies assessing {{the natural history of}} DA and stroke risk in patients with non-surgically-treated extracranial CAD with DA. Results: In CADISS, DA was present in 24 of 264 patients at baseline. In 36 of 248 patients with follow-up neuroimaging at 3 months, 12 of the 24 baseline DAs persisted, and 24 new DA had developed. There was no association between treatment allocation (antiplatelets vs anticoagulants) and whether DA at baseline persisted at follow-up or whether new DA developed. During 12 months of follow-up, stroke occurred in 1 of 48 patients with DA and in 7 of 216 patients without DA (age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio 0. 84; 95...|$|R
40|$|Dissection of {{cervical}} arteries causes {{ischemic stroke}} in young adults. This reports the clinical, ultrasonographic, and neurora-diological findings in 24 patients with 28 vertebral artery dissec-tions {{in the neck}} (4 occurring bilaterally). In 20 patients (83 %), the dissection was temporally related to trauma. No patients had an underlying vascular disease, for example, atherosclero-sis or fibromuscular dysplasia. In all, the major initial manifes-tation was pain in the occipital or neck region. The next most common symptoms were vertigo and nausea (in 17 patients). Clinical manifestations were vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attack (TIA) (5 patients: in 2 patients vestibulocerebellar TIA, in 1 patient visual TIA, in 1 patient motor TIA, and in 1 patient brain stem TIA with perioral paresthesia), cerebellar infarction (10 pa-tients, in 4 patients bilateral), brainstem infarction (5 patients), posterior cerebral artery territory infarction (1 patient), and mul-tiple vertebrobasilar ischemic lesions (3 patients). Typical angio-graphic findings were irregular narrowing of the vessel lumen or a tapering stenosis with distal occlusion. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a thickened vessel wall with hematoma sig-nal {{at the site of}} the dissection. Duplex color-flow imaging was valuable for the early diagnosis of <b>extracranial</b> vertebral artery <b>dissection</b> and for follow-up examinations. The distal V 1 - and the proximal V 2 -segment (at the level of C 6 vertebra) was the most frequent localization of dissections (in 43 %). The outcome was favorable except for 2 patients with basilar artery occlu-sion. Embolism to the basilar artery may be avoided by early administration of anticoagulants...|$|R
