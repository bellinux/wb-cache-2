Parrish felt people should be judged by their capability, not their color. During its development Parrish would often return from Washington DC depressed because of the massive resistance to the Tuskegee program. Decades later at Tuskegee Airmen reunions, when Parrish's name was called everyone applauded with a standing ovation. The experience of the AAF during World War II necessitated that the military review its policies on the utilization of black servicemembers. Confrontation, discussion, and coordination with both black and white groups led AAF leaders to the conclusion that active commitment, leadership, and equal opportunity produced a more cost-effective, viable military force. In 1948, President Harry Truman signed an Executive Order on <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> and opportunity in the military, due in no small part to the successes of the Tuskegee Airmen.

Several authors (e. g. o 2 ̆ 019 Mahony, 1982, Brockhoff and Schlich, 1998) argue that the binomial distribution cannot be used to analyse this kind of data. Brockhoff and Schlich (1998) propose an alternative model for the triangular test with replicates, where the assessors have different probabilities to correctly identify the odd sample even if the products are identical.

40|$|We {{consider}} that observations {{come from a}} general normal linear model {{and that it is}} desirable to test a simplifying null hypothesis about the parameters. We approach this problem from an objective Bayesian, model-selection perspective. Crucial ingredients for this approach are 'proper objective priors' to be used for deriving the Bayes factors. Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow priors have good properties for testing null hypotheses defined by specific values of the parameters in full-rank linear models. We extend these priors to deal with general hypotheses in general linear models, not necessarily of full rank. The resulting priors, which we call 'conventional priors', are expressed as a generalization of recently introduced 'partially informative distributions'. The corresponding Bayes factors are fully automatic, easily computed and very reasonable. The methodology is illustrated for the change-point problem and the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> effects problem. We compare the conventional priors derived for these problems with other objective Bayesian proposals like the intrinsic priors. It is concluded that both priors behave similarly although interesting subtle differences arise. We adapt the conventional priors to deal with nonnested model selection as well as multiple-model comparison. Finally, we briefly address a generalization of conventional priors to nonnormal scenarios. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

2500|$|Surname laws {{vary around}} the world. Traditionally in many European {{countries}} {{for the past}} few hundred years, it was the custom or law that a woman would on marriage use the surname of her husband and that children of a man would have the father's surname. If a child's paternity was not known, or if the putative father denied paternity, the new-born child would have the surname of the mother. That is still the custom or law in many countries. The surname for children of married parents is usually inherited from the father. In recent years there has been a trend towards <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> in relation to family names, with women being not automatically required or expected, or in some places even forbidden, to take the husband's surname on marriage, and children not automatically being given the father's surname.

6000|$|... "After the {{deposition}} of Abd-ul-Hamid," [...] writes the German authority quoted above, [...] "the Committee of Union and Progress reverted {{more and more}} to the ex-Sultan's policy. To begin with, a rigorous party tyranny was set up. A power behind the Government got the official executive apparatus into its hand, and the elections to Parliament ceased to be free. The appointment of the highest officials in the Empire and of all the most important servants of the administration was settled by decrees of the Committee. All bills had to be debated first by the Committee and to receive its approval before they came before the Chamber. Public policy was determined by two main considerations: (1) The centralistic idea, which claimed for the Turkish race not merely preponderant but exclusive power in the Empire, was to be carried to its logical consequences; (2) The Empire was to be established on a purely Islamic foundation. Turkish Nationalism and the Panislamic Idea precluded a priori any <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> for the various races and religions of the Empire, and any movement which looked for the salvation of the Empire in the decentralisation or autonomy of its various parts was branded as high treason. The nationalistic and centralistic tendency was directed not merely against the various non-Mohammedan nationalities --Greeks, Armenians, Syrians, and Jews--but also against the non-Turkish Mohammedan nations--Arabs, Mohammedan Syrians, Kurds, and the Shia element in the population. An idol of 'Pan-Turkism' was erected, and all non-Turkish elements in the population were subjected to the harshest measures. The rigorous action which this policy prescribed against the Albanians, who were mostly Mohammedans and had been thorough loyalists till then, led to the loss of almost the whole of European Turkey. The same policy has provoked insurrections in the Arab half of the Empire, which a series of campaigns has failed to suppress. The conflict with the Arab element continues"--this was written in 1916--"though the 'Holy War' has forced it to a certain extent into the background." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{first of}} {{judicial}} virtues, impartiality, is an obligation of justice, partly {{for the reason}} last mentioned; as being a necessary condition of the fulfilment of the other obligations of justice. But {{this is not the}} only source of the exalted rank, among human obligations, of those maxims of equality and impartiality, which, both in popular estimation and in that of the most enlightened, are included among the precepts of justice. In one point of view, they may be considered as corollaries from the principles already laid down. If it is a duty to do to each according to his deserts, returning good for good as well as repressing evil by evil, it necessarily follows that we should treat all equally well (when no higher duty forbids) who have deserved equally well of us, and that society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it, that is, who have deserved equally well absolutely. This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice; towards which all institutions, and the efforts of all virtuous citizens, should be made in the utmost possible degree to converge. But this great moral duty rests upon a still deeper foundation, being a direct emanation from the first principle of morals, and not a mere logical corollary from secondary or derivative doctrines. It is involved in the very meaning of Utility, or the Greatest-Happiness Principle. That principle is a mere form of words without rational signification, unless one person's happiness, supposed equal in degree (with the proper allowance made for kind), is counted for exactly as much as another's. Those conditions being supplied, Bentham's dictum, 'everybody to count for one, nobody for more than one,' might be written under the principle of utility as an explanatory commentary.[D] The equal claim of everybody to happiness in the estimation of the moralist and the legislator, involves an equal claim to all the means of happiness, except in so far as the inevitable conditions of human life, and the general interest, in which that of every individual is included, set limits to the maxim; and those limits ought to be strictly construed. As every other maxim of justice, so this, is by no means applied or held applicable universally; on the contrary, as I have already remarked, it bends to every person's ideas of social expediency. But in whatever case it is deemed applicable at all, it is held to be the dictate of justice. All persons are deemed to have a right to <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment,</b> except when some recognised social expediency requires the reverse. And hence all social inequalities which have ceased to be considered expedient, assume the character not of simple inexpediency, but of injustice, and appear so tyrannical, that people are apt to wonder how they ever could have been tolerated; forgetful that they themselves perhaps tolerate other inequalities under an equally mistaken notion of expediency, the correction of which would make that which they approve seem quite as monstrous as what they have at last learnt to condemn. The entire history of social improvement has been a series of transitions, by which one custom or institution after another, from being a supposed primary necessity of social existence, has passed into the rank of an universally stigmatized injustice and tyranny. So it has been with the distinctions of slaves and freemen, nobles and serfs, patricians and plebeians; and so it will be, and in part already is, with the aristocracies of colour, race, and sex.|$|E
