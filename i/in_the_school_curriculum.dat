25|$|In England, the Department for Education and Skills {{produced}} Developing {{the global}} dimension <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>curriculum,</b> a publication for head teachers, teachers, senior managers {{and those with}} responsibility for curriculum development. It aims {{to show how the}} global dimension can be integrated in the curriculum and across the school. It provides examples of how to integrate the global dimension from age 3 to age 16, outlining eight key concepts – global citizenship, conflict resolution, diversity, human rights, interdependence, sustainable development, values and perceptions, and social justice. For example, it gives guidance for the promotion of personal, social and emotional development of the youngest learners through discussion of photographs of children from around the world, activities, stories, and discussion of different places children have visited.|$|E
25|$|The Aosta Valley is {{nowadays}} {{the only}} {{region of the}} Franco-Provençal area where this language is still widely spoken as native by all age ranges of the population. Several events have combined to stabilize the language (Valdôtain dialect) in this region since 1948. An {{amendment to the constitution}} of Italy changed the status of the former province to an autonomous region which gives the Aosta Valley special powers to make its own decisions. Residents saw the region's economy expand and the population increase from 1951 to 1991, which encouraged them to stay and continue long-held traditions. The language is now explicitly protected by an Italian presidential decree and a federal law. Further, a regional law passed by the government in Aosta requires educators to promote knowledge of Franco-Provençal language and culture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>curriculum.</b> Several cultural groups, libraries, and theatre companies are fostering a sense of ethnic pride with their active use of the Valdôtain dialect as well (EUROPA, 2005).|$|E

At the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and {{the largest number of}} seats (56) in the House Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the Māori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English announced that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First announced a coalition arrangement with the opposition Labour Party. English was succeeded as Prime Minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October.|$|E

2500|$|World War I {{affected}} {{children in}} the United States through several social and economic changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>curriculum</b> and through shifts in parental relationships. For example, a number of fathers and brothers entered the war, and many were subsequently maimed in action or killed, causing many children to be brought up by single mothers. Additionally, as the male workforce left for battle, mothers and sisters began working in factories to take their positions, and the family dynamic began to change; this affected children as they had less {{time to spend with}} family members and were expected to grow up faster and help with the war effort. [...] Similarly, Woodrow Wilson called on children involved in youth organizations to help collect money for war bonds and stamps in order {{to raise money for the}} war effort. This was very important because the children were having a direct effect on the financial state of the United States government during World War I. [...] As children were collecting large amounts of money outside of school, within the classroom, curriculum also began to change as a result of the war. [...] Woodrow Wilson again became involved with these children as he implemented government pamphlets and programs to encourage war support through things like mandatory patriotism and nationalism classes multiple times a week. Even though war was not being fought on United States soil, children's lives were greatly affected as all of these changes were made to their daily lives as a result of the conflict.|$|E
