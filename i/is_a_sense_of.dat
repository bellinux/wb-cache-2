5|$|The western slopes fall {{smoothly}} to {{the head}} of Thirlmere reservoir, and the tiny church at Wythburn. There are rougher areas, High and Comb Crags in particular, but these do little to change the overall impression of high moorland. The lower slopes have been planted with conifers as part of the Thirlmere Forest, but above this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> wide open space. Nethermost Pike's toehold on the valley is shifted a little to the south, relative to its position on the ridge. This is because Whelpside and Birkside Gills, its boundary streams, both run south-west, rather than flowing straight down the slope.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{religions}} being {{followed by the}} people of this city. Usually there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> harmony and co-existence without incident. However, there have been situations in the past in which this delicate social fabric has broken down. Today the city {{is considered to be a}} great example of communal equality.|$|E

25|$|Deep democracy, as the {{psychologist}} Arnold Mindell {{points out in}} his book, The Leader as Martial Artist, is a timeless feeling of shared compassion for all living beings. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the value and importance of the whole, including and especially our own personal reality. Deeply democratic people value every organ in their body {{as well as their}} inner feelings, needs, desires, thoughts and dreams.|$|E
25|$|Klingons see {{something}} that isn't growing as something that is dying. A Klingon fights not for sport but to gain an advantage for the Empire, for his family and for himself. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> paranoia, as others are constantly watching all one's activities in order to seek advancement. This leads to a morality that Federation races see as often cruel and remorseless.|$|E
25|$|According to some scholars, {{what both}} {{religion}} and spirituality {{have in common}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the supernatural, while others see supernatural thought unnecessary for spirituality. In colonial America, some people had a supernatural curiosity that was often combined with free-thinking rationalism advocated by intellectuals such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Robert Fuller has characterized the SBNR phenomenon as a mix of intellectual progressivism and mystical hunger, impatient with the piety of established churches.|$|E

25|$|Croatian, Portuguese and Italian fishing families, {{many of them}} Catholic, founded San Pedro. Content {{with the}} beauty of the hills rising from the harbor, they built their homes, their church, their {{businesses}} and dutifully produced large families to do the same. More than 100 years later, some of their children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren live in those family homes, work still on the docks or in town and worship still at Mary Star of the Sea. The town's population has remained steady for the last two decades, and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> continuity that is palpable in this town, an intimacy--among the people, and between the people and the place.|$|E
25|$|Lyrical {{abstraction}} shares similarities {{with color}} field painting and abstract expressionism {{especially in the}} freewheeling usage of paint — texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color field painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from abstract expressionism and action painting of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in lyrical abstraction there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.|$|E
25|$|The pair were {{nominated}} for the Turner Prize in 1999, cited for their exhibition, Gamma at the Lisson Gallery in London. On the run up to the Turner Prize winner announcement, they also had a solo exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London (1999). Art works that were exhibited included Stasi City, Parliament (A Third House), and Gamma, a multiscreen video installation that was filmed at the former US military base at Greenham Common in Berkshire. This site was used to house nuclear cruise missiles during the Cold War and decommissioned in 1992. The Wilsons' video moves through the deserted institution, where nothing is now happening, evoking disturbing memories and possibilities. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> unease and threat, implied but never realised. They are the only characters in the film, appearing in military-style skirts and polished black shoes.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{praised the}} {{production}} design, scale model work, matte paintings, cinematography, and characters. [...] "But {{the problem with}} the movie is that it's all surface and no substance," [...] Ebert wrote. [...] "Not even the slightest attempt is made to suggest that the film takes its own story seriously. Everything is style. The performances seem deliberately angled as satire." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post described The Hudsucker Proxy as being [...] "pointlessly flashy and compulsively overloaded with references to films of the 1930s. Missing in this film's performances <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humanity, the crucial ingredient in the movies Hudsucker is clearly trying to evoke. Hudsucker isn't the real thing at all. It's just a proxy." ...|$|E
500|$|Degrassi: The Next Generation has {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly has called it [...] "a cult hit", and The New York Times named it [...] "Tha Best Teen TV N da WRLD (The best teen TV in the world)".

60|$|Violet blushed excessively, {{and made}} some inarticulate disavowals. She felt it {{presumption}} to let her name be coupled with Miss Martindale's, and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> something dangerous and wrong in expecting admiration.|$|R
50|$|There {{were several}} reasons for the low number of electoral contests. One issue <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{political}} apathy, whilst the other was that the immense costs of standing for election dissuaded individuals from standing.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the development}} of Super Mario Sunshine with producer Takashi Tezuka and directors Yoshiaki Koizumi and Kenta Usui, it was mentioned that the game's development began with the idea of gameplay involving a water pump. However, at first the developers thought that the world was too daringly out of character with Mario. Therefore, they tried using a man-type character, but thought this was too odd and that [...] "if there was a man next to Mario, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> incongruity." [...] There were ten candidates for possible water nozzles, and FLUDD was chosen because of fitting in the game's setting, despite it not being one of the favorites. They also stated that several Yoshi features were omitted, such as Yoshi vomiting water fed to him.|$|E
500|$|Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times {{said that}} Man of Steel covered no new ground {{with regard to}} Superman films, and instead, [...] "we're plunged back into a mostly-underwhelming film, with {{underdeveloped}} characters and supercharged-fight scenes that drag on and offer nothing new {{in the way of}} special-effects creativity". [...] The Boston Globes Ty Burr wrote, [...] "What’s missing from this Superman saga <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> lightness, of pop joy". The Washington Posts Ann Hornaday stated that with [...] "Hans Zimmer’s turgid, over-produced score", the film [...] "is an exceptionally-unpleasant viewing experience". For The Denver Posts Lisa Kennedy, the chief problem with Man of Steel is the [...] "rhythm and balance in the storytelling and directing" [...] which resulted in a film that swings [...] "between destructive overstatement and flat-footed homilies." ...|$|E
