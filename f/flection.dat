50|$|A microburin is a {{fragment}} of a lithic flake, or more precisely, of a lithic blade, that shows on its upper face {{the beginnings of a}} notch terminating in an oblique <b>flection</b> (whose surface can only be seen from the lower side) that ends in a very acute trihedral apex. As stated earlier, it was thought that microburins were functional microliths, but carving experiments, along with the reassembly of pieces with perfectly aligned edges have demonstrated that they were a characteristic waste of a technique called microburin technique, or more correctly microburin blow technique. Following a study of thousands of microburins originating from a variety of saharan sites Jacques Tixier noted that none of the pieces showed traces of intentional use, this finding confirms the finding of the analysis of European pieces.Examples found in Europe can be seen on this page : http://www.archeobase.be/page_microburins_meso.html.

50|$|The microburin {{technique}} {{is a special}} procedure for cutting up lithic blades which yields fragments {{that can be used}} in the manufacture of utensils. The usable fragments are basically geometric microliths. This technique has been recorded through the Old World, from at least the Mesolithic. It has also been recorded from the later phases of the Upper Paleolithic, as triangular and trapeze shaped microliths have been found from the end of the French Magdalenian although they are very rare. The microburin blow technique has not been found, at present, in the New World.The technique consists of taking a blade (a flake can also be used) and placing its upper end against a support with a sharp edge (as occurs in the use of an anvil). A notch is then made and enlarged using light blows or by pressing the edge of the piece against the angled edge of the support. The notch is enlarged until the lithic blade snaps with a gentle but positive action (<b>flection).</b>|$|E

It was approximately 2.5 - 6 kg in weight, with sixteenth-century military writer Sir John Smythe recommending lighter rather than heavier pikes. It had a wooden shaft with an iron or steel spearhead affixed. The shaft near the head was often reinforced with metal strips called [...] "cheeks" [...] or langets. When the troops of opposing armies both carried the pike, it often grew {{in a sort of}} arms race, getting longer in both shaft and head length to give one side's pikemen an edge in combat. The extreme length of such weapons required a strong wood such as well-seasoned ash for the pole, which was tapered towards the point to prevent the pike from sagging on the ends, although drooping or slight <b>flection</b> of the shaft was always a problem in pike handling. It is a common mistake to refer to a bladed polearm as a pike; such weapons are more generally halberds, glaives or voulges.|$|E

Although AVO analysis of welded interface like geologi- cal layer boundaries is common, the use of AVO variations for nonwelded boundaries like fractures {{is yet to be}} investigated. We conduct laboratory experiments to measure reflection re- sponses of dry and wet fractures. The observed P-P reflec- tions of the fracture and the fracture aperture are very well pre- dicted by the nonwelded interface model. We invert the angle- dependent P-P reflectivity of the fracture to estimate both nor- mal and tangential fracture compliances. The estimated value of the normal compliance is accurate, and it is also possible to obtain the value of the non-zero tangential compliance. We find that supplementing the information of converted P-S re- <b>flections</b> in the AVO inversion greatly improves the estimate of the tangential compliance.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is the {{characterization}} of the mechanic properties and the constitutive law, for the usual utilization in the design practice, of the composite Fiber reinforced concrete material (FRC). Nowadays in this field a great interest is represented for this material, both new structural element construction and external application of a thin layer in old or damaged conventional concrete elements. The addition of polymeric or steel fibers to a cementitious matrix increases the tensile strength and provides a residual strength in tension: this condition particularly proves, for usual content of fiber (1 % - 2 %), that the FRC material presents softening branches and residual strength; on the contrary for larger content of fiber (almost 4 %) the global response of the FRC material is ductile and the dangerous phenomena of strain localization generated near the cracks is more reduced. This condition produces the possibility of optimal use of the new material in the structural design (also for strengthening intervention) because it assures adequate ductility in order to dissipate the energy related expecialy to seismic phenomena. It’s required a deep evaluation of the constitutive material response; for the constitutive law identification the international and Italian guidelines suggest a “prestactional” approach. In Italy the CNR DT 204 / 2006 document proposes the mechanical characterization with the direct traction test or the undirected 4 points <b>flections</b> test. The equivalent constitutive response obtained with this method is also simplified. In this paper the constitutive law of FRC and the influence of fibers content is evaluated with experimental analysis for the three points <b>flections</b> - beams and for special traction specimens in accordance with CNR DT 204 / 2006. There are also proposed a numerical model and an analytical model that reproduce the experimental tests; the analytical and numerical models are based on the study of a cracked element and these models account for cracking, material non-linearity, tension-stiffening effects and presence of slip at the interfaces (the last one assumption only for analytical model). The numerical model allows catching bi - dimensional and three – dimensional aspects. It’s shown a good agreement in the graphic results in the paper. Finally, in order to define the optimum material for construction or strengthening intervention in seismic area, the ductility of r. c. real beams in FRC or r. c. real beams damaged for vertical and seismic actions (and then reinforced with FRC material with high performance) is evaluated with analytical and numerical examples...|$|R

However, upper mantle reflections from these depths were not observed on marine-reflection profiles collected in San Francisco Bay, nor were they reported from a refraction profile on San Francisco Peninsula.

40|$|The current paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} to Spanish zero pronoun resolution {{in the context of}} Spanish to Korean Machine Translation (MT). Spanish is one of the well-known 'pro-drop' languages so that especially a subject pronoun is often omitted, if it can be inferred from the linguistic as well as non-linguistic context. In Spanish to Korean MT the omitted subject doesn't need to be restored in many cases as Korean also allows a zero subject. However, there are some cases where the omitted subject must be identified to ensure a correct translation. To restore the omitted subject, linguistic clues can be employed, as Spanish verbs undergo morphological <b>flections</b> with respect to the gender and number. However, there still remain some ambiguous cases in which there are more than two possible subject candidates for the specific verb endings. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to resolve Spanish zero subject that integrates linguistic knowledge (morphological information) and artificial intelligence knowledge (machine learning approach). We proposed 11 linguistically motivated features for ML (Machine Learning). Our approach has been implemented with WEKA 3. 6. 10 and evaluated by using 10 fold cross validation method. The accuracy of the proposed method reached 83. 6 % while the baseline method that randomly chooses a possible subject candidate among three most frequent subject types shows only 33. 3 % accuracy rate. ...|$|R
