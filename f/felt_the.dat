5|$|Some {{historians have}} argued that the Ford {{administration}} <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot. But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.|$|E

50|$|Conventional roll presses are {{configured}} {{with one}} of the press rolls is in a fixed position, with a mating roll being loaded against this fixed roll. <b>The</b> <b>felts</b> run through <b>the</b> nips of the press rolls and continues around a felt run, normally consisting of several <b>felt</b> rolls. During <b>the</b> dwell time in the nip, the moisture from the sheet is transferred to <b>the</b> press <b>felt.</b> When <b>the</b> press <b>felt</b> exits <b>the</b> nip and continues around, a vacuum box known as an Uhle Box applies vacuum (normally -60 kPa) to <b>the</b> press <b>felt</b> to remove <b>the</b> moisture so that when <b>the</b> <b>felt</b> returns to <b>the</b> nip on the next cycle, it does not add moisture to the sheet.|$|R

5|$|A minor {{controversy}} about the trophy occurred in 1984, when Donald Wandrei refused his Life Achievement award as he <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> award bust was a demeaning caricature of Lovecraft, {{whom he had}} known personally.

30|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, the p.r. shoe has {{two layers}} of orange felt glued to its sole, while the p.l. shoe has a single layer. No significant visual differences in <b>the</b> <b>felts</b> were apparent otherwise. PLM samples of <b>the</b> orange outer <b>felt</b> from both shoes were observed to be composed of a mixture of fiber that contains orange-dyed wool as it major component. Minor amounts of other fibers, mostly colorless, were also observed by PLM. <b>The</b> <b>felt</b> from <b>the</b> p.l. shoe also contained some undyed wool, which was not seen in <b>the</b> <b>felt</b> from <b>the</b> p.r. shoe. This finding suggests <b>the</b> <b>felts</b> for <b>the</b> two shoes may be different, but {{the small size of}} <b>the</b> <b>felt</b> samples prevented conclusive determination. The wool fibers have the surface structure of overlapping scales typical of wool. Average fiber widths are 24  µm for the p.r. shoe and 30  µm for the p.l. shoe, well within the reported range for wool, which varies from 10 to 70  µm depending on the fiber type and species [2].|$|R
50|$|According to Gendlin, the Focusing process makes a felt sense more {{tangible}} {{and easier to}} work with. To help <b>the</b> <b>felt</b> sense form and to accurately identify its meaning, the focuser tries out words that might express it. These words can be tested against <b>the</b> <b>felt</b> sense: <b>The</b> <b>felt</b> sense will not resonate with a word or phrase that does not adequately describe it.|$|R

5|$|After Jefferson's {{retirement}} from public life in 1809, Adams became more vocal. He published a three-year marathon of {{letters in the}} Boston Patriot newspaper, refuting line-by-line an 1800 pamphlet by Hamilton which attacked his conduct and character. Though Hamilton had died in 1804 in a duel with Aaron Burr, Adams <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need to vindicate his character against the New Yorker's vehement charges.|$|E
5|$|After the war, many Presbyterian leaders <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need {{to adopt}} a new {{organizational}} structure. The Synod of New York and Philadelphia {{was intended to be}} an annual gathering of the members of all presbyteries and one elder from every congregation. Over half the members, however, were frequently absent due to long travel distances, and this prevented the Synod from functioning effectively.|$|E
5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> Act {{would survive}} a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case was not a good test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E

50|$|Roll roofing is a bitumen {{product that}} is exposed to the weather.

5|$|At eight {{tracks and}} 37 minutes in length, The King of Limbs is Radiohead's {{shortest}} album.

500|$|Commentary on {{gameplay}} {{was generally}} positive. G4TV's reviewer lauded the destructible environments, but <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> gameplay lacked variation. The reviewer from VideoGamer.com {{noted that the}} co-operative gameplay was strong, and that the addition of online play [...] "opens the [...] up to {{a wider range of}} people." [...] PALGN's Jeremy Jastrzab <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> game's menus were convoluted and difficult to navigate, and also <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> game began to drag {{near the end of the}} story. GameTrailers's reviewer The inclusion of additional mutant powers and online gameplay were points of praise. GameSpot's Greg Mueller praised the game's vast cast of characters, destructible environments and unlockable content, but <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> user interface was awkward. Mueller also <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> game loaded content far too frequently. GamesRadar's Raymond Padilla had similar complaints about the frequency and length of the game's load times. Padilla praised the addition of online play and the automatic upgrade system.|$|R
50|$|However, Mike Newmark {{writing for}} PopMatters was {{critical}} of the album's length, and <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> music's ambient nature made it seem even longer. Newmark also <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> sound of Pinhas' guitar and Merzbow's noise was dated and no longer innovative.|$|R
500|$|The {{gameplay}} received very mixed reviews, {{with the}} artificial intelligence universally derided and other gameplay elements garnering {{a range of}} opinions. Bozon said that [...] "the A.I. {{can be a real}} pain, as characters often take extremely odd routes to destinations or show command issues when engaging enemies", Joe Juba of Game Informer called the pathfinding [...] "laughably terrible", a criticism echoed by Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com, and Parkin called it [...] "an unmitigated disaster". VanOrd termed it [...] "the worst, most broken system of unit pathfinding ever devised", and Gann felt it was so bad that it showed that the developers [...] "had no idea what they were doing" [...] in making an RTS. Bozon <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> overall real-time strategy gameplay, however, was deep, if a bit slow, as did VanOrd. Parkin <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> gameplay was [...] "easy and intuitive", though slow, while Parish <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> limitations of the Nintendo DS's small screens made the game too streamlined for an RTS game. Juba and <b>the</b> GamePro reviewer <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> restrictions necessary to fit an RTS on a system the size of the DS made the game too simple and easy. The Japanese Famitsu review, however, <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> game worked well as an RTS for the Nintendo DS, and was well-suited to the console. Both Bozon and Parish <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> local multiplayer was better than the single-player game, though Bozon <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> lack of online multiplayer was stifling and VanOrd <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> tie between the multiplayer game and the player's single-player progress imbalanced any game where both players had not fully completed the storyline.|$|R

5|$|Joe Law of GameFocus {{criticized the}} Rage Gage system, stating {{that it had}} been done better in other games.

Nick Valentino of GameZone praised the game, calling it the best RPG {{to make use of the}} Dragon Ball label, and the game was the perfect {{introduction}} into the franchise. Mike Moehnke of RPGamer cited the games as not being perfect, but was superior to the Super Famicom game Legend of the Super Saiyan.
