50|$|In the 16th {{century the}} abbey was badly {{damaged by the}} <b>Geuzes</b> {{and most of the}} monks fled, leaving a {{community}} of four. It was rebuilt in the 17th century, but the constant wars and its location outside the walls of Bruges exposed it to further damage.|$|R
50|$|In 1566 {{the sisters}} were {{forced by the}} <b>Geuzes</b> to flee into Bruges, where they had just bought a house of refuge, St. Bavo's on the Garenmarkt. They were able to return in 1567, but had to flee again in 1572, and were obliged to sell all their goods. The abbey was plundered by the Gentenaars in 1579 and set on fire in 1580. Later the abbey farm was also troubled first by marauding Spanish troops and later by French ones.|$|R
50|$|The abbey {{perished in}} the wars that {{accompanied}} the Reformation. In 1580 the buildings, including the priceless library and the monastery archives, were destroyed by fire after an attack by the <b>Geuzes.</b> The monks fled to their town house in Groningen. Most of the abandoned abbey buildings were soon demolished and the resulting rubble put to use as building stone for {{the inhabitants of the}} surrounding countryside. The abbey {{is believed to have been}} formally dissolved in 1594. The last abbot died in 1613.|$|R

5000|$|... 3 Fonteinen {{was founded}} in 1887 as a café and geuzestekerij, a place where <b>geuze</b> is {{produced}} by blending old and new lambics, acquired from other breweries. The enterprise was bought by Gaston De Belder in 1953, who expanded it with a restaurant and left it to his sons Armand and Guido in 1982. In 1998, a brewery installation was bought. Apart from using its own lambic, 3 Fonteinen uses lambic made by Boon, Girardin and Lindemans for its <b>geuze.</b> 3 Fonteinen {{is one of the}} few remaining geuzestekerijen. The Mijol Club, a literary club, founded by Herman Teirlinck, used to convene in the café. In May 2009, a faulty thermostat caused 3000 bottles to explode. The remaining overheated <b>geuze</b> was made into an eau de vie called [...] "Armand's Spirit", the sales of which enough allowed the brewery to continue operations. In March 2013, after four years of interruption, Brewery 3 Fonteinen inaugurated its new brewing installation and is brewing its own lambic again. During the four year without its own installation 3 Fonteinen managed to keep its head above water by blending lambic that they bought from nearby lambic breweries like Boon and Girardin.|$|E

The bridge has stairs, requiring bicycles to be pushed on a stairway ramp.|$|E
50|$|Gueuze (or <b>Geuze)</b> {{is a type}} of lambic, a Belgian beer. It is made by {{blending}} young (1-year-old) and old (2- to 3-year-old) lambics, {{which is}} bottled for a second fermentation. Because the young lambics are not fully fermented, the blended beer contains fermentable sugars, which allow a second fermentation to occur. Lambic that undergoes a second fermentation in the presence of sour cherries before bottling results in kriek lambic, a beer closely related to gueuze.|$|E

50|$|The Zilverparkkade was {{conceptualized}} by Adriaan <b>Geuze</b> of {{the urban}} planning and landscaping bureau West 8, who envisaged it as a mixed development of both office and residential use, with 10 narrow plots for separate buildings of differing height. Every building was designed by a different architect, resulting in a striking postmodernist lineup of facades. The concept {{of a number of}} different narrow, tall facades mirrors the historic canal house arrangement typical of many Dutch cities. Due to its modern and tall appearance, it is also compared to arrangements such as the Vlissingen seaside boulevard.|$|E
5000|$|At the book's conclusion, Thyl and Nele {{experience}} at night a magical vision, with mythical beings uttering {{to them a}} prophecy about a future time of reconciliation between North and South (i.e. what would become The Netherlands and Belgium). In the aftermath, Uilenspiegel lies cold and unmoving, as if dead. The grieving Nele gets him buried, and a Catholic priest gloats [...] "Uilenspiegel, the Great <b>Geuze,</b> is dead!" [...] when suddenly the sandy grave is heaving, and Uilenspiegel emerges alive and hale. The priest flees in panic, while Thyl and Nele depart singing to yet further adventures.|$|E
5000|$|The Gardens have {{attracted}} more than 1 million {{visitors a year}} since 2012. Plans for growth and expansion for the next four decades began in 2010 with the hiring of West 8, a Dutch landscape architecture and urban planning firm with headquarters in Rotterdam and an office in New York City. The founder of West 8, Adriaan <b>Geuze,</b> stated their mission is: [...] "to celebrate Longwood, enjoy it, keep it, preserve it, while asking how it could function as a spectacular place for larger groups of people in the 21st century." [...] The comprehensive Longwood plan is now complete and the first major project in the plan, the revitalization of the Main Fountain Garden, began in 2014.|$|E
5000|$|West 8's urban {{planning}} projects include striking new conceptions, {{such as the}} Schouwburgplein in Rotterdam, a large public square made of a lightweight metal structure which [...] "floats" [...] {{on top of the}} roof of a parking garage. <b>Geuze</b> has been credited with having [...] "almost single-handedly re-established landscape on the agenda of Dutch urbanism and is now taking his influence global in designing open spaces in or around buildings by most of the best Dutch contemporary architects."West 8 brings landscape architecture into city planning in a functionalist and pragmatic way; since the distinction between town and country in places like the Netherlands has largely disappeared, novel ideas for landscape use are often called for by city planners to fulfill the needs of modern urbanites.|$|E
50|$|Oud Beersel is an artisanal Lambic brewery, {{based in}} Beersel and founded in 1882 by Henri Vandervelden. His son Louis, {{and then his}} {{grandson}} Henri, subsequently took over. The brewery remained {{in the same family}} until 2002. In 1991, it was taken over by Henri's nephew Danny Draps. In 2002, the brewing activities were stopped, due to financial problems. In 2005, driven by an interest in reviving the artisanal Oud Beersel kriek and <b>geuze,</b> two young men (Gert Christiaens and Roland De Bus) restarted the brewery. In order to finance the relaunch, the brewery is selling 2 beers called Bersalis Tripel and Bersalis Kadet, which are not lambic-based beers and are actually made by another brewery (the Huyghe Brewery in Melle). Bersalis is the Latin name of the city Beersel.|$|E
50|$|In April 2010, {{the city}} entered an {{agreement}} to take full control of the island's development {{from the state of}} New York through a newly established Trust for Governors Island, and unveiled a new master development plan. Under the plan, the historic northern end will remain structurally unchanged. The middle of the island would be developed into a park stretching to the southern tip. Areas on the east and west sides of the island will be privately developed to generate revenue, and the entire island will be edged by a circumferential promenade. The 40 acre park, designed by Adriaan <b>Geuze</b> of the Dutch landscape architecture firm West 8 would feature playing fields, woodland, and hills built of the rubble of the disused 20th-century buildings sculpted to frame views of the Statue of Liberty and other New York landmarks. The southern end of the park would meet the water in a series of wetlands.|$|E
50|$|The {{first major}} event {{to do with}} 'landscape urbanism' was the Landscape Urbanism conference {{sponsored}} by the Graham Foundation in Chicago in April 1997. Speakers included Charles Waldheim, Mohsen Mostafavi, James Corner of James Corner/Field Operations, Alex Wall, and Adriaan <b>Geuze</b> of the firm West 8, among others. The formative period of Landscape Urbanism {{can be traced back}} to RMIT University and University of Pennsylvania in the late 1980s, at a time when Peter Connolly, Richard Weller, James Corner, Mohsen Mostafavi, and others were exploring the artificial boundaries of Landscape Architecture, Urban Design and Architecture, searching for better ways to deal with complex urban projects. However, their texts cite and synthesize the ideas of influential modernist methods, programmes and manifestoes that appeared in the early twentieth century. Charles Waldheim, Anu Mathur, Alan Berger, Chris Reed, amongst others, were students at the University of Pennsylvania during this formative period for Landscape Urbanism. After the Chicago conference, European design schools and North American design institutions formed academic programs and began to formalize a field of Landscape Urbanism studies, including the University of Toronto, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Oslo School of Architecture http://www.aho.no/en/aho/Institutes/Urbanism-and-landscape/, Massachusetts Institute of Technology http://web.mit.edu/landscapeurbanism/, Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium http://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02Q2AE.htm, the University of Illinois at Chicago and London's Architectural Association.|$|E
