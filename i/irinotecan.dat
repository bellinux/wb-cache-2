5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} {{have been found}} to be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and <b>irinotecan)</b> in induction which {{have been found to}} be effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan, and <b>irinotecan</b> are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, etoposide or vinorelbine.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as inoperable (unresectable) disease in which case patients are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Chemotherapy {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, <b>irinotecan,</b> or capecitabine. A small pilot study suggested possible benefit from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E

25|$|A 2014 {{investigation}} made {{a screening}} of various drugs for anti-glioblastoma activity and identified 22 drugs with potent anti-glioblastoma activity, including the combination of <b>irinotecan</b> and statins.|$|E
25|$|Intraperitoneal {{chemotherapy}} {{has also}} been under investigation during the 2000s and 2010s for its potential to deliver higher doses of cytotoxic agent to tumors. Preliminary trials with cisplatin and paclitaxel have shown it is not well tolerated, but does improve survival, and more tolerable regimens are being researched. Cisplatin and paclitaxel are both being researched as intraperitoneal chemotherapy agents. A specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clear-cell cancers is also under investigation: <b>irinotecan</b> combined with cisplatin.|$|E
25|$|Although other {{combinations}} of drugs have occasionally {{been shown to}} be noninferior at various endpoints and in some subgroups of patients, the combination of cisplatin or carboplatin plus etoposide or <b>irinotecan</b> are considered comparable first-line regimens for SCLC. For patients who do not respond to first line therapy, or who relapse after complete remission, topotecan is the only agent which has been definitively shown to offer increased survival over best supportive care (BSC), although in Japan amirubicin is considered effective as salvage therapy.|$|E
25|$|Two topoisomerase I inhibitors, <b>irinotecan</b> and topotecan, are semi-synthetically {{derived from}} camptothecin, which is {{obtained}} from the Chinese ornamental tree Camptotheca acuminata. Drugs that target topoisomerase II {{can be divided into}} two groups. The topoisomerase II poisons cause increased levels enzymes bound to DNA. This prevents DNA replication and transcription, causes DNA strand breaks, and leads to programmed cell death (apoptosis). These agents include etoposide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and teniposide. The second group, catalytic inhibitors, are drugs that block the activity of topoisomerase II, and therefore prevent DNA synthesis and translation because the DNA cannot unwind properly. This group includes novobiocin, merbarone, and aclarubicin, which also have other significant mechanisms of action.|$|E
25|$|Another drug class {{originating}} from the NCI was the camptothecins. Camptothecin, {{derived from a}} Chinese ornamental tree, inhibits topoisomerase I, an enzyme that allows DNA unwinding. Despite showing promise in preclinical studies, the agent had little antitumour activity in early clinical trials, and dosing was limited by kidney toxicity: its lactone ring is unstable at neutral pH, so while in the acidic environment of the kidneys it becomes active, damaging the renal tubules. In 1996 a more stable analogue, <b>irinotecan,</b> won Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval {{for the treatment of}} colon cancer. Later, this agent would also be used to treat lung and ovarian cancers.|$|E
25|$|Each {{phenotype}} {{is based}} upon the allelic variation within the individual genotype. However, several genetic events can influence a same phenotypic trait, and establishing genotype-to-phenotype relationships can thus be far from consensual with many enzymatic patterns. For instance, the influence of the CYP2D6*1/*4 allelic variant on the clinical outcome in patients treated with Tamoxifen remains debated today. In oncology, genes coding for DPD, UGT1A1, TPMT, CDA involved in the pharmacokinetics of 5-FU/capecitabine, <b>irinotecan,</b> 6-mercaptopurine and gemcitabine/cytarabine, respectively, have all been described as being highly polymorphic. A strong body of evidence suggests that patients affected by these genetic polymorphisms will experience severe/lethal toxicities upon drug intake, and that pre-therapeutic screening does help {{to reduce the risk of}} treatment-related toxicities through adaptive dosing strategies.|$|E
2500|$|Some cancer {{treatments}} like bexarotene, busulfan, chlorambucil, estramustine, etoposide, flutamide, idarubicin, ifosfamide, <b>irinotecan,</b> ixabepilone, letrozole, lomustine, megestrol, mitomycin, mitoxantrone, paclitaxel, procarbazine, tamoxifen, topotecan ...|$|E
2500|$|Camptothecin (CPT) is a {{cytotoxic}} quinoline alkaloid which inhibits the DNA enzyme topoisomerase I (topo I). It {{was discovered}} in 1966 by M. E. Wall and M. C. Wani in systematic [...] of natural products for anticancer drugs. It was isolated from the bark and stem of Camptotheca acuminata (Camptotheca, Happy tree), a tree native to China used as a cancer treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine. CPT showed remarkable anticancer activity in preliminary clinical trials but also low solubility and (high) adverse drug reaction. Because of these disadvantages, synthetic and medicinal chemists have developed numerous syntheses of Camptothecin and various derivatives to increase {{the benefits of the}} chemical, with good results. Two CPT analogues have been approved and are used in cancer chemotherapy today, topotecan and <b>irinotecan.</b>|$|E
2500|$|ABC {{transporters}} {{are known}} to {{play a crucial role}} in the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). In MDR, patients that are on medication eventually develop resistance not only to the drug they are taking but also to several different types of drugs. This is caused by several factors, one of which is increased expulsion of the drug from the cell by ABC transporters. For example, the ABCB1 protein (P-glycoprotein) functions in pumping tumor suppression drugs out of the cell. Pgp also called MDR1, ABCB1, is the prototype of ABC transporters and also the most extensively-studied gene. Pgp is known to transport organic cationic or neutral compounds. A few ABCC family members, also known as MRP, [...] have also been demonstrated to confer MDR to organic anion compounds. The most-studied member in ABCG family is ABCG2, also known as BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) confer resistance to most of Topoisomerase I or II inhibitors such as topotecan, <b>irinotecan,</b> and doxorubicin.|$|E
50|$|SN-38 is an antineoplastic drug. It is {{the active}} {{metabolite}} of <b>irinotecan</b> (an analog of camptothecin - a topoisomerase I inhibitor) but has 1000 times more activity than <b>irinotecan</b> itself. In vitro cytotoxicity assays {{show that the}} potency of SN-38 relative to <b>irinotecan</b> varies from 2- to 2000-fold.|$|E
50|$|In {{the short}} term, <b>irinotecan</b> causes diarrhea, {{which may be}} acute or delayed in onset. Long term use of <b>irinotecan</b> may lead to neutropenia.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, the FDA made {{changes to}} the {{labeling}} of <b>irinotecan</b> to add pharmacogenomics recommendations, such that <b>irinotecan</b> recipients with a homozygous (both of the two gene copies) polymorphism in UGT1A1 gene, to be specific, the *28 variant, should be considered for reduced drug doses. <b>Irinotecan</b> {{is one of the}} first widely used chemotherapy agents that is dosed according to the recipient's genotype.|$|E
5000|$|The briefly attached, covalently bonded TOP1-DNA {{structure}} at the 3' {{end of a}} cleaved DNA {{single strand}} is called a TOP1-DNA cleavage complex, or TOP1cc. The TOP1cc is a specific target of TOP1 inhibitors. One of the first inhibitors shown to target TOP1 is <b>irinotecan.</b> <b>Irinotecan</b> is an analogue of the cytotoxic natural alkaloid camptothecin, obtained from the Chinese tree Camptotheca acuminata. [...] <b>Irinotecan</b> is especially effective through its metabolic product SN-38. <b>Irinotecan</b> and SN-38 act by trapping a subset of TOP1-DNA cleavage complexes, those with a guanine +1 in the DNA sequence. [...] One <b>irinotecan</b> or SN-38 molecule stacks against the base pairs flanking the topoisomerase-induced cleavage site and poisons (inactivates) the TOP1 enzyme. [...] The article Camptothecin lists other analogues of camptothecin and the article Topoisomerase inhibitor lists other compounds which inhibit TOP1.|$|E
50|$|This {{multiphase}} trial {{aimed to}} further evaluate {{the safety of}} tolerability of Abituzumab in combination therapy with cetuximab and <b>irinotecan</b> in the Phase I portion of the trial. Cetixumab, a monoclonal antibody, that targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and <b>irinotecan,</b> a topoisomerase I inhibitor, {{can be used in}} combination as standard of care for treating colorectal cancer. The Phase II portion of the trial sought to compare the efficacy of Abituzumab, cetuximab, and <b>irinotecan</b> compared to cetuximab and <b>irinotecan</b> in patients with KRAS (exon 2) wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients included in the study failed treatment with oxaliplatin, and initial safety studies included comparing Abituzumab, cetuximab, and <b>irinotecan</b> with standard of care. The Phase I study showed that doses up to 1000 mg of Abituzumab, cetuximab, and <b>irinotecan</b> were well tolerated. The results of Phase II showed that the primary endpoint of progression-free survival was not met, but overall survival improved in patients receiving Abituzumab compared to standard of care. The researchers postulate that this could be due to increased expression of αvβ6 integrin in tumors.|$|E

50|$|Genetic {{variations}} {{within the}} UGT1A1 gene {{have also been}} associated with the development of certain drug toxicities. The UGT1A1*28 variant, the same allele behind many cases of Gilbert syndrome, has been associated with an increased risk for neutropenia in patients receiving the chemotherapeutic drug <b>irinotecan,</b> and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends on the <b>irinotecan</b> drug label that patients with the *28/*28 genotype receive a lower starting dose of the drug. The *28 allele has also shown associations with an increased risk for developing diarrhea in patients receiving <b>irinotecan.</b> The UGT1A1*6 variant, more common in Asian populations than the *28 variant, has also shown associations with the development of <b>irinotecan</b> toxicities. Patients who are heterozygous or homozygous for the *6 allele may have a higher risk for developing neutropenia and diarrhea as compared to those with the UGT1A1*1/*1 genotype.|$|E
