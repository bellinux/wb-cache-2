5|$|Pilot whales, mostly short-finned pilot whales, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> {{in captivity}} in various marine parks, arguably {{starting}} the late 1940s. Since 1973, some long-finned pilot whales from New England waters were taken and temporarily kept in captivity. Short-finned pilot whales off southern California, Hawaii and Japan <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> in aquariums and oceanariums. Several pilot whales from southern California and Hawaii {{were taken into}} captivity during the 1960s and early 1970s, two of which were placed at SeaWorld in San Diego. During the 1970s and early 1980s, six pilot whales were captured alive by drive hunts and taken for public display. Pilot whales have historically had low survival rates in captivity, with the average annual survival being 0.51 during the mid-1960s to early 1970s. There {{have been a few}} exceptions to the rule. Bubbles, a female short-finned pilot whale, who was displayed in Marineland of the Pacific and eventually at Sea World California, lived to be somewhere in her 50s when she eventually died on 12 June 2016.|$|E

5|$|After the {{elections}} of 2011, Mirela Holy, who had declared her opposition to the project prior to {{the elections}}, was appointed Minister of Environment and Nature Protection. In 2012 the ministry commissioned four reviews of the EIA. The reviews—one of them supporting the EIA and three disproving the conclusions of the original EIA—were submitted to the Government of Croatia one day after Holy resigned her post, reportedly over an unrelated matter, on 7 June 2012. Objections were raised by authors of the EIA that the reviews were not published {{and the names of}} the authors <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> secret. Prime Minister Zoran Milanović said he wanted to collect opinions from the foremost Croatian, European, and worldwide experts before deciding on the matter, which has been under consideration since the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Bees <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> in hives {{since at}} least the First Dynasty of Egypt, five {{thousand}} years ago, and man had been harvesting honey from the wild long before that. Fixed comb hives are used {{in many parts of the}} world and are made from any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which enable the combs to be removed for processing and extraction of honey. Quite apart from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year on the}} Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, a {{great number}} of devotees come to the monastery, popularly known as Shingjon among Albanians. In the morning, the reliquary is placed {{at the center of the}} church under a canopy, before being opened. After the morning liturgy has been celebrated, {{chanting}} priests carry the reliquary three times around the church, followed by the devotees, who hold lit candles. The reliquary is then placed in front of the church, to be kissed by the believers. The priests give them pieces of cotton that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> inside the reliquary since the previous feast. There are numerous stories about people, both Christians and Muslims, who were healed after they prayed before the saint's relics.|$|E
5|$|Highly distinctive, male lions {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by their manes, and the male's face {{is one of}} the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture.

It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>kept</b> in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire, and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the late eighteenth century.
