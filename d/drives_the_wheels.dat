25|$|Hydrogen {{can be used}} in cars in two ways: {{a source}} of {{combustible}} heat, or a source of electrons for an electric motor. The burning of hydrogen is not being developed in practical terms; it is the hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicle (HFEV) which is garnering all the attention. Hydrogen fuel cells create electricity fed into an electric motor to <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> Hydrogen is not burned, but it is consumed. This means molecular hydrogen, H2, is combined with oxygen to form water. 2H2 (4e−) + O2 --> 2H2O (4e−). The molecular hydrogen and oxygen's mutual affinity drives the fuel cell to separate the electrons from the hydrogen, to use them to power the electric motor, and to return them to the ionized water molecules that were formed when the electron-depleted hydrogen combined with the oxygen in the fuel cell. Recalling that a hydrogen atom {{is nothing more than a}} proton and an electron; in essence, the motor is driven by the proton's atomic attraction to the oxygen nucleus, and the electron's attraction to the ionized water molecule.|$|E
2500|$|As {{seen from}} the vantage point of the earth (e.g. by a spectator), the rotor (acting like a wind turbine) decelerates the air and <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> against the earth, which it accelerates imperceptibly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{general layout}} of the initial {{production}} platform is considered {{by some to be}} a plug-in series hybrid design (since mechanical power initially drives the generator, which in turn charges the battery pack), despite its transmission design that makes it, by definition, a parallel hybrid. Power is drained from the batteries to run the electrical motors which move the vehicle. The internal combustion engine can run at a constant speed for both optimal efficiency and mechanical simplicity (i.e., {{there is no need for}} variable cam phasing). [...] The Voltec, like the Prius, uses a planetary gearset to couple power from two sources to the wheels. Unlike the Prius, the Voltec only rarely <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> with mechanical assist from the engine, and only when battery charge is depleted. The Voltec could therefore be considered a power-split hybrid.|$|E
30|$|In the {{proposed}} method using cooperative control of <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>the</b> linear actuator, the linear actuator stretches to lift <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> onto <b>the</b> step. However, in this motion, <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> could move backwards and lose {{contact with the}} side of the step, and the user {{would not be able to}} control this by electric operation. To avoid this situation, the wheelchair first performs a static wheelie motion on the step to hover the front casters above the ground in advance. By cooperative control of the shrinking motion of the linear actuator and the traction force of <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> then climbs onto the step at the same time that the front casters land on the step. Thus, using this proposed method, <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> can climb over a step without relying on <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> radius. This advantage was also confirmed by an experiment in which <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> climbed over a step higher than its wheel radius.|$|R
30|$|In the experiment, {{the height}} of the step was assumed as 100  mm, just as in the simulation. As {{previously}} described, in the step climbing process of the front casters, the wheelchair performs a static wheelie motion so that the front casters hover above the ground. In the step climbing process of <b>the</b> large <b>wheels,</b> <b>the</b> large <b>wheels</b> hover above <b>the</b> ground until they are at the same height as the step, and in the step climbing process of <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> climbs along <b>the</b> side of the step by cooperative control of the linear actuator and <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> experiment investigated whether the wheelchair could perform these step climbing processes using the constructed mechanism.|$|R

5000|$|MG2 (Primary motor-generator): <b>Drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> and regenerates {{power for}} the HV battery energy storage while braking the vehicle. MG2 <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> with {{electrical}} power generated by the engine-driven MG1 and/or the HVB. During regenerative braking, MG2 acts as a generator, converting kinetic energy into electrical energy, storing this electrical energy in the battery.|$|E

50|$|A gas turbine-electric {{locomotive}}, or GTEL, is {{a locomotive}} {{that uses a}} gas turbine to drive an electrical generator or alternator. The turbine (similar to a turboshaft engine) drives an output shaft, which drives the alternator via a system of gears. The produced electric current powers the traction motors. This type of locomotive was first experimented with in 1920, reaching its peak in the 1950s to 1960s. A related development is the gas turbine locomotive in which the turbine <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> without an intermediate electrical device, {{at the cost of}} mechanical complexity.|$|E
50|$|In motor vehicles, the {{transmission}} generally {{is connected to}} the engine crankshaft via a flywheel or clutch or fluid coupling, partly because internal combustion engines cannot run below a particular speed. The output of {{the transmission}} is transmitted via the driveshaft to one or more differentials, which <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> While a differential may also provide gear reduction, its primary purpose is to permit the wheels at either end of an axle to rotate at different speeds (essential to avoid wheel slippage on turns) as it changes the direction of rotation.|$|E

50|$|For example, Nissan USA {{introduced}} the world's first mass-production electric vehicle, the Nissan Leaf. A plug-in hybrid car, the Chevrolet Volt {{also has been}} produced, using an electric motor to <b>drive</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels,</b> and a small four-cylinder engine to generate additional electricity.|$|R
50|$|An {{internal}} Geneva {{drive is}} a variant on the design. The axis of <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> of <b>the</b> internal <b>drive</b> {{can have a}} bearing only on one side. The angle by which <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> has to rotate to effect one step rotation of <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> is always smaller than 180° in an external Geneva drive and always greater than 180° in an internal one, where the switch time is therefore greater than <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> stands still.|$|R
50|$|The {{drawings}} in Mennons' patent show a locomotive of 0-4-2 wheel arrangement with a cylindrical casing resembling a boiler. At {{the front of}} the casing is the compressor, which Mennons calls a ventilator. This supplies air to a firebox and the hot gases from the firebox drive a turbine {{at the back of the}} casing. The exhaust from the turbine then travels forwards through ducts to preheat the incoming air. The turbine drives the compressor through gearing and an external shaft. There is additional gearing to a jackshaft which <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> through side rods. The fuel is solid (presumably coal, coke or wood) and there is a fuel bunker at the rear.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{the power}} is output by simply {{rotating}} the chain, {{which can be used}} to lift or drag objects. In other situations, a second gear is placed and {{the power is}} recovered by attaching shafts or hubs to this gear. Though drive chains are often simple oval loops, they can also go around corners by placing more than two gears along the chain; gears that do not put power into the system or transmit it out are generally known as idler-wheels. By varying the diameter of the input and output gears with respect to each other, the gear ratio can be altered. For example, when the bicycle pedals' gear rotate once, it causes the gear that <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> to rotate more than one revolution.|$|E
50|$|The Arma 6x6 is {{motorised}} with a 450 hp water-cooled {{turbo diesel}} capable of running on F-34 or F-54 fuel <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> through an automatic gearbox and single-speed transfer box, {{giving it a}} top speed of 105 km/h and a power/weight ratio of 24.3 hp/tonne. This also powers the onboard 24 V DC electrical system, which incorporates two maintenance-free 125 Ah batteries and a 3.3 kW converter. Arma’s front two axles are steerable enabling it to make a turning radius of 7.85 m and the vehicle rides on independent hydropneumatic suspension, offering respectable off-road mobility and comfort. It can negotiate 45-degree approach and departure angles leading onto 60 per cent inclines and 30 per cent side-slopes. It can also cross 1.2 m-wide trenches and climb over 60 cm obstacles.|$|E
50|$|A {{spiral bevel}} gear is a bevel gear with helical teeth. The main {{application}} of this is in a vehicle differential, where <b>the</b> direction of <b>drive</b> from <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> shaft must be turned 90 degrees to <b>drive</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> <b>The</b> helical design produces less vibration and noise than conventional straight-cut or spur-cut gear with straight teeth.|$|R
30|$|For {{the method}} that uses only the {{traction}} force of <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{it is assumed}} that <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> can perform up-and-down motion without attaching the proposed mechanism. <b>The</b> <b>wheel</b> radius of <b>the</b> active-caster is assumed as 65  mm, and the height of the step is 100  mm, as previously mentioned. In this method, <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> climbs along {{to the side of the}} step, but a force is required to make <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> contact <b>the</b> side of the step in order to generate the traction force. However, generating this force for contact is difficult without the proposed mechanism. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> cannot climb over a step higher than its <b>wheel</b> radius by <b>the</b> method that uses only the traction force.|$|R
50|$|In a {{gas turbine}} power car a turbine engine, {{similar to a}} {{turboshaft}} engine, drives an output shaft that is in turn attached to a hydraulic or electric transmission, or (in {{the case of the}} UAC TurboTrain) a mechanical gearbox, which supplies power to <b>drive</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The F3DM has two {{alternating}} current electric motors, a 50-kilowatt unit that <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> and a 25-kilowatt helper that can send {{power to the}} wheels or generate electricity through regenerative braking.

At that point, the F3DM’s 1-liter 3-cylinder engine kicks in to bring the battery charge {{as close as possible}} to 30%, effectively extending the range of the vehicle just like the Chevrolet Volt does. The F3DM has a direct connection between the gasoline engine and the wheels that is useful when accelerating onto a highway, just like the Prius.

40|$|As {{the global}} economy begins to strain under the {{pressure}} of raising petroleum prices and environmental concerns, automobile manufacturers constantly strive to produce more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles. That’s why mechatronic sophistication in automotive vehicles is increasing. Given the current resources and technologies, the most feasible solution is hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). HEVs can be organized into three classes: parallel, series and power-split hybrids. In an electric car with a Range Extender, only the electric motor <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels.</b> It is powered by a battery for a few tens of kilometers. Then when the battery reaches a level load of about 30 %, a thermal engine optimized, which drives a current generator, starts producing electricity for the onward journey. In this paper, we focused on the series hybrid architecture. We analyzed different architectures and more precisely the hybrid solar vehicle with Range Extender. We developed a dynamic model of this multidisciplinary system and its control unites using software of multi-physics modeling. The simulation results were used for an operating cycle NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) to optimize fuel consumption...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The project {{described}} herein is {{a senior}} design project for mechanical engineering students. This report details the design, build, and test process {{for the development of}} a wheelchair hand cycle attachment that <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> of the wheelchair, rather than the wheel of the attachment. The sponsor of the project, Mr. Greg O’Kelly is interested in such a device for his own use as well as having a working prototype as a “proof of concept”, should the design be successful enough to manufacture. From the sponsor’s perspective, in addition to acquiring a product he can use, this is also an opportunity to offer real world experience to a team of engineering students through the development of a solution to an existing problem. There are six students working internationally to develop a single final product; three students in the United States attending California Polytechnic State University, and three students in Germany, attending the Hochschule München, School of Applied Sciences. From the student’s perspective, this is meant to be a capstone experience- the culmination of their engineering education, and a bridge between the academic world of theory and the professional world of actual product development. This report covers the background for the project, design development, an in-depth description of the final design, a testing plan, a project management plan, and the conclusion to date...|$|E
40|$|The {{progressive}} {{development of}} International law {{can be seen}} also {{in the concept of}} trust in business transaction based on its evolution from time to time. This is because the trust institution, which is considered as an achievement of the Anglo-Saxon legal system that has tremendous benefit, actually started from the concept of separation between ownership and mastery in the form of charitable trust of waqf, known in Islamic law. Research proves that in the history of “Trust”, waqf is forerunner of the establishment of “Trust”. How the concept of waqf develops a business type of Mutual Fund that is in compliance with Sharia Law, is the problem that is discussed in this paper. By using a normative and comparative law method, this paper found that by implementing only Nazhir functions that reflect the concept of trust by means of Islamic Trust Fund (ITF), the benefit of the object of cash waqf can be multiplied. For this purpose, the Islamic Trust Fund concept is defined in the real meaning of cash waqf mandate which today can be used in business activities, other than worship sector 0. With ITF concept like this does not preclude the general public to participate in purchasing units {{in the form of a}} business Sharia Mutual Funds (SMF), so thus also can create investment opportunities that also <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> of development...|$|E

Therefore, by satisfying the same condition, <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> can also climb the step.|$|R
