To account for the fact that <b>disagreement</b> is a move which can have various manifestations and meanings, we also include discussion of “conflictual disagreement” and “consensual disagreement”. In the course of the chapter, we further highlight the close relationship between changes in the study of <b>disagreement</b> online and changes in the study of language use online more generally; and we address contemporary research on the challenge of context and the indexing of emotion as pertinent for the study of <b>disagreement</b> online...|$|R

40|$|The writer focused {{to analyze}} the <b>disagreement</b> {{strategies}} since <b>disagreement</b> often occurs in the daily speech to show that people usually have different idea from the other. <b>Disagreement</b> is an act that threatens addressee?s positive want to be respected and appreciated. In {{order to avoid the}} face threatening act between the speaker and the hearer, the speaker should use an appropriate strategy to express her/his <b>disagreement.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the type of <b>disagreement</b> strategies used by Gary as a male character and Brooke as female character toward each other based on their different gender as found in the film Break Up (2006). In analyzing, the writer applied Locher?s theory (2004) on <b>disagreement</b> strategies. In analyzing this research, the writer used descriptive qualitative approach because she described the type of <b>disagreement</b> and explained about the differences of expressing <b>disagreement</b> expressed by Gary as male character and Brooke as female character. From the analysis, the writer found that the main characters, Gary and Brooke, in the Break Up movie used the <b>disagreement</b> strategies when they expressed their <b>disagreement</b> toward each other. The writer concluded that almost all of the <b>disagreement</b> strategies were used by the main characters. Gary as male character and Brooke as a female character used different strategies. The <b>disagreement</b> strategy which was the most frequently used by Gary as male character was the use of hedges. Gary used this strategy to soften his <b>disagreement</b> toward Brooke as female character. On the other hand, Brooke used non mitigating strategy the most frequently. It means that she expressed her <b>disagreement</b> more straightly than Gary as male character. It was all influenced by the situation in their daily life.

Growth stocks are more sensitive to variations in <b>disagreement</b> relative to value stocks. These findings are consistent with asset pricing theory incorporating belief dispersion.

40|$|Do {{differences}} of opinion affect house prices? This thesis investigates how <b>disagreement</b> affects house prices and housing turnover. We construct a <b>disagreement</b> index using household’s beliefs on future house price developments. The main contribution {{of this study is}} that the household survey captures real expectations in contrast to many similar studies that use analyst forecasts or volatility based measures. This study finds that higher <b>disagreement</b> is significantly associated with lower future house price returns. A one standard deviation increase of <b>disagreement</b> index translates into a 33. 8 basis points lower return the following month. The results are robust when controlling for Norges Bank key house price determinants. Granger causality tests indicate that <b>disagreement</b> has a predictive power for house price returns and not vice versa. <b>Disagreement</b> is insignificant in explaining turnover. Overall, our results lends support to predictions of models with <b>disagreement</b> and helps highlight the importance <b>disagreement</b> has in explaining price movements...|$|R
