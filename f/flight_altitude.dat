5|$|The elytra allow beetles to both fly {{and move}} through {{confined}} spaces, doing so by folding the delicate wings under the elytra while not flying, and folding their wings out just before take off. The unfolding and folding of the wings is operated by muscles {{attached to the}} wing base; {{as long as the}} tension on the radial and cubital veins remains, the wings remain straight. In some day-flying species (for example, Buprestidae, Scarabaeidae), flight does not include large amounts of lifting of the elytra, having the metathorac wings extended under the lateral elytra margins. The altitude reached by beetles in flight varies. One study investigating the <b>flight</b> <b>altitude</b> of the ladybird species Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis using radar showed that, whilst the majority in flight over a single location were at 150–195m above ground level, some reached altitudes of over 1100m.|$|E
5|$|In March 1948 {{he set a}} world <b>flight</b> <b>altitude</b> {{record of}} 59,430 feet (18,114 metres) in a Ghost-powered Vampire. The flight lasted for 45 minutes, {{reaching}} 50,000 feet in 13.5 minutes. The following year {{he went on to}} test the de Havilland Comet, the world's first jet airliner which first flew in 1949. On 23 May 1952 he flew the Comet—now a highly successful export—carrying the recently widowed Queen Mother and Princess Margaret on a four-hour tour around the Alps. At one point he supervised the Queen Mother as she took the controls. She was to dine with members of the No. 600 Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadron later that night and was anxious to say she had piloted an aircraft. Cunningham continued to test-fly prototypes such as the re-built Comet 3 and 4 in the late 1950s. On 23 October 1956 he travelled to the United States and received the Harmon Trophy from President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It was the most prestigious American trophy for services of civil aviation.|$|E
5|$|The American Air Museum {{was opened}} by Queen Elizabeth II on 1 August 1997. The {{total cost of}} the project had been £13.5 million. The museum was re-dedicated on 27 September 2002, in a {{ceremony}} attended by former President George H. W. Bush and by Prince Charles. Since being opened, the museum has had its glass front removed, and then reinstalled, to allow the bringing-in of an SR-71 Blackbird and Consolidated B-24 Liberator. The SR-71, serial number 61-7962, is the only example of its type on display outside the United States, and set a <b>flight</b> <b>altitude</b> record of 85,069 feet (25,929m) in July 1976. Besides the Blackbird, nineteen other American aircraft are on display. Notable examples include a C-47 Skytrain which flew with the 316th Troop Carrier Group and participated in three major Second World War airborne operations; the June 1944 Normandy landings, Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity, the airborne crossing of the River Rhine in March 1945. The museum's B-29 flew during the Korean War as part of the 7th Bomb Wing; it is the only example in Europe and one of only two preserved in museums outside the United States. The B-52 flew 200 sorties during the Vietnam War as part of the 28th Bomb Wing. The General Dynamics F-111 on display flew 19 missions during the 1991 Gulf War as part of the 77th Fighter Squadron.|$|E
40|$|Birds pose {{a serious}} risk to flight safety worldwide. A Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) is being {{developed}} in the Netherlands {{to reduce the risk}} of bird-aircraft collisions. In order to develop a temporally and spatially dynamic model of bird densities, data are needed on the flight-altitude distribution of birds and how this is influenced by weather. This study focuses on the dynamics of <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> of several species of birds during local flights over land in relation to meteorological conditions. We measured <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> of several species in the southeastern Netherlands using tracking radar during spring and summer 2000. Representatives of different flight strategy groups included four species: a soaring species (buzzard Buteo buteo), an obligatory aerial forager (swift Apus apus), a flapping and gliding species (blackheaded gull Larus ridibundus), and a flapping species (starling Sturnus vulgaris). Maximum <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> varied among species, during the day and among days. Weather significantly influenced the <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> of all species studied. Factors such as temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric instability, cloud cover, and sea level pressure were related to <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes.</b> Different combinations of factors explained 40 %- 70 % of the variance in maximum <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes.</b> Weather affected <b>flight</b> strategy groups differently. Compared to flapping species, buzzards and swifts showed stronger variations in maximum daily altitude and f lew higher under conditions reflecting stronger thermal convection. The dynamic vertical distributions of birds are important for risk assessment and mitigation measures in flight safety as well as wind turbine studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} radar-tracking supervisions over the night {{migration}} in Israel are submitted. The determination of <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes,</b> <b>flight</b> speeds, heights of maximum birds’ concentration, and migratory directions was performed. The average <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> of night migration were 985 m in autumn and 1465 m in spring of 1998 - 2000, maximum <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> were 2068 m and 2655 m correspondingly. The mean track {{direction of the}} night bird migration is 183 ° in spring and 6 ° in autumn. The migration of waterfowl over the Mediterranean Sea in the low altitude band was registered. Their average headings differ from the general migratory path, averaging 135 ° in autumn and 315 ° in spring.

5|$|Wind shear {{refers to}} the {{variation}} of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 knots (15m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 knots (22m/s) for airliners at <b>flight</b> <b>altitude.</b> Vertical speed changes greater than 4.9knots (2.5m/s) also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft. Low level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during {{take off and landing}} in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear (headwind loss in excess of 30 knots). The rationale for this additional caution includes: (1) microburst intensity can double in a minute or less, (2) the winds can shift to excessive cross wind, (3) 40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and (4) several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts. Wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear.|$|E

40|$|The {{radiation}} dose rates at <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> can increase by {{orders of magnitude}} {{for a short time}} during energetic solar cosmic ray events, so called ground level enhancements (GLEs). Especially at high latitudes and <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes,</b> solar energetic particles superposed on galactic cosmic rays may cause radiation that exceeds the maximum allowed dosage limit for the general public. Therefore the determination of the {{radiation dose}} rate during GLEs should be as reliable as possible. Radiation dose rates along flight paths are typically determined by computer models that are based on cosmic ray flux and anisotropy parameters derived from neutron monitor and/or satellite measurements. The characteristics of the GLE on 15 April 2001 (GLE 60) were determined and published by various authors. In this work we compare these results and investigate the consequences on the computed radiation dose rates along selected flight paths.
