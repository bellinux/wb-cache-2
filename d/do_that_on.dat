5|$|As Double Dare grew messier, a green slime {{substance}} {{became more}} commonly used in physical challenges and obstacles. Slime was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, You Can't <b>Do</b> <b>That</b> <b>on</b> Television. Double Dares high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon's association with slime, and saw it featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s. The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the Kids' Choice Awards, a slime geyser at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including Wild & Crazy Kids and Figure It Out. The relationship of Nickelodeon and slime still lasts on the network.|$|E

Seth Green's short-lived show Greg the Bunny was about sentient hand-puppets working in a Muppet-like children's show. Many other films and television shows such as The Simpsons, Family Guy, The West Wing and Robot Chicken have referenced The Muppets.|$|E

500|$|Zappa's last tour in a {{rock and}} jazz band format took place in 1988 with a 12-piece group which had a {{repertoire}} of over 100 (mostly Zappa) compositions, but which split under acrimonious circumstances before the tour was completed. The tour was documented on the albums Broadway the Hard Way (new material featuring songs with strong political emphasis); The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life (Zappa [...] "standards" [...] and an eclectic collection of cover tunes, ranging from Maurice Ravel's Boléro to Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven); and Make a Jazz Noise Here.

Claremont joked, [...] "you can <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> a drawing, but when you put it on people it's disturbing!" [...] Producer/co-writer Tom DeSanto had been supportive of using the blue and yellow color scheme of the comics, but came to conclude that they would not work onscreen. To acknowledge the fan complaints, Singer added Cyclops' line [...] "What would you prefer, yellow spandex?" [...] – when Wolverine complains about wearing their uniforms – during filming. Singer noted that durable black leather made more sense for the X-Men to wear as protective clothing, and Shuler Donner added that the costumes helped them [...] "blend into the night".|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} nomination, Garfield {{was ordered to}} report to War Secretary Edwin Stanton in Washington to discuss his {{military}} future. [...] There, Garfield met Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, who befriended him, seeing him as a younger version of himself. The two men agreed politically, and both {{were part of the}} Radical wing of the Republican Party. Once he took his seat in December 1863, Garfield was frustrated that Lincoln seemed reluctant to press the South hard. Many radicals, led in the House by Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, wanted rebel-owned lands confiscated, but Lincoln threatened to veto any bill that would <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> a widespread basis. Garfield, in debate on the House floor, supported such legislation and, discussing England's Glorious Revolution, hinted that Lincoln might be thrown out of office for resisting the bills. Although Garfield had supported Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, the congressman marveled that it was a [...] "...strange phenomenon in the world's history, when a second-rate Illinois lawyer is the instrument to utter words which shall form an epoch memorable in all future ages." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Northern Echo, Star Stories actor Kevin Bishop discussed the legal issues involved with making the series: [...] "We're not allowed {{to say anything about}} anyone that isn't true. It can be quite tricky. Sometimes we've had to change lines even when the filming is all finished. We go back to the recording studio and put one line over another line. ... The only reason I reckon we've not been sued is because actually we've not said anything that technically we can't." [...] He said the series was [...] "well looked after" [...] by attorneys. In a 2009 interview with The Independent, Bishop recounted an experience when he gave a copy of the program to television producers in the United States: [...] "I gave some American producers the Star Stories DVD and those that could be bothered to watch it saw the Tom Cruise one. One guy went 'you can't do that it's Tom Cruise man? [...] 'yeah but you can't <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> TV' [...] 'what you’re talking about Scientology, are you fucking nuts??

It's really interesting and colorful. It's the kind of video that's still fun to look at after you've seen it a few times. That {{was very important to}} us. At this point in our lives, part of the challenge is to try new things, not to fall into the pattern of playing it safe.

500|$|By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created DiscReet Records, also {{distributed}} by Warner Bros. Zappa continued {{a high rate}} of production through {{the first half of the}} 1970s, including the solo album Apostrophe (') (1974), which reached a career-high No.10 on the Billboard pop album charts helped by the chart single [...] "Don't Eat The Yellow Snow". Other albums from the period are Over-Nite Sensation (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as [...] "Dinah-Moe Humm" [...] and [...] "Montana", and the albums Roxy & Elsewhere (1974) and One Size Fits All (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called the Mothers, and are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult jazz fusion songs in such pieces as [...] "Inca Roads", [...] "Echidna's Arf (Of You)" [...] and [...] "Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)". A live recording from 1974, You Can't <b>Do</b> <b>That</b> <b>on</b> Stage Anymore, Vol. 2 (1988), captures [...] "the full spirit and excellence of the 1973–75 band". Zappa released Bongo Fury (1975), which featured a live recording at the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin from a tour the same year that reunited him with Captain Beefheart for a brief period. They later became estranged for a period of years, but were in contact at the end of Zappa's life.|$|E

How many batteries did we suck dry playing Sonic, Madden and Road Rash on the bus or in the car, or in the dark when {{we were supposed to}} be sleeping? You couldn't <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> a Game Boy!" [...] By contrast, IGN reviewer Levi Buchanan noted the Game Gear's biggest fault was its game library when compared to the Game Boy, stating that [...] "the software was completely lacking compared to its chief rival, which was bathed in quality games. It didn't matter that the Game Gear was more powerful. The color screen did not reverse any fortunes. Content and innovation beat out technology, a formula that Nintendo is using right now with the continued ascendance of the DS and Wii." [...] Buchanan later went on to praise some parts of the Game Gear's library, however, stating [...] "Some of those Master System tweaks were very good games, and fun is resilient against time." [...] Retro Gamer praised Sega's accomplishment in surviving against the competition of Nintendo in the handheld console market with the Game Gear, noting that [...] "for all the handhelds that have gone up against the might of Nintendo and ultimately lost out, Sega's Game Gear managed to last the longest, only outdone in sales by the Sony PSP.
