30|$|With this background, {{the purpose}} of this {{research}} was to investigate the degradation behaviors of the major coloring compounds of three different natural <b>dye</b> <b>plants</b> by thermally degrading them in 100 °C oven and analyzing the concentration of dye using a high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector and a mass selective detector (HPLC-DAD-MS). The <b>plant</b> <b>dyes</b> of interest were Phellodendron bark (hwangbek), madder, and indigo, and the investigation was conducted on their major coloring compounds- berberine and palmatine of Phellodendron bark, alizarin and purpurin of madder, and indigotin and indirubin of indigo plant. Coloring compounds of these <b>dye</b> <b>plants</b> were selected since the three <b>dye</b> <b>plants</b> represent the major dyes of the past which dyed fabrics into yellow, red, and blue colors, respectively. The three <b>dye</b> <b>plants</b> differ also in their dyeing mechanisms. Phellodendron bark is the most representative basic dye among the natural <b>plant</b> <b>dye,</b> madder is the most representative mordant dye, and indigo is the most representative vat dye.|$|R

50|$|The Lansing Board of Water and Light obtains all {{raw water}} {{from a series of}} 124 wells located {{throughout}} the city of Lansing, {{making it one of the}} few public utilities for large cities that provides water exclusively from wells. The city sits atop, and draws its water from, the Saginaw Aquifer, a natural, but limited, underground reservoir , and 550 sq mi in size. The raw water is pumped directly to two conditioning plants: the John <b>Dye</b> <b>plant</b> located in downtown Lansing and the Wise Road plant located on the southwest side of the city. At these plants, water hardness is reduced by adding lime and soda ash to the water, which reacts with dissolved calcium and magnesium to form calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide floc. The floc then settles out of the water in large settling basins, and any residual floc is removed via sand and gravel filtering. This process reduces the hardness of the {{water from a}}pproximately 411 parts per million (ppm) to about 85 ppm. The finished water is then chlorinated and fluorinated, and sent to storage prior to distribution.|$|E
50|$|In 1882 the Hudson River Aniline and Color Works {{built their}} first plant in Rensselaer (building 61), however it burned 13 years later. In 1895 Building 61 was rebuilt {{and at the}} same time Building 71 was built as well. It would be {{acquired}} by the Bayer Corporation in 1903, which then built one of the largest and most up-to-date factories of its time in the US and the Rensselaer plant became the American home for the production of brand-name Aspirin. The US government seized the property in 1917 during World War I as enemy property, Bayer being a German company. It would later be owned by the General Aniline and Film Company, and then BASF. In 1927 it was the first plant to produce solid diazo salts in the United States. The plant went through 12 separate owners or subsidiaries in its lifetime, in the 1990s it was the oldest <b>dye</b> <b>plant</b> in continuous operation and also produced more dye than any other plant in the United States. According to a promotional brochure issued around 1993 by the BASF Corporation the Rensselaer plant was the largest North American dyestuffs production facility. The plant was shut down for good on December 28, 2000.|$|E
30|$|Copper {{and iron}} {{can be related}} to copperas, either to blue (copper sulphate) or green (iron sulphate), or a mixture of both [37]. When used as mordants, these salts darkened colours.

It is possible, too, that the copper or iron vats in which dyeing occurred influenced the mordanting process, or the water sources themselves.|$|E

30|$|Sappanwood, as a {{very common}} reddish natural <b>dye</b> <b>plant,</b> was {{recorded}} as su fang 蘇方/枋 or su fang mu 蘇方/枋木 in Chinese, whose main species was Caesalpinia sappan L. in the family Leguminosae. Sappanwood only grew in tropical regions. Its cultivation on continental China never met the demand of sappanwood in ancient China. Therefore, sappanwood was documented to have been consistently imported to Guangzhou from South East Asia via sea trade [34].The initial record dated back to Nanfang caomu zhuang (南方草木状) written by the Botanist Ji Han (嵇含, 263 – 306 C.E.) in Jin Dynasty (265 – 420 C.E.) [35]. In the early sixteenth century, the discovery of South America led to use the alternative plant Brazilwood (Caesalpinia brasiliensis L.) in Europe, which caused the trade with Asian sappanwood to decline dramatically [25].

It showed that in alkaline solution, the maximum COD removal and decoloration rate(58. 8 % and 99. 1 %) was observed,which demonstrated that ozone and pulsed discharge was more efficient on COD removal and decolouration in alkalin than in neutral solution when all the samples were treated for 13 mins. After being treated, B/C increased from 0. 2 to 0. 45. Decoloration efficiency and COD removal could be improved obviously when oxygen feed increased from 40 to 80 L /h，yet further increase in oxygen feed led to a markedly decrease of decolouration efficiency and COD removal...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBixa orellana {{commonly}} known as annatto {{is one of the}} oldest known natural dye yielding plants native to Central and South America. Various parts of annatto have been widely used in the traditional medical system for prevention and treatment of a wide number of health disorders. The plethora of traditional uses has encouraged researchers to identify and isolate phytochemicals from all parts of this plant. Carotenoids, apocarotenoids, terpenes, terpenoids, sterols, and aliphatic compounds are main compounds found in all parts of this plant and are reported to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities. In recent years annatto has received tremendous scientific interest mainly due to the isolation of yellow–orange natural dye from its seeds which exhibits high biodegradability, low toxicity, and compatibility with the environment. Considerable research work has already been done and is currently underway for its applications in food, textile, leather, cosmetic, solar cells, and other industries. The present review provides up-to-date systematic and organized information on the traditional usage, phytochemistry and pharmacology of annatto. It also highlights its non-food industrial applications in order to bring more interest on this <b>dye</b> <b>plant,</b> identifies the existing gaps and provides potential for future studies. Studies reported in this review have demonstrated that annatto holds a great potential for being exploited as source of drugs and a potential natural dye.

40|$|O anil ou índigo é um corante azul de origem vegetal com registros de uso que remetem às primeiras civilizações. Sua tradição como planta tintorial vem da ótima qualidade de tingimento que oferece em fibras animais e vegetais. Além disso, as folhas da anileira tem a peculiaridade de fornecer também a cor azul como pigmento, insolúvel, e assim, aumentar suas possibilidades de uso. A presente pesquisa tem como objetivo explorar possíveis aplicações do pigmento índigo natural em materiais artísticos como uma forma de ampliar a gama de produtos disponíveis com essa matéria-prima. Experimentos foram realizados para testar o comportamento, a resistência à luz e a aplicabilidade do pigmento em quatro técnicas de pintura diferentes. O desempenho dos materiais desenvolvidos foi suficiente para sustentar o uso da versão natural do pigmento índigo como alternativo à sintética, apresentando ainda a vantagem de ser menos tóxica e poluente. Espera-se que o aumento da variedade de aplicações do índigo natural estimule, por consequência, o interesse pelo desenvolvimento de novos produtos e também por sua história, favorecendo o resgate de conhecimento e as práticas tradicionais de cultivo de anileira em localidades brasileiras com histórico de cultivo no passado.
