2500|$|The wing {{was only}} {{slightly}} tapered, being almost rectangular and with a cutout in the trailing edge over the cockpit to improve the pilot's field of view. [...] Short-span ailerons were mounted far outboard. On each side there were two pairs of parallel struts bracing the wing to the fuselage; both pairs were mounted on the lower fuselage but one pair met the wing at about 60% span, the other at 30%. [...] Each outer strut had a <b>jury</b> <b>strut</b> at right angles which met {{the top of its}} inboard equivalent at the wing.|$|E
2500|$|The forward {{fuselage}} of the P-1 and -2 was rounded with its 100hp (75kW) Gipsy upright inline engine in tapering cowlings, the cylinder heads under a fairing {{with an open}} front end for cooling. [...] The forward open cockpit was under the wing and the rear one at the trailing edge which had a cut-out providing an enhanced field of view. [...] Behind the cockpits the fuselage became more flat sided, though rounded upper and lower decking made it appear oval. [...] A braced tailplane was attached at mid fuselage height; the fin had a rounded leading edge but the rudder trailing edge was straight and upright. [...] The undercarriage was fixed and conventional, the mainwheels on axles which were hinged from the lower longerons and curved to the horizontal at their extremities. [...] Vertical compression legs were attached to the forward wing bracing struts, which were <b>jury</b> <b>strut</b> braced at the junction, and an inverted V-form strut hinged to the central fuselage provided lateral stability. [...] There was a long, near vertical tail skid.|$|E

5000|$|Early in its career, the DH.80A {{was plagued}} {{by a series of}} fatal crashes, the most famous being to Australian aviator Bert Hinkler while {{crossing}} the Alps in CF-APK on 7 January 1933. The cause was eventually pinned down to [...] "flutter" [...] caused by turbulence leading to wing failure - this was corrected by stiffening the front strut with a <b>jury</b> <b>strut</b> to the rear wing root fitting. One aircraft took part in the Challenge 1934 European tourist plane contest, but dropped out because of an engine fault on one of the last stages.|$|E
50|$|The two outer Salmson engines were mounted, uncowled, on {{the forward}} wing bracing struts, with {{extended}} streamlined bodies behind them which {{connected to the}} rear bracing strut; the forward struts were reinforced by <b>jury</b> <b>struts</b> to the wing roots and the rear bracing <b>struts</b> by vertical <b>jury</b> <b>struts</b> to the rear spar. The Potez 40 had a tailwheel undercarriage with its main legs with rubber shock absorbers mounted vertically below the outer engine extensions; the mainwheels were hinged on widely spaced V-Struts from the lower fuselage and were sometimes enclosed under spats.|$|R

The wings are supported by a single lift strut and a <b>jury</b> <b>strut.</b> The pilot is accommodated on an open seat, without a windshield. The controls are conventional three axis, but the aircraft uses a control yoke rather than the more common control stick. The landing gear features main wheel bungee suspension.|$|E
