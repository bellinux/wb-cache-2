40|$|Many prisoners leaving custody are homeless, jobless and poor. They {{are given}} a <b>discharge</b> <b>grant</b> by the Home Office to meet their {{immediate}} needs on release. For many, it is their only source of income until they find a job or, more commonly, receive their first benefit cheque. This paper reviews the immediate needs of prisoners on release from custody and then examines how far the <b>discharge</b> <b>grant</b> is adequate in meeting these needs. In-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} prisoners both before and after release from custody. These included ten men in prison who were within two or three weeks of release and 14 men who had been released from prison within the previous month. Interviews suggested that the grant lasted only a few days, leaving ex-prisoners with very little to cover even basic needs in the two weeks before they were entitled to receive any income support...|$|E

2500|$|This {{analysis}} assumes, however, {{that the}} collateral does not {{increase in value}} after commencement of the case. If the collateral increases in value and the debtor (rather than the estate) keeps the collateral (e.g., where the asset is exempt or is abandoned by the trustee back to the debtor), {{the amount of the}} creditor's security interest may or may not increase. In situations where the debtor (rather than the creditor) is allowed to benefit from the increase in collateral value, the effect is called [...] "lien stripping" [...] or [...] "paring down." [...] Lien stripping is allowed only in certain cases depending on the kind of collateral and the particular chapter of the Code under which the <b>discharge</b> is <b>granted.</b>|$|R

After 1866, he enrolled at the École Militaire which he left in 1869 with the rank of lieutenant in the French artillery, spending five months in Algeria and, after a short stay in the Versailles garrison, was called up to fight in the Franco-Prussian War.

50|$|The Clean Water Act {{stipulates}} that states should adopt specific water quality standards for their navigable waterways (streams, rivers, wetlands and lakes) and issue permits for discharge under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System(NPDES).

Legal entitlements for <b>discharge</b> are <b>granted</b> in the form of permits, but the overall allowable level of discharge is controlled by the EPA. The states may issue permits, but the allowable pollution levels must not exceed the federal standards. Additionally, both the federal EPA and the corresponding environmental regulatory offices at the state level make pertinent information publicly available, which includes the harmful effects of mercury exposure and the times of the year in which it is deemed dangerous to consume biotic organisms (e.g. consumption advisories for fish).|$|R

5000|$|At that time, Bobek was 17 years old, legally {{an adult}} under Michigan {{criminal}} law, but eligible for probation {{with a record}} of the offense sealed from the public record under a special law for youthful first offenders. She pleaded guilty under that law, the Holmes Youthful Trainee Act, and in January 1995 was given two years' probation and a choice between 50 hours of community service and 30 days in jail. Information regarding her case soon spread widely through skating circles and was leaked to the news media. Under the Youthful Trainee Act, cases are to remain confidential; so in February 1995, she filed for dismissal of her case. Though journalists and legal scholars have argued that Michigan law allows journalists to release information about juvenile criminals if there is [...] "compelling public interest," [...] which was arguable due to her status as a world class figure skater, Bobek's motion for probation <b>discharge</b> was <b>granted</b> by the court.|$|R

2500|$|The {{effect of}} a {{bankruptcy}} discharge is to eliminate only the debtor's personal liability, not the in rem liability for a secured debt {{to the extent of}} the value of collateral. The term [...] "in rem" [...] essentially means [...] "with respect to the thing itself" [...] (i.e., the collateral). For example, if a debt in the amount of $100,000 is secured by property having a value of only $80,000, the $20,000 deficiency is treated, in bankruptcy, as an unsecured claim (even though it's part of a [...] "secured" [...] debt). The $80,000 portion of the debt is treated as a secured claim. Assuming a <b>discharge</b> is <b>granted</b> and none of the $20,000 deficiency is paid (e.g., due to insufficiency of funds), the $20,000 deficiency—the debtor's personal liability—is discharged (assuming the debt is not non-dischargeable under another Bankruptcy Code provision). The $80,000 portion of the debt is the in rem liability, and it is not discharged by the court's discharge order. This liability can presumably be satisfied by the creditor taking the asset itself. An essential concept is that when commentators say that a debt is [...] "dischargeable," [...] they are referring only to the debtor's personal liability on the debt. To the extent that a liability is covered by the value of collateral, the debt is not discharged.|$|R
40|$|THE {{case studies}} of the fifteen hundred New Jersey and Boston bankrupts which were made {{during the last two}} years throw some light upon the {{functions}} which the venerable institution of bankruptcy is performing. The present Act was passed in 1898 and, though amended several times, has never been changed fundamentally. During the thirty-three years it has been in force no inventory of its operation has been made. But little attempt has been made to determine its incidences. In fact without independent investigations that would be practically impossible, as no provision is made in the system for the collection of vital statistics of bankruptcy. The only data available are those contained in the annual reports of the attorney-general. They are practically valueless for even an administrative, let alone a functional, study of bankruptcy. They reveal little of the kinds of persons using bankruptcy. No clues are given as to why they are there. No information is set forth showing what treatment they obtain-whether they applied for a discharge, whether the application was contested, whether the <b>discharged</b> was <b>granted</b> or refused and if refused on what ground. Nothing is given showing how the various subdivisions of the discharge section [§ 14 (b) ] are working. The deficiencies are as apparent on the administrative side of bankruptcy, not only as respects § 14 but also as respects all other sections of the Act...|$|R

40|$|Bankruptcies, {{more than}} ever and bigger than ever, have {{followed}} our credit administration of the past decade. In 1921 our total technical bankrupts were officially reported at 15, 200. In 1931, this number reached 60, 322. Outstanding in this history are wage and salary earners. In numbers, wage and salary earner bankruptcies increased from 5, 928 in 1921 to 29, 814 in 1931. Whereas they constituted 39 per cent of the total of our bankrupts in 1921, that ratio had increased to 49 per cent in 1931. In other words, in 1931 almost one-half of our technical bankrupts were wage and salary earners. Furthermore, {{there is evidence to}} support the conclusion that a greater percentage of 2 ̆ 2 no-assets 2 ̆ 2 estates is found in our wage and salary earners 2 ̆ 7 bankruptcies than in any other class of bankrupts. Thus, the bankruptcy records for the fiscal year 1930 have been analyzed to show that 84. 90 per cent of the estates of wage and salary earners in bankruptcy had no assets and that 98. 17 per cent of those estates had assets per estate of less than 500 in value. It may also be observed that all but a small fraction of our wage and salary earner bankruptcies are instituted by a voluntary petition. In 1921, there were 31 involuntary petitions among the 5, 928 wage and salary earner bankruptcies; 5, 897 were voluntary petitions. In 1931 there were 116 involuntary petitions among the 29, 814 wage and salary earner bankruptcies. In common with all bankruptcies, discharges are freely granted: 2 ̆ 298 per cent of the mercantile bankrupts and about 99 ½ per cent of the non-mercantile bankrupts who seek <b>discharges</b> are <b>granted</b> them outright. 2 ̆ 2 These percentages have been 2 ̆ 2 practically constant since the earliest days of the act [Bankruptcy Act, 1898] despite the gradual addition of new grounds for denying a discharge. 2 ̆...|$|R
