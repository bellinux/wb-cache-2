5|$|The old President Warfield was {{eventually}} acquired in early 1947 by Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, a Jewish organization helping Holocaust survivors illegally reach Palestine, then under British mandate. The former Baltimore Steam Packet and U.S. Navy steamship was renamed <b>Exodus</b> when she embarked from France for Palestine on July 11, 1947, carrying 4,515passengers. Two Royal Navy destroyers rammed the <b>Exodus</b> {{as she entered}} Palestinian waters near Haifa on July18. British forces boarded the damaged ship and eventually deported the passengers. The <b>Exodus</b> remained in Haifa harbor until 1952, when the derelict caught fire and burned completely. The 1960 film <b>Exodus</b> depicted the refugees' odyssey aboard the former President Warfield.|$|E
5|$|Geologist Barbara J. Sivertsen {{seeks to}} {{establish}} {{a link between the}} eruption of Santorini (c. 1600 BCE) and the <b>Exodus</b> of the Israelites from Egypt in the Bible, which was also suggested in the books: The <b>Exodus</b> Enigma, by lan Wilson (1985) and Return to Sodom and Gomorrah, by Charles Pellegrino (1994).|$|E
5|$|Nefarious was written, directed, produced, and {{narrated by}} Benjamin Nolot, founder and {{president}} of <b>Exodus</b> Cry. <b>Exodus</b> Cry, which distributed the film, is headquartered in Grandview, Missouri and is an organization that opposes human trafficking by raising awareness, by reintegrating victims back into society, and by prayer. Nolot founded <b>Exodus</b> Cry in 2007 after a woman he did not know gave him , saying that God told her to do so in order that Nolot might found an anti-human-trafficking organization. This was founded at a prayer meeting later that year where attendees prayed for human trafficking victims. The organization claims that this prayer meeting occurred on the day before the announcement of the 2007 international child pornography investigation, which involved approximately 2,400 human-trafficking-related arrests in 77 countries.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} his illness and Slayer's {{upcoming}} participation in the Australian Soundwave Festival tour that was set to begin on February 26, 2011, the band {{made the decision to}} play the dates without Hanneman, and on February 16, 2011, brought on Gary Holt (guitarist of the band <b>Exodus)</b> to fill in for him. Pat O'Brien joined as Slayer's temporary second guitarist when Holt left the tour to play with <b>Exodus.</b> In 2012, bandmate Tom Araya announced a recovery from the disease. However, later in February 2013, Kerry King revealed continuing health problems that kept Hanneman from working.|$|E
5|$|Metro <b>Exodus</b> was {{announced}} on 11 June 2017 at Microsoft's press conference during E3 2017. The game {{is scheduled to}} be released for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2018.|$|E
5|$|One of the Old Bay Line's steamers, {{the former}} President Warfield, later became famous as the <b>Exodus</b> ship of book and movie fame, when Jewish {{refugees}} from war-torn Europe sailed aboard her in 1947 in an unsuccessful attempt to emigrate to Palestine.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{changes to the}} ethnic {{composition}} of Slavonian counties occurred between censuses conducted in 1991 and 2001. The 1991 census recorded a heterogenous population consisting mostly of Croats and Serbs—at 72 percent and 17 {{percent of the total}} population respectively. The Croatian War of Independence, and the ethnic fracturing of Yugoslavia that preceded it, caused an <b>exodus</b> of the Croat population followed by an <b>exodus</b> of Serbs. The return of refugees since the end of hostilities is not complete—a majority of Croat refugees returned, while fewer Serbs did. In addition, ethnic Croats moved to Slavonia from Bosnia and Herzegovina and from Serbia.|$|E
5|$|While the {{fortunes}} of the franchise had been declining for a few years, they would bottom out with a player <b>exodus</b> following the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The squad's entire All Black front row of Carl Hayman, Anton Oliver, and Clarke Dermody left for lucrative contracts in Europe, while star first-five Nick Evans moved north to Auckland to play for the Blues, and hugely talented young lock James Ryan was forced to retire at age 24 due to injury problems. Joining the <b>exodus</b> were several other veteran starters, along with coach Greg Cooper who left the franchise to take up an assistant coaching position with the Blues. The coach for the 2008 season, Glenn Moore, was appointed 28 August 2007.|$|E
5|$|With the <b>exodus</b> {{of several}} {{manufacturing}} companies, the area's industrial economy {{began to decline}} during the early 20th century. By the 1920s, competition from the South and Midwest, followed by the Great Depression, led {{to the collapse of}} the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and precision mechanics. This decline would continue into the later half of the century; between 1950 and 1979, the number of Massachusetts residents involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264,000 to 63,000. The 1969 closure of the Springfield Armory, in particular, spurred an <b>exodus</b> of high-paying jobs from Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly as it de-industrialized during the last 40 years of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there are}} no other large cities in the Republic of Macedonia, and because of {{political}} and economical centralisation, a large number of Macedonians living outside of Skopje work in the capital city. The dynamism of the city also encourages rural <b>exodus,</b> not only from Macedonia, but also from Kosovo, Albania and Southern Serbia.|$|E
5|$|British {{relations}} were also difficult with the nominally conquered Acadians. They resisted repeated British demands to swear oaths to the British crown, and eventually this sparked an <b>exodus</b> by the Acadians to Île-Royale and Île-Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island). By the 1740s, French {{leaders such as}} Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre orchestrated a guerrilla war with their Mi'kmaq allies against British attempts to expand Protestant settlements in peninsular Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|H. erectus {{arrived in}} Eurasia {{approximately}} 1.8 million years ago, in an event {{considered to be}} the first African <b>exodus.</b> There is evidence that the Java population of H. erectus lived in an ever-wet forest habitat. More specifically the environment resembled a savannah, but was likely regularly inundated ("hydromorphic savanna"). The plants found at the Trinil excavation site included grass (Poaceae), ferns, Ficus, and Indigofera, which are typical of lowland rainforest.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Machen {{and other}} conservatives founded the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions. A year later, the General Assembly {{declared}} the Independent Board unconstitutional {{and demanded that}} all church members cut ties with it. Machen refused to obey, and his ordination was suspended in 1936. Afterwards, Machen led an <b>exodus</b> of conservatives to form what would be later known as the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|In May 1983, Metallica {{traveled}} to Rochester, New York to record its debut album, Metal Up Your Ass, which {{was produced by}} Paul Curcio. The other members decided to eject Mustaine from the band because of his drug and alcohol abuse, and violent behavior just before the recording sessions on April 11, 1983. <b>Exodus</b> guitarist Kirk Hammett replaced Mustaine the same afternoon.|$|E
5|$|In the present, {{medical student}} Jude Mathis investigates a {{military}} research facility {{in order to}} search for his missing professor. There he witnesses a spyrix-powered weapon called the Lance of Kresnik absorb his professor. The military prep Jude as the next victim, but he is saved by Milla Maxwell, Maxwell's successor. In response, the military activates the lance which absorbs Milla's spirit companions forcing her and Jude to retreat. Jude and Milla decide to confront Rashugal's king who had endorsed the Lance's creation. During their travel, they are joined by Alvin, Elize Lutus, Rowen J. Illbert and Leia Rolando. After Rashugal's king is defeated, <b>Exodus</b> obtains and uses the Lance to temporarily disable the barrier protecting Rieze Maxia, allowing Elympios' army to invade. Assisted by Auj Oule's king, Gaius, the party defeats <b>Exodus</b> {{at the cost of}} Milla's life.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1894 that Stroma gained its first {{artificial}} landing point, a pier built from Portland cement near Nethertown {{at a cost of}} £800. In 1955, Caithness County Council constructed a new harbour on the south coast of the island at the then great cost of £28,500. Although it was intended to help stem the <b>exodus</b> of people from the island, Stroma was abandoned only a few years after the harbour's completion.|$|E
5|$|Repentless is {{the twelfth}} studio album by American heavy metal band Slayer. It was {{released}} on September 11, 2015, and is the first Slayer album to feature guitarist Gary Holt of <b>Exodus</b> {{and the first to}} feature drummer Paul Bostaph since 2001's God Hates Us All. Repentless is also Slayer's first album following the death of founding member Jeff Hanneman in 2013, and the band's first album to be released on Nuclear Blast.|$|E
5|$|Shostakovich {{wanted the}} Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra to première the symphony, but that group had been {{evacuated}} to Novosibirsk {{as part of}} the government-led cultural <b>exodus.</b> The world première was instead held in Kuybyshev on 5 March 1942, performed by the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra under conductor Samuil Samosud. The Moscow première was given by a combination of the Bolshoi and the All-Union Radio orchestras on 29 March in the Columned Hall of the House of Unions.|$|E
5|$|The French {{departure}} {{prompted a}} mass <b>exodus</b> of the American militia, significantly shrinking the American force. On 24 August, Sullivan was alerted by General George Washington that Clinton was assembling a relief force in New York. That evening his council {{made the decision}} to withdraw to positions on {{the northern part of the}} island. Sullivan continued to seek French assistance, dispatching Lafayette to Boston to negotiate further with d'Estaing.|$|E
5|$|The Old Testament {{refers to}} ten {{individual}} commandments, {{even though there}} are more than ten imperative sentences in the two relevant texts: <b>Exodus</b> 20:1–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21. The Old Testament does not make clear how the texts should be divided to arrive at ten commandments. The division traditionally used by the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches was first derived by the Latin Church Father Augustine of Hippo (354–430) in his book Questions on <b>Exodus.</b> Other Christian communities, such as the Orthodox Church and many Protestant churches, use the formulation standardized by the Greek Fathers of the Christian East. The two forms have slightly different numbering, but maintain exactly the same substance despite some Protestant claims to the contrary. Rabbinic Jewish numbering is more closely aligned with the Eastern Church tradition, considering the text against covetousness as a single proscription, but differs from Christian denominations in that it considers what many Christians call a prologue to be the entire first commandment.|$|E
5|$|The White House Seder participants, {{many of them}} African Americans, were {{cognizant}} of {{the similarities between the}} story of the Israelites' <b>Exodus</b> from Egypt and the American civil rights movement. The themes of social justice, struggle, and freedom were often evoked during discussion at the meal. At the point in the ritual when the prophet Elijah is welcomed to the meal, the guests recited the Emancipation Proclamation.|$|E
5|$|The endings {{of the two}} {{poems are}} the same but have {{opposite}} results: they both have a sunset and an <b>exodus</b> from the country, but the first deals with Wales and the second with the Aztec lands. The first is messianic and heralds a return of Wales's greatness, and the second deals with a new country being created.|$|E
5|$|The new {{government}} sought {{to appease the}} protesters by reopening the border with Czechoslovakia. This, however, merely resulted in the resumption of the mass <b>exodus</b> through Hungary via Czechoslovakia. On 8November 1989, with huge demonstrations continuing across the country, the entire Politbüro resigned and a new, more moderate Politbüro was appointed under Krenz's continued leadership.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second Intifada and the resulting decrease in tourism also affected the Christian minority, since they are the owners of many Bethlehem hotels and services that cater to foreign tourists. A statistical analysis of the Christian <b>exodus</b> cited lack of economic and educational opportunity, especially due to the Christians' middle-class status and higher education. Since the Second Intifada, 10% of the Christian population have left the city.|$|E
5|$|To African Americans, {{the story}} of the <b>Exodus</b> was perhaps the central story, the most {{powerful}} image about emerging from the grip of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity – a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today. For me, personally, growing up in far-flung parts of the world and without firm roots, the story spoke to a yearning within every human being for a home.|$|E
5|$|Two millennia ago, humans {{developed}} spyrix, a {{power source}} which absorbs spirits to supply power. In response, the spirit Maxwell gathered humans, {{who share a}} symbiotic relationship with spirits, onto an isolated land protected by a barrier; the isolated land became known as Rieze Maxia and the outer lands as Elympios. As spirits are needed to sustain nature, Maxwell waits for the day all humans on Elympios die off before dispelling the barrier. Twenty {{years prior to the}} present, an Elympion cruise ship becomes trapped in Rieze Maxia, eventually forming a terrorist group known as <b>Exodus.</b> <b>Exodus</b> works with the Elympios military {{to find a way to}} destroy the barrier. In the present era, Rieze Maxia is ruled by two countries called Rashugal and Auj Oule. While the two countries appear to live in harmony, they both initiate black operations in attempts to conquer the other in hopes of uniting Rieze Maxia as a single country.|$|E
5|$|When Belgrano was {{dispatched}} to Upper Peru, María Josefa {{followed him to}} Jujuy. She {{took part in the}} Jujuy <b>Exodus</b> and saw the battle of Tucumán. It is thought that she was pregnant by this time. Her son, Pedro Pablo, was born on 30 July 1813. Pedro Pablo was adopted by Encarnación Ezcurra and her husband, Juan Manuel de Rosas, who she had married shortly before.|$|E
5|$|A carving {{at the top}} of the stele portrays Hammurabi {{receiving}} the laws from Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice, and the preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by Shamash to bring the laws to them. Parallels between this narrative and the giving of laws by God in Jewish tradition to Moses and similarities between the two legal codes suggest a common ancestor in the Semitic background of the two. Fragments of previous law codes have been found. However David P. Wright argues that the Covenant Code of the Biblical Book of <b>Exodus</b> is 'directly, primarily, and throughout' based upon the Laws of Hammurabi.|$|E
5|$|A {{little before}} 16:00, Ney noted an {{apparent}} <b>exodus</b> from Wellington's centre. He mistook {{the movement of}} casualties to the rear for {{the beginnings of a}} retreat, and sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with cavalry alone.|$|E
5|$|A {{national}} recession greatly {{affected the}} city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma {{heavily dependent on}} oil suffered the freefall in gas prices due to a glut, and a mass <b>exodus</b> of oil industries. Tulsa, heavily dependent on the oil industry, {{was one of the}} hardest hit cities by the fall of oil prices. By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy.|$|E
5|$|Another likely {{literary}} {{source is}} the plague narrative in the Book of <b>Exodus,</b> in which Egypt {{is covered by}} darkness for three days. It {{has been suggested that}} the author of Matthew's gospel changed the Marcan text slightly to more closely match this source. Commentators have also drawn comparisons with the description of darkness in the Genesis creation narrative, with a prophecy regarding mid-day darkness by Jeremiah, and with an end-times prophecy in the Book of Zechariah.|$|E
5|$|As the {{revolution}} progressed, many Tutsi left Rwanda to escape Hutu purges. The <b>exodus,</b> which began during the November 1959 arson attacks, continued steadily throughout {{the revolution}}. An official, late-1964 total of 336,000 Tutsi settled {{primarily in the}} four neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, Tanganyika (later Tanzania) and Congo-Léopoldville. The exiles, unlike the ethnic Rwandans who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial eras, were seen as refugees by their host countries and began almost immediately to agitate {{for a return to}} Rwanda. Their aims differed; some sought reconciliation with Kayibanda and the new regime, some affiliated with the exiled King Kigeli and others wished to oust the new PARMEHUTU regime from power and establish a socialist republic.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano is {{considered}} one of the greatest heroes in Argentina's history. A monument complex (Monumento Nacional a la Bandera, National Flag Memorial) was built in 1957 in honour of the flag, in Rosario. The Flag Memorial and the park that surround it are the seat of national celebrations every Flag Day, on 20 June, the anniversary of Belgrano's death. Jujuy Province is declared the honorary capital of Argentina each 23 August since 2002, in reference to the Jujuy <b>Exodus.</b>|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, Marine {{intelligence}} {{began to}} note an <b>exodus</b> of NVA units from the Khe Sanh sector. The 325C Divisional Headquarters {{was the first}} to leave, followed by the 95C and 101D Regiments, all of which relocated to the west. At the same time, the 304th Division withdrew to the southwest. That did not mean, however that battle was over. On 22 March over 1,000 North Vietnamese rounds fell on the base, and, once again, the ammunition dump was detonated.|$|E
5|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} heavy metal had {{branched}} {{in so many}} different directions that fans, record companies, and fanzines created numerous subgenres. The United States was especially known for one of these subgenres, thrash metal, which was innovated by bands like Anthrax, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Testament, <b>Exodus,</b> Nuclear Assault, Death Angel, Mono Men, The DT's, OFF!, and Overkill, with Metallica being the most commercially successful. The United States was {{known as one of the}} birthplaces of Death Metal during the mid to late 1980s. The Florida scene was the most well-known, featuring bands like Death, Morbid Angel, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Malevolent Creation, Obituary, and many others. There are now countless death metal and deathgrind bands across the country.|$|E
5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the <b>exodus</b> of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E
