5000|$|As of the 1994 model year, {{a limited}} edition model, known as Europa, was {{introduced}} on the European market. It could be ordered {{both as a}} saloon and an Avant. It was factory-equipped with power mirrors, alloy wheels, rear seat headrests, an airbag steering wheel, and offered a choice between power sunroof or air conditioning. It came in five different special colours. For [...] "regular" [...] 1994 B4 saloons and Avants, standard features as well as options available were stepped up too, including an airbag steering wheel and redesigned <b>door</b> <b>liners</b> (standard), and passenger airbags and a built-in engine immobiliser (optional).|$|R
50|$|Fisker offered {{many choices}} for the exterior, with custom Fisker colors {{including}} Titanium Crystal Metallic, Silver Quartz Metallic, Raptor Red, Ocean Blue Metallic, or White Sands Metallic. The base interior of the BMW was redone with new leather and color options, while retaining the electronics and telematics of the original BMW. The leather interiors could be customized to taste, {{with much of the}} work being done by an Italian firm, with colors that included Saddle, Coral Reef, Pebble, Sand, Cotto, Raised Sand, Midnight Black, or white. If desired by the customer, even the trunk can be fully lined with leather as part of the Custom Trim Package that also included upgraded center console, <b>door</b> <b>liners,</b> and instrument panels. Alcantara was extensively used in both the interior headliner and the trunk.|$|R

50|$|The hotel's Olympic Suite {{incorporates}} panelling, mirrors, {{a ceiling}} and {{stained glass windows}} which {{were removed from the}} RMS Olympic when she was being dismantled in Jarrow in 1936. The hotel's then-owner, Algenon Smart, had been a frequent traveller on Olympic and took part in the auction of the ship's fittings in November 1935. At the auction, which was run by the London firm Knight Frank & Rutley, he had the winning bids for elements of the First Class Lounge, the Aft First Class Staircase, and the revolving <b>door</b> from the <b>liner's</b> restaurant.|$|R
60|$|Dusk {{had fallen}} {{and rows of}} lights twinkled along the walls at the river-mouth. Tall {{chimneys}} and warehouses rose against the sky, there was a biting wind, and Marston shivered at the <b>door</b> of the <b>liner's</b> smoking-room. Her engines throbbed slackly as she steamed in with the tide, past the dark shapes of anchored vessels. A mile or two ahead, bright streaks, in which the separate lights were merged, marked the landing stages, and Marston looked for the red, white, and green triangle that would indicate the company's tug. For his comrade's sake, he was illogically relieved {{because he could not}} see her yet, although the moment he dreaded could not be put off long.|$|R
