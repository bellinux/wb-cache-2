40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of the over-the-counter derivative market has prompted dealers to lessen their <b>credit</b> risk <b>exposure</b> by adopting bilateral closeout netting agreements. This article shows that netting agreements will not only reduce current <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> but under certain circumstances will also dampen fluctuations in the volatility of dealers' exposures. Thus, netting agreements may limit potential <b>credit</b> <b>exposure,</b> or the possibility that <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> will increase over a fixed time horizon. Derivative securities...|$|R

The difference between the market value of US derivatives and the <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> to the financial system is due to netting - financial institutions tend to have many positions with their counterparties that have positive and negative values, resulting in a much smaller exposure than the sum of the market values of their derivative positions.

40|$|An {{analytical}} analogue to the Monte Carlo techniques previously used by banking supervisors {{to assess}} the potential <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> of interest rate swaps is developed, which permits a more thorough examination of swap exposure. This is done by using the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1985) one-factor model of the yield curve to generate interest rate paths from which swap <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> paths can be determined. Even with such a relatively simple interest rate process, the patterns of <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> {{are found to be}} more complex than the supervisors previous techniques allow: they vary with the level of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the volatility of the short rate - all factors which are ignored in the supervisors risk measurement methodology - and have a significantly non-linear relationship with swap maturity. In conclusion, market traders and regulators need to be alert to these factors in determining the appropriate level of capital to hold as protection against counterparty default. ...|$|R

40|$|Over-the-counter {{derivatives}} {{have contributed}} significantly to the effectiveness and efficiency of the international financial system but also entail significant counterparty credit risk. Collateralization {{is one of the most}} important and widespread credit risk mitigation techniques used in derivatives transactions. However, the relevant decisions are often made in an ad-hoc manner, without reference to an analytical framework. Very little academic research has addressed the quantitative analysis of collateralization for contingent credit risk control. The issue of mark-to-market timing becomes important for reducing <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> of illiquid and long term derivative contracts due to the difficulty and cost of marking to market. the goal of this research is to propose a framework for minimizing the potential <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> of collateralized derivative transactions by optimizing mark-to-market timing. ...|$|R

Michael Pykhtin and Steven Zhu offer a blueprint for modelling <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> and pricing counterparty risk. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial contract will default prior to the expiration of the contract and will not make all the payments required by the contract. Only the contracts privately negotiated between counterparties — over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and security financing transactions (SFT) — are subject to counterparty risk. Exchange-traded derivatives are not affected by counterparty risk, because the exchange guarantees the cash flows promised by the derivative t...|$|R

The dual approach shows us how to make banks correctly internalize the intraday network externalities they create in the real-time gross settlement system and provides an objective standard for the daily microprudential surveillance of the payment system. ...|$|R

5000|$|Collateral {{management}} is {{the method of}} granting, verifying, and giving advice on collateral transactions {{in order to reduce}} credit risk in unsecured financial transactions. The fundamental idea of collateral {{management is}} very simple, that is cash or securities are passed from one counterparty to another as security for a <b>credit</b> <b>exposure.</b> [...] In a swap transaction between parties A and B, party A makes a mark-to-market (MtM) profit whilst party B makes a corresponding MtM loss. Party B then presents some form of collateral to party A to mitigate the <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> that arises due to positive MtM. The form of collateral is agreed before initiation of the contract. Collateral agreements are often bilateral. Collateral has to be returned or posted in the opposite direction when exposure decreases. In the case of a positive MtM, an institution calls for collateral {{and in the case of}} a negative MtM they have to post collateral.|$|R
40|$|Under the Basel II banking {{regulatory}} capital regime the capital requirements for <b>credit</b> <b>exposures</b> are calculated using the Asymptotic Single Risk Factor (ASRF) approach.

Here we extend this approach to calculate capital requirements for equity investments.

We show that the capital requirements for equity investments are quite different to those of <b>credit</b> <b>exposures,</b> since equity investments can suffer substantial loss of value even when the underlying company has not defaulted. Unexpected loss is commonly used as a measure of capital requirements, but it ignores the ability of earnings to absorb loss.
