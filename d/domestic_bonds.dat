6000|$|In the quarrel earlier {{alluded to}} between the {{energetic}} Progressive and the obstinate Conservative (or, {{to talk a}} tenderer language, between Hudge and Gudge), the state of cross-purposes is at the present moment acute. The Tory {{says he wants to}} preserve family life in Cindertown; the Socialist very reasonably points out to him that in Cindertown at present there isn't any family life to preserve. But Hudge, the Socialist, in his turn, is highly vague and mysterious about whether he would preserve the family life if there were any; or whether he will try to restore it where it has disappeared. It is all very confusing. The Tory sometimes talks {{as if he wanted to}} tighten the <b>domestic</b> <b>bonds</b> that do not exist; the Socialist as if he wanted to loosen the bonds that do not bind anybody. The question we all want to ask of both of them is the original ideal question, [...] "Do you want to keep the family at all?" [...] If Hudge, the Socialist, does want the family he must be prepared for the natural restraints, distinctions and divisions of labor in the family. He must brace himself up to bear the idea of the woman having a preference for the private house and a man for the public house. He must manage to endure somehow the idea of a woman being womanly, which does not mean soft and yielding, but handy, thrifty, rather hard, and very humorous. He must confront without a quiver the notion of a child who shall be childish, that is, full of energy, but without an idea of independence; fundamentally as eager for authority as for information and butter-scotch. If a man, a woman and a child live together any more in free and sovereign households, these ancient relations will recur; and Hudge must put up with it. He can only avoid it by destroying the family, driving both sexes into sexless hives and hordes, and bringing up all children as the children of the state--like Oliver Twist. But if these stern words must be addressed to Hudge, neither shall Gudge escape a somewhat severe admonition. For the plain truth to be told pretty sharply to the Tory is this, that if he wants the family to remain, if he wants to be strong enough to resist the rending forces of our essentially savage commerce, he must make some very big sacrifices and try to equalize property. The overwhelming mass of the English people at this particular instant are simply too poor to be domestic. They are as domestic as they can manage; they are much more domestic than the governing class; but they cannot get what good there was originally meant to be in this institution, simply because they have not got enough money. The man ought to stand for a certain magnanimity, quite lawfully expressed in throwing money away: but if under given circumstances he can only do it by throwing the week's food away, then he is not magnanimous, but mean. The woman ought to stand for a certain wisdom which is well expressed in valuing things rightly and guarding money sensibly; but how is she to guard money if there is no money to guard? The child ought to look on his mother as a fountain of natural fun and poetry; but how can he unless the fountain, like other fountains, is allowed to play? What chance have any of these ancient arts and functions in a house so hideously topsy-turvy; a house where the woman is out working and the man isn't; and the child is forced by law to think his schoolmaster's requirements more important than his mother's? No, Gudge and his friends in the House of Lords and the Carlton Club must make up their minds on this matter, and that very quickly. If they are content to have England turned into a beehive and an ant-hill, decorated here and there with a few faded butterflies playing at an old game called domesticity in the intervals of the divorce court, then let them have their empire of insects; they will find plenty of Socialists who will give it to them. But if they want a domestic England, they must [...] "shell out," [...] as the phrase goes, to a vastly greater extent than any Radical politician has yet dared to suggest; they must endure burdens much heavier than the Budget and strokes much deadlier than the death duties; for the thing to be done is nothing more nor less than the distribution of the great fortunes and the great estates. We can now only avoid Socialism by a change as vast as Socialism. If we are to save property, we must distribute property, almost as sternly and sweepingly as did the French Revolution. If we are to preserve the family we must revolutionize the nation.|$|E

40|$|An {{explanation}} for the widely-observed phenomenon of home country asset preference {{is provided by the}} existence of government debt. Domestic government debt implies future taxes for domestic residents. Since no market exists for the statutory obligation to pay taxes, the present value of future tax payments needed to finance government debt is viewed as a nontraded asset (or liability). Because there is a positive covariation in the return on the <b>domestic</b> <b>bond</b> with the government debt liability, holding the <b>domestic</b> <b>bond</b> reduces the variation in the return on domestic residents' traded plus nontraded, or total wealth. For this reason, risk-averse domestic assetholders are shown {{to increase the amount of}} traded wealth they hold in <b>domestic</b> government <b>bonds</b> as <b>domestic</b> government debt increases. ...|$|R

50|$|Sterilized {{intervention}} {{is a policy}} that attempts to influence the exchange rate without changing the monetary base. The procedure {{is a combination of}} two transactions. First, the central bank conducts a nonsterilized intervention by buying (selling) foreign currency bonds using domestic currency that it issues. Then the central bank “sterilizes” the effects on the monetary base by selling (buying) a corresponding quantity of domestic-currency-denominated bonds to soak up the initial increase (decrease) of the domestic currency. The net effect of the two operations is the same as a swap of domestic-currency bonds for foreign-currency bonds with no change in the money supply. With sterilization, any purchase of foreign exchange is accompanied by an equal-valued sale of <b>domestic</b> <b>bonds,</b> and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|In {{the very}} short run the money supply is {{normally}} predetermined by the past history of international payments flows. If the central bank is maintaining an exchange rate {{that is consistent with}} a balance of payments surplus, over time money will flow into the country and the money supply will rise (and vice versa for a payments deficit). If the central bank were to conduct open market operations in the domestic bond market in order to offset these balance-of-payments-induced changes in the money supply — a process called sterilization, it would absorb newly arrived money by decreasing its holdings of <b>domestic</b> <b>bonds</b> (or the opposite if money were flowing out of the country).

50|$|The {{rapid growth}} of foreign {{investment}} after 1780 (as seen above) coincided with a redirection of the investment to governments other than the British. Many Dutch investors liquidated their British portfolios after the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (which immediately resulted in a rise in British interest rates) and reinvested in French, Spanish, Polish (an especially bad choice {{in view of the}} coming Partitions of Poland), and even American government loans. The appetite for such placements abated a little after the first defaults of foreign governments (like the French in 1793), but even under the Batavian Republic (which itself absorbed the bulk of available funds after 1795) investment in foreign funds did not fall-off completely. This may have been because Dutch investors did not always realize the riskiness of this type of investment. They were often badly served by the merchant banks, who had a vested interest in protecting their sovereign clients {{to the detriment of the}} bondholders. This is also indicated by the very slight agio of the interest rate of these risky loans over that for <b>domestic</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the conditions under}} which expected inflation might influence the money demand, using a microeconomic model where the transactions of the representative agent are facilitated by its holdings of money. We assume that the agent holds a real asset, along with a range of nominal assets, that may include domestic money, foreign money, <b>domestic</b> <b>bonds</b> and foreign bonds. In this model, the optimal choice between money and bonds is embedded in a portfolio choice between the real asset and risky assets (the Merton problem). We show that, as long as the agent is not constrained in her holdings of bonds, the demand for domestic money will not, in general, depend on expected inflation. The demand for money may however become a positive function of the inflation rate in case the agent is constrained in her holdings of foreign bonds. The only case in which the demand for domestic money may depend negatively on the inflation rate is when the agent faces a binding constraint in her holdings of <b>domestic</b> <b>bonds.</b> COMPETE; QREN; FEDER; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|E

40|$|The home bias is {{observed}} {{in the composition of}} portfolios of different classes of financial assets. The literature offers conflicting arguments about the rationality of this behavior {{in the case of the}} portfolios invested in short-term securities, commonly known as currency deposits. In the context of an economy subject to strong volatility, the conventional wisdom suggests that conservative investors should concentrate these deposits on <b>domestic</b> <b>bonds.</b> However, these instruments can be very risky for a long-term investor due to uncertainty about the future short-term interest rate. Not least important, under the assumption of uncovered interest parity, it may be optimal for this investor to maintain foreign currency deposits as a hedge against a deterioration of the domestic investment opportunities. On the root of this argument is the fact that the lower expected return on <b>domestic</b> <b>bonds,</b> as it stimulates the outflow of capital, it is accompanied by real depreciation of the domestic currency. Therefore, the foreign currency deposits reduce the volatility of future wealth as the size of current wealth tends to increase when its expected return decreases.

The main conclusion is that fairly conservative investors should allocate significant part of these deposits in dollars, pounds and ienes...|$|E
