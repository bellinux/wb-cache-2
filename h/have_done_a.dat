5|$|The creek's use as {{a tribal}} {{boundary}} is disputed. As other southern California Native Americans <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>a</b> tribe typically claimed {{both sides of a}} stream or river—and used drainage divides as boundaries instead. However, the presence of Aliso Canyon, a steep and difficult-to-traverse gorge, suggests the opposite. Kroeber (1907) was the first to support this theory, and many other archaeologists have followed as well. The Juaneño disagree, arguing that their boundary stretches north to the northern drainage divide of the Aliso Creek watershed, which supports the practice of claiming both sides of a stream.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 15th century, the {{achieving}} of the effect of realistic space in a painting by the employment of linear perspective was a major preoccupation of many painters, as well as the architects Brunelleschi and Alberti who both theorised about the subject. Brunelleschi is known to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> number of careful studies of the piazza and octagonal baptistery outside Florence Cathedral and it is thought he aided Masaccio in the creation of his famous trompe l'oeil niche around the Holy Trinity he painted at Santa Maria Novella.|$|E
25|$|Lawler {{has stated}} several {{theories}} {{as to why}} he was allowed to leave. His first involves the ascent of Carter's career alongside the downfall of Chyna's. In his contention, Chyna was jealous of his wife's push inside the company, in part due to the Right to Censor storyline, and in part because of his wife's offer to pose for Playboy magazine. Until that time, Chyna had been the second major wrestling star from the World Wrestling Federation to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> piece in Playboy (after Sable); during Chyna's debut on the adult magazine, she had suddenly broken her friendship with Carter.|$|E
25|$|After a death {{sentence}} is affirmed in state collateral review, the prisoner may file for federal habeas corpus, which is a unique type of lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts. Federal habeas corpus {{is a type of}} collateral review, and {{it is the only way}} that state prisoners may attack a {{death sentence}} in federal court (other than petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal habeas corpus is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal constitutional rights. Prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling. According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of death penalty cases are reversed through federal habeas corpus.|$|E

25|$|Over time, {{alternative}} {{theories of}} Child Development {{have been put}} forward, and empirical findings <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> lot to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during {{the first phase of}} the experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies' understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand that other people have desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view that children are very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory (Lourenço & Machado, 1996).|$|E

500|$|Hugh Robert Mill, {{writing in}} 1905 before the non-existence of New South Greenland had been finally established, [...] {{concluded}} {{that because of}} Morrell's blunders, and his habit of incorporating the experiences of others into his story, all his claims {{should be treated as}} unproven. Nevertheless, he conceded that [...] "a man may be ignorant, boastful and obscure, and yet <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> solid piece of work". The Canadian geographer Paul Simpson-Housley, although sceptical about much of Morrell's account, suggests that the speeds claimed for the derided western journey, though fast, were not impossible, [...] and Morrell's farthest south in the Weddell Sea, queried by Mill, [...] is entirely plausible, given that James Weddell had sailed four degrees further south just a month earlier.|$|E

During the 2012 United States presidential election, Cher and comedian Kathy Griffin released a public service announcement titled [...] "Don't Let Mitt Turn Back Time on Women's Rights".
