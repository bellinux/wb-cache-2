5|$|Today's California condor is {{the sole}} {{surviving}} member of Gymnogyps and has no accepted subspecies. However, there is a Late Pleistocene form that is sometimes regarded as a palaeosubspecies, <b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus</b> amplus. Current opinions are mixed regarding the classification of the form as a chronospecies or a separate species Gymnogyps amplus. Gymnogyps amplus occurred {{over much of the}} bird's historical range – even extending into Florida – but was larger, having about the same weight as the Andean condor.

40|$|Lamb {{losses to}} {{predation}} have historically ranged from 4 % to 8 % {{in the western}} United States but most data are over 30 yr old. We repeated a sheep depredation study conducted from 1972 through 1975 on Cedar Mountain, Utah, to determine how predation rates have changed {{over the last three}} decades. Pastures and herd sizes were similar (1 730 lambs) between our study (2006 and 2007) and the prior one. Additionally, 40 % of the ranchers in our study also participated in the prior study. During 2006 and 2007, 5. 8 % of all lambs on Cedar Mountain were lost to all causes compared to 9. 5 % during the 1970 s. Predators were responsible for 87 % of all checked lamb losses during our study versus 83 % during the 1970 s. We estimated that 4. 9 % of all lambs on Cedar Mountain were killed by predators during our study compared to 7. 9 % during the 1970 s. During our study, coyotes (Canis latrans Say) were responsible for 67 % of the depredated lambs, cougars (Felis concolor Linnaeus) for 31 %, and black bears (Ursus americanus Pallas) for 2 %.

40|$|Five out of 169 fertile California condor (<b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus)</b> eggs laid {{in captivity}} have {{exhibited}} chondrodystrophy, a lethal form of dwarfism.

We estimate that the frequency of this putative allele is about 9 %. This high frequency is probably due to a founder effect. We consider three management options for the allele: ignoring it, eliminating it by selection and minimizing its phenotypic manifestation by avoiding matings between possible carriers. We recommend minimizing its phenotypic expression because an unacceptably large proportion of condors (up to 78 out of 146) would be prevented from breeding under a selection strategy designed to eliminate the allele. We predict that many captive populations will prove similar to the California condor population in that it will prove inadvisable or impractical to select against one or more deleterious alleles detected in the population. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Condors and {{vultures}} {{are distinct}} from most other terrestrial birds because they use extensive soaring flight for their daily movements. Therefore, assessing resource selection by these avian scavengers requires quantifying {{the availability of}} terrestrial-based habitats, as well as meteorological variables that influence atmospheric conditions necessary for soaring. In this study, we undertook the first quantitative assessment of habitat- and meteorological-based resource selection in the endangered California condor (<b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus)</b> within its California range and across the annual cycle. We found that condor use of terrestrial areas did not change markedly within the annual cycle, and that condor use was greatest for habitats where food resources and potential predators could be detected and where terrain was amenable for taking off from the ground in flight (e. g., sparse habitats, coastal areas). Condors originating from different release sites differed {{in their use of}} habitat, but this was likely due in part to variation in habitats surrounding release sites. Meteorological conditions were linked to condor use of ecological subregions, with thermal height, thermal velocity, and wind speed having both positive (selection) and negative (avoidance) effects on condor use in different areas. We found little evidence of systematic effects between individual characteristics (i. e., sex, age, breeding status) or components of the specie...|$|R
40|$|Lead {{poisoning}} is {{a primary}} factor impeding the survival and recovery of the critically endangered California Condor (<b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus).</b> However, the frequency and magnitude of lead exposure in condors is not well-known in part because most blood lead monitoring occurs biannually, and biannual blood samples capture only approximately 10 % of a bird's annual exposure history. We investigated the use of growing feathers from free-flying condors in California to establish a bird's lead exposure history. We show that lead concentration and stable lead isotopic composition analyses of sequential feather sections and concurrently collected blood samples provided a comprehensive history of lead exposure over the 2 - 4 month period of feather growth. Feather analyses identified exposure events not evident from blood monitoring efforts, and by fitting an empirically derived timeline to actively growing feathers, {{we were able to}} estimate the time frame for specific lead exposure events. Our results demonstrate the utility of using sequentially sampled feathers to reconstruct lead exposure history. Since exposure risk in individuals is one determinant of population health, our findings should increase the understanding of population-level effects from lead poisoning in condors; this information may also be helpful for other avian species potentially impacted by lead poisoning...|$|R
40|$|We {{document}} {{causes of}} death in free-ranging California Condors (<b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus)</b> from {{the inception of the}} reintroduction program in 1992 through December 2009 to identify current and historic mortality factors that might interfere with establishment of self-sustaining populations in the wild. A total of 135 deaths occurred from October 1992 (the first post-release death) through December 2009, from a maximum population-at-risk of 352 birds, for a cumulative crude mortality rate of 38 %. A definitive cause of death was determined for 76 of the 98 submitted cases, 70 % (53 / 76) of which were attributed to anthropogenic causes. Trash ingestion was the most important mortality factor in nestlings (proportional mortality rate [PMR] 73 %; 8 / 11), while lead toxicosis was {{the most important factor in}} juveniles (PMR 26 %; 13 / 50) and adults (PMR 67 %; 10 / 15). These results demonstrate that the leading {{causes of death}} at all California Condor release sites are anthropogenic. The mortality factors thought to be important in the decline of the historic California Condor population, particularly lead poisoning, remain the most important documented mortality factors today. Without effective mitigation, these factors can be expected to have the same effects on the sustainability of the wild populations as they have in the past...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} {{new methods}} for quantifying specific in-situ activities of wildlife, {{in this case}} the endangered Cali-fornia condor (<b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus).</b> These methods extract information from hundreds of thousands of temporally continuous and spatially explicit satellite telemetry reports. Visual observations and ground-based telemetry can provide behavioral data, although the information is often spatially and temporally limited and sample sizes can be small for wide-ranging species. Automated satellite telemetry offers continuous position reporting and unbiased spatial coverage, but to date has lacked thematic content such as the time, place, and duration of particular activities. Procedures developed for this study use a combination of models and geographic information systems (GIS) to identify condor transit flight, perch-ing, roosting, and nesting activity based only on hourly telemetry position reports. This approach combines the temporal and spatial advantages of automated telemetry with increased thematic quality from activity models. The analytical meth-ods were applied to 340, 694 satellite-based position records from 51 California condors which were collected from June 2005 to April 2012. We identified 31, 268 extended perch locations and an additional 15, 483 overnight roost locations by translating basic location, speed, and time data into characterizations of bird activities. This approach correctly identified nine of the ten known nest sites occupied by condors outfitted with telemetry transmitters based only on the telemetry da...|$|R
40|$|This review {{examines}} the main developments {{that have occurred}} over the past 50 years {{in our understanding of}} three aspects of raptor biology: (1) natural factors that limit breeding densities; (2) influences of toxic chemicals; and (3) movements and migrations. Early evidence indicated that raptor breeding densities were limited naturally by the availability of either prey or nest sites, whichever was in shortest supply in the area concerned. More recent evidence has shown that predation can have additional influence, with larger raptors and owls limiting the numbers of smaller ones to below what food or nest sites would permit. In addition, it has become apparent that some migratory raptors, like other migratory birds, can be limited in their migration and wintering areas to levels below those that conditions in breeding areas would permit. As many raptor populations have recovered from the effects of organochlorine pesticides, attention has switched to other limiting agents, including lead (from ammunition), which is currently preventing California Condors (<b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus)</b> from establishing self-sustaining populations in the wild, and anti-inflammatory veterinary drugs, which have caused massive declines in Asia vultures (Gyps spp.). The development of radio-tracking enabled studies of the local movements of individual raptors, providing new information on territories and ranging behavior, while satellite-based tracking has revealed the migration routes, wintering areas, and behavior of hundreds of individual birds...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the world, {{populations of}} {{scavenger}} birds are declining rapidly with some populations {{already on the}} brink of extinction. Much of the current research into the factors contributing to these declines has focused on exposure to drug residues, lead, and other toxins. Despite increased monitoring of these declining populations, little is known about infectious diseases affecting scavenger bird species. To assess potential infectious disease risks to both obligate and facultative scavenger bird species, we performed a serosurvey for eleven potential pathogens in three species of scavenging birds in California: the California condor (<b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus),</b> turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). California condors were seropositive for avian adenovirus, infectious bronchitis virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, avian paramyxovirus- 2, West Nile virus (WNV) and Toxoplasma gondii. Golden eagles were seropositive for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci and Toxoplasma gondii, and turkey vultures were seropositive for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci, avian paramyxovirus- 1, Toxoplasma gondii and WNV. Risk factor analyses indicated that rearing site and original release location were significantly associated with a positive serologic titer to WNV among free-flying condors. This study provides preliminary baseline data on infectious disease exposure in these populations for aiding in early disease detection and provides potentially critical information for conservation of the endangered California condor as it continues to expand its range and encounter new infectious disease threats...|$|R
40|$|The California Condor (<b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus)</b> has {{recently}} survived a severe population bottleneck. The entire population {{was reduced to}} 27 individuals in 1982. The number of genetic founders was even smaller. We obtained 482 base pairs of DNA sequence from the mitochondrial control region (CR) of all founder individuals that potentially represented unique maternal haplotypes. Four unique haplotypes {{were present in the}} genetic founders. One of these haplotypes is unique to Topatopa, a male brought into captivity in 1967, whose haplotype will not persist in the future population. Haplotype diversity (h) was reduced by 25 % between the founder population and our census of the 2002 population. Nucleotide diversity (θ) did not vary significantly between the founders and the current population. Our results provide insights into condor genetics. First, where recessive deleterious alleles have been expressed in progeny (e. g., chondrodystrophy) the breeding pair shares the same mitochondrial haplotype. Second, we identifi ed the presence of a nuclear copy of the mitochondrial control region and provide condor specific primer sequences to preferentially amplify DNA of mitochondrial origin. Third, we confirm low levels of genetic diversity in the captive population as suggested by previous research. Forth, we question whether the low level of diversity is a consequence of the 20 th century bottleneck, or if diversity has been historically low over a much longer time scale...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del póster presentado a la 10 th Conference of the European Ornithologist's Union, celebrada en Badajoz (España) del 24 al 28 de agosto de 2015. Electrocution is a {{major problem}} for large raptors in open areas. The {{construction}} of safe electrical pole and wire configurations is the primary way of reducing this mortality and has been applied successfully in many regions of the Iberian Peninsula. However, electrocution is still the main cause of mortality for the Spanish Imperial Eagle. We employed an electric fence equipped power pole in a flight cage to train rehabilitated eagles ready for release to not use these poles as perches. To date three eagles were trained and released. Despite being the highest and most attractive perch in the cage avoidance of the power pole was effective after two low power electric shock experiences. Post- release satellite transmitter data is available only for one of the three individuals. This two-year-old eagle has establishes a small home range in an open area, and five months after release is still avoiding power poles as perches. These preliminary results show that similarly to other species such as the Californian Condor (<b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus)</b> or the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) conditioned learning is effective in the mid-term, as an additional tool to the correction of dangerous power poles.

40|$|Endangered species {{recovery}} programs seek {{to restore}} populations to self-sustaining levels. Nonetheless, many recovering species require continuing management {{to compensate for}} persistent threats in their environment. Judging true recovery {{in the face of}} this management is often difficult, impeding thorough analysis of the success of conservation programs. We illustrate these challenges with a multidisciplinary study of one of the world's rarest birds-the California condor (<b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus).</b> California condors were brought to the brink of extinction, in part, because of lead poisoning, and lead poisoning remains a significant threat today. We evaluated individual lead-related health effects, the efficacy of current efforts to prevent lead-caused deaths, and the consequences of any reduction in currently intensive management actions. Our results show that condors in California remain chronically exposed to harmful levels of lead; 30 % of the annual blood samples collected from condors indicate lead exposure (blood lead ≥ 200 ng/mL) that causes significant subclinical health effects, measured as > 60 % inhibition of the heme biosynthetic enzyme δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase. Furthermore, each year, ∼ 20 % of free-flying birds have blood lead levels (≥ 450 ng/mL) that indicate the need for clinical intervention to avert morbidity and mortality. Lead isotopic analysis shows that lead-based ammunition is the principle source of lead poisoning in condors. Finally, population models based on condor demographic data show that the condor's apparent recovery is solely because of intensive ongoing management, with the only hope of achieving true recovery dependent on the elimination or substantial reduction of lead poisoning rates...|$|R
40|$|The {{critically}} endangered California condor (<b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus)</b> {{has been}} the focus of intensive conservation efforts for several decades. Reduced to a population size of twenty-three birds in 1985, the entire surviving population was brought under captive management for recovery. Founded by fourteen individuals, the surviving California condor gene pool has been managed through captive breeding of individuals paired through pedigree analysis. As of August, 2013, there were 424 California condor individuals; 223 are flying in the wild in four re-introduced populations in California, Arizona and Baja California, Mexico. All condors have their sex identified via amplification of sex chromosome specific markers and DNA samples are stored for every individual of the species. Microsatellite genotyping has confirmed parentage in captive and wild condor chicks, corrected switched identities, and identified successful extra-pair copulation in the wild population. Whole genome sequencing using data generated on multiple platforms has been used to produce a de novo genome assembly for a founder male condor and thirty additional condors that together encompass the entire genetic variation of the species, perhaps the first time such a comprehensive effort has been conducted for any species. Studbook-based kinship relationships between founder birds and kinship estimates from genome-wide genetic variation can be compared and evaluated in the context of retention of genetic diversity in the generations of California condors. Genomic studies of California condors are providing a model system for avian conservation genomics and allow empirical evaluation of basic facets of transmission genetics, including segregation, linkage, recombination and mutation...|$|R
40|$|California condors (<b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus)</b> {{released}} into the wild in Arizona ranged widely in Arizona and Utah. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the blood lead concentrations of many of the birds rise because of ingestion of spent lead ammunition. Condors were routinely recaptured and treated to reduce their lead levels as necessary but, even so, several died from lead poisoning. We used tracking data from VHF and satellite tags, together with the results of routine testing of blood lead concentrations, to estimate daily changes in blood lead level in relation to the location of each bird. The mean daily increment in blood lead concentration depended upon both the location of the bird and the time of year. Birds that spent time during the deer hunting season in two areas in which deer were shot with lead ammunition (Kaibab Plateau (Arizona) and Zion (Utah)) were especially likely to have high blood lead levels. The influence upon blood lead level of presence in a particular area declined with time elapsed since the bird was last there. We estimated the daily blood lead level for each bird and its influence upon daily mortality rate from lead poisoning. Condors with high blood lead over a protracted period were much more likely to die than birds with low blood lead or short-term elevation. We simulated the effect of ending the existing lead exposure reduction measures at Kaibab Plateau, which encourage the voluntary use of non-lead ammunition and removal of gut piles of deer and elk killed using lead ammunition. The estimated mortality rate due to lead in the absence of this program was sufficiently high that the condor population would be expected to declin...|$|R

Our approach, which disentangles niche models into activity-specific components, has applications for other species where it is routinely assumed (often incorrectly) that individuals fulfill all requirements for life within a single environmental space. Ecological niche models conformed to our understanding of California condor ecology, had good predictive performance when tested with data withheld from model development, and aided in the identification of several candidate reintroduction areas outside of the current distribution of the species. Our results suggest there are large unoccupied regions of the California condor’s historical range that have retained ecological features similar to currently occupied habitats, and thus could be considered for future reintroduction efforts.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2009 Pressure from {{potential}} predators makes vigilance critical for an individual???s survival, especially {{during times of}} vulnerability. California condors (<b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus),</b> with their heavy bodies and large, broad wings, are slow to take-off. This makes vigilance an essential survival behavior for condors due to their susceptibility when feeding on carcasses. Relatively high overall mortality among reintroduced condors has raised questions regarding the suitability of release candidates. Reduction in this overall mortality is of primary concern to the California Condor Recovery Program. I investigated factors influencing vigilance in 31 reintroduced California condors while feeding on proffered carcasses at a primary release site in Southern California. I measured individual vigilance, via scanning frequency, and a suite of factors previously shown to influence vigilance. I used an information theoretic approach to determine which {{of a set of}} explanatory models best fit the variation in anti-predator scanning frequency observed in my data. The best fitting model incorporated the following variables in order of decreasing importance: a negative correlation with the number of individuals at the carcass feeding site, a negative correlation with Julian date, a positive correlation with focal bird age, sex (males were more vigilant than females), and a negative correlation with ambient temperature. Examination of survival behaviors such as vigilance may allow for more rapid identification of problematic behaviors in release candidates, as well as providing insight for aviculturists and field managers regarding foci for future management efforts.

In this study, we used high-resolution GPS location data to quantify monthly home range size of the critically endangered California Condor <b>Gymnogyps</b> <b>californianus</b> throughout the annual cycle in California. We assessed whether individual-level characteristics (age, sex and breeding status) and factors related to endangered species recovery program efforts (rearing method, release site) were linked to variation in monthly home range size. We found that monthly home range size varied across the annual cycle, with the largest monthly home ranges observed during late summer and early fall (July-October), a pattern that may be linked to seasonal changes in thermals that facilitate movement. Monthly home ranges of adults were significantly larger than those of immatures, but males and females used monthly home ranges of similar size throughout the year and breeding adults did not differ from non-breeding adults in their average monthly home range size. Individuals from each of three release sites differed significantly in the size of their monthly home ranges, and no differences in monthly home range size were detected between condors reared under captive conditions relative to those reared in the wild. Our study provides an important foundation for understanding the movement ecology of the California Condor and it highlights the importance of seasonal variation in space use for effective conservation planning for this critically endangered species...|$|R
