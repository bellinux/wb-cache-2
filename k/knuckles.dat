5|$|Knuckles' {{story begins}} in Mushroom Hill, {{where he is}} {{relaxing}} with his animal friends but is interrupted by a bomb dropped by EggRobo. This prompts <b>Knuckles</b> to chase after him, leading him {{through most of the}} same zones Sonic went through. The chase ends at the damaged remains of Sky Sanctuary, where a robot called Mecha Sonic attacks <b>Knuckles</b> but accidentally destroys EggRobo instead. After a short fight, Mecha Sonic uses the power of the Master Emerald to achieve a Super form similar to Sonic's. <b>Knuckles</b> manages to defeat Super Mecha Sonic, who explodes. Sonic flies in piloting the biplane Tornado and <b>Knuckles</b> hitches a ride to return the Master Emerald to Angel Island. If all the Chaos Emeralds are collected, Angel Island rises upwards, into the sky. However, if the player has not collected all the Chaos Emeralds, <b>Knuckles</b> cannot redeem the Master Emerald, and Angel Island plummets into the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Sonic & <b>Knuckles</b> is a 1994 side-scrolling {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by Sonic Team {{and published by}} Sega for the Sega Genesis. An installment in the main Sonic the Hedgehog series, it is a direct sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which released earlier that year. The story follows Sonic the Hedgehog and <b>Knuckles</b> the Echidna in their respective quests to save Angel Island; Sonic tries to prevent Dr. Robotnik from relaunching his orbital weapon, the Death Egg, while <b>Knuckles</b> scuffles with Robotnik's minion, known as EggRobo.|$|E

40|$|Automated {{biometrics}} identification using finger <b>knuckle</b> images {{has increasingly}} generated interest among researchers with emerging applications in human forensics and biometrics. Prior {{efforts in the}} biometrics literature have only investigated the major finger <b>knuckle</b> patterns that are formed on the finger surface joining proximal phalanx and middle phalanx bones. This paper investigates the possible use of minor finger <b>knuckle</b> patterns, which are formed on the finger surface joining distal phalanx and middle phalanx bones. The minor finger <b>knuckle</b> patterns can either be used as independent biometric patterns or employed to improve the performance from the major finger <b>knuckle</b> patterns. A completely automated approach for the minor finger <b>knuckle</b> identification is developed with key steps for region of interest segmentation, image normalization, enhancement, and robust matching to accommodate image variations. This paper also introduces a new or first publicly available database for minor (also major) finger <b>knuckle</b> images from 503 different subjects. The efforts to develop an automated minor finger <b>knuckle</b> pattern matching scheme achieve promising results and illustrate its simultaneous use to significantly improve the performance over the conventional finger <b>knuckle</b> identification. Several open questions on the stability and uniqueness of finger <b>knuckle</b> patterns should be addressed before <b>knuckle</b> pattern/image evidence can be admissible as supportive evidence {{in a court of}} law. Therefore, this paper also presents a study on the stability of finger <b>knuckle</b> patterns from images acquired with an interval of 4 - 7 years. The experimental results and the images presented in this paper provide new insights on the finger <b>knuckle</b> pattern and identify the need for further work to exploit finger <b>knuckle</b> patterns in forensics and biometrics applications.

5|$|The player {{character}} {{moves through}} six levels, each {{divided into two}} acts. The first act of each level ends with a miniboss fight with one of Dr. Robotnik's robots, while the second ends with a regular boss fight with Robotnik (or EggRobo in Knuckles' campaign). Sonic and <b>Knuckles</b> traverse levels differently: Sonic can jump slightly higher, is faster and can use the insta-shield ability which makes him invincible for a split-second, whereas <b>Knuckles</b> can glide, break obstacles and climb most walls. The levels also include cutscenes that differ based on the character selected, as Sonic and <b>Knuckles</b> are rivals {{for most of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} {{immediately}} after the events of Sonic 3, where Dr. Robotnik's orbital weapon, the Death Egg, is damaged in a battle with Sonic and crash-lands back onto Angel Island. Sonic travels through each zone looking to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to defeat Robotnik, and once again comes into conflict with <b>Knuckles,</b> who believes Sonic is trying to steal the Emeralds for himself. In Hidden Palace Zone, Sonic fights and defeats <b>Knuckles.</b> The two hear a disturbance outside of the chamber, and go out to find Dr. Robotnik stealing the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. <b>Knuckles</b> attempts to attack Robotnik, but is electrically shocked in the process, and is trapped with Sonic in an underground passage. <b>Knuckles,</b> realizing Sonic is on his side, shows him a portal that leads them to Sky Sanctuary, where the Death Egg is relaunching. Sonic proceeds to infiltrate the Death Egg, and defeats Robotnik as Super Sonic.|$|E

30|$|Recently, a new {{biometric}} technology {{based on}} finger <b>knuckle</b> print has {{attracted much attention}} in the biometrics research community. Finger <b>knuckle</b> print is highly unique, {{so it can be}} served as a distinctive biometric identifier [1 â€“ 5]. Compared with traditional biometric techniques (e.g., faces, fingerprints, and voices), finger <b>knuckle</b> print exhibits some advantages in real application: (1) It is hard to be abraded since people hold stuffs with inner side of their hands. (2) Unlike fingerprint, there is no stigma of criminal investigation associated with finger <b>knuckle</b> print. So, finger <b>knuckle</b> print has a high user acceptance rate [6]. (3) People rarely leave finger <b>knuckle</b> print on stuff surface, making the loss of private data less possible. Hence, finger <b>knuckle</b> print is considered {{to be one of the}} most promising biometric techniques for personal identification in future.|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{details the}} {{development}} of a smartphone based online system to automatically identify a person by using their finger <b>knuckle</b> image. The key objective is to exploit user-friendly biometric, with least privacy concern, to enhance security of the data in smartphone. The final product from this research is a finger <b>knuckle</b> authentication smartphone application, which is developed under Android operating system with environment version 2. 3. 3. This paper has developed some specialized algorithms for the finger <b>knuckle</b> detection, image pre-processing and region segmentation. Automatically detected and segmented finger <b>knuckle</b> images are used to encode finger <b>knuckle</b> pattern phase information using a pair of log-Gabor filters. Efficient implementation of various modules is achieved in C/C++ programming language, with OpenCV library, for online application. We also developed a user-friendly graphical user interface for the users to enroll and authenticate themselves. The developed system can therefore acquire finger <b>knuckle</b> image from the smartphone camera and automatically authenticate the genuine users. This paper has also developed a new smartphone based finger <b>knuckle</b> image database of 561 finger <b>knuckle</b> images of 187 different fingers from 109 users, in real imaging environment.
