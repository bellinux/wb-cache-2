He oversaw {{tax cuts and}} advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so {{that the government would}} not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down.

[...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the chance elements to our life and that's kind of {{the embodiment of the}} feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." [...] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?" [...] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: [...] "It can mean so many things to so many different people." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, Lundgren {{planned on}} playing a {{supporting}} role, {{with a more}} famous actor in the lead. He also considered directing the film, but decided against it, as he desired {{to learn more about}} producing. In 2013, Lundgren announced the casting of Tony Jaa, in the role of Tony Vitayakul; and Ekachai Uekrongtham as the director. Lundgren chose Uekrongtham after being impressed with his film, Beautiful Boxer. He contacted him through a mutual friend in Los Angeles, and in mid-2013, they arranged to meet in the city. While he had previously turned down scripts offered to him for international markets, Uekrongtham found Skin Trade [...] "riveting". He said the script [...] " [...] the potential to work as a character-driven piece while saying something about <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> scars, literal and otherwise". Jaa, on the other hand, met with Lundgren through his manager and film agent. He couldn't speak any English when cast, but claimed to have taken [...] "intensive" [...] lessons in preparation for his role; stating he is now [...] "reasonably fluent" [...] in [...] "conversational" [...] English.|$|E

She said that [...] "Violence against women was inescapable in this episode, but what made Mad Mens {{exploration}} of the topic worthwhile and compelling {{was the fact that}} two women in this episode asserted their power and control over their lives.

The series featured classic horror films like [...] Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, The Shining, The Silence of the Lambs, Candyman, The People Under the Stairs, and the first film of Wes Craven's Scream series. Peele also included films outside of the horror genre, such as psychological thrillers Funny Games and Misery, Hitchcock's mystery thriller Rear Window, and comedy-thriller The 'Burbs. The sneak preview of Get Out was preceded by the 1967 comedy-drama Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, the first Hollywood film to address interracial marriage and a big influence on the premise for Peele's own film. When asked about its inclusion in the series, Peele told the Village Voice, [...] "It’s not an actual thriller, it’s just a great exploration of the social phenomenon of <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> race, putting it in a package that everyone can understand.
