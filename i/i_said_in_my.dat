One of my knees, I think the left went into the water. This pissed me {{off a little bit}} and I opened my knife, it was in my left hand and I stabbed Lauren in {{the left side of the}} neck. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> interview that it was the right side of the neck with my right hand but I am been thinking since. It wasn't my right thumb which was cut but my left. After a couple of seconds after I stabbed her she stopped moving." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must presume, Mademoiselle," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> most business-like manner, [...] "that the {{document}} {{you speak of}} has been stolen." ...|$|E
60|$|JOHN. She said 'I {{have found}} her,' and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> blunt way, 'You mean Lady Sybil,' {{and she went}} away laughing.|$|E
60|$|I had an {{inspiration}} again. 'Take off that moustache!' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> calmly, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> most commanding voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alicia, dear," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{interrupting}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> turn, [...] "repeat my words. Say 'I {{take this}} man, Francis Softly, for my lawful wedded husband.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Ant. I did {{not think}} so; <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> rage: Pr'ythee, forgive me: Why didst thou tempt my anger, by {{discovery}} Of what I would not hear? ...|$|R
6000|$|I leaned {{around the}} corner of the tree and spoke. 'Excuse me,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> suavest voice, 'but I think I see a way out of your difficulty.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is my reason, Hans," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> most icy voice, and I {{pointed to}} a faint line of smoke rising against the {{twilight}} sky on the further side of the intervening valley.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be silent," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> sternest manner. Then, {{unable to}} bear more of Ayesha's mockery, for I felt that as usual she was mocking me, I added {{with all the}} dignity that I could command, ...|$|E
60|$|P.S.--By the way, <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{letter that}} <b>I</b> found ALL {{literary}} persons vulgar and dull. Permit me to contradict this {{with regard to}} yourself. I met you once at Blackwall, I think it was, and really did not remark anything offensive in your accent or appearance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Marika, your Cornish friend {{may have}} taught you to speak English," [...] <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> native tongue, {{turning to the}} woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "So it seems!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> blunt fashion. [...] "You may {{not feel}} so merry when my friend Jim Horscroft comes back to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would expect}} to find me alone, from what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> note," [...] {{observed}} Miss Moore, as she conducted Caroline towards the parlour; [...] "but it was written this morning: since dinner, company has come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{asked how}} {{it was that she}} had no {{companion}} to take care of her. [...] "You are too young and too pretty," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> blunt English way, [...] "to trust yourself alone in such a place as this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} the bracelet, Sir," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> most suave manner. [...] "You shall have it, but not unless {{you will pay}} me three {{thousand}} francs for it. I can get two thousand five hundred by taking it straight to Mlle. Mars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{lieutenant}} tells me, Mademoiselle," [...] <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> counterfeited voice, [...] "that it is {{your desire}} to bear Monsieur your father company upon this journey of his to Paris." ...|$|R
6000|$|This modern school, therefore, {{became the}} only true school of {{landscape}} which had yet existed; the artificial Claude and Gaspar work may be cast aside out of our way,--as <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> Edinburgh lectures, under the general title of [...] "pastoralism,"--and from the last landscape of Tintoret, if we look for life, we must pass at once to the first of Turner.|$|R
60|$|So I {{saw that}} she had tricked me, and taken her watch at night. For I slept like a trooper after a day's forage. As to what <b>I</b> might have <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> dreams--that thought made me red as an apple.|$|R
6000|$|... "And why not? But never mind. Do not {{suppose that}} I am rebuking you. As <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> letter, we are quits now, {{and there is}} no place for scolding on either side. We are quits now; but I am punished and you are rewarded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] I said. [...] "I waited till I {{had seen}} you, as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> telegram. I {{wrote him a}} letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That man did me a cruel injury {{four days}} ago, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart he should live to {{perceive}} and confess {{that the only}} noble revenge a man can take upon his enemy is to return good for evil. I resign in his favor. Appoint him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And your sister--she {{must feel}} it even more," [...] <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> {{thinking}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart that my new acquaintance made rather {{too much of}} his own troubles and too little of those of his companion.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have told}} me nothing of the rest," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> half choked, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> eagerness to hear of the girls, and yet unaccountably afraid to ask. I believe I dreaded to hear that Lucy was married. [...] "How, and where is Grace?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Charmion," [...] I replied, [...] "I grieve if I did pain thee; {{but over}} that vision comes no change. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> what was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart and there's an end. Thou art my cousin and my friend, I {{can never be}} more to thee." ...|$|R
60|$|For these beds (known as the Woolwich and Reading beds) dip {{under that}} vast bed of London clay, {{four hundred and}} more feet thick, which (as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> last chapter) was {{certainly}} laid down by the estuary of some great tropic river, among palm-trees and Anonas, crocodiles and turtles.|$|E
60|$|From the {{accumulated}} sadness into which I fell, I had at length {{no hope of}} ever issuing again. I roamed from place to place, carrying my burden with me everywhere. I felt its whole weight now; and I drooped beneath it, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart that it could never be lightened.|$|E
6000|$|... "Same as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cable. Every {{last one}} of them, semaphore, lamp code, Marconi--a copy, mind you, not the original. That was too dangerous. But it's the real goods, and you can lay to that." [...] He slapped the German upon the {{shoulder}} with a rough familiarity from which the other winced.|$|E
50|$|He {{authored}} numerous booklets, {{often with}} evocative titles, such as Thoughts and aphorisms (1951), Pétain and history: What <b>I</b> would have <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> inaugural {{speech at the}} Académie française if I had been elected (1957), History of the Latin Quarter (1960-1963), Where is France going? (1961) and Antimaxims (1973).|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is neither}} more nor less than blind chance," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> reply to <b>my</b> companion's words. [...] "Because {{we headed for}} the ship-yard they {{supposed}} we had a boat nearby, and because our people were gathering at Cambridge they would naturally say it was our purpose to go there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then I was afraid, as {{remembering that}} cruel thing <b>I</b> <b>said</b> once <b>in</b> <b>my</b> sinful anger. Oh, {{appointed}} of God to be a soldier, {{and the greatest}} in the land! and <b>in</b> <b>my</b> ignorant anger <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> would drown you with my own hands if you unsexed yourself and brought shame to your name and family. Ah, how could <b>I</b> ever have <b>said</b> it, and you so good and dear and innocent! I was afraid; for I was guilty. You understand it now, my child, and you forgive?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Master Van Voorden," [...] {{the knight}} said, {{as the latter}} turned his horse, and they {{proceeded}} on their way, [...] "I must repeat in person what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> letter, how deeply obliged we are to you for the superb suits of armour you sent last night to my son and his friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{company was}} very tense now, so vividly had {{he set the}} whole scene before them. [...] "I opened the door, and found her {{standing}} {{at the far side}} of the room, her hair in ropes and her eyes wild. She was 'bug-house' all right. 'Karen,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> most hypnotic voice, 'I lift the spell. You are free. Go back to work.'" ...|$|E
60|$|That is {{the romance}} {{that has been}} told about the big shops; in the {{literature}} and art which they have bought, and which (as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> recent articles) will soon be quite indistinguishable from their ordinary advertisements. The literature is commercial; {{and it is only}} {{fair to say that the}} commerce is often really literary. It is no romance, but only rubbish.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{shall never}} wonder, and, with your good leave, never know,' <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> smiling <b>in</b> <b>my</b> turn. 'It {{is enough for}} me that you give me this gratification. I have not the least desire that you should tell me by what means I have {{obtained}} it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{the meaning}} of this, ma'am? Don't get trying any little games upon me," [...] <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> roughest way--and I can put it on rough when I like. [...] "It'll be the worse {{for you if you}} play me any trick," [...] I added, showing her my knife.|$|R
60|$|I {{gave him}} the best idea I could, in a few words, of Mr. Micawber. He laughed heartily at my feeble {{portrait}} of that gentleman, {{and said he was}} a man to know, and he must know him. 'But who do you suppose our other friend is?' <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> turn.|$|R
