5|$|Springbok (Top Award) : This badge {{is the top}} Scout {{award in}} South Africa. It {{concentrates}} on teaching the Scout <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> back to the community. The Springbok award {{is the equivalent of}} the UK's Queen's Scout and the American Eagle Scout. Among the requirements, the Scout must complete at least 40hours of community service, lead a hike of over 30kilometres (18.6mi) in unfamiliar territory, and plan and construct a pioneering project.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{is named}} Northeastern Pennsylvania Salesman of the Year and {{must make a}} speech at an {{association}} meeting at the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel, getting some assistance from Michael Scott (Steve Carell). Before he leaves, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), in retaliation for Dwight's cocky attitude, gives him tips on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> public speeches. Unknown to Dwight, Jim's tips are taken from a speech by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943. When Michael and Dwight {{make it to the}} convention, Dwight gets cold feet and Michael goes up and tries to relive his glory days of winning Salesman of the Year two years in a row, but ends up bombing. Dwight finally works up the nerve to give his speech and, using Jim's advice, wins over the crowd with a passionate yet unorthodox speech, which Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) videotapes from the back. Michael ends up leaving the convention room and later entertains Dwight with his tales at the bar.|$|E

More importantly, they are taught that vomiting warrants an injection within hours of hydrocortisone (e.g., SoluCortef) or other glucocorticoid. This recommendation applies to both children and adults. Because young children are more susceptible to vomiting illnesses than adults, pediatric endocrinologists usually teach parents <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> hydrocortisone injections.|$|E

25|$|Bongo {{used part}} {{of the money to}} build up a fairly large circle of people who {{supported}} him such as government ministers, high administrators, and army officers. He had learned from Léon M'ba <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> government ministries to different tribal groups so that someone from every important group had a representative in the government. Bongo had no ideology beyond self-interest, but there was no opposition with an ideology either. He ruled by knowing how the self-interest of others could be manipulated. He was skilled at persuading opposition figures to become his allies. He offered critics modest slices of the nation's oil wealth, co-opting or buying off opponents rather than crushing them outright. He became the most successful of all Africa's Francophone leaders, comfortably extending his political dominance into the fifth decade".|$|E

[...] Another biographer, Geoffrey Wansell, notes that Elsie blamed herself bitterly for the death of Grant's older brother John, and never recovered from it. Grant later acknowledged that his negative experiences with his fiercely independent mother affected his relationships with women later in life. She frowned on alcohol and tobacco, and would reduce pocket money for minor mishaps. Grant later attributed her behaviour towards him as down to her being overprotective, fearing that she would lose him as she did John.|$|E
500|$|To ensure {{accuracy}} in scriptwriting, the serial employs {{a team of}} researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics. One medical advisor was given a cameo role in the series as an orthopaedic surgeon, and another, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in Holby City as a scrub nurse. Another adviser, a heart surgeon, has occasionally left open-heart surgery to advise Holby City writers over the telephone. The programme utilises surgeons from different disciplines, who check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is particularly important in case viewers copy procedures they have seen in the show, such as CPR. Series star Amanda Mealing commented: [...] "We pride ourselves on being realistic. You need to know what you are doing and why. It is a complex and foreign thing to act out an operation. For training, I watched a number of real ones." [...] Cast members are taught <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> realistic injections, monitor blood pressure and check a pulse, and some are given the opportunity to observe procedures in real hospitals. Original cast member George Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital in preparation for his role as Anton Meyer, while Edward MacLiam observed laparoscopic surgery being performed before joining the cast as Greg Douglas in series twelve.|$|E
500|$|When he {{returned}} home in 1857 at age 26, he found a burgeoning timber industry in Michigan, the [...] "Green Gold Rush". He took a job earning $13 a month at the Pine River lumber camp near St. Louis, Michigan and within a month was promoted to camp foreman with double wages. He was [...] "tall, strong and knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> orders". Using savings, he started his own lumber company in 1858, buying 300 acres in Gratiot County. In 1867, he founded the community of Melbourne on the Saginaw River near Zilwaukee, Michigan, named after his favorite city in Australia. By 1870, Melbourne was among {{the largest and most}} complete mills in the world, but in 1876, it was destroyed by a fire of unknown origin. Many at the time thought this {{would be the end of}} Burt's fortunes, but he also owned timber land elsewhere, including in St. Louis County, Minnesota, which turned out to be favourable for him, as it was in the heart of the immensely valuable Mesabi iron range. In addition to his various timber and iron mine holdings, Burt made his fortune in the salt industry, in railroads and in foreign bonds and banking investments. He invested in the former CS Railroad (running between Durand and Bay City) and for a time, owned most of the Ann Arbor Railroad system. He also bought railways in Russia and China. He had plans to build a sugar beet factory in Owosso, Michigan, but the idea failed to come to fruition.|$|E

500|$|In Buddhist texts {{further details}} {{are given in}} what way {{and to what extent}} a meritorious deed will bring results: this depends on the spiritual quality of the recipient, the spiritual {{attitude}} of the giver, the manner in which one gives and the object given. If the recipient is a human, the gift yields more fruits than if the recipient is an animal, but a gift to a [...] (a young monk), a monk, many monks, and the Buddha yield even more fruits, in ascending order. If the giver is motivated by greed or other defilements of the mind, the merit gained will be much less than if the giver is motivated by loving-kindness or other noble intentions. Even the intention of going to heaven, though in itself not considered wrong, is not seen as lofty as the intention to want to develop and purify the mind. If the recipient is spiritually [...] "not worthy of the gift", the gift will still be meritorious provided the giver's intention is good, and this is also valid the other way around. Good thoughts must also be maintained after the good deed is done, as regretting the gift will also decrease the merit. Whether the giver pronounces a certain wish or intention also affects the meritorious deed, as the power of the merits can be channeled toward a certain purpose. The manner in which people give is also important: whether someone gives respectfully or not, and whether by giving someone is harming anyone. With regard {{to the size of the}} gift, a larger gift is usually more meritorious than a smaller one, but purity of mind affects merit more than the gift's size. It is therefore recommended to give as much as you can afford, no more and no less. Such care in choosing who to give to and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>give,</b> is called being 'skilled in merit' (...)

40|$|Abstract. Initially, web {{development}} methods {{focused on}} the generation of read-only web applications for browsing the data stored in relational database systems. Lately, many have evolved to include content-modification functionalities. As a consequence, we believe that existing quality properties for web model designs must be complemented with new property definitions. In particular, we propose two new quality properties that take the relationship between navigation models and the related data models into account. The properties check if navigation models include all necessary content-modification operations and whether all possible navigation paths modify the underlying data in a consistent way. In this paper, we show <b>how</b> <b>to</b> determine if a navigation model verifies both properties and also <b>how</b> <b>to,</b> <b>given</b> a data model, automatically generate a preliminary navigation model satisfying them. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Gemara related a {{story about}} <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> to the poor.

They did so because, as Mar Zutra bar Tobiah said in the name of Rav (or others say Rav Huna bar Bizna said in the name of Rabbi Simeon the Pious, and still others say Rabbi Johanan said in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai), it is better for a person to go into a fiery furnace than to shame a neighbor publicly.

[...] Filmfare {{described}} her acting style, writing, [...] "...when it comes to style, sexiness or sheer onscreen presence, she's unparalleled... a fierce, raw, flinty performer with unbridled honesty. Her acting isn't gimmicky." [...] Critic Khalid Mohamed commends her technical control: [...] "She knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> and to what degree.

Dhawan from The Tribune wrote, [...] "Rekha's flowering as an actress post Ghar and Khubsoorat climaxed in [...] Umrao Jaan. As a tragic courtesan she gave a performance of consummate artistry, adopting a much-admired huskiness and despondency of tone. Rekha communicated much with a delicately raised eyebrow. In 2010, Filmfare included two of her performances—from Khubsoorat (1980) and Umrao Jaan (1981)—in their list of [...] "80 Iconic Performances".

It does not reduce its objectives to an anthropocentric perspective: to a material well-being or only to initiatives of a political or social, economic or cultural order. Much less can it be a liberation that supports or is supported by violence." [...] Romero expressed several times his disapproval for divisiveness in the Church. In a sermon preached on 11 November 1979 he said: [...] "The other day, one of the persons who proclaims liberation in a political sense was asked: ‘For you, {{what is the meaning}} of the Church’?" [...] He said that the activist [...] "answered with these scandalous words: ‘There are two churches, the church of the rich and the church of the poor. We believe in the church of the poor but not in the church of the rich.’" [...] Romero declared, [...] "Clearly these words are a form of demagogy and I will never admit a division of the Church." [...] He added, [...] "There is only one Church, the Church that Christ preached, the Church to which we should give our whole hearts. ...There is only one Church, a Church that adores the living God and knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> relative value to the goods of this earth." ...|$|E
