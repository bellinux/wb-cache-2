This is a property of the chemistry and mode of action of the pesticide and the physiological and biochemical attributes of organisms. However, there is also the potential to make pesticides more selective through their judicious use, based on critical selection, timing, dosage, placement and formulation of pesticides (which are often broad spectrum). This paper discusses approaches to increase the ecological selectivity of pesticides and pesticide application methods, in the context of Integrated Pest Management in Brassica crops. Topics covered include minimisation of the dose applied, controlled release and <b>dropleg</b> technologies and the impacts of seed treatments on non-target species...|$|E

Copper (Cu-hydroxide, Cu-oxychloride or Cu-octanoate) was sprayed in a weekly routine or according to the decision support system SIMPHYT with total dosages ranging from 0. 57 kg/ha to 4. 0 kg/ha. The results revealed in almost all treatments a significant reduction of late blight, except for the lowest rates (e. g. 4 x 0. 14 kg/ha Cu as Cu-octanoate or 6 x 0. 15 kg/ha Cu as Cu-hydroxide). There was a clear dose-response relation between increasing rates of copper and control of late blight in each experiment. Marketable yields varied from 132 dt/ha to 238 dt/ha in organic field trials depending on trial site and copper treatment. Generally, an effect of copper treatment and late blight on yield could be shown. Even a slight reduction of P. infestans increased yield by 10 % to 20 %. The influence of copper dosage on late blight was more obvious than influence of copper spraying on yield. A <b>dropleg</b> spraying system (copper application within the crop canopy) which was tested on one trial site did not improve blight control compared to conventional application...|$|E
