50|$|The Top Spin is {{a thrill}} ride {{developed}} by HUSS Park Attractions, {{and is the}} generic name {{for a series of}} rides from other manufacturers that follow the same principle. The ride consists of a passenger platform suspended between two counterweighted arms. The arms are turned by motors, while the platform generally only has brakes that are engaged and disengaged at various points of the ride cycle. A typical top spin program runs the main arm motors while <b>engaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaging</b> the platform brakes so that it will rotate in exciting ways. The minimum rider height requirement is 54 inches; maximum is 80 inches due to the seat and restraint design. The ride was debuted in 1990 with it proving an instant success with European fairgoers.|$|E

50|$|Changing gear {{with the}} Wilson box {{relied on the}} control of the brake bands that held each epicyclic's annulus in fixed position. The brake band to be {{selected}} was controlled by a rotating cam, moved by the gear shift lever. Only one band was engaged for each gear selection. This small lever could not provide enough power to engage and lock the brake band, thus the need for the pedal The actual movement of the brake bands was controlled by the 'toggle' mechanism, a distinctive feature of the Wilson design. When the pedal was pressed and released, a series or 'busbar' of finger-like levers were pressed upwards by a strong coil spring, against a series of light linkages or 'operating struts'. The position of each linkage was controlled by the gear selection camshaft. If the cam (for each gear) held the linkage in place, rather than allowing it to swing out of the way, the busbar finger would then press, via the operating strut, onto the toggles controlling the brake bands themselves. These toggles provided the additional leverage necessary to hold the brake band in place, under the force of the coil spring, until the pedal was next pressed. A further characteristic of the Wilson design was the use of self-adjusting nuts on each band, to compensate for wear. The action of <b>engaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaging</b> each band was sufficient to advance the ratchet nuts and so adjust for wear by taking up any slack.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Distributed sensor {{networks}} offer {{many new}} capabilities for contextually monitoring environments. By making such systems mobile, we increase the application-space for the distributed network mainly by providing dynamic contextdependent deployment, continual relocatability, automatic node recovery, {{and a larger}} area of coverage. In existing models, the addition of actuation to the nodes has exacerbated three of the main problems with distributed systems: power usage, node size, and node complexity. In this {{paper we propose a}} solution to these problems in the form of parasitically actuated nodes that harvest their mobility and local navigational intelligence by selectively <b>engaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaging</b> from mobile hosts in their environment. We analyze the performance of parasitically mobile distributed networks through software simulations and design, implement, and demonstrate hardware prototypes...|$|E

50|$|Lockup torque {{converters}} that <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> at certain speeds can make these speeds unstable — the transmission wastes less power above {{the speed at}} which the torque converter locks up, usually causing more power to the wheels for the same throttle input.|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms for <b>engaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaging</b> {{electrical}} and fluid line connectors {{are required to}} be operated repeatedly in hazardous or remote locations on space station, nuclear reactors, toxic chemical and undersea environments. Such mechanisms may require shields to protect the mating faces of the connectors when connectors are not engaged and move these shields {{out of the way}} during connector engagement. It is desirable to provide a force-transmitting structure to react the force required to engage or disengage the connectors. It is also desirable that the mechanism for moving the connectors and shields is reliable, simple, and the structure as lightweight as possible. With these basic requirements, an Umbilical Mechanism Assembly (UMA) was originally designed for the Space Station Freedom and now being utilized for the International Space Station...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the possibility of}} adopting a conical shaped motor for Green Taxiing (GT) application. This topology of motor has been selected in order to obviate the presence of external declutching system (i. e. mechanical or electromagnetic clutch) interposed between the electric actuator and the wheel. An axial force contributes to move the rotor inside-out of the stator (principle of sliding-rotor). The axial movement of the rotor can be monitored acting on the magnetizing current. The axial sensor-less position estimation method described hereafter envisages the possibility of evaluating the axial position of the rotor during the <b>engaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaging</b> movement from the wheel. The axial position calculation {{is dependent on the}} inductance of the motor. An “on¬line” computation of the position has been implemented through the use of high-frequency injection signals...|$|E
40|$|Neural {{ensembles}} oscillate {{across a}} broad range of frequencies and are transiently coupled or “bound” together when people attend to a stimulus, perceive, think, and act. This is a dynamic, self-assembling process, with parts of the brain <b>engaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaging</b> in time. But how is it done? The theory of Coordination Dynamics proposes a mechanism called metastability, a subtle blend of integration and segregation. Tendencies for brain regions to express their individual autonomy and specialized functions (segregation, modularity) coexist with tendencies to couple and coordinate globally for multiple functions (integration). Although metastability has garnered increasing attention, it has yet to be demonstrated and treated within a fully spatiotemporal perspective. Here, we illustrate metastability in continuous neural and behavioral recordings, and we discuss theory and experiments at multiple scales, suggesting that metastable dynamics underlie the real-time coordination necessary for the brain’s dynamic cognitive, behavioral, and social functions...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{hypothesized}} that whereas Japanese culture encourages socially engaging emotions (e. g., friendly feelings and guilt), North American culture fosters socially disengaging emotions (e. g., pride and anger). In two cross-cultural studies, {{the authors measured}} <b>engaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaging</b> emotions repeatedly over different social situations and found support for this hypothesis. As predicted, Japanese showed a pervasive tendency to reportedly experience engaging emotions more strongly than they experienced disengaging emotions, but Americans showed a reversed tendency. Moreover, as also predicted, Japanese subjective well-being (i. e., the experience of general positive feelings) was more {{closely associated with the}} experience of engaging positive emotions than with that of disengaging emotions. Americans tended to show the reversed pattern. The established cultural differences in the patterns of emotion suggest the consistent and systematic cultural shaping of emotion over time.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} focus placed on how individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) visually perceive and attend to social information, such as facial expressions or social gaze. The role of eye movements is inextricable from visual perception, however this aspect is often overlooked. We performed {{a series of}} meta-analyses {{based on data from}} 28 studies of eye movements in ASD to determine whether there is evidence for ocular motor dysfunction in ASD. Tasks assessed included visually-guided saccade tasks, gap/overlap, anti-saccade, pursuit tasks and ocular fixation. These analyses revealed evidence for ocular motor dysfunction in ASD, specifically relating to saccade dysmetria, difficulty inhibiting saccades and impaired tracking of moving targets. However there was no evidence for deficits relating to initiating eye movements, or <b>engaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaging</b> from simple visual targets. Characterizing ocular motor abnormalities in ASD may provide insight into the functional integrity of brain networks in ASD across development, and assist our understanding of visual and social attention in ASD...|$|E

A modeling and sensitivity analysis approach is presented that identifies effective strategies for human-automation interaction as a function of three task-context parameters and three aid design parameters.

40|$|During open-heart surgery roller {{pumps are}} often used to keep the {{circulation}} of blood through the patient body. They present numerous key features, but they suffer from several limitations: (a) they normally deliver uncontrolled pulsatile inlet and outlet pressure; (b) blood damage {{appears to be more}} than that encountered with centrifugal pumps. A lumped parameter mathematical model of a roller pump (Sarns 7000, Terumo CVS, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was developed to dynamically simulate pressures at the pump inlet and outlet in order to clarify the uncontrolled pulsation mechanism. Inlet and outlet pressures obtained by the mathematical model have been compared with those measured in various operating conditions: different rollers' rotating speed, different tube occlusion rates, and different clamping degree at the pump inlet and outlet. Model results agree with measured pressure waveforms, whose oscillations are generated by the tube compression/release mechanism during the rollers' <b>engaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaging</b> phases.
