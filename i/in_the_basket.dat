5|$|Burnham {{was born}} on May 11, 1861 on a Dakota Sioux Indian {{reservation}} in Minnesota, to a missionary family living near the small pioneer town of Tivoli (now gone), about 20 miles (32km) from Mankato. His father, the Reverend Edwin Otway Burnham, was a Presbyterian minister educated and ordained in New York; {{he was born in}} Ghent, Kentucky. His mother Rebecca Russell Burnham had spent most of her childhood in Iowa, having emigrated with her family from Westminster, England at the age of three. In the Dakota War of 1862, Chief Little Crow and his Sioux warriors attacked the nearby town New Ulm, Minnesota; Burnham's father was in Mankato buying ammunition at the time, so when Burnham's mother saw Sioux approaching her cabin dressed in war paint, she knew she had to leave and could never escape carrying her baby. She hid Frederick in a basket of green corn husks in a corn field and fled for her life. Once the Sioux attack had been repulsed, she returned to find their house burned down, but the baby Frederick was safe, fast asleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> with the corn husks.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{demonstrate}} the value of <b>the</b> <b>in</b> <b>basket</b> test as practical psychology. Practical psychology is defined as applied psychology {{that is used by}} practitioners. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of personnel selection the practitioners are those who select people for work; this includes a large number and a wide variety of people. For <b>the</b> <b>in</b> <b>basket</b> test to be regarded as practical psychology it was hypothesised that a single variable method of overall assessment of performance on <b>the</b> <b>in</b> <b>basket</b> test should be as good as a multivariate method; <b>the</b> <b>in</b> <b>basket</b> test should be reliable; the single variable approach should be a valid method of assessing performance on the test; and the validity of <b>the</b> <b>in</b> <b>basket</b> test should be demonstrated in an industrial setting. Four studies were conducted to test these hypotheses; a reliability study, a factor analytic study, an assessment of the validity of <b>the</b> <b>in</b> <b>basket</b> test using discriminant analysis, and a study of <b>the</b> test <b>in</b> a meat freezing works. It was concluded that the single variable method of overall assessment of performance on <b>the</b> <b>in</b> <b>basket</b> test was as good as the multivariate method. It was argued that there were inherent difficulties <b>in</b> establishing <b>the</b> reliability of <b>the</b> <b>in</b> <b>basket</b> test, but inter scorer reliability was demonstrated.

25|$|According to Frank Hamilton Cushing, Native American cooking baskets {{used by the}} Zuni (Zuñi) {{developed}} from mesh casings woven to stabilize gourd water vessels. He reported witnessing cooking basket use by Havasupai in 1881. Roasting baskets covered with clay would be filled with wood coals and the product to be roasted. When the thus fired clay separated from the basket, it would become a usable clay roasting pan in itself. This indicates a steady progression from use of woven gourd casings to waterproof cooking baskets to pottery. Other than in many other cultures, Native Americans used and still use the heat source inside the cookware. Cooking baskets are filled with hot stones and roasting pans with wood coals. Native Americans would form a basket from large leaves to boil water, according to historian and novelist Louis L'Amour. As long as the flames did not reach above the level of water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> the leaves would not burn through.|$|E

Then when unobserved, while the learned professor is [...] "taking down his notes" [...] for the public press, he reverses the accordion, and attaching the false keyboard on the bottom by means of a small hook attached to it, fastens it to the side of the basket; having now the real keyboard in his hand he is able to produce musical sounds. Afterward the accordion floated about <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> under the table, without the contact of Mr. Home's hand. This subsequent phenomenon was given to avoid immediate examination of the first by keeping Professor Crookes in suspense, and giving the medium time to reverse the instrument and conceal in his clothing the false key-board which had been on the bottom of the instrument. The accordion was suspended by means of a small hook fastened to dark thread, which would be invisible in the gas-light.|$|E

500|$|The Eagle {{had been}} stocked with safety {{equipment}} such as guns, snowshoes, sleds, skis, a tent, a small boat (in {{the form of a}} bundle of bent sticks, to be assembled and covered with balloon silk), most of it stored not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> but in the storage space arranged above the balloon ring. These items had not been put together with great care, or with any acknowledgement of adopting indigenous peoples' techniques for dealing with the extreme environment. In this, Andrée contrasted not only with later but also with many earlier explorers. Sven Lundström points to the agonizing extra efforts that became necessary for the team due to Andrée's mistaken design of the sleds, with a rigid construction that borrowed nothing from the long proven Inuit sleds, and were so impractical for the difficult terrain. Andrée called it [...] "dreadful terrain", with channels separating the ice floes, high ridges, and partially iced-over melt ponds. The men's clothes included no furs but were woollen coats and trousers, plus oilskins. They wore the oilskins but the explorers reported always seeming to be damp or wet from the half-frozen pools of water on the ice and the typically foggy, humid Arctic summer air, and preoccupied with drying their clothes, mainly by wearing them. Danger was everywhere, as it would have meant certain death to lose the provisions lashed to one of the inconvenient sleds into one of the many channels that had to be laboriously crossed.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the great}} {{diversity}} within this genus, as of 2017, comprehensive life-history studies of Amphidromus species are still lacking; {{only a few}} observations of behavior of species within the genus exist, and these observations are scattered throughout the literature. A study by Eugen Paravicini (1921) described egg-laying behaviour in Amphidromus palaceus var. pura at Palimanan, West Java. According to Paravicini's observations, in October, 1920, locals from West Java brought in two [...] "nests" [...] containing snails that had just begun depositing their eggs; one snail had folded the exterior leaves of a young bamboo shoot and gummed them together into a pointed cornet. The shoot hung vertically with the narrow end pointed upward, and the wide opening below. The {{upper part of the}} sack was filled with eggs when collected. The snail descended slowly, rotating around its longitudinal axis, and deposited eggs until the entire cavity was filled up. If a crack <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> exposed eggs to the air, they quickly dried up. Two days after capture, egg-laying was finished, and the snail closed the opening by folding over more leaves. Probably four days were spent in egg-laying, since the cavity was half filled at the start of observations. A second nest of similarly folded mango leaves contained 234 eggs. The volume of eggs in each case greatly exceeded the size of the snail, indicating that the eggs must be encapsulated just before deposition. The capsules were very thin, and dried quickly upon any exposure to the air. October marked the start of the rainy season and probably this is the normal breeding period. Eggs of A. porcellanus were reported by van Benthem Jutting (1950, p.493) to have started hatching only ten days after being laid. Similar nest-building habits have been reported for other species, but no complete study of a life cycle has been published. Up until 1961, no information was available on the cycle of activity, longevity, rate of growth, etc.|$|E

2500|$|The {{other major}} {{difference}} with {{this system is}} that when contacted, the hose does not “retract” into an HDU.

[...] If not pushed far enough, the probe will disengage, halting fueling. [...] Because of a much smaller position keeping tolerance, staying properly connected to a KC-135 adapter unit is considerably more difficult than staying in a traditional hose/drogue configuration. [...] When fueling is complete, the receiver carefully backs off until the probe refueling valve disconnects from the valve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> [...] Off center disengagements, like engagements, can cause the drogue to “prang” the probe and/or strike the aircraft’s fuselage.|$|E
