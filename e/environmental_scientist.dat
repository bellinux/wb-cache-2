500|$|In January 2013, a joint British-Australian team {{set out to}} {{duplicate}} Shackleton's 1916 trip across the Southern Ocean. Led by explorer and <b>environmental</b> <b>scientist</b> Tim Jarvis, the team was assembled {{at the request of}} Alexandra Shackleton, Sir Ernest's granddaughter, who felt the trip would honour her grandfather's legacy. In October 2015, Shackleton's decorations and medals were auctioned; the sale raised £585,000. This team became the first to replicate the so-called [...] "double crossing"; sailing from Elephant Island to South Georgia, and the crossing of the South Georgian mountains from King Haakon Bay (where Shackleton had landed nearly 100 years prior) to Stromness. The expedition very carefully matched legacy conditions, using a replica of the James Caird (named for the project's patron: the Alexandra Shackleton), period clothing (by Burberry), replica rations (both in calorific content and rough constitution), period navigational aids, and a Thomas Mercer chronometer just as Shackleton had used. This expedition was made into a documentary film, screening as Chasing Shackleton on PBS in the United States, and [...] elsewhere on the Discovery Channel.|$|E

In the 1870s, foreign students began traveling to the United States to attend the Michigan State Agricultural College such that, by the 1880s, they were a significant presence on campus. In 1887, two percent (six out of 312) of the College's student population were Japanese. [...] Among the 1880s students were Michitaro Tsuda, (B.S.1884), {{who went on to}} become a member of the Japanese emperor's Privy Council, and Minakata Kumagusu, (1888), a prominent Japanese <b>environmental</b> <b>scientist.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In May 2008, a {{week before}} their annual shareholder's meeting, ExxonMobil pledged in its annual {{corporate}} citizenship report that it would cut funding to [...] "several public policy research groups whose position on climate change could divert attention" [...] from the need to address climate change. In 2008, ExxonMobil funded such organizations and was {{named one of the}} most prominent promoters of climate change denial. According to Brulle in a 2012 Frontline interview, ExxonMobil had ceased funding the climate change counter-movement by 2009. According to the environmental advocacy group Greenpeace, ExxonMobil granted $1 million to climate denial groups in 2014. ExxonMobil granted $10,000 to the Science & Environmental Policy Project founded by climate denial advocate, physicist, and <b>environmental</b> <b>scientist</b> Fred Singer and earlier funded the work of solar physicist Wei-Hock [...] "Willie" [...] Soon, who said that most global warming is caused by solar variation.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas A. Baillieul, a {{geologist}} and retired senior <b>environmental</b> <b>scientist</b> with the United States Department of Energy, disputed Gentry's claims {{in an article}} entitled, [...] "'Polonium Haloes' Refuted: A Review of 'Radioactive Halos in a Radio-Chronological and Cosmological Perspective' by Robert V. Gentry." [...] Baillieul noted that Gentry was a physicist with no background in geology and given the absence of this background, Gentry had misrepresented the geological context from which the specimens were collected. Additionally, he noted that Gentry relied on research {{from the beginning of}} the 20th century, long before radioisotopes were thoroughly understood; that his assumption that a polonium isotope caused the rings was speculative; and that Gentry falsely argued that the half-life of radioactive elements varies with time. Gentry claimed that Baillieul could not publish his criticisms in a reputable scientific journal, although some of Baillieul's criticisms rested on work previously published in reputable scientific journals.|$|E

2500|$|In 1959, Reiss and {{her husband}} joined <b>environmental</b> <b>scientist</b> Barry Commoner and others to create the Greater St. Louis Citizens' Committee for Nuclear Information, which {{initiated}} the Baby Tooth Survey in conjunction with Saint Louis University and the Washington University School of Dental Medicine {{as a means of}} determining the effects of nuclear fallout on the human anatomy. Louise Reiss led the project from 1959 to 1961. The research focused on detecting the presence of strontium-90, a cancer-causing radioactive isotope created by the more than 400 atomic tests conducted above ground before 1963. Due to its chemical similarity to calcium, the radioactive strontium isotope is absorbed from water and dairy products into the bones and teeth of children, as their growing bodies need calcium. Visiting local schools and organizations, Louise Reiss convinced parents to have their children send in their lost baby teeth, in return for which they were sent a button reading [...] "I gave my tooth to science". The team sent collection forms to area schools, and teeth were initially sent to the Reiss home, where they were sorted. In all, some 320,000 teeth from children of various ages were collected before the project was ended in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s, VFP opposed US-sponsored wars in Central America. On Easter Sunday, Apr 19, 1987, VFP members {{marched on}} President Reagan's Western White House in California, and Vice President Bush's {{vacation}} home in Kennebunkport, Maine, protesting U.S. intervention in Central America. From May 4–18, 1987, sixteen members of VFP representing eight states traveled through Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua conducting site visits {{and interviews with}} high level government, military, religious and private sector elders, and talking with many average citizens. Following their return, they published a 40-page delegation report that was distributed to 5,000 opinion leaders in the United States including members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, the heads of many government offices and agencies, church, labor, and educational leaders, and media pace setters. In 1988, many VFP members participated in the Veterans Peace Convoy which was intended to truck medical and humanitarian aid to the suffering children of Nicaragua. Though the convoy was stopped by U.S. Customs and Treasury officials in Texas at the Laredo border checkpoint, on June 15, 1988, the vehicles were off-loaded into containers at a Texas port facility and about 95% of the cargo reached its destination in Nicaragua. In July 1988, VFP member Joe Ryan, an <b>environmental</b> <b>scientist,</b> of Tallahassee, Florida, established VFP's Nicaragua Environmental Science Project. Ryan spent two years working in Nicaragua training pollution control teams how to correct water contamination problems. The project was credited with significantly reducing the nation's infant mortality rate. Also in July 1988, VFP member Randy Parent of Caribou, Maine, drove a truckload of smelting and casting equipment to Guatemala where he established the Pro-Tierra Machine Tool Project to train members of several indigenous tribes how to make farm tools for the 100,000 members of the Pro-Tierra land reform movement.
