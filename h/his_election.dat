5|$|Leo's {{election}} {{was seen as}} a victory for France, with supporters of the French celebrating in Rome's streets upon <b>his</b> <b>election.</b> Leo's election pleased the French, because he was a relative of Marie de' Medici who was happy with <b>his</b> <b>election.</b> Leo's reign, however, was limited to the month of April 1605. He caught a cold while appearing in public, and died on 27 April 1605, twenty-six days after <b>his</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E

Albani was not a bishop, and had to receive episcopal consecration after <b>his</b> <b>election</b> before he could be crowned pope. Albani had been elected on the feast day of Pope Clement I, and took the name of Clement XI to honour the saint. At fifty-one, Albani was younger than any other pope who had been elected in almost two centuries. Albani was the candidate of the zelanti in this conclave, and <b>his</b> <b>election</b> represented a success for them.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{tensions}} arose {{between the}} ARF and Armenian SSR. The death of Catholicos Garegin of the Holy See of Cilicia prompted {{a struggle for}} succession. The National Ecclesiastic Assembly, which was largely influenced by the ARF, elected Zareh of Aleppo. This decision {{was rejected by the}} Echmiadzin-based Catholicos of All Armenians, the anti-ARF coalition, and Soviet Armenian authorities. Zareh extended his administrative authority over {{a large part of the}} Armenian diaspora, furthering the rift that had already been created by <b>his</b> <b>election.</b> This event split the large Armenian community of Lebanon, creating sporadic clashes between the supporters of Zareh and those who opposed <b>his</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} year of {{eligibility}} in , Koufax {{was elected to the}} Baseball Hall of Fame, just weeks after his 36th birthday. <b>His</b> <b>election</b> made him the Hall's youngest member ever elected, five months younger than Lou Gehrig upon <b>his</b> <b>election</b> in 1939, though because the 1972 induction ceremony was nearly eight months after the election, Koufax's age at induction was slightly higher than Gehrig's, making Gehrig the youngest player ever inducted. On June 4 of that same year, Koufax's uniform number 32 was retired alongside those of Dodger greats Roy Campanella (39) and Jackie Robinson (42).|$|E
5|$|On 28 May the {{conclave}} unanimously elected Orsini as Pope. He had {{not been}} seen as a serious candidate in past conclaves because he did not have political experience. Orsini was 75 at the time, and it took the cardinals two days to convince him to accept <b>his</b> <b>election.</b> He was recorded to have spent the night before <b>his</b> <b>election</b> sleepless and in tears. Even when the cardinals had taken him into the Sistine Chapel for the formal vote to elect him pope after they had been convinced he would accept, he was still unwilling to accept his own election. Ultimately, he only accepted it after being convinced of it by Agustín Pipia the Master of the Dominican Order, of which he was a member. Upon accepting <b>his</b> <b>election,</b> he attempted to take the name Benedict XIV, which would have recognized Antipope Benedict XIII, the last Avignon Pope during the Western Schism. Lawyers from the Roman Curia eventually persuaded Orisini to take the name Benedict XIII.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{is widely}} {{known for being}} the first priest in an openly gay {{relationship}} to be consecrated a bishop in a major Christian denomination believing in the historic episcopate. His sexual orientation was privately acknowledged in the 1970s, when he studied in seminary, was ordained, married, and started a family. He went public with his sexual identity and divorced in 1986. He entered a formal relationship with his second partner, Mark Andrew, in 1988. When delegates to the Episcopal convention were voting on the ratification of <b>his</b> <b>election,</b> it became an issue of controversy. <b>His</b> <b>election</b> was ratified 62 to 45. After <b>his</b> <b>election,</b> many theologically conservative Episcopalians in the United States abandoned the Episcopal Church, formed the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) and aligned themselves with bishops outside the Episcopal Church in the United States, a process called the Anglican realignment. His story has appeared in print and film.|$|E

5|$|The Montalto faction {{transferred}} {{their support}} to Medici on 1 April, securing <b>his</b> <b>election.</b> Joyeuse had been seeking Medici's election throughout the conclave, and {{had managed to}} secure the support of Montalto for his candidate. Montalto was allied with the Spanish and had previously backed Tolomeo Gallio. After Medici's election, Avila revealed that Philip III had excluded Medici as well, and protested so loudly {{that he could be}} heard on the street. The cardinals who had elected Medici answered that protesting the election of a candidate was useless once the person was elected pope. Upon <b>his</b> <b>election,</b> Medici took the name Leo XI in honour of his great-uncle Leo X. <b>His</b> <b>election</b> made Leo the fourth cardinal to be elected pope that had been created by Sixtus V in his consistory in 1583.|$|E
