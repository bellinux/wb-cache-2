40|$|The use of fibre-reinforced {{polymer matrix}} {{composite}} materials {{is growing at}} a faster rate than GDP in many countries. An improved understanding of their processing and mechanical behaviour would extend the potential applications of these materials. For unidirectional composites, it is predicted that localised absence of fibres is related to longitudinal compression failure. The use of woven reinforcements permits more effective manufacture than for unidirectional fibres. It has been demonstrated experimentally that compression strengths of woven composites are reduced when fibres are clustered. Summerscales predicted that clustering of fibres would increase the permeability of the reinforcement and hence expedite the processing of these materials. Commercial fabrics are available which employ this concept using flow-enhancing <b>bound</b> <b>tows.</b> The net effect of clustering fibres is to enhance processability whilst reducing the mechanical properties. The effects reported above were qualitative correlations. Gross differences in the appearance of laminate sections are apparent for different weave styles. For the quantification of subtle changes in fabric architecture, the use of automated image analysis is essential. Griffm used Voronoi tessellation to measure the microstructures of composites made using flow-enhancing tows. The data was presented as histograms with no single parameter to quantify microstructure. This thesis describes the use of automated image analysis for the measurement of the microstructures of woven fibre-reinforced composites, and pioneers the use of fractal dimensions as a single parameter for their quantification. It further considers the process-property- structure relationships for commercial and experimental fabric reinforcements in an attempt to resolve the processing versus properties dilemma. A new flow-enhancement concept has been developed which has a reduced impact on laminate mechanical properties. University of Bristol and Carr Reinforcements Limite...|$|R

Second, a free capital flow regime falls short of supporting efficient demand and expenditure reallocations and induces too little downstream (upstream) flows during (after) the liquidity trap. And third, when it comes to capital flow management, individual countries' incentives to manage their terms of trade conflict with aggregate demand stabilization and global efficiency.

50|$|As {{with all}} small G {{proteins}} RhoG {{is able to}} signal to <b>downstream</b> effectors when <b>bound</b> to GTP (Guanosine triphosphate) and unable to signal when bound to GDP (Guanosine diphosphate).Three classes of protein interact with RhoG to regulate GTP/GDP loading. The first are known as Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and these facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP so as to promote subsequent RhoG-mediated signalling. The second class are known as GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and these promote hydrolysis of GTP to GDP (via the intrinsic GTPase activity of the G protein) thus terminating RhoG-mediated signalling. A third group, known as Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), inhibit dissociation of GDP and thus lock the G protein in its inactive state.GDIs can also sequester G proteins in the cytosol which also prevents their activation. The dynamic regulation of G protein signalling is necessarily complex and the 130 or more GEFs, GAPs and GDIs described thus far for the Rho family {{are considered to be}} the primary determinants of their spatiotemporal activity.|$|R

Under these conditions this domain can activate at different distances upstream of the transcriptional start site but does not do so when <b>bound</b> <b>downstream</b> of the start site. In contrast, the POU activation domain cannot activate transcription when delivered to DNA via a heterologous DNA binding domain, but can function when linked to such a domain if bound to DNA via its own appropriate binding site.

The current model of R 2 retrotransposition involves an ordered series of cleavage and polymerization steps {{carried out by}} at least two R 2 protein subunits, one bound upstream 15 and one <b>bound</b> <b>downstream</b> of the integration site. The role in the retrotransposition reaction of two conserved DNA-binding motifs, a C 2 H 2 zinc finger (ZF) and a Myb motif, located within the N-terminal domain of the protein are explored in this report. 20 These motifs {{do not appear to}} play a role in RT or the ability of the protein to bind the R 2 RNA transcript. Methylation and missing nucleoside interference-based DNA footprints using polypeptides to the N-terminal domain suggest the ZF and Myb motifs 25 bind toregions 3 to 1 and 110 to 115 with reference to the insertion site. Mutations in these DNA sites or of the N-terminal protein domain blocked binding and the activity of the downstream subunit.

In contrast to the complex modular character of Ig enhancers, the promoters appear to be simple, depending primarily on a conserved TATA box and octamer elements. We have analyzed the role of proximal sequences for Igkappa promoter function. Igkappa promoter transcription critically depends on initiator-like sequences and on a downstream element located at + 24 to + 39 relative to the start site. Replacement of these sequences resulted in strong reduction of promoter activity. In vitro, these elements {{were found to be}} more effective in extracts of lymphoid than of non-lymphoid origin. Deletion of the downstream and initiation site regions had a comparable effect on promoter activity to obliteration of the TATA box or octamer element.

To define specific regions of PLC-? 3 {{that are involved}} in binding and activation by G??, a series of fragments of PLC-? 3 as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were produced. A fragment encompassing the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and <b>downstream</b> sequence (GST-N) <b>bound</b> to G protein ? 1 ? 2 in an in vitro binding assay, and binding was inhibited by G protein ? subunit, G?i 1. This PLC-? 3 fragment also inhibited G??-stimulated PLC-? activity in a reconstitution system, while having no significant effect on G?q-stimulated PLC-? 3 activity. The N-terminal G?? binding region was delineated further to the first 180 amino acids, and the sequence Asn 150 ?Ser 180, just distal to the PH domain, was found to be required for the interaction. Mutation of basic residues 154 Arg, 155 Lys, 159 Lys, and 161 Lys to Glu within this region reduced G?? binding affinity and specifically reduced the EC 50 for G??-dependent activation of the mutant enzyme 3 -fold.

EI is a multidomain, 128 -kDa homodimer that has been shown to exist in two conformational states related to one another by two large (50 ‚Äì 90 ¬∞) rigid body domain reorientations. The open conformation of apo EI allows phosphoryl transfer from His 189 located in the N-terminal domain Œ±/Œ≤ (EINŒ±/Œ≤) subdomain to the <b>downstream</b> protein partner <b>bound</b> to the EINŒ± subdomain.

Here, we investigate the solution conformation of a complex of an active site mutant of EI (H 189 A) with PEP. Simulated annealing refinement driven simultaneously by solution small angle X-ray scattering and NMR residual dipolar coupling data demonstrates unambiguously that the EI(H 189 A) ‚ÄìPEP complex exists in a dynamic equilibrium between two approximately equally populated conformational states, one corresponding to the closed structure and the other to a partially closed species.

Quantitative estimates of wind speed made with the CMOD 4 algorithm are unreliable in the downstream region because wind direction is variable and unknown and because spatial gradients in air-sea temperature difference affect atmospheric boundary layer stability. A large anticyclone south of Tenerife strongly influenced the estimated wind speed probably because higher ocean temperatures in its centre caused atmospheric instability and increased radar backscatter.

Monthly HVPTD values at 0. 25 ¬∞ (latitude by longitude) resolution were resampled spatially and temporally to produce an enhanced HVPTD time series at 0. 5 ¬∞ resolution for the period May 1979 through February 1985. Enhanced HVPTD values were regressed against monthly discharge derived from the WBM/WTM for each of 40 grid cells along the main stem over a calibration period from May 1979 to February 1983 to provide a spatially contiguous estimate of time-varying discharge.

Only a few STAT 5 target genes, {{among them the}} CIS (cytokine-inducible SH 2 -containing protein) gene, have been identified. We cloned the human CIS gene and studied the human CIS gene promoter. This promoter contains four STAT binding elements organized in two pairs. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies using nuclear extracts of UT 7 cells stimulated with erythropoietin, we showed that these four sequences bound to STAT 5 -containing complexes that exhibited different patterns and affinities: the three upstream STAT binding sequences bound to two distinct STAT 5 -containing complexes (C 0 and C 1) and the <b>downstream</b> STAT box <b>bound</b> only to the slower-migrating C 1 band.

All R 2 elements target the same sequence within 28 S rDNA. The amino-terminal domain of R 2 Bm, an R 2 -D clade element, contains a single zinc finger and a Myb motif that are responsible for binding R 2 protein downstream of the insertion site.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{analytical}} derivation {{of the mean}} velocity profile in a near-wall turbulent flow is revisited {{in the context of}} a two-dimensional channel flow. An approach based on the use of dispersion relations for the flow velocity is developed. It is shown that for an incompressible flow conserving vorticity, there exists a decomposition of the velocity field into rotational and potential components, such that the restriction of the former to an arbitrary cross-section of the channel is a functional of the vorticity and velocity distributions over that cross-section, while the latter is divergence-free and <b>bounded</b> <b>downstream</b> thereof. By eliminating the unknown potential component with the help of a dispersion relation, a nonlinear integro-differential equation for the flow velocity is obtained. It is then analyzed within an asymptotic expansion in the small ratio v*/U of the friction velocity to the mean flow velocity. Upon statistical averaging in the lowest nontrivial order, this equation relates the mean velocity to the cross-correlation function of the velocity fluctuations. Analysis of the equation reveals existence of two continuous families of solutions, one having the near-wall asymptotic of the form U ‚àº ln^p (y/y 0), where y is the distance to the wall, p> 0 is arbitrary, and the other, U ‚àº y^n, with n> 0 also arbitrary except in the limit n ‚Üí 0 where it turns out to be a universal function of the Reynolds number, n ‚àº 1 /ln(Re). It is proved, furthermore, that given a mean velocity distribution having either asymptotic, one can always construct a cross-correlation function so as to satisfy the obtained equation. These results are discussed in the light of the existing controversy regarding experimental verification of the law of the wall. Comment: 22 page...|$|R
