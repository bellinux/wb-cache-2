60|$|The duke deservedly reposed in him {{implicit}} confidence, and entertained {{an almost}} unbounded admiration of his cousin's knowledge of mankind. He was scarcely less a favourite or less an oracle with the duchess, {{though there were}} subjects on which she feared Lord Eskdale did not entertain views as serious as her own; but Lord Eskdale, with an extreme carelessness of manner, and an apparent negligence of the minor arts of pleasing, was a consummate master of the feminine idiosyncrasy, and, from a French actress to an English duchess, was skilled in guiding women without ever letting the curb be felt. Scarcely a week elapsed, when Lord Eskdale was in the country, that a long letter of difficulties was not received by him from Montacute, with an earnest request for his <b>immediate</b> <b>advice.</b> His lordship, singularly averse to letter writing, and especially to long letter writing, used generally in reply to say that, {{in the course of}} a day or two, he should be in their part of the world, and would talk the matter over with them.|$|E
60|$|Sir Alured in {{his letter}} {{expressed}} a hope that Everett might be informed instantly. He would have written himself had he known Everett's address. But he did know that his elder cousin was in town, and he besought his elder cousin to come at once,--quite at once,--to Wharton. Emily, he said, would of course accompany her father on such an occasion. Then there were long letters from Mary Wharton, and even from Lady Wharton, to Emily. The Whartons {{must have been very}} much moved when Lady Wharton could be induced to write a long letter. The Whartons were very much moved. They were in a state of enthusiasm at these news, amounting almost to fury. It seemed as though they thought that every tenant and labourer on the estate, and every tenant and labourer's wife, would be in an abnormal condition and unfit for the duties of life, till they should have seen Everett as heir of the property. Lady Wharton {{went so far as to}} tell Emily which bedroom was being prepared for Everett,--a bedroom very different in honour from any by the occupation of which he had as yet been graced. And there were twenty points as to new wills and new deeds as to which the present baronet wanted the <b>immediate</b> <b>advice</b> of his cousin. There were a score of things which could now be done which were before impossible. Trees could be cut down, and buildings put up; and a little bit of land sold, and a little bit of land bought;--the doing of all which would give new life to Sir Alured. A life interest in an estate is a much pleasanter thing when the heir is a friend who can be walked about the property, than when he is an enemy who must be kept at arm's length. All these delights could now be Sir Alured's,--if the old heir would give him his counsel and the young one his assistance.|$|E

50|$|The 2010 year {{began with}} {{controversy}} surrounding the president's order that a US$6.7 billion escrow account be {{opened at the}} Central Bank {{for the purpose of}} retiring high-interest bonds, whose principal is tied to inflation. The move met with the opposition of Central Bank president Martín Redrado, who refused to implement it, and following an impasse, he was dismissed by presidential decree on 7 January 2010. Redrado refused to abide by the initial decree removing him from the presidency of the Central Bank, however, and petitioned for a judicial power to keep him in office. Accordingly, the president enacted another decree for his dismissal, citing misconduct on Redrado's part. The legitimacy of this new decree was questioned as well, as his dismissal would deny Redrado due process. Congress was in recess period at the time, but most of its opposition members considered returning to override the decrees through an extraordinary session. The session became a source of controversy as well: Kirchner considered that, according to the 63rd article of the Constitution, only the President may call for an extraordinary session while the Congress is in recess. Cobos replied instead that all regulations concerning decrees require the <b>immediate</b> <b>advice</b> and consent of Congress, that the body's by-laws (56 and 57) allow extraordinary sessions called by any member, and that the commission formed for that purpose functions at all times, even during recess.|$|E

40|$|Objective To compare {{thoracic}} radiographs of clinically normal {{dogs and}} dogs with mild clinical heartworm disease with images transmitted by a desk-top, two-way audiovisual teleconferencing system. Design - Prospective, matched-set study. Study Population - 50 thoracic radiographs from clinically normal and heartworm-infected dogs and the digitally transmitted images of those radiographs. Procedure - Thoracic radiographs from 25 clinically normal dogs and 25 dogs infected with 1 to 24 heartworms {{were evaluated by}} 3 clinicians. Using classic criteria for heartworm disease, evaluations of radiographs and images transmitted digitally over 2 highspeed data-transfer telephone lines (56 kilobits/s/line) were performed.

40|$|Domestic {{violence}} is a common problem that may affect {{more than a quarter}} of women. It is a complex area in which to undertake research. Studies often focus on selected populations and exhibit a diversity of design, making comparison difficult. This review focuses on physical violence by men against women partners or ex-partners, and exemplifies important issues for general practitioners. Domestic violence frequently goes undetected. This may be the result of doctor's fears of exploring an area perceived as time-consuming, where knowledge is lacking and where they feel powerless to 'fix' the situation. Women may not reveal that they are experiencing violence, sometimes because doctors are unsympathetic or hostile. Nevertheless, women wish to be asked routinely about physical abuse and want to receive <b>immediate</b> <b>advice</b> and information about their options if necessary. Women experience a range of health and social problems in association with domestic violence, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse and pregnancy complications. However, none of these features is specific enough to be useful as an indicator of violence. Therefore, doctors should routinely ask all women direct questions about abuse. This recommendation can be incorporated into guidelines, which should be implemented widely in the UK, to improve the care of women experiencing domestic violence. In parallel with this, the educational needs of general practitioners should be addressed. Further research is needed to establish the prevalence of domestic violence in women presenting to general practice and to investigate how the problem is currently being addressed. If progress is to be made in tackling domestic violence, action within primary care is just one part of this: a fundamental change in the attitudes of men towards women is required...|$|E
40|$|A postal {{questionnaire}} {{was sent to}} 634 Leicestershire general practitioners about the service they wanted from their local gastrointestinal unit. Their views were specifically sought {{in relation to the}} care of chronic gastrointestinal disorders such as coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. This initial survey was 'testing the water' before addressing GP needs in all areas of gastroenterology including, management issues in peptic ulcer disease and hiatus hernia. The design of the questionnaire was simple with only 12 'yes' or 'no' stems. The response rate to one mailing of the questionnaire was 41 % with the rate for each question ranging from 83 % (on whether a telephone hot-line would be useful) to 99 % (on the value of treatment protocols). There was a poor response rate to some individual stems, with rates of less than 10 %, because most GPs only answered 'yes' to the stem they were interested in without answering 'no' to other parts. Most GPs wanted a regular news bulletin on the management of both inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease as well as detailed protocols on their treatment. Sixty per cent of respondents wanted a telephone hot line to senior gastroenterologists, with direct dialing to provide <b>immediate</b> <b>advice.</b> Eighty per cent of GPs want shared care with hospital consultants of such patients. A similar proportion thought that this decision should be made jointly by patients and their doctors. There is a clear desire by GPs for a more specialist education in line with the current trend of extending their role. GPs in Leicestershire would value {{a more active role in}} the management of patients with chronic intestinal diseases and it is likely that such views are widespread in Great Britain...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background For stroke patients, calling an {{ambulance}} {{has been shown}} to be associated with faster times to hospital than contacting a family physician. However little is known about the impact of decisions made by family physicians on delay times for stroke patients once they have been called. We aimed to test the hypotheses that among ambulance transported stroke patients: • Factors associated with first calling a family physician, could be identified. • Time to ambulance call will be longer when a family physician is first contacted. • Medical examination prior to the ambulance call will be associated with longer delay times. Methods For 6 months in 2004, all ambulance-transported stroke patients who presented from a defined region in Melbourne, Australia to one of three hospitals were assessed. Ambulance and hospital records were analysed. The patient and the person who called the ambulance were interviewed to obtain their description of the stroke event. Results 198 patients were included in the study. In 32 % of cases {{an ambulance}} was first called. No demographic or situational factors were associated with first calling a doctor. Patients with a history of stroke or TIA were less likely to call a doctor following symptom onset (p = 0. 01). Patients with a severe stroke (Glasgow Coma Scale When a family physician was contacted (22 % of cases), the time to ambulance call was significantly longer than when an ambulance was first called (p = 0. 0018) (median 143 and 44 minutes, respectively). In 36 % of calls to a family physician, the doctor elected to first examine the patient. Time to ambulance call was shorter when the doctor vetted the call and advised the caller to immediately call an ambulance (45 %) (median 412 and 92 minutes respectively: p = 0. 06). Conclusion Time delays to ambulance call were significantly longer for stroke patients when a family physician was first contacted. Further extensive delays were experienced by patients when the family physician elected to examine the patient. Family physicians and their staff have an important role to play in averting potential delays for stroke patients by screening calls and providing <b>immediate</b> <b>advice</b> to "call an ambulance". </p...|$|E

5000|$|The normal {{approach}} to wrongful trading actions {{is that the}} liquidator will try to establish a date at which the company can {{be shown to be}} balance sheet insolvent, and then show why it was unreasonable for directors to continue to trade after this. In the UK, and contrary to many misconceptions, it is not an offence to trade a company while it is insolvent. Indeed, in some situations, if the directors genuinely believe that the position will be turned around and the position of creditors will improve, it is the correct thing to do. When it becomes wrongful trading is when it should have been realised that the position of the creditors was likely to deteriorate from that position onwards and that the company would proceed into liquidation. Once a director realises that his or her company is insolvent, one important thing for him to do is to seek <b>immediate</b> professional <b>advice</b> from a licensed insolvency practitioner. All directors who continue as directors of a company trading while insolvent may face disqualification under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.

40|$|Prenatal {{patients}} are often exposed to respiratory viruses {{at home and}} at work. Understandably, these patients may be concerned and want <b>immediate</b> answers and <b>advice</b> from their physicians. While most women who are exposed to chickenpox are immune, serologic testing can be performed and susceptible patients can be treated with varicella-zoster immune globulin. If the prenatal patient is infected with the varicella-zoster virus, the risk of fetal manifestations is less than 2 percent. Women who have been exposed to fifth disease can undergo serologic testing to determine the likelihood of infection. If the prenatal patient becomes infected with fifth disease during the first 20 weeks of gestation, the risk of fetal manifestations is about 9 percent and includes nonimmune hydrops and death. Cytomegalovirus, which is the most common congenital infection, is generally asymptomatic in the mother. Infected fetuses have a 25 percent chance of developing early or late neurologic manifestations. The evidence of harm from other common respiratory viruses is inconsistent...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} Cork MABS service {{in terms of}} client satisfaction. The {{research}} found {{that there is an}} exceptionally high level of satisfaction with the MABS service among its clients. Cork MABS is seen by its clients as a highly professional and caring service. A large number of clients cited the peace of mind and the reassuring nature of the money advice process for them. It was found that there is a significant relationship between the perceived overall outcome in terms of clients’ ability to manage their financial affairs in a better way and their level of satisfaction with the service. Clients value the longer-term impacts as well as the more <b>immediate</b> money <b>advice</b> service. Some issues raised by clients were the need for more information on benefits and allowances and greater support in negotiating with creditors. For a small number of clients, particularly in the older age category, there were continuing uncertainties about the confidentiality of the service. There was some frustration about the length of time that clients had to wait for their first appointment with a money advisor. A significant relationship was found between waiting times and clients’ overall levels of satisfaction with the MABS service. The study makes a number of recommendations, most of which hinge on maintaining the current high level of support for MABS clients. Without this support, it is likely that satisfaction levels will begin to fall, and clients will suffer. The ethos of Cork MABS from the start has been about self-help and it continues to promote self-help over dependency among its clients. This in turn works to improve the financial capability of clients in the longer run which has wider societal benefits...|$|R
40|$|Background: Significant {{adverse events}} (AE) during cancer therapy disrupt {{treatment}} and escalate to emergency admissions. Approaches {{to improve the}} timeliness and accuracy of AE reporting may improve safety and reduce health service costs. Reporting: AE via Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs), can improve clinician-patient communication and making data available to clinicians in ‘real time’ using electronic PROs (ePROs) could potentially transform clinical practice by providing easily-accessible records to guide treatment decisions. This manuscript describes the development of eRAPID (electronic patient self-Reporting of Adverse-events: Patient Information and aDvice) is a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded programme,a system for patients to self-report and manage AE online during and after cancer treatment. Materials and methods: A multi-disciplinary team of IT experts, staff and patients developed using agile principles a secure web application interface (QStore) between an existing online questionnaire builder (QTool) displaying real-time ePRO data to clinicians in the electronic patient record (EPR) at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTHT). Hierarchical algorithms were developed corresponding to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading using the QTool question dependency function. Patient advocates (N[*]=[*] 9), patients (N[*]=[*] 13) and staff (N[*]=[*] 19) usability tested the system reporting combinations of AE. Results: The eRAPID system allows patients to report AE from home on PC, tablet or any web enabled device securely during treatment. The system generates <b>immediate</b> self-management <b>advice</b> for low or moderate AE and for severe AE advice to contact the hospital immediately. Clinicians can view patient AE data in the EPR and receive email notifications when patients report severe AE. Conclusions: Evaluation of the system in a Randomised Controlled Trial in breast, gynaecological and colorectal cancer patients undergoing systemic therapy is currently underway. To adapt eRAPID for different treatment groups pilot studies are being undertaken with patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy and upper gastrointestinal surgery...|$|R
5000|$|The law {{provides}} for [...] "expeditious" [...] action. The meaning of [...] "expeditious" [...] {{in the context}} of this law has not yet been determined by the courts. Black's Law Dictionary defines [...] "expeditious" [...] as [...] "performed with, or acting with, expedition; quick; speedy." [...] In the common law, the term [...] "expeditious" [...] has been interpreted according to the circumstances, allowing more time than [...] "immediate" [...] but not undue delay. Some suggest that the most prudent courses are to comply [...] "immediately" [...] or to seek <b>immediate</b> legal <b>advice</b> from qualified legal counsel. In the commercial online world, taking more than 24 hours may well be viewed as undue delay. However, when legal advice is factored into the equation it is reasonable to give counsel time to review all the facts, verify the necessary elements of the notice and conduct minimal research to ascertain the current state of the law. This may reasonably occur when the material posted appears likely to be covered by a fair use, for fair use is not copyright infringement. So, in some situations it may be reasonable to determine that [...] "expeditious" [...] would take more than 24 hours, and if the ISP was a small not-for-profit provider, or a server run by volunteers, it may not have the resources to obtain a legal opinion with the same speed that a large multinational corporation may have resources at its disposal to comply immediately. There may not even be a person immediately available who is qualified to determine if the notice complies with the standards set forth in the act. Perhaps a reasonable court would take these factors into consideration. The courts in the United States have yet to rule on these issues.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that positive effects of physiotherapy for acute low back pain patients can be achieved if treatment is delivered early enough. However {{it is clear that}} not all patients treated with physiotherapy are likely to report equally positive outcomes from their treatment. The identification of clinical characteristics of those patients who do less well will help refine models of care for acute low back pain. Aim: To identify non-responders to early active physiotherapy. Method: A secondary analysis was conducted on the data from a recently published randomised controlled trial of early physiotherapy for acute low back pain. All patients were randomised into two groups: <b>immediate</b> physiotherapy or <b>advice</b> and wait list and completed a series of physical, psychological and pain measures at baseline and again at six weeks. Multivariate statistical analysis was conducted to identify which patient baseline characteristics were associated with unsuccessful outcomes at the six week follow up. Control group comparisons permitted only those relationships associated with the intervention to be described. Results: Data analysis indicated that subgroups of patients who responded poorly to their physiotherapy treatment could be identified by a priori knowledge of their pain, mental health and physical function (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Conclusions: The results of the current analysis suggest that there are identifiable subgroups of patients who respond less well to physiotherapy treatment. Attention to these patient characteristics needs to be included in models of care for acute low back pain so that effects of therapy for all patients can be optimised...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In Luxembourg, viral {{hepatitis}} and HIV infection data in problem drug users (PDUs) are primarily based on self-reporting. Our study aimed {{to determine the}} prevalence of HAV, HBV, HCV and HIV infections in ever injecting (IDUs) and non-injecting drug users (nIDUs) including inherent risk factors analysis for IDUs. Secondary objectives were immunisation against HAV and HBV, referral to care and treatment facilities as well as reduction in risk behaviour. Methods A nationwide, cross-sectional multi-site survey, involving 5 in-, 8 out-treatment and 2 prison centres, included both an assisted questionnaire (n = 368) and serological detection of HIV and Hepatitis A, B, C (n = 334). A response rate of 31 % resulted in the participation of 310 IDUs and 58 nIDUs. Risk factors such as drug use, sexual behaviour, imprisonment, protection and health knowledge (HAV, HBV status and immunisations, HCV, HIV), piercing/tattoo and use of social and medical services were studied by means of chi 2 and logistic models. Results Seroprevalence results for IDUs were 81. 3 % (218 / 268, 95 %CI=[76. 6; 86. 0]) for HCV, 29. 1 % (74 / 254, 95 %CI=[25. 5; 34. 7]) for HBV (acute/chronic infection or past cured infection), 2. 5 % (5 / 202, 95 %CI=[0. 3; 4. 6]) for HIV- 1 and 57. 1 % (108 / 189, 95 %CI=[50. 0; 64. 1]) for HAV (cured infections or past vaccinations). Seroprevalence results for nIDUs were 19. 1 % (9 / 47, 95 %CI=[7. 9; 30. 3]) for HCV, 8. 9 % (4 / 45, 95 %CI=[0. 6; 17. 2]) for HBV (acute/chronic infection or past cured infection), 4. 8 % (2 / 42, 95 %CI=[- 1. 7; 11. 3]) for HIV- 1 and 65. 9 % (27 / 41, 95 %CI=[51. 4; 80. 4]) for HAV. Prisoners showed the highest rates for all infections. Age, imprisonment and setting of recruitment were statistically associated with HCV seropositivity. Age, speedball career and nationality {{were significantly associated with}} HBV seropositivity. Only 56 % of the participants in outpatient centres collected their serology results and 43 doses of vaccine against HAV and/or HBV were administered. Conclusions Despite the existing national risk-reduction strategies implemented since 1993, high prevalence of HCV and HBV infections in injecting drug users is observed. Our study showed that implementing risk-prevention strategies, including immunisation remains difficult with PDUs. Improvement should be looked for by the provision of field healthcare structures providing tests with <b>immediate</b> results, <b>advice,</b> immunisation or treatment if appropriate. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Open Foundation {{program at}} the University of Newcastle has always embraced {{students}} {{from a wide variety}} of backgrounds and potentially with a wide variety of disabilities and other problems that are likely to inhibit their learning. This paper addresses some of the problems encountered during fourteen years of teaching in the program, and lessons learnt in attempting to deal with diverse cohorts of students. Our job to act as a sorting mechanism for undergraduate programs carries a great amount of responsibility, not only to uphold the integrity and standards of the program but also to the individual students who risk a lot, including lifestyle, career, and relationship changes. When students are additionally burdened in this quest for change by learning disabilities, mental illness, physical disabilities, lack of confidence or over confidence, lack of Information Technology skills, no prior adult learning experiences, ESL issues, coming to terms with Indigenous, transsexual or gay identities or alternatively with discrimination based on these identities, it makes for very interesting adjustments for students and requires that staff are sensitive to all these needs and deal with them in an appropriate manner. While we have Disability officers, Counsellors and Learning Support officers, in the first instance and primarily in relation to their learning, lecturers are the initial and most <b>immediate</b> source of <b>advice</b> and encouragement. It is often to them that referring, guiding and facilitating adjustment to students’ new learning environment falls. How lecturers deal with it then becomes a matter of experience, insight and initiative. This paper unpacks some of the issues teaching to diverse student cohorts entails...|$|R
40|$|In April 1999, the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) {{initiated}} {{construction of}} the U. S. Route 113 project in Worcester County, Maryland. This multi-phased interstate roadway project will upgrade and dualize approximately 24 miles of existing two-lane highway to improve vehicular safety and traffic flow. As a special condition of the U. S. Clean Water Act, Section 404 permit, the SHA was required by U. S. Army Corp of Engineers-Baltimore District (COE) to utilize an independent Environmental Monitor to ensure compliance with all environmental permits and commitments, and to ultimately {{reduce the amount of}} total wetland and stream impact. Although the basis for the COE requirement can be found in Section 1505 - 2 (c) and 1505 - 3 of book 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), a designated Environmental Monitor has rarely been used or required. The US 113 project included the first large-scale Design/Build effort that the SHA has undertaken. The planned phasing sequence is for Phase I and Phase III to be completed in a Design/Build manner, with Phase II and Phase IV in a traditional fully designed and advertised-for-bid manner. The COE permitted the entire project based on approximate thirty-percent complete designs and authorized an impact of 27 acres of nontidal wetlands and 1, 975 linear feet of stream channel. The COE permitted this large impact with the understanding that the Environmental Monitor would be on-site on a daily basis to ensure that impacts would be avoided and minimized during construction using best management practices and other impact minimization methods. In addition to monitoring environmental permit compliance, the Environmental Monitor also ensures implementation of commitments made in documents completed during the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process such as Environmental Assessments (EA), Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), Record of Decision (ROD) and the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for cultural resources. The role of the Environmental Monitor is in addition to the services normally requested for Environmental Construction Inspection (ECI) in a number of ways. The Environmental Monitor must be the on-site environmental manager and problem solver. The Environmental Monitor is charged with three broad responsibilities: 1. To review design and construction activities with emphasis on avoidance and minimization and to ensure environmental commitments and requirements are incorporated into the {{construction of the}} project. 2. To function as an unbiased independent source of environmental expertise, including making recommendations of measures and actions to reduce impact and to rectify non-compliance issues. 3. To function as a liaison between the public, the participating department of transportation (DOT), and the regulatory agencies, specifically in relation to environmental commitments and coordination with the COE for problems/issues that may arise regarding construction associated with jurisdictional Waters of the United States. Ideally, the complete environmental monitoring effort begins with involvement in the initial design phase and extends throughout the life of the construction project. To fulfill the assigned responsibilities, the Environmental Monitor performs daily inspections of the entire project site, maintains a physical presence during the full length of construction activities within environmentally sensitive areas, obtains periodic water quality data from streams and stormwater management facilities, and reviews all submittals for the ongoing project designs. The Environmental Monitor is to be highly involved with project construction and public involvement/information aspects, including: • Impact Avoidance and Minimization Documentation • SWM ponds and planting ICOET 2001 Proceedings 315 A Time for Action • Water quality • Stream relocations/crossings • Wetland protection/restoration/mitigation • Existing vegetation protection • Off-site fill/borrow areas (environmental issues) • Construction staging areas (environmental clearances) • Cultural and historical (Section 106 /Section 4 (f)) issues and commitments • Other commitments made through the federal and state environmental review process including those made during the NEPA process. • Information management including the development of a project website that provides information to the public on such topics as project description, need and purpose, construction schedules, and detours. To date, Phase I (the first Design/Build portion) of the project has been completed and {{is open to the public}} for use. Phase II has undergone traditional design and advertisement and is currently in the eighth month of construction. Upon completion of Phase I and the as-built surveys, a final report was prepared that provided specific information on the avoidance and minimization measures that were undertaken during the Design/Build process, the total of wetland and stream impact for the respective phase of construction, and the amount of wetland and/or stream impact that was avoided through the efforts of the Environmental Monitor team. As a result of the environmental monitoring effort, there was a reduction of 2. 34 acres of wetland impact from the original 8. 97 acres of impact permitted by the COE. Additionally, there was more than an acre of forest impact reduction. There were relatively minor incidents in which the project became non-compliant with erosion and sediment control issues and the COE permit. Through the efforts of the Environmental Monitor, the non-compliance was discovered quickly and rectified within a timely manner, thereby avoiding potentially costly delays, COE fines, and project shut-downs. Environmental Monitor efforts are currently ongoing for Phase II and minimization efforts are consistently documented both from the design process and the current construction activities. Based on the results of the first phase of construction, the use of an Environmental Monitor team for large environmentally complex projects, such as the U. S. 113 project, is a successful merging of the achievement of public infrastructure goals and adherence to current environmental regulations and policies. The SHA is continuing to use an Environmental Monitor for other transportation projects largely because of the success of US 113 -Phase I. The SHA has identified important tangible benefits that have been brought to the transportation construction process as a result of using an Environmental Monitor. These benefits include the avoidance of costly delays and potential shutdowns from non-compliant actions; potential reduction of environmental impacts that lead to a reduction in mitigation costs and overall project costs; detection of unforeseen environmental problems/issues; the opportunity for SHA to receive <b>immediate</b> professional environmental <b>advice</b> and recommendations regarding a specific issue; the ability for the public to receive accurate information on design and construction issues and a timely response to their concerns; and a costeffective method of proactive environmental protection. The total cost for the US 113 project is approximately $ 115 million. The services of the Environmental Monitor will cost approximately $ 980, 000, approximately 0. 85 % of the project cost. The utilization of an Environmental Monitor is a progressive mutually beneficial cooperative effort between DOTs and state and federal regulatory agencies. This type of cooperative effort can continue to set the stage for more expeditious initiation and completion of complex public-need/transportation projects throughout the country in a cost-effective manner, ensuring that appropriate environmental protection standards and safeguards are emplaced...|$|R
