5|$|Before the 2014 season, the Phillies signed Mayberry to a {{guaranteed}} $1.5875 million contract. Mayberry entered the season {{a member of}} the Phillies bench who some writers thought was not worth his salary, but made the opening day roster. Mayberry was successful early in the season, particularly as a pinch hitter – as of June 13, he was 9-for-19 with three home runs and 11 RBIs. He also started several games at first base, predominantly against left-handed pitchers. This success led some to suggest the Mayberry would <b>have</b> <b>value</b> in a potential trade, as the Phillies were not expected to make the playoffs, and thus might prefer to get a prospect for future seasons. However, some attributed Mayberry's success {{to the fact that the}} Phillies used him in an appropriate role, rather than trying to utilize him every day.|$|E

The study found the combination to significantly improve negative schizophrenia symptoms, and people taking both drugs experienced fewer of the adverse effects commonly associated with haloperidol. An earlier, smaller, open-label trial had found ondansetron to be useful in treating antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, and the study patients also showed significant improvement in the disease's symptoms.|$|E

30|$|A {{spanning}} elementary subgraph M' of M with s(M') {{number of}} mixed cycles (length ≥ 3) gives 2 ^s(M') permutations π since, for each mixed cycle-component in M', {{there are two}} ways of choosing the corresponding cycles in π. For a vertex v_k∈ V(M'), we denote d_k=d(v_k)=d_M_U(v_k). Furthermore, if for some direction of a permutation π, a mixed cycle-component C_ 1 <b>has</b> <b>value</b> i∏_v_j∈ V(C_ 1) 1 /d(v_j) (or -i∏_v_j∈ V(C_ 1) 1 /d(v_j)), then for the other direction C_ 1 <b>has</b> <b>value</b> -i∏_v_j∈ V(C_ 1) 1 /d(v_j) (or i∏_v_j∈ V(C_ 1) 1 /d(v_j)) and vice versa. Thus, they cancel each other in the summation. In addition, if for some direction of a permutation π, C_ 1 <b>has</b> <b>value</b> ∏_v_j∈ V(C_ 1) 1 /d(v_j) (or -∏_v_j∈ V(C_ 1) 1 /d(v_j)), then for the other direction C_ 1 <b>has</b> the same <b>value.</b> For each edge-component (kl) corresponding to the factors (r_h)_kl(r_h)_lk <b>has</b> <b>value</b> 1 /√(d_kd_l) 1 /√(d_ld_k)= 1 /d_kd_l.

Perhaps due to this lack of clarity, researchers have operationalised the concept in diverse ways, and have varied in their conclusions. While some researchers may be criticised for using measures of cultural capital which focus only on certain aspects of 'highbrow' culture, this is a criticism which could also be leveled at Bourdieu's own work.

25|$|Many community-run bicycle {{programmes}} paint their bicycles in {{a strong}} solid colour, such as yellow or white.

However, theft rates in many bike-sharing programmes remain high, as most shared-use bicycles <b>have</b> <b>value</b> only as basic transport, and may be resold to unsuspecting buyers after being cleaned and repainted. In response, some large-scale bike sharing programmes have designed their own bike using specialised frame designs and other parts to prevent disassembly and resale of stolen parts.|$|E
