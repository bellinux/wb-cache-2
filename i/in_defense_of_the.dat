5|$|<b>In</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text's authenticity, Ariel Shisha-Halevy, Professor of Linguistics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and {{a leading}} expert on Coptic language, {{concluded}} that the language itself offered no evidence of forgery. King also found examples from a new discovery in Egypt that has {{the same kind of}} grammar, showing that at least one unusual case is not unique. While some experts continue to disagree about the other case, King notes that newly discovered texts often feature grammatical or spelling oddities which expand our understanding of the Coptic language.|$|E

5|$|The 1793 Second Partition of Poland was {{the second}} of three {{partitions}} (or partial annexations) that ended {{the existence of the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1795. The second partition occurred {{in the aftermath of the}} War <b>in</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution and the Targowica Confederation of 1792, and was approved by its territorial beneficiaries, the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia. The division was ratified by the coerced Polish parliament (Sejm) in 1793 (see the Grodno Sejm) in a short-lived attempt to prevent the inevitable complete annexation of Poland, the Third Partition.|$|E
5|$|After the Union rout at Bull Run, {{the first}} major battle of the Civil War, and the {{retirement}} of the aged Winfield Scott in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign, longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops <b>in</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Both ships saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the Ottoman fleet {{over the course}} of the decade following their arrival in November 1907. They took part in the first fleet maneuver conducted by the fleet in over twenty years in 1909. Neither ship saw action during the Italo-Turkish War of 191112, as Peyk-i Şevket had been interned at British-controlled Suez at the outbreak of war, and Berk-i Satvet was stationed with the reserve fleet in the Sea of Marmara, which did not risk confrontation with the significantly stronger Italian fleet. Both ships saw combat during the First Balkan War in 1913, primarily in supporting Ottoman forces ashore in East Thrace. The ships provided gunfire support to the Ottoman army holding the Çatalca line <b>in</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital at Constantinople. Berk-i Satvet also took part in two brief skirmishes with the Greek Navy.|$|E

5|$|During the Polish–Russian War of 1792 <b>in</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution, the Polish forces {{supporting}} the Constitution, {{fought against the}} army of the Russian Empire, invited by the pro-Russian alliance of Polish magnates, known as the treasonous Targowica Confederation. The conservative nobility (see also, szlachta) believed that the Russians would help them restore their Golden Liberty. Abandoned by their Prussian allies, the badly outnumbered Polish pro-Constitution forces fought under Prince Józef Poniatowski a defensive war with some measure of success, but were ordered to abandon their efforts by their supreme commander, King Stanisław August Poniatowski. The King decided to join the Targowica Confederation, as demanded by the Russians.|$|E
5|$|In July 1943, Lützow became Inspector of Day Fighters, Italian Front, {{based in}} Naples. From September 1943 to March 1944, he {{commanded}} the 1.

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that between 1493 and 1793 sejms were held 240 times. Jędruch gives a higher number of 245, and notes that 192 of those were successfully completed, passing legislation. 32 sejms were vetoed with the infamous liberum veto, particularly {{in the first half}} of the 18th century. The last two sejms of the Commonwealth were the irregular four-year Great Sejm (1788–92), which passed the Constitution of the 3 May, and the infamous Grodno Sejm (1793) where deputies, bribed or coerced by the Russian Empire following the Commonwealth defeat in the War <b>in</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution, annulled the short-lived Constitution and passed the act of Second Partition of Poland.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 1861, Morton {{addressed}} {{a special session}} of the Indiana General Assembly to obtain the legislature's approval to borrow and spend funds to purchase arms and supplies for Indiana's troops. Morton also urged Indiana's legislators to set aside party considerations {{for the duration of}} the war and unite <b>in</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union, but the Republicans and Democrats did not cooperate for long. Initially, the Democratic-controlled legislature was supportive of Morton's measures and passed the legislation he requested. After the state legislature adjourned in May, however, some of the state's prominent Democrats changed their opinion about the war. In January 1862 the Democrats clarified their position at a state convention chaired by Thomas Hendricks. Indiana's Democrats stated that their support for the integrity of the Union and the war effort, but opposed emancipation of black and the abolition of slavery.|$|E
