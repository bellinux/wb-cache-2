40|$|The {{actions of}} the {{phosphodiesterase}} inhibitor <b>denbufylline</b> on the excitability of hippocampal neurons were investigated by means of extracellular and intracellular recordings. <b>Denbufylline,</b> which {{has been shown to}} selectively inhibit a low KM, Ca 2 +/calmodulin-independent phosphodiesterase isozyme, concentration-dependently increased the amplitude of the extracellularly recorded CAI population spike evoked by electrical stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway. Concentration-response-curves yielded an EC 50 for <b>denbufylline</b> of 0. 76 M. In comparison, the nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3 -isobutyl-lmethylxanthine (IBMX) also produced an increase in the amplitude of the population spike. From the concentration-response-curve, which was steeper than that of <b>denbufylline,</b> an EC 50 for IBMX of 1. 04 M was obtained. However, despite their similar EC 50 values, <b>denbufylline</b> was found to be significantly more potent at lower concentrations (<- 300 nM) than IBMX. Intracellular recordings from CAI pyramidal cells revealed postsynaptic actions of <b>denbufylline</b> (300 nM) as indicated by a small drug-induced depolarization (2 – 5 mV) associated with an increase in membrane input resistance by 10 – 20 %. In addition, <b>denbufylline</b> blocked the accommodation of trains of action potentials evoked by the injection of depolarizing current pulses. The results suggest i) that accumulation of adenosine- 3, 5 -monophosphate (CAMP) in the postsynaptic cell and/or in the presynaptic terminal produced by blockade of phosphodiesterases leads to enhanced synaptic transmission in the CAI area of the hippocampus and ii) that a low KM, Ca 2 +/calmodulin-independent cAMP-phosphodiesterase is an important component involved in the regulation of the intracellular cAMP level at synapses of central nervous system neurons. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} our {{laboratory}} {{have shown that}} the synthetic xanthine analogue <b>denbufylline,</b> a selective type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE- 4) inhibitor, is a potent activator of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis when given orally or intraperitoneally (i. p.) to adult male rats. This paper describes the results of experiments in which well established in vivo and in vitro methods were used to compare the effects of <b>denbufylline</b> on HPA function with those of two other selective PDE- 4 inhibitors, rolipram and BRL 61063 (1, 3 -dicyclopropylmethyl- 8 -amino-xanthine). For comparison, parallel measurements of the immunoreactive- (ir-) luteinising hormone (LH) were made where appropriate. When injected intraperitoneally, rolipram (40 and 200 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, P 0. 05). By contrast, intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) injection of rolipram (8 [*]ng– 1 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) or <b>denbufylline</b> (50 [*]ng– 1 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) failed to influence the serum ir-corticosterone concentration. BRL 61063 (8 – 120 [*]ng[*]kg− 1, i. c. v.) was also ineffective in this regard although at a higher dose (1 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. c. v.) it produced a small but significant (P 0. 05). In vitro rolipram (10 [*]μM, P 0. 05); the rank order of potency was thus BRL 61063 >rolipram>denbufylline. The adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (100 [*]μM, P< 0. 01) also stimulated the release of ir-CRH- 41, producing effects which were additive with those of rolipram and <b>denbufylline</b> but not with those of BRL 61063. The secretory responses to forskolin (100 [*]μM) were accompanied by a highly significant increase in the cyclic AMP content of the hypothalamic tissue (P< 0. 005). Rolipram (10 [*]μM) also significantly (P< 0. 05) elevated the hypothalamic cyclic AMP but <b>denbufylline</b> (10 [*]mM) and BRL 61063 (10 [*]μM) did not. However, all three PDE-inhibitors potentiated the rise in cyclic AMP induced by forskolin (P< 0. 05). None of the drugs tested, alone or in combination, modified the release of arginine vasopressin (ir-AVP) from the hypothalamus. Rolipram (100 [*]μM), <b>denbufylline</b> (100 [*]μM) and BRL 61063 (100 [*]μM) stimulated the release of corticotrophin (ir-ACTH) from pituitary tissue in vitro (P< 0. 05) but in lower concentrations they were without significant effect. In addition, rolipram (10 [*]μM, P< 0. 05), <b>denbufylline</b> (0. 1 [*]μM, P< 0. 05) and BRL 61063 (10 [*]μM, P< 0. 05) potentiated the significant (P< 0. 05) rises in ir-ACTH secretion induced by forskolin (100 [*]μM). Forskolin (100 [*]μM) also produced a highly significant increase (P< 0. 01) in the tissue cyclic AMP content which was further potentiated by rolipram (10 [*]μM), <b>denbufylline</b> (10 [*]μM) and BRL 61063 (10 [*]μM) which, alone did not affect the cyclic AMP content of the tissue. Since both <b>denbufylline</b> and BRL 61063 possess significant adenosine A 1 receptor blocking activity, further studies examined the potential influence of these receptors on the secretion in vitro of CRH- 41, AVP and ACTH. The release of ir-CRH- 41 was increased significantly by adenosine deaminase (ADA, 5 [*]u[*]ml− 1, P< 0. 05) and the A 1 -receptor antagonist, 1, 3 -dicyclopropyl- 8 -cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX, 0. 1 – 10 [*]nM, P< 0. 05). The responses to ADA were abolished by the A 1 receptor agonist N 6 -cyclo-hexyladenosine (CHA, 100 [*]nM, P< 0. 05) which alone had no significant effect on ir-CRH- 41 release. ADA (0. 1 – 10 [*]u[*]ml− 1) and DPCPX (1 [*]nM) had weak stimulant and inhibitory effects, respectively, on the release of ir-ACTH from the pituitary gland while CHA (0. 1 – 10 [*]nM) was without effect. Ligand binding studies with [3 H]-DPCPX as a probe demonstrated the presence of specific high affinity A 1 binding sites in the hypothalamus (Kd= 0. 7 [*]nM; Bmax= 367 ± 32 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein) and in the hippocampus (Kd= 1 [*]nM; Bmax= 1165 ± 145 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein). In both tissues binding of the ligand was displaced by CHA (IC 50 = 1 [*]nM (hypothalamus) and 2 [*]nM (hippocampus)), BRL 61063 (IC 50 = 80 [*]nM (hypothalamus) and 100 [*]nM (hippocampus)) and <b>denbufylline</b> (IC 50 = 5 [*]μM (hypothalamus) and 9 [*]μM (hippocampus)) but not by rolipram. The results suggest that rolipram, denblufylline and BRL 61063 stimulate the HPA axis in the rat, acting at the levels of both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. Their actions may be explained, at least in part, by inhibition of PDE- 4 but additional actions including blockade of hypothalamic adenosine A 1 receptors by <b>denbufylline</b> and BRL 61063 cannot be excluded...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) modulates the stimulated generation of the cytokines, interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) and IL- 13, from human basophils. This was addressed by evaluating the effects of both nonselective and selective inhibitors of PDEs on the generation of cytokines from basophils. The nonselective PDE inhibitors, isobutyl-methylxanthine (IBMX) and theophylline, attenuated the IgE-mediated generation of IL- 4 and IL- 13 and, also, the release of histamine from basophils. The effects of the isoform-selective inhibitors, 8 -methoxymethyl-IBMX (PDE 1 inhibitor), siguazodan (PDE 3 inhibitor), rolipram (PDE 4 inhibitor), <b>denbufylline</b> (PDE 4 inhibitor), Org 30029 (mixed PDE 3 and 4 inhibitor) and zaprinast (PDE 5 inhibitor), were studied.

The effects of isoform-selective inhibitors on basophils activated by IL- 3 were evaluated. The IL- 3 -induced generation of IL- 4, IL- 13 and histamine was inhibited to a statistically significant (P< 0. 05) extent, only by compounds that act as inhibitors of PDE 4.

Solubilized PDE IV was {{at least}} 10 times more potently inhibited by selective PDE IV inhibitors (e. g. rolipram, <b>denbufylline)</b> than bound enzyme. Vanadate/glutathione complex (V/GSH) activated membrane-bound PDE IV and also increased potencies of these same inhibitors by at least 10 -fold. Neither solubilization nor V/GSH markedly influenced the inhibitory activities of non-selective inhibitors (e. g. trequinsin, dipyridamole).

40|$|We studied {{interactions}} between the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway and cAMP-protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathway in regulation of mitogenesis of mesangial cells (MC) determined by [3 H]thymidine incorporation, with or without added EGF. Forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP strongly (by 60 - 70 %) inhibited [3 H]thymidine incorporation into MC. Cilostamide, lixazinone or cilostazol selective inhibitors of cAMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE) isozyme PDE-III, inhibited mitogenesis to similar extent as forskolin and DBcAMP and activated in situ PKA, but without detectable increase in cAMP levels. Cilostamide and cilostazol were {{more than three times}} more effective at inhibiting mesangial mitogenesis than rolipram and <b>denbufylline,</b> inhibitors of isozyme PDE-IV, even though PDE-IV was two times more abundant in MC than was PDE-III. On the other hand, when incubated with forskolin, rolipram-enhanced cAMP accumulation was far greater (10 - 100 x) than with cilostamide. EGF increased MAPK activity (+ 300 %); PDE isozyme inhibitors which suppressed mitogenesis also inhibited MAPK. PDE isozyme inhibitors also suppressed PDGF-stimulated MC proliferation. We conclude that cAMP inhibits the mitogen-dependent MAPK-signaling pathway probably by decreasing the activity of Raf- 1 due to PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation. Further, we surmise that minor increase in the cAMP pool metabolized by PDE-III is intimately related to regulation of mesangial proliferation. Thus, PDE isozyme inhibitors have the potential to suppress MC proliferation by a focused effect upon signaling pathways...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the inhibitory effects of the PDE 4 inhibitor, rolipram, in an in vitro assay of thromboxane (Tx) production. The assay was then used to monitor the activity of this compound in vivo in normal and RAO-affected horses. Rolipram and the structurally distinct PDE 4 inhibitor, <b>denbufylline,</b> attenuated both lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced and unstimulated Tx production in blood from normal horses. Thromboxane production appeared to involve a calcium-dependent interaction between leucocytes and platelets (LPS-induced Tx production = 2. 3 ± 0. 4, 4. 5 ± 1. 1 and 20. 8 ± 3. 6 ng/mL for platelets, leucocytes and blood, respectively) and rolipram-inhibited Tx production via an effect on leucocytes. Inhibition of ex vivo LPS induced Tx production was detected after intravenous administration of rolipram (5 μg/kg) to normal ponies. This dose did not significantly affect either lung function or neutrophil accumulation when administered to three horses with clinical signs of RAO. This study suggests that inhibition of Tx production in equine blood can be used to measure PDE 4 activity.

Additional PDE 4 inhibitors, <b>denbufylline,</b> Ro 20 - 1724, RP 73401 and nitraquazone, were all found to be effective inhibitors of mediator release in basophils but were ineffective in HLMC unless high concentrations (1 [*]mM) were employed.
