5|$|The {{completion}} of I-69 in the 1980s, and {{the approval of}} the North American Free Trade Agreement, increased traffic at the Blue Water Bridge. A new toll and customs plaza was built in 1991, and later the next year, an international task force determined that traffic on the existing structure was exceeding capacity. <b>Environmental</b> <b>planning</b> started in 1993, and construction started on the second span between Port Huron and Point Edward, Ontario in 1995. In July 1997, the second span opened. The original span was closed for rehabilitation, and both were opened to traffic in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus has {{increasingly}} been investing in <b>environmental</b> <b>planning</b> and, {{in accordance with}} national policy, aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of fossil fuels for heating by 2030. The municipal power plants were adapted for this purpose in the 2010s. In 2015, the municipality took over three private straw-fired heating plants and the year after, a new 77 MW {{combined heat and power}} biomass plant at Lisbjerg Power Station was completed while Studstrup Power Station finished a refit to move from coal to wood chips. In conjunction with the development of the Docklands district there are plans for a utility scale seawater heat pump which will take advantage of fluctuating electricity prices to supply the district heating system.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1990s, many plans were {{proposed}} to limit or discourage economic practices that damage the environment. Despite discussion of programs to require payments for resources (especially water) and to collect fines from heavy polluters, however, little has been accomplished. The obstacles are a lack of law enforcement in these areas, inconsistent government economic and <b>environmental</b> <b>planning,</b> corruption, and the overwhelming concentration of power in the hands of a president who shows little tolerance of grassroots activity.|$|E
25|$|The Ganges {{was ranked}} as the fifth most {{polluted}} river {{of the world}} in 2007.

The levels of fecal coliform from human waste in the waters of the river near Varanasi are more than 100 times the Indian government's official limit. The Ganga Action Plan, an environmental initiative to clean up the river, has been a major failure thus far, due to corruption, lack of technical expertise, poor <b>environmental</b> <b>planning,</b> and lack of support from religious authorities.|$|E

In elevating Copenhagen to [...] "most liveable city" [...] in 2013, Monocle pointed to its open spaces, increasing activity on the streets, city planning in favour of cyclists and pedestrians, and features to encourage inhabitants to enjoy city life with an emphasis on community, culture and cuisine.
