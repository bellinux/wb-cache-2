6000|$|Sadie, {{dressed in}} black and white, with a black feather in her white hat, was braced back on the driving seat, {{with one hand on}} the reins while she used the whip. There was a patch of bright color in her face, her eyes flashed, and the {{rigidity}} of her figure gave her an air of savage resolution. She looked a handsome virago as she battled with the powerful horses, which plunged and <b>kicked</b> while <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> rocked among <b>the</b> ruts. Helen watched the struggle with somewhat mixed feelings. This was the girl for whom Bob had given her up! ...|$|R
60|$|The outlaw rummaged {{in one of}} <b>the</b> <b>wagons,</b> pulled aside <b>the</b> canvas flaps of the other, laughed harshly, {{and then}} with clinking spurs tramped through <b>the</b> camp, <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> beds, {{overturning}} a pile of saddles, and making disorder generally, till he spied the couple sitting on the stone in the shadow.|$|R
60|$|Brooke moved a {{few paces}} nearer. It was one thing for a rancher {{accustomed}} to horses and bridges of that description to take pleasure in such a struggle, but quite another {{in the case of}} a man from the cities, and he had misgivings as to the result of it. The latter, however, showed very little concern, though the near horse was now apparently endeavoring to <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> front of <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> in. Then Brooke sprang suddenly towards them as both backed <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> against <b>the</b> log. He fancied that one wheel was mounting it when he seized the near horse's head, but after that he had very little opportunity of noticing anything.|$|R
5000|$|Rather than {{return home}} to her friends and family, Belle starts {{spending}} her days in a local tavern where she eventually meets a dwarf named Dreamy (Lee Arenberg). After convincing him to go after his love (Amy Acker), he convinces her to seek out adventure, that being to join {{a group of men}} on the hunt for a beast known as the Yaoguai. She does just that, but when not taken seriously and <b>kicked</b> off <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> she sends <b>the</b> men in the wrong direction and proceeds to go out and hunt the creature herself. She winds up befriending the likes of a warrior named Mulan (Jamie Chung), and she is eventually able to track the Yaoguai down. However, as it turns out, all this time the beast has merely been trying to communicate with them. With the use of some fairy dust, Belle restores the creature to its true form: Prince Phillip (Julian Morris). While Phillip and Mulan go off together in order to rescue Princess Aurora (Sarah Bolger), Belle plans to return to Rumplestiltskin. She's unable to do so, however, when the Evil Queen arrives to take her prisoner. Regina goes on to have the Dark One convinced that Belle committed suicide by throwing herself off a tower, leaving him utterly heartbroken, when all the while she remains locked up in the Queen's castle. Belle is later sought out by Captain Hook (Colin O'Donoghue), an old enemy of Rumplestiltskin's who believes that the Dark One's former maid may know the key to his undoing. He plans to kill her when she proves otherwise, but Regina intervenes as she believes Belle to be a [...] "valuable chess piece".|$|R
60|$|The cowboys {{struggled}} to their feet. The Chinaman, {{who was sitting}} inside <b>the</b> cook <b>wagon,</b> poring over a book {{by the light of}} a lantern, recognised the note of fury in French's tone and raised his head, startled. A paroxysm of fear seized him. The very moment that French threw open the door of <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> he <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> lantern across the floor and plunged at the canvas sides of the vehicle, slipping underneath until he reached the ground. French, left in darkness, groped around {{for a moment and then}} emerged. The cowboys had gathered together outside.|$|R
60|$|Just {{then one}} of the horses lifted its fore hoofs off the ground, and being jerked back by the pole plunged and <b>kicked</b> furiously, until <b>the</b> other horse flung up its head and <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> went {{backward}} with a run. Then they stopped, and there was a series of resounding crashes against the front of the vehicle. Hawtrey was within a pace or two of <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> when Sally recognized him.|$|R
25|$|Wooden wedges may {{be forced}} between the stage and the bottom edge of <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> perimeter. Ideally, <b>the</b> wedges are driven under <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> to <b>the</b> extent that <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> is {{supported}} by the wedges instead of its casters. Wedges are typically used in pairs, on opposite sides of <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> can't slip off the wedges.|$|R
50|$|Coal also arrives by the Indian Railways. <b>The</b> <b>wagons</b> are routed via Ramagundam {{railway station}} to the {{separate}} plant line and these coaches arrive at <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> tippler. <b>The</b> <b>wagons</b> arriving {{in this manner}} must be tilted at <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> tippler to obtain the coal as {{they do not have}} the drop mechanism underneath.|$|R
30|$|The {{on-board}} {{intelligence of}} <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> {{will include a}} GPS location module and a data logger, so that <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> can be located easily. Due to the exact information about the position of <b>the</b> <b>wagons,</b> they can be dispatched more easily. Thus, together with the new integrated business model, the round trip times of <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> from nowadays approximately 3  days shall be reduced to 2  days. Furthermore the mileage counting will facilitate a mileage-based maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>wagon</b> {{consists}} of a square-shaped, open-worked base plate with four spoked wheels. A female figure approx. 32 cm high holding a bowl-shaped object in upraised hands stands {{in the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> <b>The</b> bowl is also held on the sides by two scissor-shaped supports. Recent restoration work and examination by experts has concluded that the bowl attributed to <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> up to now cannot be conclusively proven to originally have been part of <b>the</b> cult <b>wagon</b> [...] In addition to the kettle bearer, numerous other figures in the form of both standing and mounted people as well as animals similar to deer and to horses are present on <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> <b>The</b> depicted scene is interpreted as a sacrifice. <b>The</b> <b>wagon</b> presumably served as a cult object for the consumption of a libation.|$|R
2500|$|A lift jack is {{fundamentally}} a lever that attaches to <b>the</b> scenery <b>wagon</b> platform with a hinge, with a caster mounted to {{the underside of}} the lever near the hinge. When no downward force is applied to the lever handle, <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> rests securely on the stage; this effectively locks <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> in place due to friction between <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> platform and <b>the</b> stage. When the lever handle is forced downward, however, the caster serves as a [...] to lift <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> slightly above <b>the</b> stage, thus enabling the unit to be rolled.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the fire was never fully explained. <b>The</b> <b>wagon</b> had {{previously}} been used to carry a load of bulk sulphur powder and although {{it would have been}} cleaned in between loads, the possibility remained that some of the powder remained. Although <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> was sheeted, <b>the</b> theory advanced was that a cinder from the engine had landed in <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> and had ignited some sulphur which in turn set alight the wooden body of <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b>|$|R
60|$|Five minutes passed, {{and then}} {{four or five}} men came up to <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> <b>The</b> hay, which was on top, was cast aside, {{revealing}} some machinery resting {{on the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> Conestoga <b>wagon</b> {{was built}} with its floor curved upward {{to prevent the}} {{contents}} from tipping and shifting. Including its tongue, <b>the</b> average Conestoga <b>wagon</b> was 18 feet (5.4 m) long, 11 feet (3.3 m) high, and 4 feet (1.2 m) in width. It could carry up to 12000 lb of cargo. The seams {{in the body of}} <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> were stuffed with tar to protect them from leaking while crossing rivers. Also for protection against bad weather, stretched across <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> was a tough white canvas cover. The frame and suspension were made of wood, and the wheels were often iron rimmed for greater durability. Water barrels were built on the side of <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> toolboxes held tools needed for repair, and a feed box on the back of <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> was used to feed the horses. <b>The</b> early freight <b>wagon</b> was not intended to be ridden upon. <b>The</b> <b>wagon</b> had a brake handle on the left side between the two wheels and a teamster either walked beside <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> or could ride standing (and could sit for a rough ride) on a pull-out board, called a lazy board, that provided access to the brake handle. The left horse near <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> was referred to as the wheel horse and was sometimes ridden. <b>The</b> Conestoga <b>wagon</b> began <b>the</b> custom of [...] "driving" [...] on the right-hand side of the road.|$|R

50|$|A later time-saving {{innovation}} was to tow <b>the</b> flatbed <b>wagon</b> {{directly behind}} <b>the</b> baler, and the bale would be pushed up a ramp to a waiting attendant on <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> <b>The</b> attendant hooks the bale off the ramp and stacks it on <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> {{while waiting for}} the next bale to be produced.|$|R
30|$|Because of {{the rules}} for {{acceptance}} of rolling stock in international transport the technical inspection is necessary.

5000|$|Formed by Chris Merry in {{the early}} 1890s, the Henry Street Gang was based in Chicago's Southwest Side {{committing}} armed robbery against local merchants and street peddlers. Based along Maxwell and Halsted Streets, the gang often stole from local businesses while posing as push cart vendors. The gang developed a method of robbery known as the [...] "kick in" [...] where Merry and six members would pull up to a local store and, with one man staying with <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> and two lookouts outside, Merry {{and the other members}} would <b>kick</b> in <b>the</b> entrance and haul off the stores merchandise onto <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> <b>The</b> gang continued to raid Southside neighborhoods for several years until Merry was hanged for murdering his invalid wife.

50|$|Two {{doors are}} {{located at the}} bottom of <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> Normally these are locked at a 45 degree angle {{downward}} to hold the haylidge inside <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> When <b>the</b> farmer drives over the pile he releases the doors from inside the cab of the tractor to instantly unload <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> This design offers greater safety, less wear from moving parts and most importantly greater efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|The VR {{intended}} to use <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> for [...] "slack coal" [...] traffic (probably loose coal units), between Wonthaggi and Newport Power Station. <b>The</b> <b>wagons</b> {{were found to be}} unsuitable, probably because of the higher water content of Victorian brown coal compared to black (denser) coal in other states; this combined with the rather shallow discharge angles of <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> hoppers resulted in discharge issues.|$|R

50|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> bed is narrow, many {{families}} would construct an “overjet” for additional space. An overjet {{is created by}} nailing boards or planks on top of <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> bed that extend out over the wheels. This would create space to place mattresses for sleeping on either sides of the bed. Additional bows would be inserted to stretch the canvas to cover the overjet and keep the weather out.
