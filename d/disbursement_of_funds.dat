5|$|The {{value to}} the sinecurist of an office like that of Paymaster of Marines lay {{not so much in}} the {{official}} salary attached to it, but in the lax accounting procedures associated with <b>disbursement</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds,</b> which allowed the official to retain large sums of public money in his own hands for many years until accounts were made up. The office of Paymaster General had been reformed in 1783 to avoid these abuses, but these changes had not yet been extended to the Marines during Villiers' tenure.|$|E

It served as an advisory board to the Roosevelt administration on issues facing black people in America. It was composed of numerous talented blacks, mostly men, who had been appointed to positions in federal agencies. This was the first collective of black people working in higher positions in government. It suggested to voters that the Roosevelt administration cared about black concerns. The group gathered in Bethune's office or apartment and met informally, rarely keeping minutes. Although as advisers they did not directly create public policy, they were a respected leadership among black voters; they influenced political appointments and <b>disbursement</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to organizations that would benefit black people.|$|E

The sagas note that aside from the significant spoils of battle he had retained, he had participated three times in polutasvarf (loosely translated as [...] "palace-plunder"), a term which implies either the pillaging of the palace exchequer on the death of the emperor, or perhaps the <b>disbursement</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to the Varangians by the new emperor in order to ensure their loyalty. It is likely that the money Harald made while serving in Constantinople allowed him to fund his claim for the crown of Norway.

Such a program requires continual, extensive and sophisticated information that is rarely available in developing countries, particularly low-income ones.
