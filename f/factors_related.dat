5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms.

5|$|The player {{generally}} has {{to explore the}} dungeon to reveal its contents similar to a fog of war. Many roguelikes include <b>factors</b> <b>related</b> to light sources such as a torch to provide illumination to see monsters in nearby squares, and line of sight can also limit what monsters are visible. Dungeons tend to be connected by stairs; lower dungeon levels generally are more difficult than higher ones, so that a character that is underdeveloped may have difficulty by progressing too fast. Dungeon levels and the population of monsters and treasure within them are generated randomly using procedural generation, so that no game is the same on subsequent playthroughs. Most roguelikes have an ultimate goal of either claiming an item located at the deepest level of the dungeon, or to defeat a specific monster that lives on that level. Typical roguelikes include a scoreboard, ranking the player's performance once their game is over (be it through permadeath or completing the objective) based {{on the amount of}} treasure, money, and experience earned, and how fast the player completed the game in such cases.|$|E

The probabilistic description of discrete choice behavior is used not to reflect individual behavior that is viewed as intrinsically probabilistic.

In practice, we cannot know all factors affecting individual choice decisions as their determinants are partially observed or imperfectly measured. Therefore, discrete choice models rely on stochastic assumptions and specifications to account for unobserved <b>factors</b> <b>related</b> to a) choice alternatives, b) taste variation over people (interpersonal heterogeneity) and over time (intra-individual choice dynamics), and c) heterogeneous choice sets.

25|$|For an {{avalanche}} to occur, {{it is necessary}} that a snowpack have a weak layer (or instability) below a slab of cohesive snow. In practice the formal mechanical and structural <b>factors</b> <b>related</b> to snowpack instability are not directly observable outside of laboratories, thus the more easily observed properties of the snow layers (e.g. penetration resistance, grain size, grain type, temperature) are used as index measurements of the mechanical properties of the snow (e.g. tensile strength, friction coefficients, shear strength, and ductile strength). This results in two principal sources of uncertainty in determining snowpack stability based on snow structure: First, both the factors influencing snow stability and the specific characteristics of the snowpack vary widely within small areas and time scales, resulting in significant difficulty extrapolating point observations of snow layers across different scales of space and time. Second, the relationship between readily observable snowpack characteristics and the snowpack's critical mechanical properties has not been completely developed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Currently, {{there is}} a debate as to whether triple {{negative}} breast carcinoma (TNBC) has a worse prognosis than non-TNBC. Our aim {{was to determine whether}} TNBC is a prognostic factor for survival. Methods We identified 1, 048 Taiwanese breast carcinoma patients, of whom 167 (15. 9 %) had TNBC. Data used for analysis were derived from our cancer registry database for women with breast cancer who were diagnosed between 2002 January and 2006 December. Results In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, tumor subgroup (TNBC vs. non-TNBC) was a prognosis <b>factor</b> <b>related</b> to 5 -year overall survival. In the univariate analysis, tumor subgroup (TNBC vs. non-TNBC) was a significant <b>factor</b> <b>related</b> to 5 -year overall survival, in addition to age, tumor size, lymph node, metastasis, grade, stage, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, and HER 2 overexpression status. In the multivariate analysis, tumor subgroup was not a significant <b>factor</b> <b>related</b> to 5 -year disease-free survival (DFS). In node-positive patients, tumor subgroup was a significant <b>factor</b> <b>related</b> to 5 -year overall survival, in addition to age, tumor size, metastasis, and grade. In node-negative patients, tumor subgroup was not a significant <b>factor</b> <b>related</b> to 5 -year disease-free survival and 5 -year overall survival. Conclusion Our results indicated that TNBC patients in Taiwan have worse 5 -year overall survival than non-TNBC patients. Notably, in node-positive patients, TNBC played a prognostic role in 5 -year overall survival. </p...|$|R
