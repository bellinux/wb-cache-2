40|$|ABSTRACT: Trails are {{a primary}} {{recreation}} resource facility on which recreation activities are performed. They provide safe access to non-roaded areas, support recreational opportunities such as hiking, biking, and wildlife observation, and protect natural resources by concentrating visitor traffic on resistant treads. However, increasing recreational use, coupled with poorly designed and/or maintained trails, {{has led to}} a variety of resource impacts. Trail managers require objective information on trails and their conditions to monitor trends, direct trail maintenance efforts, and evaluate the need for visitor management and resource protection actions. This paper reviews trail impacts and different types of trail assessments, including <b>inventory,</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and condition assessment approaches. Two assessment methods, point sampling and problem assessment, are compared empirically from separate assessments of a 15 -mile segment of the Appalachian Trail in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

40|$|Inventory {{management}} {{is a crucial}} aspect of managing a company successfully. This is even more apparent {{in the case of}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>inventories</b> for production equipment, which impact directly on production equipment efficiency. This is a typical inventory {{management is}}sue for a cement manufacturer that faces the problem of managing its <b>maintenance</b> <b>inventories</b> optimally when certain maintenance items have exceptionally long lead times (100 weeks) and values in excess of R 500 000. An assessment of the cement manufacturer’s approach to managing its <b>maintenance</b> <b>inventories</b> indicated various shortcomings, which have resulted in a significant level of obsolescence. One approach to managing <b>maintenance</b> <b>inventories</b> efficiently is to implement a classification of the inventory items in terms of their criticality to the cement production process. The critical nature of a component could be established through a risk-based approach (minimisation of the risk of production loss) and taking into account the type of maintenance (planned vs unplanned) that the component is required for. A risk-based approach should form the basis of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>inventory</b> management of the cement manufacturer as this would allow the cement manufacturer to utilise other inventory management methods effectively. In addition, it is important to ensure that employees are well versed in the different inventory management approaches utilised and that high levels of integration between departments are pursued...|$|R

In each of these cases, there would be slight variations to the basic inventory calculation formula (Concentration - Density - Volume). In addition to calculating inventories, the BBIM also documents the source of the underlying data and how the calculations were performed. An enhancement is planned for 1 Q 00 to account for wastes transferred between tanks.

30|$|Globalisation {{of complex}} {{industrial}} production processes {{has increased the}} importance of seaports in the global supply chain. Port activity is no longer limited to just cargo handling; logistics service provision in an international context has become a core {{part of the business}} (Wang and Cullinane, 2006). In this situation, the most imperative aspects of logistics performance are logistics costs and reliability of supply chains. Poor logistics facilitation takes a large toll on a country’s competitive advantage, and insights in this respect were conferred by Arvis et al. (2007). In a world of just-in-time production processes, {{it is not only the}} time and cost of delivery of shipments that matters, but also its reliability and predictability. A firm’s hedging costs due to poor reliability and predictability of logistics services can be significantly high in terms of higher <b>inventory</b> <b>maintenance</b> requirements (Arvis et al., 2010). The trade-off between direct freight costs and reliability varies depending on a country’s commodity trade and logistics performance, which can limit the potential of developing countries to diversify from time-insensitive commodities to value-added goods (Arvis et al., 2010). Despite such significance, the impacts of port infrastructure quality and logistics performance on a country’s trade and economy have been largely overlooked in the existing port economics literature.|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{approach}} to model and solve the joint problem of facility location, inventory allocation and capacity investment in a two echelon, single-item, service parts supply chain with stochastic demand. The objective of the decision problem is to minimize the total expected costs associated with (1) opening repair facilities, (2) assigning each field service location to an opened facility, (3) determining capacity levels of the opened repair facilities, and (4) optimizing inventory allocation among the locations. Due {{to the size of}} the problem, computational efficiency is essential. The accuracy of the approximations and effectiveness of the approach are analyzed with two numerical studies. The approach provides optimal results in 90 % of scenarios tested and was within 2 % of optimal when it did not. We explore the impact of capacity utilization, inventory availability, and lead times on the performance of the approach. We show that including tactical considerations jointly with strategic network design resulted in additional cost savings from 3 % to 12 %.

Logistics is one essential administration {{that should be}} made by an organization. The logistic procedures consist of procurement, recording, storage, distribution, maintenance, and elimination. At present, the logistic activities at economics faculty are running quite well. However, based on the studies conducted by many researchers, the logistic impacts require further examination and analysis. The pre-research study based on interviews shows that no logistic staff handles the logistic management. For the time being, the logistic activities are handled by the public utility staffs. Besides, the Standardized Operational Procedures on logistic management are still unclear. This research uses a descriptive-qualitative approach. Data are obtained from informants in the forms of words, measures, and writings. Interview, observation, and documental analysis are techniques used to collect the data.

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) A key {{performance}} indicator of a cement manufacturer is that of its operating equipment efficiencies or OEE. The world-best standard for OEE of cement manufacturers is 85 %, and this figure can only be achieved through very good maintenance practices and programmes combined with exceptional maintenance inventory levels and good maintenance inventory strategies. Maintenance inventory {{can be described as}} spares that support the manufacturing process, but that is not included in the final product. Like all types of <b>inventory,</b> <b>maintenance</b> inventory has a cost associated with carrying the inventory that can be calculated through applying the various carrying cost components associated with inventory. In a cement manufacturer this carrying cost figure can be excessively high {{as a result of the}} slow movement of major spare components that have to be held in inventory due to its critical importance to the manufacturing process. It is also evident that inventory levels in AfriSam are high. This may be due to the fact that management believe the best possible method to minimise the risk of production loss during a breakdown, is to increase maintenance inventory levels with no comparison to the costs associated with carrying the inventory. The chosen research problem is: “AfriSam (Pty) Ltd carries maintenance inventory worth millions of rands with slow movement of high value maintenance inventory sometimes in excess of 3 years. The cost of managing the inventory together with the carrying cost of the inventory has become a key focus point in the business and there is a need to find methods to optimise the inventory. ...|$|E

Logistics, including transportation, <b>inventory</b> <b>maintenance,</b> order processing, purchasing, warehousing, materials handling, packaging, customer service standards, and product scheduling must continuously be developed {{to meet the challenges of}} the market. The globalization, with longer distances to customers and suppliers, and the progressing trend of outsourcing are examples of why the importance of logistics has increased over the last few years. A considerable part of the final product cost is frozen during the early product development phases. In the early phases of the product development process, the cost of making design changes is low compared to making changes later in the product development process. The product development decisions made in the early phases of the product development process have considerable impact on future manufacturing and logistics activities as well. The objective of this research project is to develop a framework supporting the collaboration between the logistics- and the product development process. To do this, it has been essential to analyze which parameters influence the efficiency of the logistics process and the interface between the logistics- and the product development process. Also, to investigate how the logistics department can be integrated earlier in the product development process has been of interest. This has been done through both a theoretical review and also through a number of case studies. The result and conclusion of this project is a framework that gives support for what to focus on, how to collaborate, in which phases collaboration is meaningful, and which persons need to be involved in the different product development phases. Working as the framework suggests will, hopefully, give closer collaboration between the logistics- and the product development process than without this supportive framework.
