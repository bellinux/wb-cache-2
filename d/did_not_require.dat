5|$|After the deicing {{truck was}} repaired, the pilot {{requested}} a second deicing, though {{the flight crew}} did not perform a walkaround of their airplane, and USAir procedures <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> them to do so. Following the second deicing, LaGuardia ground control granted Flight 405 permission to taxi to Runway 13. The flight crew completed the pre-flight checklist during the taxi.|$|E
5|$|Over ten Han-era {{underground}} tombs {{have been}} found, {{many of them}} featuring archways, vaulted chambers, and domed roofs. Underground vaults and domes <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> buttress supports since they were {{held in place by}} earthen pits. The use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown.|$|E

50|$|A {{generalization}} of semirings <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> {{the existence of}} a multiplicative identity, so that multiplication is a semigroup rather than a monoid. Such structures are called hemirings or pre-semirings. A further generalization are left-pre-semirings, which additionally <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> right-distributivity (or right-pre-semirings, which <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> left-distributivity).|$|R

5|$|The Constitution of May 3 {{specified}} that the deputies were elected for two years, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> reelection {{in that period}} if any extraordinary sejms were to be called. Senators {{for the most part}} were selected by the king from a number of candidates presented by the sejmiks.|$|E
5|$|The PC game {{featured}} a non-linear plot, non-player characters that each ran {{in their own}} independent AI, and an unusual pseudo-3D engine (which eschewed polygonal solids in favor of voxel elements) that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> {{the use of a}} 3D accelerator card to play the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{authorized}} {{loudspeaker enclosure}} {{to use with}} a console organ was the Hammond Tone Cabinet, which housed an external amplifier and speaker in a cabinet. The cabinet carried a balanced mono signal along with the necessary mains power directly from the organ, using a six-pin cable. Spinet organs contained a built-in power amplifier and loudspeakers, so <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a tone cabinet.|$|E

50|$|Passive {{treatment}} {{systems are}} a valuable option for treating acid mine drainage at remote locations. The advantages of passive treatment systems {{are that they}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> electrical power; <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> any mechanical equipment, hazardous chemicals, or buildings; <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> daily operation and maintenance; are more natural and aesthetic in their appearance and may support plants and wildlife; and, are less expensive than active alternatives.|$|R
5|$|Within the UK, {{the most}} common {{variation}} is to use lamb instead of mutton. Gloucester Squab pie <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> lamb and suggests any leftover meat could be used. Other ingredients can be included, for example Agatha Christie produced a variant which included hard-boiled eggs and another recipe took the concept of serving with clotted cream and adds cream to thicken.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Misch {{received}} a call-up notice for military service. In Offenberg, {{he joined the}} SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT), the predecessor to the Waffen-SS, instead of the German Army as the SS-VT <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> Reichsarbeitsdienst (National Labour Service) time. Along with eleven others, he was selected for Hitler's personal bodyguard unit, the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). In August 1939, {{he was promoted to}} the rank of SS-Rottenführer.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 1999, a month {{following}} the draft, Henrik and Daniel signed three-year {{contracts with the}} Canucks. As the contract <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> them to begin playing in Vancouver immediately, they announced on 12 August they would return to Sweden to play one more season with Modo. During the 1999–2000 season, Henrik led Modo in scoring with 47points in 50games, two points ahead of Daniel. The two brothers played on a line with New York Islanders prospect Mattias Weinhandl.|$|E

25|$|BiFC <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> {{specialised}} equipment, as visualisation {{is possible}} with an inverted fluorescence microscope that can detect fluorescence in cells. In addition, analysis <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> complex data processing or correction for {{other sources of}} fluorescence.|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of ADAP method is the simplicity. It {{can be adapted}} to such a cheap equipment as, for example, SlipChip. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> complex and expensive equipment, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> working with hazardous radioactive reagents.|$|R
5|$|The Senate Ethics Committee did not pursue, {{for lack}} of jurisdiction, any {{possible}} ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain was in the House. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said that it too lacked jurisdiction, because McCain {{was no longer in}} the House. It said it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> that McCain amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his House years, on the grounds that McCain had now fully reimbursed Keating's company.|$|E
5|$|The {{change to}} Best in Show was {{considered}} by the press to be of little significance and was not promoted by Charles Cruft, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a dog to have won its Best of Breed class until 1936. It did however remove restrictions on entry, which remained until the mid-1960s when entry to Crufts was restricted to dogs who had already become a champion by gaining championship points at other dog shows.|$|E
5|$|The {{war was a}} {{transformative}} {{experience for}} Truman that brought out his leadership qualities. He had entered the service in 1917 as a family farmer who had worked in clerical jobs that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> the ability to motivate and direct others, but during the war he gained leadership experience and a record of success that greatly enhanced and supported his post-war political career in Missouri.|$|E
25|$|ERISA <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> {{employers}} to establish pension plans.

5|$|A recent phenomenon, the {{migration}} of rural Chinese workers began in 1984 when the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration became less punitive and allowed people to move to find employment. People left rural areas to escape poverty, and females left {{due to the lack}} of local opportunities for women. In the cities, women could find new, low-paid factory-based jobs that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> highly skilled workers. According to national statistics, the ratio of male to female migrant workers averages 2:1, and an estimated 30-40 million of the migrant women work in the cities, namely Hong Kong and Shenzhen.|$|E
5|$|A secret {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} M. W. Kellogg for engineering studies in July 1941. This included the design and construction of a ten-stage pilot gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December 1942, the Manhattan District contracted Kellogg to design, build and operate a full-scale production plant. Unusually, the contract <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> any guarantees from Kellogg that it could actually accomplish this task. Because {{the scope of the}} project was not well defined, Kellogg and the Manhattan District agreed to defer any financial details to a later, cost-plus contract, which was executed in April 1944. Kellogg was then paid $2.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Although {{commerce}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> them, pennies {{bearing the}} likeness of Elizabeth II were minted in 1953 in sets sold to the public, using an obverse design by Mary Gillick. One 1954 penny was struck, for internal Mint purposes. By 1961, new pennies were needed again for circulation, and were produced in large numbers. The officials who planned decimalisation in the 1960s did not favour keeping the large bronze penny, whose value had been eroded by inflation. The last for circulation were dated 1967—a final proof set was dated 1970. The old penny quickly went out of use after Decimal Day, 15 February 1971, and was demonetised on 31 August of that year.|$|E

5|$|Bloodless {{heart surgery}} was pioneered by American surgeon Denton Cooley. It was also {{performed}} by doctor Jerome Kay in Los Angeles and the procedure soon {{spread around the}} world. Panday, who trained under the Canadian surgeon Wilfred Gordon Bigelow, adopted the technique and tailored it to Indian conditions. He performed bloodless open heart surgeries at KEM in the 1970s and 1980s. Bloodless heart surgery was cost-effective in India, as it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> blood transfusions, reduced the chances of infection in case of infected blood, and further reduced postoperative costs. Bloodless heart surgery was also performed on Jehovah's Witnesses, as they refused donated blood.|$|E
5|$|Drusus {{had little}} time to mourn or {{celebrate}} {{the death of his}} grandfather or the ascendance of Tiberius: the legions in the Rhine and Illyricum were in mutiny. They had not received the bonuses promised to them by Augustus, and when it became clear a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. On 17 or 18 September, Drusus was sent to deal with the troops in Illyricum, and a delegation was sent to confer proconsular imperium maius upon Germanicus, who dealt with the situation on the Rhine. Drusus <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> proconsular powers because he was consul designate.|$|E
5|$|During the Sarajevo Crisis in 1914, German diplomats offered Turkey an anti-Russian {{alliance}} and territorial gains in Caucasia, north-west Iran and Trans-Caspia. The pro-British faction {{in the cabinet}} was isolated due to the British ambassador taking leave until 18 August. As the crisis deepened in Europe, Ottoman policy was to obtain a guarantee of territorial integrity and potential advantages, unaware that the British might enter a European war. On 30 July 1914, {{two days after the}} outbreak of the war in Europe, the Ottoman leaders agreed to form a secret Ottoman-German Alliance against Russia, although it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> them to undertake military action.|$|E
