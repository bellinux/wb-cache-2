50|$|<b>Floor</b> <b>marking</b> {{tapes are}} {{adhesive}} tapes used to mark hazards, divide spaces, create aisles, or provide directions.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} <b>floor</b> <b>marking</b> on the positioning of surgical devices within the clean air flow in an operating room (OR) to minimise infection risk. Laminar flow clean air systems are important in preventing infection in ORs but, for optimal results, surgical devices must be correctly positioned. The authors evaluated <b>floor</b> <b>marking</b> in four ORs at an eye hospital using time series analysis. Through observations during 829 surgeries over a 20 -month period, the positions of surgical devices were determined. Eight semistructured interviews with surgical staff were conducted to assess user experiences and team dynamics. Before marking, the instrument table was positioned completely within the laminar flow in only 6. 1 % of the cases. This increased to 36. 1 % and finally 53. 8 %. Mayo stands were increasingly positioned within the laminar flow: from 74. 2 % to 84. 7 %. The surgical lamp decreasingly obstructed flow: from 41. 8 % to 28. 7 %. At T 3 (20 months), however, in 48. 6 % of the applicable cases the lamp was positioned in the flow again. Discussions and site visits between airside operators and surgical staff resulted in increasing awareness of specific risk areas in the OR. OR floor markings facilitated and stimulated safety awareness and resulted in significantly increased compliance with the positioning of surgical devices in the clean air flow. Safety and quality approaches in hospital care, therefore, should include a human factors approach that focuses on system design in addition to teaching clinical and non-technical skill...|$|E

This has always been a operose task that could be simplified a lot. We will use a Leica Total Station, a long range tracking device, as main source of localisation together with a Pioneer P 3 -DX differential drive robot. The use of these highly accurate laser measurements impose some limits that are to be found and analysed. In the end, a state estimator will be built, fusing odometry information with laser information. These location estimates can then be used to control the robot and therefore the positioning of the markings. i i...|$|E
40|$|The {{control and}} shaping of {{pedestrian}} movement recurs as {{an aspect of}} security planning for crowded spaces. Using the concepts of triangulation, performance and flow, this paper presents a series of experiments designed to shape pedestrian movement patterns in public spaces in different spatial and operation contexts, by eliciting noticeable behaviours and disrupting routine use of space. The hypothesis investigated is that playful, non-obstructive interventions foster a positive social experience yet {{can be used to}} shape pedestrian movement. The interventions examined were around the themes of <b>floor</b> <b>marking</b> and mirrors. Analysis demonstrated that the interventions were able to create zones of attraction and exclusion, engage people’s curiosity and elicit playful actions. Habituation, goal-directed behaviour and the influence of increased cognitive load at personal level were all important factors responsible for reducing the level of engagement with an intervention. The results suggest that increased understanding between environmental and interpersonal stimuli and behavioural responses can provide guidance in using socially acceptable design interventions to influence use of space in different operational contexts, contributing to sustainable security...|$|E

The solo performer runs {{from one to the}} next in alphabetical order while telling stories of leaving her home. She continues to tell stories and give statistics from her native land, and her new chosen home.

She maps out some of the places she would like to visit, see and explore, before ending with a statement of planning {{one or more of these}} possible journeys. The critical commentary or reflection discusses three different areas or themes employed in the performance ?RUN FOR YOUR LIFE?, departures, maps and autobiography. It will look at the role of the travelling artist in society. What they can offer to the people they meet and the places they travel through. It will also discuss how this performance was brought further with a trip to Barcelona. The performer stated that she would take this trip at the end of the performance. In the section on maps, the choice and construction of the map used in the performance will be discussed. It will also explore the different types of maps that were employed, maps that go beyond what conventional cartography can express or represent. The final section on autobiography considers how the phrase at the end of the performance (stating that the performer will leave on a given date) is viewed by the audience.
