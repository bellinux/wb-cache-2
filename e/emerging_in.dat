5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis females {{lay their}} eggs on Lundy cabbage leaf stalks. The white larvae are leaf miners, digging into the {{petioles}} and stems. After <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> late summer, they pupate in soil.|$|E
5|$|After informally {{managing}} {{and promoting}} the New York Dolls {{for a few}} months, McLaren returned to London in May 1975. Inspired by the punk scene that was <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> Lower Manhattan—in particular by the radical visual style and attitude of Richard Hell, then with Television—McLaren began taking a greater interest in the Strand.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{migration}} was likewise {{instrumental in}} the development of the new domains <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> former royal lands. The new landholders granted personal freedom and more favorable financial conditions to those who arrived in their estates, which also enabled the peasants who decided not to move to improve their position. BélaIV granted privileges to more than a dozen towns, including Nagyszombat (Trnava, Slovakia) and Pest.|$|E

50|$|Stylops melittae can <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> two generations, {{but most}} <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> just one generation, so that stylops-infested sand bees are {{encountered}} mostly {{just in the}} early months of the year March through May.|$|R
50|$|Adults overwinter {{and appear}} in early spring. The larvae feed on figs. They are {{protected}} by a web of silken threads. Adults of the summer generation <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> July. The second generation <b>emerges</b> <b>in</b> autumn and hibernate.|$|R
5|$|Many of the North American {{species are}} in the genus Neotibicen: the annual or jar fly or dog-day cicadas (so named because they emerge in late July and August). The best-known North American genus, however, is Magicicada. These {{periodical}} cicadas have an extremely long life cycle of 13 or 17 years, suddenly and briefly <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb fly Merodon equestris, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the gradual}} {{disintegration}} of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary in the 16thcentury, the last voivodes of Transylvania, who came from the Báthory family, ceased to be high-ranking officials. Instead they were the heads of state, although under Ottoman suzerainty, of a new principality <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> the eastern territories of the kingdom. Accordingly, Stephen Báthory, the voivode elected by the Diet of the new realm, officially abandoned the title of voivode and adopted that of prince in 1576, upon his election as King of Poland.|$|E

5|$|Blyton's work became {{increasingly}} controversial among literary critics, {{teachers and parents}} from the 1950s onwards, because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books, particularly the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit. Her books have been criticised as being elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic and {{at odds with the}} more liberal environment <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968.|$|E
5|$|By 1977, {{a second}} wave of the punk rock {{movement}} was breaking in the three countries where it had emerged, {{as well as in}} many other places. Bands from the same scenes often sounded very different from each other, reflecting the eclectic state of punk music during the era. While punk rock remained largely an underground phenomenon in North America, Australia, and the new spots where it was <b>emerging,</b> <b>in</b> the UK it briefly became a major sensation.|$|E
5|$|By June 1999 and in {{the midst}} of their investigation, the {{university}} had negotiated a buyout of the remainder of Haskins' contract, worth $1.5 million over three years. It also withdrew from postseason consideration in the 1999–2000 season and docked itself 11 scholarships over four years. In the summer of 2000, Haskins came forward and admitted that he had paid Gangelhoff $3,000 for her services; this revelation came to light after Haskins turned his financial records over to the NCAA. In addition, more details were <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> which Haskins was also accused of mail fraud in an incident regarding a recruit's transcript, giving players cash, dismissing sexual harassment concerns against his players, as well as his staff trying to persuade professors to give his players inflated grades they had not earned.|$|E
50|$|Around the 7th {{century the}} Kabara Nation {{under the control}} of the Kabara's <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> Northern Nigeria. Around the 9th century an {{upheaval}} of unexplained origins saw a transference of power from these matriarchal monarchs and a new set of nations <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> their place.|$|R
50|$|In Palearctic regions, D. adulterina parasitizes D. saxonica. In mid-May or just beforehand, colonies initiate. The {{first set}} of workers <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> early June and begin working on large-cells mid-June. Queens will <b>emerge</b> <b>in</b> early July and the colony {{continues}} until just after mid-August.|$|R
50|$|The plaza <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> 1559 and was {{originally}} called Plaza Nueva (New Square). It was {{built as a}} popular alternative to Plaza de Armas, the military and government main center, the name changed when another important square <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> town, the Plaza del Santo Cristo.|$|R
5|$|Dengue {{can also}} be {{transmitted}} via infected blood products and through organ donation. In countries such as Singapore, where dengue is endemic, the risk {{is estimated to be}} between 1.6 and 6 per 10,000 transfusions. Vertical transmission (from mother to child) during pregnancy or at birth has been reported. Other person-to-person modes of transmission have also been reported, but are very unusual. The genetic variation in dengue viruses is region specific, suggestive that establishment into new territories is relatively infrequent, despite dengue <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> new regions in recent decades.|$|E
5|$|<b>Emerging</b> <b>in</b> {{the mid-1980s}} with such bands as California's Saint Vitus, Maryland's The Obsessed, Chicago's Trouble, and Sweden's Candlemass, the doom metal {{movement}} rejected other metal styles' emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl. Doom metal traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical approach of early Black Sabbath. The Melvins {{have also been}} a significant influence on doom metal {{and a number of}} its subgenres. Doom emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos, and a sepulchral mood relative to many other varieties of metal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms to fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit. The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus {{into the ranks of}} the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. A new culture of dependency was <b>emerging,</b> <b>in</b> which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5000|$|Periodical cicadas {{are grouped}} into [...] {{based on the}} {{calendar}} year when they emerge (see chart below and maps on www.magicicada.org). For example, in 2014, the 13-year brood XXII <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> Louisiana and the 17-year brood III <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> western Illinois and eastern Iowa.|$|R

First brood adults will fly from mid-May until late June, second brood adults will fly from early July until late August, and occasionally a partial third brood will occur that will <b>emerge</b> later <b>in</b> the season.|$|R
5|$|Integrated {{education}} {{models are}} <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> the academic world, a model which {{is referred to}} as T-shape and π-shaped education. T-shaped professionals are taught general knowledge in a few disciplines (e.g. management and engineering) and specific, deep knowledge in a single domain (e.g. design). This model also applies to companies, when they shift their focus from small T innovations (innovations involving only one discipline, like chemists) to big T innovations (innovations involving several disciplines, like design, ethnography, lead user, etc.). Like in education, this shift makes breaking down silos of departments and disciplines of knowledge essential.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{started from}} the pole {{position}} and held off a challenge from Häkkinen {{on the first}} lap. He maintained the lead until his first pit stop on lap 24 when a refuller was struck by his rear tyre, allowing Häkkinen {{to take over the}} lead until his pit stop two laps later. Michael Schumacher kept the lead for a further twenty-one laps as he and Häkkinen made their second pit stops together, with Häkkinen <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> front because Schumacher experienced a slow pit stop. Häkkinen kept the lead for the remaining twenty-three laps to win the race.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki {{was born}} at a period when Japan was {{becoming}} more isolated, after missions to China had ended and a stronger national culture was <b>emerging.</b> <b>In</b> the 9th and 10th centuries, Japanese gradually became a written language {{through the development of}} kana, a syllabary based on abbreviations of Chinese characters. In Murasaki's lifetime men continued to write in Chinese, the language of government, but kana became the written language of noblewomen, setting the foundation for unique forms of Japanese literature.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concepts}} of [...] "science" [...] and [...] "religion" [...] are a recent invention: [...] "religion" [...] <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the 17th {{century in the}} midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation, [...] "science" [...] <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century {{in the midst of}} attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature, and the phrase [...] "religion and science" [...] <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century due to the reification of both concepts. It was in the 19th century that the terms [...] "Buddhism", [...] "Hinduism", [...] "Taoism", and [...] "Confucianism" [...] first <b>emerged.</b> <b>In</b> the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (scientia) and religion (religio) were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.|$|R
5|$|While these {{specific}} failings {{came back to}} haunt the Empire in subsequent decades, perhaps the greatest weakness of the Peace of Augsburg was its failure {{to take into account}} the growing diversity of religious expression <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> the evangelical (Lutheran) and Reformed traditions. Other confessions had acquired popular, if not legal, legitimacy in the intervening decades and by 1555, the reforms proposed by Luther were no longer the only possibilities of religious expression: Anabaptists, such as the Frisian Menno Simons (1492–1559) and his followers; the followers of John Calvin, who were particularly strong in the southwest and the northwest; and the followers of Huldrych Zwingli were excluded from considerations and protections under the Peace of Augsburg. According to the Augsburg agreement, their religious beliefs remained heretical.|$|E
5|$|Although Golos Truda sharply {{criticized the}} anarchist communists of Petrograd as romantics, {{ignorant of the}} complex social forces of the Revolution among Petrograd's Bolshevik-supporting factory workers, {{the ideas of the}} union and its paper were {{considered}} bizarre and met with little initial success. Despite this, the anarcho-syndicalist union persisted and gradually acquired a degree of influence, focusing its efforts through propaganda in Golos Truda, with the intent of capturing the attention of the public with its ideals and by differentiating itself from the other radical factions. The paper's circulation continuing to increase in the city and its provinces, with robust anarcho-syndicalist collectives and meetings <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> Kronstadt, Oboukhovo, and Kolpino. In March 1918, the Bolsheviks moved the seat of government from Petrograd to Moscow, and the anarchists swiftly followed, moving the printing of Golos Truda to the new capital.|$|E
5|$|First <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> New York City in 2011, the Occupy {{movement}} was an international protest movement against {{social and economic}} inequality, its primary goal being to make the economic structure and power relations in society more favorable to the underclasses. Different local groups have different foci, but among the prime concerns is the claim that large corporations and the global financial system control {{the world in a}} way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy and is unstable. It was widely seen as a reaction to the 2008–2012 global recession, an economic crisis that had led to high unemployment across the western world, and was also inspired by the Arab Spring, in which popular protest movements overthrew the governments of several countries in the Arab world. Chomsky became a supporter for the Occupy movement, joining protesters at some of their camps and advocating their cause in the mainstream press.|$|E
