5000|$|Having sent {{samples for}} {{forensic}} analysis, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) {{found evidence that}} the Disappearing Positive Methodology was in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi. On 7 August 2016, the IPC's Governing Board voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, citing the Russian Paralympic Committee's (RPC) inability to enforce the IPC's Anti-Doping Code and the World Anti-Doping Code, which is [...] "a fundamental constitutional requirement". IPC President Sir Philip Craven described the Russian anti-doping system as [...] "entirely compromised" [...] and 18 July 2016 as [...] "one of the darkest days {{in the history of}} all sport", and stated that the Russian government had [...] "catastrophically failed its Para athletes". IPC Athletes' Council Chairperson Todd Nicholson said that Russia had used athletes as [...] "pawns" [...] in order to [...] "show global prowess". On 23 August 2016, the Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed Russia's appeal, stating that the IPC's decision was [...] "made in accordance with the IPC Rules and was proportionate in the circumstances" [...] and that Russia [...] "did not file any evidence contradicting the facts on which the IPC decision was based." [...] The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland rejected another appeal by Russia, saying that the RPC [...] "needed to demonstrate it had fulfilled its obligations in upholding... anti-doping protocols, and that its interests in an immediate lifting of its suspension outweigh the <b>International</b> <b>Paralympics</b> <b>Committee's</b> interests in fighting doping and in the integrity of athletics. It did not succeed in this in any way." [...] Rejecting an appeal by ten athletes, a German court stated that the IPC had no obligation to allow them to compete and that the committee had [...] "comprehensibly justified" [...] its decision.|$|R

Accordingly, in Term 1, 1999, the first 76 girls commenced in the Senior College. St Andrew's became the only co-educational school in the City.In 1999, the School's Student Business Club formed a working partnership with the Sydney 2000 <b>Paralympics</b> Organising <b>Committee</b> (SPOC) to raise awareness of the Games.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} whether there was a relative quality effect for key performance indicators (KPI) in goalball. The study was completed from a performance analysis perspective and analysis was completed on two major <b>international</b> goalball tournaments (<b>Paralympics</b> 2012, European A 2013) and three IBSA qualifying events (Hungary 2013, Venice 2014, Malmo 2014). A regression-based analysis described by O’Donoghue & Cullinane (2011) was used to identify whether there was a relative quality (RQ) effect between KPI in goalball. Results showed that there was a low correlation between RQ and KPI in goalball. Although weak positive correlation was observed, a repeated measures anova showed trends for shots to pockets (F= 3. 280, p= 0. 053) and speed of shot (F= 4. 048, p< 0. 05), with a weak negative correlation for smooth shots (F= 5. 598, p< 0. 05). Thus, suggesting that teams of higher RQ score more goals, through faster more accurate shots. The regression was used to present a case study from one match between Russia and GB (RQ of + 1. 12, - 1. 12 respectively). The team with higher RQ performed well in desirable aspects of performance, exceeding the performance of 81. 30 % for speed of shot, 94. 36 % shots to pockets and 70. 63 % bounce shots of performances with that RQ. Despite the low correlation between RQ effect and KPI in goalball the regression-based analysis was shown to have an applied application, although caution would be expressed due to the variation experienced in the upper and lower estimates of the prediction equation...|$|R
