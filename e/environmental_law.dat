5|$|From 1981 {{until his}} {{retirement}} in 2003, Miskovsky worked for Kirkland & Ellis, where he specialized in <b>environmental</b> <b>law.</b> In 1989, Miskovsky helped establish the Archdiocesan Legal Network, a free legal clinic run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington. The clinic aided people with non-criminal legal issues such as bankruptcy, evictions, suspended licenses or delayed social security checks. Miskovsky was originally tasked with recruiting other lawyers for the clinic, but was eventually promoted to chairmen of the clinic's board.|$|E

Schulich School of Law also operates the Marine & <b>Environmental</b> <b>Law</b> Institute, which carries out research and conducts consultancy activities for governmental and non-governmental organizations. The school's Department of Political Science similarly operates the Centre for Foreign Policy Studies, which is primarily concerned with the fields of Canadian and American foreign, security, and defence policy, including maritime security policy.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear {{power and}} fossil fuels are subsidized by many governments, and wind power {{and other forms}} of {{renewable}} energy are also often subsidized. For example, a 2009 study by the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Law</b> Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002–2008 period. The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74billion for energy subsidies to support R for nuclear power ($50 billion) and fossil fuels ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same time frame, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US$26billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help {{to level the playing field}} and support growing energy sectors, namely solar power, wind power, and biofuels. History shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} has five libraries. The largest, Killam Memorial Library, opened in 1971. It {{is the largest}} academic library in Atlantic Canada with over one million books and 40,000 journals. The library's collection largely serves the faculties of arts and social sciences, sciences, management, and computer science. The W. K. Kellogg Health Science Library provides services largely for the faculties of dentistry, medicine, and other health professions. The Sexton Design & Technology Library is located within Sexton Campus. Its collection largely serves those in the faculties of engineering, architecture and planning, and houses the university's rare books collection. The Sir James Dunn Law Library holds the university's collection of common law materials, legal periodicals, as well as books on international law, health law, and <b>environmental</b> <b>law.</b> MacRae Library {{is located at the}} university's Agricultural Campus, and has the largest collection of agricultural resource material in Atlantic Canada. The Dalhousie University Archives houses official records of, or relating to, or people/activities connected with Dalhousie University and its founding institutions. The archives also houses material related to theatre, business and labour in Nova Scotia. The collection consists of manuscripts, texts, photographs, audio-visual material, microfilm, music, and artifacts.|$|E

25|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>law</b> has {{developed}} {{in response to}} emerging awareness of and concern over issues impacting the entire world.

The principles discussed below are not an exhaustive list and are not universally recognized or accepted. Nonetheless, they represent important principles for the understanding of <b>environmental</b> <b>law</b> around the world.|$|E

40|$|Nigeria as {{a country}} is blessed with an {{abundance}} of both human and natural resources. Exploitation of natural resources in Nigeria over the years with little or no regard for the environment has increased susceptibility of parts of the country to identified geohazards. A suite of <b>environmental</b> <b>laws</b> exist in Nigeria, all these aimed at protecting both the environment and its inhabitants. The aim {{of this paper is to}} review existing <b>environmental</b> <b>laws</b> in Nigeria, and occurrence of identified geohazards as a result of absence or non-implementation of these laws. Data for this study were obtained primarily from secondary sources. They are published government reports, journal articles, books, as well as other resources on the environment of Nigeria. Results show that Nigeria {{as a country}} has suitable existing and well-meaning <b>environmental</b> <b>laws.</b> The country also has many agencies charged with the responsibilities of implementing these <b>environmental</b> <b>laws</b> and policies. However, the non-implementation and non-existence of identified <b>environmental</b> <b>laws</b> and policies has increased both exposure and vulnerability of parts of the country to geohazards. The effects of these include; loss of means of livelihood, environmental degradation leading to Badlands in parts of the country, as well as death in extreme cases. It is recommended in this paper that adherence to existing <b>environmental</b> <b>laws</b> and policies as a panacea to mitigating identified geohzards is important. It is further recommended that amendment of already existing <b>environmental</b> <b>laws</b> to capture contemporary realities be made. This paper concluded by calling for more investment in the use of remote sensing and GIS tools such as LiDAR technology in the study of geohazards...|$|R

While there are few and they have limited authority, the decisions carry much weight with legal commentators and are quite influential {{on the development of}} international <b>environmental</b> <b>law.</b> One of the biggest challenges in international decisions is to determine an adequate compensation for environmental damages. The courts include the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the international Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), the European Court of Justice, European Court of Human Rights and other regional treaty tribunals.|$|E
50|$|The {{effective}} {{enforcement of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>laws</b> {{is vital to}} any protection regimes {{that are designed to}} protect the environment. In the early days of environmental legislation, violations carried largely insignificant civil fines and penalties. Initial <b>environmental</b> <b>laws</b> and regulations had little or no deterrent effect on corporations, individuals, or governments to comply with <b>environmental</b> <b>laws.</b> Indeed, a major source of failure of US environmental protection legislation was the civil character of federal enforcement actions. Their chief sanction was fines, which many corporations took in stride as a cost of doing business. <b>Environmental</b> criminal <b>law</b> covers narrower ground. Its core consists of the criminal provisions of eight federal statutes passed mainly in the 1970s and amended in the last two decades.|$|R
