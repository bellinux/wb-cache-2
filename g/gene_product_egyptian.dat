40|$|AbstractWe are {{reporting}} a molecular comparative analysis of component 1 BBTV-DNA-R of an Egyptian isolate of (BBTV) and 30 different geographical isolates. DNA was extracted from BBTV-infected adult banana aphids collected from El-Qalubia Governorate, Egypt. Using specific primers the BBTV-DNA-R was amplified, cloned into a prokaryote vector, sequenced and a molecular comparative analysis of BBTV-DNA-R {{of this study}} and some overseas isolates of BBTV-infected banana plants was determined. Results showed that the component 1 consists of 1108 nts and contains a sequence of 69 nts representing the CR-SL of 31 nts. A CR-M (90 nts) at the position (972 – 1062) characterized with GC-rich sequence from nts 76 to 90 (average of 80 % G+C) was found. Alignment results of BBTV DNA-R confirmed {{the presence of a}} number of conserved regions in all isolates. Large ORF of 861 nts at position 102 to 962 in the virion sense were detected. The predicted protein of this ORF consisted of 286 amino acids and had a molecular weight of 33. 8 kDa. The DNA-phylogenetic analysis showed a percent identity of 98. 0 and 97. 9 between BBTV DNA-R and isolates of Pakistan (isolate TJ 1) and Australia (isolate V 1), respectively. The similarities between the <b>gene</b> <b>product</b> of <b>Egyptian</b> BBTV DNA-R and the 30 overseas isolates ranged from 93. 7 to 99. 0 %. Differences in phylogenetic trees based on the entire sequence of BBTV DNA-R, CR-M and amino acid sequences confirmed the existence of two taxonomic groups of BBTV and the Egyptian isolate belongs to the south pacific group...|$|R

Results Expression of nm 23 -H 1 <b>gene</b> <b>product</b> was present in 17 (37. 8 %) cases. We found an inverse correlation between nm 23 -H 1 <b>gene</b> <b>product</b> expression and lymphatic vessel invasion, whereas no correlation between nm 23 -H 1 <b>gene</b> <b>product</b> expression and blood vessel invasion. Overall survival rate was not different between nm 23 -H 1 <b>gene</b> <b>product</b> positive and negative patients (p = 0. 21).

In this study, we observed that oncogenic Ras mutant induced the expression of ST 2 and ST 2 L proteins.

Furthermore, when the expression of ST 2 <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> was silenced by RNA-interference technique, Ras (G 12 V) -induced cellular transformation was drastically suppressed. According to these observations, it was indicated that the oncogenic Ras-induced expression of ST 2 <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> {{is required for the}} acceleration of cellular transformation, and this seems to be independent of the stimulation with IL- 33, a ligand for ST 2 /ST 2 L.

The effects of the two vaccinia virus <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> were compared in an in vivo system in which translation of a reporter gene (dihydrofolate reductase or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha [eIF- 2 alpha]) was inhibited because of the localized activation of PKR. In this system, the E 3 L <b>gene</b> <b>product,</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} the K 3 L <b>gene</b> <b>product,</b> potentiated translation of the reporter gene and inhibited eIF- 2 alpha phosphorylation.

A major challenge for knowledge discovery using these databases is to identify related <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> in disparate databases. The development of Gene Ontology (GO) as a common vocabulary for annotation allows integrated queries across multiple databases and identification of semantically related <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> (i. e., <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> that have similar GO annotations).

Tools that allow users to directly search and inspect relations among all GO terms and their associated <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> from multiple databases are needed. Results We present a standalone package called DynGO, which provides several advanced functionalities in addition to the standard browsing capability of the official GO browsing tool (AmiGO). DynGO allows users to conduct batch retrieval of GO annotations for a list of <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products,</b> and semantic retrieval of <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> sharing similar GO annotations. The result are shown in an association tree organized according to GO hierarchies and supported with many dynamic display options such as sorting tree nodes or changing orientation of the tree.

Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that several of these membrane-anchored <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> are transported to the cell surface. Removal of the N-linked glycosylation site from the v-sis <b>gene</b> <b>product</b> did not prevent cell surface transport. Several of these mutant genes are able to induce focus formation in NIH 3 T 3 cells, providing further evidence that the membrane- anchored proteins are properly folded. These results demonstrate that N- linked glycosylation is not required for the cell surface transport of a protein that is in a native, biologically active conformation. These results provide a correlation between cell surface expression of the membrane-anchored v-sis <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> and transformation...|$|R
50|$|Cells {{in which}} {{transcription}} has been amplified have additional suggestive hallmarks that amplification has occurred. Cells with increased mRNA levels may be larger, consistent {{with an increased}} abundance of <b>gene</b> <b>products.</b> This increase {{in the amount of}} <b>gene</b> <b>product</b> may result in a decreased doubling time.|$|R
40|$|The Gene Ontology project ([URL] {{produces}} structured, controlled vocabularies and <b>gene</b> <b>product</b> annotations. <b>Gene</b> <b>products</b> {{are classified}} {{according to the}} cellular locations and biological process in which they act, and the molecular functions that they carry out. We annotate <b>gene</b> <b>products</b> from {{a broad range of}} model species and provide support for those groups that wish to contribute annotation of further model species. The Gene Ontology facilitates the exchange of information between groups of scientists studying similar processes in different model organisms, and so provides a broad range of opportunities for plant scientists...|$|R
