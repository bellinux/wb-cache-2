40|$|We {{studied the}} changes in major {{elements}} and organic carbon concentrations during the initial stage of the mixing of the black (Rio Negro) and the White (Rio Solimoes) waters in the Amazon River basin to understand the geochemical processes that could control the redistribution between particulate and dissolved fractions. Water samples were collected at six stations including the Rio Negro and the Rio Solimoes and four stations downstream from the confluence. The relative contributions of the two tributaries were determined using a triple tracer approach (delta(18) O, deltaD, Cl-). Particulate (> 0. 2 mum) and dissolved (< 0. 2 mum) concentrations of major elements (Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, Si) and organic carbon (POC and DOC) were measured. Major elements in the particulate fraction {{were found to have}} a nonconservative behaviour in the initial stage of the mixing due to mineral removal. In the dissolved fraction, only the DOC, Fe, and Mn behaved nonconservatively. The Fe losses could be due to preferential removal of Fe bound to N-rich organic matter (OM) and/or to preferential removal of Fe oxyhydroxides. The increasing dissolved manganese content in the dissolved phase is explained by a reductive dissolution of manganese oxides due to massive inputs of phenolic-rich OM from the Rio Negro. The amount of <b>DOC</b> <b>removed</b> from the water column in the initial stage of the mixing would represent 4 % of the total annual DOC flux of the Amazon River at the reference gauging station of Obidos...|$|E
40|$|A {{national}} conference held {{in association with}} the International Humic Substances Society and the Natural Organic Matter Interest Group. The impacts of gypsum application to pasture on the concentration and character of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and on the inorganic profile of surface and subsurface water were investigated in the Mount Lofty Ranges of South Australia. Two adjacent sub-catchments of the Mount Bold reservoir were selected for study, where gypsum was applied at a rate of 15, 000 kg ha− 1 to one and the other left untreated, as a control. Gypsum amendment led to reductions in DOC concentrations in surface and subsurface flows of about 50 %, significant increases in aqueous Ca, Mg, Mn and Na and lower concentrations of other metals (Al, Fe) due to Ca 2 + exchange. Natural organic matter (NOM) in water from the gypsum-treated site was found to have a lower relative aromaticity compared with the control. Alum treatment of control and gypsum-treated waters by a jar test procedure led to 73 % and 48 % removal of DOC, respectively, resulting in similar residual concentrations. This indicates that <b>DOC</b> <b>removed</b> by traditional alum treatment of drinking water supplies is also susceptible to in situ gypsum treatment, probably via a similar metal-catalysed aggregation mechanism. We conclude that gypsum application to soils of medium to heavy texture has potential to enhance their capacity to bind NOM, thereby lowering DOC concentrations in surface and subsurface flows.

40|$|Background and Aim: Nowadays, {{regarding}} the increased human and geological activities, concentrations of toxic and carcinogenic disinfectant by-products– like Trihalomethanes -which have an organic base, {{in drinking water}} sources, has worryingly increased. Thus, the present study aimed at surveying the amount of dissolved organic carbon (<b>doc)</b> <b>removed</b> from aqueous solution by Fenton process. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, the outcome of removing dissolved organic carbon derived from natural water with initial concentrations 2, 4, and 8 mg/l using one-liter water containers by means of Fenton Process at PHs 2, 3, 4, and 5 due to adding 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/l of H 2 O 2 and Ferrous ions with 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/l concentrations at oxidation time 5, 10, 20, and 40 minutes was calculated. Finally, the outcome of carbon removal was assessed by means of TOC analyzer. Results: It {{was found that the}} most outcome of dissolved organic carbon removal (about 97 %) belonged to 10 / 1 H 2 O 2 and Ferrous ion, while dissolved organic carbon PH was 3 and its initial concentration was 2 mg/l and oxidation time was 40 minutes. Conclusion: Generally speaking, it was confirmed that the improved Fenton Oxidation Process can efficiently be used to refine water containing dissolved organic carbon.

40|$|The {{treatability}} of NOM {{present in}} runoff and subsurface waters from discrete zero-order catchments (ZOCs) with three land management practices (Australian native vegetation, pine plantation, grasslands) on varying soil textures of a closed drinking water reservoir-catchment was investigated. Subsurface water {{samples were collected}} by lysimeters and shallow piezometers and surface waters by installation of barriers that diverted waters to collection devices. For small sample volumes collected, a 'micro' jar testing procedure was developed to assess the treatability of organics by enhanced coagulation using alum, under standardised conditions. DOM present in water samples was quantified by measurement of DOC and UV absorbance (at 254 nm) and characterized using these and F-EEM. The mean alum dose rate (mg alum per mg <b>DOC</b> <b>removed</b> or Al/DOC) {{was found to be}} lower for DOM from sandy soil ZOCs (21. 1 +/- 11. 0 Al/DOC) than from clayey soil ZOCs (38. 6 +/- 27. 7 Al/DOC). ZOCs with Pinus radiata had prominent litter layers (6. 3 +/- 2. 6 cm), and despite differences in soil textures showed similarity in DOM character in subsurface waters, and in alum dose rates (22. 2 +/- 5. 5 Al/DOC). For sandy soil ZOCs, the lowest alum dose rates (16. 5 +/- 10. 6 Al/DOC) were for waters from native vegetation catchment while, for clayey soil ZOCs, waters from pine vegetation had the lowest alum dose rates (23. 0 +/- 5. 0 Al/DOC). Where ZOCs have a prominent O horizon, soil minerals had no apparent influence on the treatability of DOM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} set of {{measurements were}} performed to investigate the effect of different engine conditions (i. e. load, speed, temperature, "driving scenarios") and emission control devices (with/without diesel oxidative catalyst, DOC) on the composition and abundance of unregulated exhaust gas emissions from a light-duty diesel engine. Exhaust emissions were introduced into an atmospheric chamber and measured using thermal desorption comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionisation detector (TD-GC×GC-FID). In total, 16 individual and 8 groups of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured in the exhaust gas, ranging from volatile to intermediate volatility. The total speciated VOC (∑SpVOC) emission rates varied significantly with different engine conditions, ranging from 70 to 9268 milligrams of VOC mass per kilogram of fuel burnt (mg kg - 1). ∑SpVOC emission rates generally decreased with increasing engine load and temperature, {{and to a lesser}} degree, engine speed. The exhaust gas composition changed as a result of two main influencing factors, the DOC hydrocarbon (HC) removal efficiency and engine combustion efficiency. Increased DOC HC removal efficiency and engine combustion efficiency resulted in a greater percentage contribution of the C 7 to C 12 branched aliphatics and C 7 to C 12 n -alkanes, respectively, to the ∑SpVOC emission rate. The investigated <b>DOC</b> <b>removed</b> 46  ±  10  % of the ∑SpVOC emissions, with removal efficiencies of 83  ±  3  % for the single-ring aromatics and 39  ±  12  % for the aliphatics (branched and straight-chain). The DOC aliphatic removal efficiency generally decreased with increasing carbon chain length. The emission factors of n -nonane to n -tridecane were compared with on-road diesel emissions from a highway tunnel in Oakland California. Comparable emission factors were from experiments with relatively high engine loads and speeds, engine conditions which are consistent with the driving conditions of the on-road diesel vehicles. Emission factors from low engine loads and speeds (e. g. cold-start) showed no agreement with the on-road diesel emissions as expected, with the emission factors observed to be 2 to 8 times greater. To our knowledge, this is the first study which has explicitly discussed the effect of the DOC HC removal efficiency and combustion efficiency on the exhaust gas composition. With further work, compositional differences in exhaust gas emissions as a function of engine temperature, could be implemented into air-quality models, resulting in improved refinement and better understanding of diesel exhaust emissions on local air quality...|$|E

40|$|Ion {{exchange}} resins {{have found}} an increasing application in {{the drinking water}} treatment sector {{over the last few}} decades. The ion exchange resins have a positive ability to remove the charged natural organic matter (NOM). To apply this process in full-scale treatment, the most suitable resin has to be selected and the hydraulic behaviour of the treatment process must be known. This study has the purpose to study the NOM fractions removal with different resins and select the most suitable resin for NOM removal of the Weesperkarspel water. Another purpose is to study the hydraulic behaviours of fluidized ion exchange and testing of the fluidization models of Ergun and Richardson-Zaki. The thesis study is characterizing NOM into the specific fraction and later observing the removal of each fraction with the different ion exchange resins. The kinetic and the equilibrium of NOM removal of each resin are also studied. Four ion exchange resins are tested (Lewatit VP OC 1071, Purolite Macronet 200, Duolite A 7 and MIEX DOC). The ultraviolet absorbance method (UV), dissolved organic carbon detection method (DOC), specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), fluorescence excitation emission matrix (fluorescence EEM) and liquid chromatography-organic carbon detector method (LC-OCD) were applied. Weesperkarspel water contains a high degree of aromatic NOM fractions, mostly in the form of humic substances. The Lewatit VP OC 1071 is the most suitable resin for removal of NOM in general view, especially aromatic NOM and humic substances fractions. It appears to be removed as high as 65 % and 94 % respectively. The MIEX <b>DOC</b> <b>removed</b> 57 % aromatic NOM fraction and 70 % of humic substances. The pH was found as the dominant parameter for the NOM removal by the weak base Duolite A 7. In normal raw water (pH = 7. 8), this resin is almost ineffective while it can remove the aromatic NOM up to 35 % and humic substances fraction of 45 % in raw water pH adjusted to 5. The sorbent Purolite Macronet 200 can remove only biopolymers and neutral NOM fractions. Adsorption is an important mechanism for the removal process of high molecular weight NOM fractions and the neutrals fractions. By using the linear driving force model (LDF) to describe the ion exchange rate of the resin, it was found that MIEX DOC resin can remove NOM faster than other resins. The LDF- k constant of MIEX DOC is also higher than other resins. MIEX DOC has the smallest resin bead size. This can be the reason for the fast removal of NOM. The resin exchange capacity is related with the Freundlich constant K and n. Increase of K and n values lead to increase of exchange capacity. The Lewatit VP OC 1071 has the highest K and n values and thus the highest exchange capacity. The exchange rate and exchange capacity is a specific property of each resin. With help from the LDF model and Freundlich isotherm the breakthrough curve can be determined. The Lewatit VP OC 1071 has longest running time compared with the MIEX DOC and Duolite A 7 due to the highest exchange capacity. The hydraulics behaviour of fluidized bed ion exchange has been investigated with the strong base gel resin Lewatit VP OC 1071. The temperature and the feed velocity influence the expanded behaviour. The wet density and wet porosity are important parameters for the model prediction. Combination of mathematical modelling of ion exchange and the treatment conditions of Weesperkarspel drinking water treatment plant, the fluidized ion exchange process can be designed. For Weesperkarspel drinking water treatment plant, the aim is to decrease the DOC concentration of 7. 2 mg C/l to 3. 0 mg C/l with the fluidized ion exchange process. The 20 fluidized ion exchange reactors with a height of 9 m, 10 m 2 of resin bed surface area, a bed height of 2 m and a feed velocity of 20 m/h are designed. The reactors consist of 4 groups, each group is started with delays of 15 days. With this operational step, the running time of each reactor is 60 days. The cost is estimated 11 -euro cent per m 3 treated water. Sanitary EngineeringWatermanagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{organic matter}} (NOM), {{ubiquitous}} in natural water sources, {{is generated by}} biogeochemical processes in both the water body and in the surrounding watershed, {{as well as from}} the contribution of organic compounds that enter the water as a result of human activity. NOM significantly affects the properties of the water source, including the ability to transport metals, influence the aggregation kinetics of colloidal particles, serve as a food source for microorganisms and act as a precursor in the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs), as well as imparting a brown colour to the water. The reactivity of NOM is closely tied to its physicochemical properties, such as aromaticity, elemental composition, functional group content and molecular weight (MW) distribution. The MW distribution is an important consideration from a water treatment perspective for several reasons. For example, low MW NOM decreases the efficiency of treatment with activated carbon, and this fraction is thought to be the portion most difficult to remove using coagulation. The efficiency of membranes in the treatment of drinking water is also influenced by the MW distribution of NOM, while some studies have shown that the low MW fraction contributes disproportionately to the formation of bioavailable organic matter, therefore promoting the formation of biofilms in the distribution system. For these reasons, understanding the MW distribution of NOM is important for the treatment of natural waters for use as drinking waters. Optimisation of a high pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) method for analysis of the MW distribution of NOM in natural waters is described (Chapter 2). Several parameters influencing the performance of HPSEC are tested and an optimised set of conditions illustrated. These parameters included eluent composition, ionic strength of the sample, flow rate and injection volume. Firstly, it was found that increasing the ionic strength of the HPSEC eluent resulted in less exclusion of NOM from the stationary phase. Stationary phases used in HPSEC contain a residual negative charge that can repel the negatively charged regions of NOM, effectively reducing the accessible pore volume. By increasing the ionic strength, interactions between the stationary phase and eluent enabled a larger effective pore size for the NOM analytes. However, increasing ionic strength of the eluent also resulted in a loss of peak resolution for the NOM portion able to access the pore volume of the stationary phase. Determining the ideal eluent composition required the balancing of these two outcomes. Matching of the ionic strength of the sample with the eluent was also an important consideration. Retention times were slightly lower when the sample ionic strength was not matched with the eluent, especially for the lowest MW material, although the effect on chromatography was minimal. Flow rate had no effect on the resolution of the HPSEC chromatogram for the portion of material able to permeate the pore space of the stationary phase. Changes in the volume of sample injected had a marked effect on the elution profile of the NOM sample. Besides the obvious limitation of detection limit, only minor changes in elution profile were obtained up to an injection volume of 100 µL. Volumes above this value, however, resulted in significant peak broadening issues, as well as an undesirable effect on the low MW portion of detected DOC. In Chapter 3, high pressure size exclusion chromatography with UV 254 [subscript] and on-line detection of organic carbon (HPSEC-UV 254 [subscript]-OCD) was used to compare the removal of different apparent MW fractions of DOC by two process streams operating in parallel at the local Wanneroo groundwater treatment plant (GWTP). One of these two process streams included alum coagulation (operating in an enhanced coagulation mode (EC) for increased DOC removal) and the other stream included a magnetic ion exchange (MIEX®) process followed by alum coagulation (MIEX®-C). The MIEX® process is based on a micro-sized, macroporous, strong base anion exchange resin with magnetic properties, which has been designed to remove NOM through ion exchange of the anionic sites in NOM. Water was sampled from five key locations within these process streams, and the DOC at each location was characterised in terms of its MW distribution. HPSEC was carried out using three different on-line detector systems, namely OCD, UV absorbance detection at 254 nm, and fluorescence detection (λex[subscript]= 282 nm; λim[subscript] = 353 nm). This approach provided significant information on the chemical nature of the DOC in the various MW fractions. The MIEX®-C process was found to outperform the EC process: these two processes removed similar amounts of high and low MW DOC, but the MIEX®-C process showed greater removal of DOC from the intermediate MW fractions. The two coagulation processes (EC and coagulation following MIEX®) showed good removal of the fractions of highest MW, while the MIEX® process alone was found to remove DOC across all MW fractions. These results seem to indicate that anionic groups, particularly susceptible to removal with MIEX® treatment, are well distributed across all MW fractions of NOM. In agreement with previous studies, MIEX®-C outperformed EC in the overall removal of DOC (MIEX®-C removed 25 % more DOC than EC). However, 70 % of the additional <b>DOC</b> <b>removed</b> by MIEX®-C was comprised of a surprisingly narrow range of medium-high MW fractions. The development of a novel online organic carbon detector (OCD) for use with HPSEC for determining the MW distribution of NOM is described in Chapter 4. With UV absorbance detection, the magnitude of the signal is based on the extinction coefficient of the chromophores in the analytes being investigated; whereas the signal from an OCD is proportional to the actual organic carbon concentrations, providing significantly more information. The development of an online OCD involved the separation of analytes using HPSEC, removal of inorganic carbon species which may interfere with organic carbon determination, oxidation of the organic carbon to carbon dioxide, separation of the produced carbon dioxide from the aqueous phase and subsequent detection of the gaseous carbon dioxide. In the new instrument, following separation of components by HPSEC, the sample stream was acidified with orthophosphoric acid to a concentration of 20 mmol L- 1 [superscript], resulting in a pH of ≤ 2, in order to convert inorganic carbon to carbon dioxide. This acid dose was found to remove greater than 99 % of inorganic carbon once the acidified sample was passed through a hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane allowing the passage of dissolved gases (under negative pressure from a vacuum pump) but restricting the flow of the mobile phase. Several factors influenced the oxidation of the organic carbon in the next step, including the dose of persulfate, the type and intensity of UV radiation and the composition of the capillary through which the sample stream passes. Through optimisation of this process, it was found that a persulfate dose of 0. 84 mmol L- 1 [superscript] in the sample stream was required for optimum oxidation efficiency. A medium pressure UV lamp was compared to a vacuum UV lamp for its efficiency in oxidation of organic carbon to carbon dioxide. While the medium pressure lamp produced a far smaller percentage of its total radiation at the optimum wavelength for oxidation of organic compounds, the greater overall intensity of the medium pressure lamp was shown to be superior for this application. The composition of the capillary was shown to have a considerable effect on the oxidation efficiency. A quartz capillary, internal diameter 0. 6 mm, was compared with a PTFE capillary, internal diameter 0. 5 mm, for the oxidation of organic carbon by external UV treatment. While peak width, an important consideration in chromatographic resolution, was greater for the larger internal diameter quartz capillary, the lower UV transparency of PTFE combined with the shorter contact time, due to the reduced internal diameter of the capillary, resulted in a less efficient oxidation step using the PTFE capillary. The quartz capillary was therefore chosen for use in the UV/persulfate oxidation step for oxidation of organic carbon to carbon dioxide. Separation of the produced carbon dioxide from the sample stream was achieved by sparging with nitrogen and contacting the gas/liquid mixture with a hydrophobic PTFE membrane, restricting the passage of the liquid while allowing the nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases to pass to the detection system. The only factor influencing this separation was the flow of the nitrogen sparge gas, with a flow of 2 mL min- 1 [superscript] found to be optimum. Detection of produced carbon dioxide was via a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer with a Iightpipe accessory. The Iightpipe accessory was designed for use as a detector for gas chromatography and the small size of the detector cell was ideal for use with this application. Using the new system described, concentrations of a single peak could be determined with a detection limit of 31 ng and a determination limit of 68 ng. The development of the new OCD allowed characterisation of NOM in terms of its MW distribution and the UV and fluorescence spectral properties of each MW fraction. Further characterisation of MW fractions of NOM from a local groundwater bore was carried out by separation of the fractions by preparative HPSEC, followed by off-line analysis. Preparative HPSEC involved the injection of a pre-concentrated groundwater sample multiple times, using a large scale HPSEC column, then collecting and combining material of identical MW. This allowed each MW fraction of the sample to be further characterised as described in Chapter 5. Preparative HPSEC has only previously been applied to a small number of samples for the concentration and fractionation of NOM, where the structural features of the various MW fractions were studied. In the current research, more extensive studies of not only the chemical characteristics, but also the disinfection behaviour, of the MW fractions were conducted. Separation of the sample was conducted on a large diameter silica-based HPSEC column, with fraction collection based on semi-resolved peaks of the HPSEC chromatogram. Nine MW fractions were collected by this method. After concentration and dialysis to remove the buffer salts in the HPSEC mobile phase, each fraction was re-analysed by analytical HPSEC-UV 254 [subscript] and showed a single Gaussian shaped peak, indicating discrete MW fractions had successfully been collected. Analysis of the collected MW fractions indicated that 57 % of the organic carbon was in Fractions 3 and 4, with 41 % in Fractions 5 - 9, leaving only 2 % in Fractions 1 (highest MW) and 2. For each of the nine MW fractions, chorine demand and 7 day trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) were measured on dilute solutions of the same DOC concentration, and solid state 13 [superscript]C NMR spectra were recorded on some of the solid isolates obtained after Iyophilisation of the separate or combined dialysis retentates. The larger MW Fractions 3 and 4 were found to contain a greater proportion of aromatic and carbonyl carbon, and the lower MW Fractions 5 and 6 and Fractions 7 - 9 contained greater proportions of aliphatic and O-aliphatic carbon, by this technique. Chlorine demand experiments on each individual fraction with a normalised DOC concentration indicated that the largest MW fraction (Fraction 1) had the lowest chlorine demand. It was concluded that material in this fraction may be associated with inorganic colloids and unavailable for reaction with chlorine. Fraction 3 had the highest chlorine demand, just over two times more than the next highest chlorine demand (Fraction 4) and approximately three times the chlorine demand of Fraction 2. The organic material in Fraction 2 was postulated to contain a mixture of the reactive material present in Fraction 3 and the colloidal associated material present in Fraction 1. NMR analysis indicated that the difference between Fraction 3 and Fraction 4 was a reduction in reactive aromatic carbon and hence the lower chlorine demand in the latter fraction. Fractions 5 - 8 had similar chlorine demands, lower than Fraction 4, while Fraction 9 had a very low chlorine demand similar to that of Fraction 1. For Fractions 5 - 9, the lower aromatic carbon content most likely resulted in the lower chlorine demand. The 7 day THMFP experiments showed some clear trends, with Fraction 1 and Fraction 2 producing the least amounts of THMs but having the greatest incorporation of bromine. Fractions 3 and 4 produced the greatest concentration of THMs with the lowest bromine incorporation, perhaps as they contained fast reacting THM precursors and the higher chlorine concentrations resulted in greater amounts of chlorinated THMs. Fraction 5 and Fraction 6 produced similar levels of THMs over 7 days to Fractions 7 - 9 (approximately 75 % of the amount formed by Fractions 3 and 4), however, Fractions 7 - 9 formed these THMs more quickly than Fractions 5 and 6, with slightly greater amounts of bromine incorporation. It was thought that the increased speed of formation was due to the smaller MW of these fractions and a simpler reaction pathway from starting material to formation of THMs, as well as some structural differences. This research marks the first report of significantly resolved MW fractions being isolated and their behaviour in the presence of a disinfectant being determined. While the high MW fractions had the greatest chlorine demands and THMFPs, these fractions are also the easiest to remove during coagulation water treatment processes, as shown in Chapter 3. The lowest MW material formed significant amounts of THMs, and also formed THMs more quickly than other MW fractions. This has important implications from a water treatment perspective, as the lowest MW material is also the most difficult to remove during conventional treatment processes. Solid samples of NOM were isolated from water samples taken from four points at the Wanneroo GWTP using ultrafiltration and subsequent Iyophilisation of the retained fractions, as described in Chapter 6. The sampling points were following aeration (Raw), following treatment by MIEX®, following treatment by MIEX®-C and following treatment by EC. Elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, solid state 13 [superscript]C NMR spectroscopy and HPSEC-UV 254 [subscript]- 0 CD analysis were used to compare the four isolates. Treatment with MIEX®-C was found to remove the greatest amount of NOM. Additionally, treatment with MIEX®-C was able to remove the largest MW range of NOM, with the remaining material being depleted in aromatic species and having a greater proportion of aliphatic and O-aliphatic carbon. EC treatment completely removed the NOM components above 5000 Da, but NOM below this was not well removed. NOM remaining after the EC train had a lower aromatic content and more aliphatic oxygenated organic matter than the RW. The remaining organic matter after MIEX® treatment contained less aromatic material compared to the RW, but had a greater aromatic content than either of the EC or MIEX®-C samples. HPSEC was a significant analytical technique used throughout this research. Initial optimisation of an HPSEC method was an important development which allowed improved resolution of various MW fractions. The application of this technique and comparison of three detection systems for the study of DOC removal showed, for the first time, the performance of MIEX® treatment at a full scale groundwater treatment facility. The use of various HPSEC detection systems allowed significant characterisation of the MW fractions, more information than had previously been gathered from such a sample set. This work demonstrated the need for OCD when applying HPSEC to the study of NOM. As such, a system was constructed that built on previously developed systems, with the use of a small detector cell enabling detection limits capable of measuring even the most dilute natural and treated water samples. To study the individual MW fractions in detail, preparative HPSEC was applied and, for the first time, the disinfection behaviour of various MW fractions was examined. Interestingly, the lowest MW fractions, acknowledged to be the most recalcitrant to conventional water treatment processes, produced significant quantities of THMs. Also the formation kinetics of THMs from the low MW fractions indicated that THMs were formed as quickly as, or perhaps even at faster rates than from the larger MW fractions. Finally, structural characterisation of NOM at four stages of the Wanneroo GWTP indicated MIEX®-C treatment was superior to EC, of significant interest for the water industry...|$|E
40|$|Appendix D: Wavecomm Tech <b>Docs</b> <b>removed</b> for {{copyright}} reasonsTelecare {{and especially}} Mobile Care Systems {{are getting more}} and more popular. They have two major benefits: first, they drastically improve the living standards and even health outcomes for patients. In addition, they allow significant cost savings for adult care by reducing the needs for medical staff. A common drawback of current Mobile Care Systems is that they are rather stationary in most cases and firmly installed in patients’ houses or flats, which makes them stay very near to or even in their homes. There is also an upcoming second category of Mobile Care Systems which are portable without restricting the moving space of the patients, but with the major drawback that they have either very limited computational abilities and only a rather low classification quality or, which is most frequently, they only have a very short runtime on battery and therefore indirectly restrict the freedom of moving of the patients once again. These drawbacks are inherently caused by the restricted computational resources and mainly the limitations of battery based power supply of mobile computer systems. This research investigates the application of novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to improve the operation of 2 Mobile Care Systems. As a result, based on the Evolving Connectionist Systems (ECoS) paradigm, an innovative approach for a highly efficient and self-optimising distributed online machine learning algorithm called MECoS - Moving ECoS - is presented. It balances the conflicting needs of providing a highly responsive complex and distributed online learning classification algorithm by requiring only limited resources in the form of computational power and energy. This approach overcomes the drawbacks of current mobile systems and combines them with the advantages of powerful stationary approaches. The research concludes that the practical application of the presented MECoS algorithm offers substantial improvements to the problems as highlighted within this thesis...|$|R

A prior biodegradability study (Zahn−Wellens test) had demonstrated that the matrix was biodegradable after a rather long biomass adaptation period. After 4 days of treatment in an immobilized biomass reactor (IBR), 96 % of the original <b>DOC</b> was <b>removed</b> by the biological treatment; however, more than 50 % of NXA was adsorbed on the biomass. As development of chronic toxicity in the IBR is possible after long exposure to NXA, adsorption and biomass stability during continuous exposure to NXA were studied in different cycles for one month. After the biotreatment, the effluent was treated by solar photo-Fenton. Total degradation of NXA and reduction in toxicity were observed. The intermediates formed during degradation by biotreatment and subsequent photo-Fenton were studied by liquid chromatography−time-of-flight mass spectrometry...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{adsorption}} and microwave assisted-oxidation of Cationic Blue (X-GRL) on hydrous manganese oxides (delta MnO(2)) and commercial MnO(2) (beta MnO(2)). The effects of X-GRL adsorption and Mn(IV) reductive dissolution are investigated. delta MnO(2) exhibits higher adsorbing potential for X-GRL than beta MnO(2) does, with dissolved organic carbon (<b>DOC)</b> removal potential (<b>removed</b> <b>DOC</b> at per gram MnO 2) of 4. 92 and 0. 31 mg/g, respectively. The ratio of absorption at different wavelength (A(202) (nm) /A(300) (nm) /A(610) (nm)) and ratio of DOC to A(610) (nm) (R(DOC) /A(610) (nm)) varies after adsorption. This implies the electron transfer between manganese oxides surfaces and X-GRL, which is confirmed by dissolved Mn(II) concentration increase. delta MnO(2) exhibits more remarkable oxidizing effect than beta MnO(2) does. X-GRL adsorption onto delta MnO(2) involves in hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, which is inhibited by Ca(2 +) presence and favored at higher pH. Manganese species (delta MnO(2), beta MnO(2) and Mn(2 +)) facilitates X-GRL degradation and DOC removal in O(2) /MWL systems, and more significant effects are observed for delta MnO(2) due to its combined effects of adsorption and catalysis. The k(app) (apparent reaction constant) in the initial 10 min with delta MnO(2) presence is about 2. 5 and 4. 2 times higher than that with beta MnO(2) and Mn(2 +) presence, respectively. However, with reactions continuing, DOC mineralization is inhibited in heterogeneous systems due to the adverse effect of high dissolved Mn(2 +) concentration. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In Boreal regions the raw waters contain high {{concentrations}} of natural organic matter (NOM), thus their removal in biofilters is not always effective due to the slow degradation rate of biodegradable organic carbon (BDOC). The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the BDOC degradation rate after ozonation of humic rich dissolved organic carbon (DOC= 4 - 8 mg/L) drinking water. To measure BDOC removal kinetics a simple method was developed for this study. The organic carbon in synthetic water solution in which the only organic substance was acetate was completely removed during the first 120 minutes. During the same period only 9 % of the <b>DOC</b> was <b>removed</b> from ozonated drinking water sample (O 3 mgL- 1 /DOC mgL- 1 = 1 - 1. 5). In the following 105 minutes another 7 % of DOC was degraded by the columns. After that no changes of DOC occurred. These results allow concluding that even at high ozone doses the BDOC produced from humic-rich water is slowly biodegradable and therefore is not effectively removed by biofiltration applying the contact time (20 - 30 min) currently used by ozonation-biofiltration plants...|$|R

This study shows that this approach is often not efficient for removal of DOC from waters with a high amount of humic substances. During chemical treatment, the microbiologically available phosphorus is very efficiently removed, which results in shortages of phosphorus needed for bacteria to mineralise carbon in BAC filters. To enhance removal of DOC by biological treatment, addition of phosphorus prior to the BAC filters should be considered...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the utilization of}} dissolved organic matter and oxygen for sewage purification and to evaluate the feasibility of {{the application of the}} sewer as a pretreatment system for municipal sewage. The experiment was carried out in a 1. 5 -km section of a sanitary gravity sewer in a slope of 0. 0075. This sewer is a cement pipe with an inner diameter of 450 mm. Continuous monitoring of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), suspended solids (SS), flow rate, and dissolved oxygen (DO) were conducted along the sewer. It was found that 16 % of the <b>DOC</b> was <b>removed</b> in the section with an estimated 18 -minute retention time. Throughout the entire sewer section, a slow flow rate favors a higher DOC removal efficiency because it offers a longer retention time, which implies that oxygen would not be a limiting factor. The DO decreased progressively along the sewer line and the mean concentration difference between the influent and effluent was found almost constant at 3. 1 mg/L throughout the entire sewer section. Batch tests using both sewage and sediment were carried out to determine their specific DOC removal rates and the specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR), and the mean values were found to be 1. 3 mg DOC/mg SS/day (0. 054 mg DOC/mg SS/day) for DOC removal and 17. 7 mg O 2 /g SS/hr for oxygen uptake in the sewage phase and 2. 6 mg DOC/mg SS/day (0. 108 mg DOC/mg SS/day) for DOC removal and 32 mg O 2 /g SS/hr for oxygen uptake in the sediment phase, respectiveIy. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content analysis of the SS and sediment samples also confirmed that both the SS and the sediments contained substantial amount of active biomass. The oxygen budget analysis of this sewer found that the oxygen demand for the sediment and the sewage is 22. 8 kg O 2 /day and 4. 3 kg O 2 /day, respectively. If this entire 1. 5 -km sewer system is taken as a tubular bioreactor, it can be estimated that 39. 13 Kg of DOC can be stabilized per day, to which the sewage phase contributes 40 % while the sediment phase contributes 60 %. The sediment is more effective in both <b>removing</b> <b>DOC</b> and utilizing oxygen in this sewer system...|$|R

This included solar radiation, which is not a controlled variable. The observed behavior of the system in batch-mode was compared with fed-batch experiments carried out under similar conditions.

40|$|Catchments {{draining}} peat soils {{provide the}} majority of drinking water in the UK. Over the past decades, concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have increased in surface waters. Residual DOC can cause harmful carcinogenic disinfection by-products to form during water treatment processes. Increased frequency and severity of droughts combined with and increased temperatures expected as the climate changes, have potentials to change water quality. We used a novel approach to investigate links between climate change, DOC release and subsequent effects on drinking water treatment. We designed a climate manipulation experiment to simulate projected climate changes and monitored releases from peat soil and litter, then simulated coagulation used in water treatment. We showed that the ‘drought’ simulation was the dominant factor altering DOC release and affected the ability to <b>remove</b> <b>DOC.</b> Our results imply that future short-term drought events could have a greater impact than increased temperature on DOC treatability. ...|$|R

40|$|Two {{biological}} contact oxidation reactors, cascade biofilm reactor (CSBR) and one-step biofilm reactor (OSBR), {{were used}} in this paper for pretreatment of eutrophic water from Lake Taihu in China. The CSBR was more effective and stable for eutrophic water treatment than OSBR, in terms of extracellular microcystin-LR, chlorophyll-a, DOC, and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) removal. Removal efficiencies of extracellular microcystin-LR and chlorophyll-a were 75. 8 % and 59. 7 % in CSBR and 60. 5 % and 53. 0 % after 2 [*]h in OSBR. CSBR had much higher removal efficiency (34. 3 %) than OSBR (22. 7 %) for DOC, and CSBR could remove 67 % BDOC, accounting for 34 % of total DOC in source water. 11. 5 % of <b>DOC</b> was <b>removed</b> through means other than biological degradation, such as biofilm adsorption and bioflocculation. In CSBR at 5. 5 ~ 13 °C, 57. 5 % of atrazine was removed at 2 [*]h hydraulic retention time, with background concentration of 136. 5 [*]ng/L. Meanwhile, removal efficiencies of three phthalic acid esters (PAEs) (dimethyl phthalate, di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, and di-n-butyl phthalate) were 78. 7 %, 52. 4 %, and 85. 3 %, respectively. Only 35. 2 % of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) could be removed by CSBR with initial concentration of 21. 5 [*]μg/L.

40|$|Background Evidence {{increasingly}} {{shows that}} stream ecosystems greatly contribute to global carbon fluxes. This involves a tight coupling between biofilms, the dominant form of microbial life in streams, and {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC), a very significant pool of organic carbon on Earth. Yet, the interactions between microbial biodiversity and the molecular diversity of resource use are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Using six 40 -m-long streamside flumes, we created a gradient of streambed landscapes with increasing spatial flow heterogeneity to assess how physical heterogeneity, inherent to streams, affects biofilm diversity and DOC use. We determined bacterial biodiversity in all six landscapes using 16 S-rRNA fingerprinting and measured carbon uptake from glucose and DOC experimentally injected to all six flumes. The diversity of <b>DOC</b> molecules <b>removed</b> from the water was determined from ultrahigh-resolution Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Bacterial beta diversity, glucose and DOC uptake, and the molecular diversity of DOC use all increased with increasing flow heterogeneity. Causal modeling and path analyses of the experimental data revealed that the uptake of glucose was largely driven by physical processes related to flow heterogeneity, whereas biodiversity effects, such as complementarity, most likely contributed to the enhanced uptake of putatively recalcitrant DOC compounds in the streambeds with higher flow heterogeneity. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest biophysical mechanisms, including hydrodynamics and microbial complementarity effects, through which physical heterogeneity induces changes of resource use and carbon fluxes in streams. These findings highlight the importance of fine-scale streambed heterogeneity for microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in streams, where homogenization and loss of habitats increasingly reduce biodiversity...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to obtain insight into the mechanisms that are operative in pre-ozonized coagulation. Effects of pre-ozonation on organic matter removal during coagulation with IPF-PACl were investigated by using PDA (photometric disperse analysis), apparent molecular weight distribution and chemical fractionation. The dynamic formation of floes during coagulation process was detected. Changes of aquatic organic matter (AOM) structure resulted from the influence of pre-ozonation were evaluated. Results show that dosage of O- 3 and characteristics of AOM are two of the major factors influencing the performance of O- 3 on coagulation. No significant coagulation-aid effect of O- 3 was observed for all experiments using either AlCl 3 or PACl On the contrary, with the application of pre-ozonation, the coagulation efficiency of AlCl 3 was significantly deteriorated, reflected by the retardation of floe formation, and the removal decreases of turbidity, DOC, and UV 254. However, if PACl was used instead of AlCl 3, the adverse effects of pre-ozonation were mitigated obviously, particularly when the O- 3 dosage was less than 0. 69 (mg O- 3 /mg TOC). The difference between removals of UV 254 and DOC indicated that pre-ozonation greatly changed the molecular structure of AOM, but its capability of mineralization was not remarkable. Only 5 % or so <b>DOC</b> was <b>removed</b> by pre-ozonation at 0. 6 - 0. 8 mg/L alone. Fractionation results showed that the organic products of pre-ozonation exhibited lower molecular weight and more hydrophilicity, which impaired the removal of DOC in the following coagulation process...|$|R

Their engineered applications inspire {{the search for}} conductive, stable, inexpensive, and sustainable electrode materials. Magnéli-phase titanium oxides have unique crystal and electron structure, which result in good electrical conductivity approaching that of metal and excellent corrosion resistance close to that of ceramics. We fabricated a monolithic porous Magnéli-phase Ti 4 O 7 electrode for EO of refractory industrial dyeing and finishing wastewater (DFWW). The results demonstrated that the electrochemically active area of porous Ti 4 O 7 electrode was 2 – 3 orders of magnitude higher than the apparent surface area of bulk electrode. The Ti 4 O 7 electrode achieved efficient and stable abatement of recalcitrant organic pollutants on site without any extra addition of chemicals. The soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved organic carbon (<b>DOC)</b> were <b>removed</b> by 66. 5 % and 46. 7 %, respectively, at current density of 8 mA cm− 2 after 2 h reaction. The bioavailability of treated wastewater was improved substantially, indicated by one order of magnitude increase in BOD 5 /COD. The Ti 4 O 7 electrode had good long-term stability, with its maximum COD removal declined only slightly (< 8 %) at current density of 20 mA cm− 2 during a 50 -cycle operation.

The behaviours of six commercial GAC compounds were compared. Batch kinetics experiments showed that 80 % of DOC in seawater was adsorbed within four hours. Adsorption kinetics fitted the Ho and McKay model well, and isotherms followed the Freundlich model. GAC A and GAC F had the best adsorption capacities. For GAC A, the adsorption mechanism was mainly related to high occupation of the porous volume, whereas for GAC F, the adsorption was mainly related to electrostatic interactions. GAC A was selected for a fixed bed column experiment continuously fed with seawater as GAC F released acidic groups into the feed water. This filtration set-up enabled more than 70 % of <b>DOC</b> to be <b>removed</b> from seawater.

40|$|Sequential ozone and UV-based {{processes}} (VUV irradiation and UV/H 2 O 2) for {{the treatment}} of secondary effluent were investigated. The effectiveness of these sequential treatments was compared with the individual treatments in terms of reduction in DOC, COD, UV 254 and colour and impact on BDOC. The greatest decrease in DOC, COD and UV 254 was achieved for samples treated with ozone before UV/H 2 O 2 (UVH), where a synergistic benefit was observed. By monitoring the formation of hydroxyl radicals (HO) during UVH and ozonation it was demonstrated that UVH treatments generated more hydroxyl radicals than ozonation, which explained the greater extent of mineralisation attained during UVH treatment. Sequential O 3 -UVH treatment (for 5 and 10 min, respectively) enhanced the formation of biodegradable compounds such that when followed by biological treatment up to 73 % of the <b>DOC</b> could be <b>removed</b> from the secondary effluent.

The largest organic carbon pool, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC), may change significantly due to changes in both riverine inputs and transformation rates; however, the present DOC inventories and transformation patterns are poorly understood. Using samples from the International Siberian Shelf Study 2008, this study examines for the first time DOC removal in Arctic shelf waters with residence times that range from months to years. Removals of up to 10 %- 20 % were found in the Lena River estuary, consistent with earlier studies in this area, where surface waters were shown to have a residence time of approximately 2 months. In contrast, the DOC concentrations showed a strong nonconservative pattern in areas with freshwater residence times of several years. The average losses of DOC were estimated to be 30 %- 50 % during mixing along the shelf, corresponding to a first-order removal rate constant of 0. 3 yr- 1. These data provide the first observational evidence for losses of DOC in the Arctic shelf seas, and the calculated DOC deficit reflects DOC losses that are higher than recent model estimates for the region. Overall, a large proportion of riverine <b>DOC</b> is <b>removed</b> from the surface waters across the Arctic shelves. Such significant losses must be included in models of the carbon cycle for the Arctic Ocean, especially since the breakdown of terrestrial DOC to CO 2 in Arctic shelf seas may constitute a positive feedback mechanism for Arctic climate warming. These data also provide a baseline for considering the effects of future changes in carbon fluxes, as the vast northern carbon-rich permafrost areas draining into the Arctic are affected by global warming.

Water samples from the Apure and Orinoco Rivers were collected monthly in four sectors {{over a period of}} 15 months. Auxiliary parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and temperature), total suspended sediments, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and major (Na, K, Ca, Mg, and Si) and trace (Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Cr) element concentrations were measured in all sectors. The relative contribution of both rivers after the Apure-Orinoco confluence was determined using Ca as a tracer. Moreover, a mixing model was developed to determine whether dissolved species exhibit a conservative behavior during mixing. The results indicate that <b>DOC</b> is <b>removed</b> from waters during the Apure-Orinoco mixing, probably due to absorption of DOC on mineral phases supplied by the Apure River. Dissolved Na, Ca, and Mg behave conservatively during the mixing processes, and their concentrations are controlled by a dilution process. The anomaly in the temporal pattern of K in the Orinoco is caused by the input of biogenic K originating from the Apure River during the high-water stage. The loss of dissolved Si during the low-water stage {{can be explained by the}} uptake of Si by diatoms. Dissolved Mn, Zn, Al, and Fe showed a non-conservative behavior during the Apure-Orinoco mixing. The removal of Mn and Zn from the dissolved phase can be explained by the formation of Mn-oxyhydroxides and the scavenging of Zn onto Mn oxides. Dissolved Fe is controlled by redox processes, although the removals of Fe and Al due to the preferential adsorption of large organometallic complexes by mineral surfaces after the Apure-Orinoco confluence can affect the mobility of both elements during transport. The conservative behavior shown by Cu and Cr can be related to the tendency of both elements to be complexed with small organic colloids, which are not preferentially adsorbed by clays...|$|R

The experiments consisted inconsecutive permeation (20 min) alternated with BW with permeate water (1. 0 min) (periodically chemically assisted with NaClO and NaOH) and followed by a two-stage CIP consisting first in an oxidising and basic step (NaClO and 30 NaOH) and second in an acidic step (citric acid). Feed, permeate, retentate (when present) and cleaning discharge streams were monitored for turbidity, total and dissolved organic carbon (TOC and DOC, respectively), UV 254 and inorganic ions (Al, Fe, P).

We hypothesised that specific hotspots and hot moments would occur where waters enriched with DOC and POC sourced from headwaters are exposed to: (1) mixing with freshwaters of different pH, conductivity and metal concentrations; and (2) mixing with seawater during autumn when DOC concentrations were at their highest.
