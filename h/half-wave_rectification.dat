In particular, they showed that a model like the one previously employed by [J. Acoust. Soc.

Bernstein and Trahiotis computed the normalized interaural correlation subsequent to <b>half-wave,</b> square-law <b>rectification</b> and low-pass filtering, the parameters of which were chosen to mimic peripheral auditory processing. In this report, it is demonstrated that augmenting the model by adding a physiologically valid stage of 2 ̆ 2 envelope compression 2 ̆ 2 prior to rectification and low-pass filtering provides a remedy. The new model not only accounts for the data obtained by Eddins and Barber (and the similar data obtained by Hall et al.), but also does not diminish the highly successful account of the comprehensive set of data that gave rise to the original form of the model. Therefore, models based on the computation of the normalized interaural correlation appear to remain valid because they can account, both quantitatively and qualitatively, {{for a wide variety of}} binaural detection and discrimination data. © 1999 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R

40|$|Microbalanced stimuli are dynamic {{displays}} {{which do}} not stimulate motion mechanisms that apply standard (Fourier-energy or autocorrelational) motion analysis directly to the visual signal. In order to extract motion information from microbalanced stimuli, Chubb and Sperling [(1988) Journal of the Optical Society of America, 5, 1986 - 2006] proposed that the human visual system performs a rectifying transformation on the visual signal prior to standard motion analysis. The current research employs two novel types of microbalanced stimuli: half-wave stimuli preserve motion information following <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectification</b> (with a threshold) but lose motion information following full-wave rectification; full-wave stimuli preserve motion information following full-wave rectification but lose motion information following <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectification.</b> Additionally, Fourier stimuli, ordinary square-wave gratings, were used to stimulate standard motion mechanisms. Psychometric functions (direction discrimination vs stimulus contrast) were obtained {{for each type of}} stimulus when presented alone, and when masked by each of the other stimuli (presented as moving masks and also as nonmoving, counterphase-flickering masks). RESULTS: given sufficient contrast, all three types of stimulus convey motion. However, only one-third of the population can perceive the motion of the half-wave stimulus. Observers are able to process the motion information contained in the Fourier stimulus slightly more efficiently than the information in the full-wave stimulus but are much less efficient in processing half-wave motion information. Moving masks are more effective than counterphase masks at hampering direction discrimination, indicating that some of the masking effect is interference between motion mechanisms, and some occurs at earlier stages. When either full-wave and Fourier or half-wave and Fourier gratings are presented simultaneously, there is a wide range of relative contrasts within which the motion directions of both gratings are easily determinable. Conversely, when half-wave and full-wave gratings are combined, the direction of only one of these gratings can be determined with high accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: the results indicate that three motion computations are carried out, any two in parallel: one standard ("first order") and two non-Fourier ("second-order") computations that employ full-wave and <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectification...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{computational}} {{theory for}} classification of natural biosonar targets is developed {{based on the}} properties of an example stimulus ensemble. An extensive set of echoes (84 800) from four different foliages was transcribed into a spike code using a parsimonious model (linear filtering, <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectification,</b> thresholding). The spike code is assumed to consist of time differences (interspike intervals) between threshold crossings. Among the elementary interspike intervals flanked by exceedances of adjacent thresholds, a few intervals triggered by disjoint half-cycles of the carrier oscillation stand out in terms of resolvability, visibility across resolution levels and a simple stochastic structure (uncorrelatedness). They are therefore argued to be a stochastic analogue to edges in vision. A three-dimensional feature vector representing these interspike intervals sustained a reliable target classification performance (0. 06 % classification error) in a sequential probability ratio test, which models sequential processing of echo trains by biological sonar systems. The dimensions of the representation are the first moments of duration and amplitude location of these interspike intervals {{as well as their}} number. All three quantities are readily reconciled with known principles of neural signal representation, since they correspond to the center of gravity of excitation on a neural map and the total amount of excitation...|$|E
40|$|Adaptation to {{stimulus}} statistics, such as {{the mean}} level and contrast of recently- heard sounds, has been demonstrated at various levels of the auditory pathway. It allows the nervous system to operate over {{the wide range of}} intensities and contrasts found in the natural world. Yet, current standard models of the response properties of auditory neurons do not incorporate such adaptation. Here, we present a model of neural responses in the ferret auditory cortex (the IC Adaptation model), which takes into account adaptation to mean sound level at a lower level of processing – the inferior colliculus (IC). The model performs high-pass filtering with frequency-dependent time constants on the sound spectrogram, followed by <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectification,</b> and passes the output to a standard linear-nonlinear (LN) model. We find that the IC Adaptation model consistently predicts cortical responses better than the standard LN model, for a range of synthetic and natural stimuli. The IC Adaptation model introduces no extra free parameters, so it improves predictions without sacrificing parsimony. Furthermore, the time constants of adaptation in the IC appear to be matched to the statistics of natural sounds, suggesting that neurons in the auditory midbrain predict the mean level of future sounds, and adapt their responses appropriately...|$|E

We studied binocular summation for horizontal luminance gratings (L), luminance gratings in noise (LM) and second-order gratings(contrast-modulated noise, CM). Noise centre frequency was 6 c/deg, rms contrast 0. 2 or 0. 1. We measured 2 AFC detection thresholds for gratings (0. 75 c/deg, 0. 2 s duration) shown to one eye, to botheyes in-phase, or both eyes in anti-phase. Mean binocular thresholds were 5 – 6 dB better than monocular thresholds for L, LM and CM: close to linear summation across the eyes. We found full binocular summation for CM even when the 2 D noise carriers were uncorrelated or anti-correlated between the eyes, implying binocular combination of envelope, not carrier, responses. Similarly, binocular summation for CM occurred with uncorrelated, oblique 1 D noise carriers at both parallel and orthogonal orientations,suggesting that CM summation is insensitive to carrier similarity or composition. In all cases anti-phase signals showed no summation and very little cancellation, consistent with <b>half-wave</b> <b>rectification</b> before binocular summation.
