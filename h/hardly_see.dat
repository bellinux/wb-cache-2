500|$|In season four, Grissom's true {{feelings}} are revealed in [...] "Butterflied", an episode that centers entirely around him discovering his sentiments for Sara. It {{was then that}} he admitted {{not being able to}} risk his career to be with her. In season four, Sara apparently develops a drinking problem, which Grissom acknowledges on the season finale; after this, they would <b>hardly</b> <b>see</b> each other, and Grissom becomes interested in detective Sofia Curtis.|$|E
500|$|The firemen {{made their}} way up an {{enclosed}} staircase with Serial 502 behind them. Dozens of rioters suddenly appeared {{at the top of}} the stairs, blowing whistles and throwing bottles. Pengelly ordered the officers and firefighters to retreat. They were forced to run backwards down the unlit narrow staircase, fearful of tripping over the fire hoses, which had been flat before but were now full of water. PC Richard Coombes, armed with just a short truncheon, said the noise – [...] "Kill the pigs!" [...] – was deafening, and he could <b>hardly</b> <b>see</b> through the scratched Perspex visor on his helmet.|$|E
500|$|The {{generic name}} Pycnoporellus is Ancient Greek for [...] "with countless pores". The {{specific}} epithet alboluteus {{is a combination}} of the Latin words for [...] "white" [...] and [...] "yellow". Curtis Gates Lloyd did not approve of the name, opining: [...] "I <b>hardly</b> <b>see</b> how Ellis could have given it a worse name if he had tried, for it is neither [...] "white" [...] nor [...] "yellow", but orange as Ellis described it. The young growth may possibly be white, but not when developed." [...] The fungus is commonly known as the [...] "orange sponge polypore".|$|E

500|$|Later, in his autobiography, Matlock would {{describe}} the primary impetus for his departure as his increasingly acrimonious relationship with Rotten, {{which he described}} as being exacerbated by the rampant inflation of Rotten's ego [...] "once he'd had {{his name in the}} papers" [...] and instigated by McLaren. Lydon would later claim that [...] "God Save the Queen," [...] the belligerently sardonic song planned as the band's second single, had been the final straw: [...] " [...] couldn't handle those kinds of lyrics. He said it declared us fascists." [...] Though the singer could <b>hardly</b> <b>see</b> how anti-royal-ism equated with fascism, he claimed, [...] "Just to get rid of him, I didn't deny it." [...] (The claim was denied by Matlock.) Jon Savage suggests that Rotten pushed Matlock out in an effort to demonstrate his power and autonomy from McLaren. Matlock almost immediately formed his own band, Rich Kids, with Midge Ure, Steve New, and Rusty Egan.|$|E

[...] He also wrote of it as [...] "a wilderness where one does not see the sun all day long.

Before shipping to Kentucky he reported worked well in an exercise on the long gallop at Newmarket. In the build-up to the race, there was some concern about the state of the turf course which had been softened by heavy rain, with the track supervisor saying that the ground was likely to be [...] "good to soft" [...] by British standards. Golden Horn was attempting to become the first Arc winner to win the race, following the failures of Dancing Brave (fourth in 1986), Trempolino (second in 1987), Saumarez, (fifth in 1990), Subotica (fifth in 1992) and Dylan Thomas (fifth in 2007).|$|E
2500|$|Verbs are {{conjugated}} for tense, mood, person, {{number and}} voice. There are three voices: active, passive and middle (or medial), {{but it may}} be debated whether the middle voice is a voice or simply an independent class of verbs of its own (because every middle-voice verb has an active ancestor but concomitant are sometimes drastic changes in meaning {{and the fact that the}} middle-voice verbs form a conjugation group of their own). Examples might be [...] ("come") vs. [...] ("get there"), [...] ("kill") vs. [...] ("perish ignominiously") and [...] ("take") vs. [...] ("manage to"). In every case mentioned, the meaning has been so altered, that one can <b>hardly</b> <b>see</b> them as the same verb in different voices. Verbs have up to ten tenses, but Icelandic, like English, forms most of them with auxiliary verbs. There are three or four main groups of weak verbs in Icelandic, depending on whether one takes a historical or a formalistic view: , , and , referring to the endings that these verbs take when conjugated in the first person singular present. Some Icelandic infinitives end with the [...] suffix, some with , two with [...] ( [...] , [...] ) one with [...] (: [...] "wash") and one with [...] (the Danish borrowing [...] which is probably withdrawing its presence). For many verbs that require an object, a reflexive pronoun can be used instead. The case of the pronoun depends on the case that the verb governs. As for further classification of verbs, Icelandic behaves much like other Germanic languages, with a main division between weak verbs and strong, and the class of strong verbs, few as they may be (...) , is divided into six plus reduplicative verbs. They still make up some of the most frequently used verbs. ( [...] , [...] "to be", is the example par excellence, having two subjunctives and two imperatives in addition to being made up of different stems.) There is also a class of auxiliary verbs, called the [...] verbs (4 or 5, depending who is counting) and then the oddity [...] ("to cause"), called the only totally irregular verb in Icelandic although [...] is caused by common and regular sound changes.|$|E
