5000|$|If {{the scanner}} PID {{displays}} a [...] "lambda" [...] or [...] "equivalence ratio," [...] the reading should be 1.0 under stoichiometric conditions. Numbers above 1.0 indicate a lean condition while numbers below 1.0 indicate rich mixtures. The ECM uses {{the information from}} the sensors to adjust the amount of fuel being injected into the engine, so corresponding changes in the short-term <b>fuel</b> <b>trim</b> PID(s) should also be seen. Lean mixture readings from the AFR sensor will prompt the ECM to add fuel, which will manifest itself as a positive (or more positive) short-term <b>fuel</b> <b>trim</b> percentage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{one problem}} with this early design was that at higher altitudes where the pure {{turbojet}} engines could produce decent fuel economy, the wing was very compromised. At {{the top of the}} B-47's envelope, about 35000 ft, the B-47 was in [...] "coffin corner". That means that at this level, which produced the most range at most weights due to fuel consumption, there was an envelope of 5 kn between maximum mach and stall speed. Since this airplane had a rudimentary autopilot at best, it meant that if the B-47 was going to cross the Atlantic Ocean, it had to be flown this high and the pilot had to leave the autopilot OFF and needed to spend up to eight hours staring at the airspeed and manipulating the throttles in order to not fall from the sky. To put this in perspective, a modern Boeing 757 has over 50 kn of difference at even a very heavy weight at 41000 ft.Fuel capacity was enormous, at 17000 usgal L, more than triple the 5000 usgal L on the B-29 Superfortress. That meant that maintaining <b>fuel</b> <b>trim</b> to ensure a stable center of gravity in flight would be a very critical copilot duty. The total bombload capacity was to be 25000 lb. Production aircraft were to be equipped with state-of-the-art electronics for navigation, bombing, countermeasures, and turret fire control.|$|E
30|$|We {{proposed}} a time-optimized driver fingerprinting method {{based on the}} driving patterns. It is shown that in-vehicle network data, such as <b>fuel</b> <b>trim,</b> brake pedal and steering wheel data, are relevant in accurately identifying drivers. It is also shown {{that it is possible}} to identify drivers with a very high accuracy within the first 3  min of driving, using a limited amount of sensor data collected from a restricted but judiciously chosen set of sensors.|$|E
50|$|The Mahindra Bolero is an {{off-road}} vehicle produced by Mahindra & Mahindra. Price: The various <b>fuel</b> <b>trims</b> in Mahindra Bolero are priced differently. The Diesel trims are priced between Rs. 6,03,937/- to Rs. 7,78,046/-.|$|R
50|$|As for {{transmission}} on the Dzire, {{there is}} a 5-speed manual transmission gearbox as standard in both the <b>fuel</b> <b>trims.</b> However, in higher trims levels, {{there is a}} 5-speed automatic transmission too for both petrol as well as diesel motors.|$|R
50|$|Tata Motors on January 22, 2015 {{launched}} the much awaited Bolt hatch at Rs 4.44 Lac (Ex-Showroom, Delhi). The hatch is made available {{in both the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>trims</b> with 4 variants in petrol and diesel. Tata Bolt competes {{with the likes of}} Maruti Suzuki Swift and Hyundai Grand i10. The car is developed under the banner of HorizonNext strategy, which contains three aspects- DriveNext, DesignNext and ConnectNext. Under DriveNext, the car gets segment first multi driving modes- City (default), Eco and Sport, while with ConnectNext, the hatch embraces 5-inch Harman touchscreen infotainment system.|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} alternative methods of fuel consumption measurement based on model with using the diagnostic outputs of engine control unit. On-board diagnosis (the second level, known as OBD- 2) has been mandated by government regulation because of advanced damage control systems in newer cars. However, its signals {{can be used}} for accurate analyses of power or torque measurement. On-board diagnostics offers many various parameters such a spark advance, intake air temperature, coolant temperature, throttle position, air flow mass and so on. Many of them have been unavailable without using sophisticated and expensive instrumentation. In the article are described two ways of fuel consumption measuring which are based on intake air consumption and knowledge about air-fuel ratio. First of them is founded on voltage output of oxygen sensor, the second on short (long) term <b>fuel</b> <b>trim.</b> As is shown at the end the second way gives more accurately results...|$|E
50|$|The boat has two 1,500-liter tanks {{with fresh}} water and <b>fuel.</b> <b>Trimming</b> {{can be carried}} out with an {{electric}} pump, which is normal procedure, or with compressed air as fall-back, if the trim-pump fails. The main ballast tanks, of 8,000 liters, are always filled and emptied with compressed air, and can flush up to 400 liters of water in/out per second. Nautilus can go from sailing on the surface to periscope depth in approximately 20 seconds. The boat has a theoretical crush depth of between 400 - 500 m, but, as a precaution, the submarine only nominally dives to 100 m.|$|R
50|$|The general {{construction}} of the Type 2 is substantially different {{than that of the}} Type 1. In the forward part of the vessel is the warhead, followed by the <b>fuel,</b> <b>trimming</b> and 2 steering air tanks. The forward part of the midsection is occupied by the 2600 L hydrogen peroxide chamber. This cylindrical tank required a complicated {{construction of}} welding 5 ribs evenly spaced around the circumference, then coating the inside of the tank with tin, then asphalt and finally with a thick tin plating. Construction of each tank took on average 2 weeks and the skill required was very high.|$|R

5000|$|In May 2009 a Greek {{judge ruled}} against Daimler and cleared the car {{allowing}} sales {{to begin in}} Greece. The judge answering to Daimler's demand to ban the Chinese vehicle from entering the Greek market said that “The impression the Noble makes on a third and informed party by its visual appearance is different {{to the one that}} is made to the same person by the Smart... It is commonly accepted that the decision over buying a new car cannot be based only on the exterior characteristics but many other technical specifications such as the power of the engine, <b>fuel</b> consumption, <b>trim</b> specification, retail price and dealers’ network.” ...|$|R
50|$|The tjugofem (= 25 in Swedish) Saloon was {{released}} in a batch of 300 to celebrate SAABs 25th year in the UK. These had the 1985cc 8-Valve engine with Bosch K-Jetronic <b>fuel</b> injection. Interior <b>trim</b> was blue turbo velour with a special gear knob with the cars number. Exterior the model was a standard non-turbo apart from alloy wheels, Tjugofem pinstriping and Turbo style rear spoiler.|$|R
60|$|Clear away! There {{was nothing}} they wouldn't have cleared away, or couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It {{was done in}} a minute. Every movable was packed off, {{as if it were}} {{dismissed}} from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were <b>trimmed,</b> <b>fuel</b> was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to see upon a winter's night.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fuel {{conservation}} programs are instruments used by airlines to improve operational efficiency and <b>trim</b> <b>fuel</b> related costs. Identifying fuel savings to accurately manage these programs {{has always been}} an issue due to the operation volatility and lack of reliable data. Advanced data management systems were developed to support these programs, but having means to identify fuel savings is still compelling. A new methodology based on segmented fuel consumption profiles is proposed as a tool to accurately identify fuel savings across periods. This approach allows for a detailed fuel consumption analysis with full operation coverage...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} man’s {{dependency}} on energy has increased rapidly {{mainly because of}} the increase in the living standards and use of advance technologies, So that non ‐ renewable fossil fuel reserves being exhausted and there are issues related to their GHG (Green House Gas) emissions such as, carbon m onoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), and methane (CH 4), it has become essential to look forward the use of renewable or inexhaustible <b>fuels</b> to <b>trim</b> down the trouble on our non renewable fuels and for resolving the problem of emissions. In this work, perform ance and emission parameter were investigated on a single cylinder four stroke diesel engine. This engine was modified to run with Biogas &Diesel in dual fuel mode. The experimental results show that 25 % diesel save at low load and emission of CO 2,CO and H C slightly increases with increasing load. Exhaust gas temperature also increases with load in both fuel modes (Diesel as well as Diesel - Biogas) ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{body styles}} were, once again, four-door sedan, two-door hardtop coupé, and five-door station wagon. The C110 was more fussy in its styling than its predecessor, {{particularly}} so in wagon form, where unusually for a wagon design, no windows were fitted between the C and D pillars. Its appearance {{seems to be}} influenced by the 1970–1975 Citroën SM. The C110 was the first version to return to the round rear tail and brake lights introduced in 1963 albeit with dual units from the previous generation, and the appearance has become a traditional Skyline feature. The styling also influenced a smaller, more affordable two-door coupe, called the Silvia, introduced in 1975. Nissan introduced its emission control technology, primarily consisting of <b>fuel</b> injection on <b>trim</b> packages ending with an [...] "E", using the moniker Nissan NAPS also in 1975.|$|R
