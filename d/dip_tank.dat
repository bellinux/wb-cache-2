40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} (November 2012) on the communal dipping system in Mnisi, Mpumalanga Province of South Africa to detect levels of blue tick resistance to commonly used acaricides. The larvae obtained from engorged females of the one host tick Rhipicephalus (B). microplus from twelve communal dipping areas were tested against various concentrations of amitraz, chlorfenvinphos and cypermethrin using the Shaw Larval Immersion Test method. Only R. (B). microplus ticks were identified from all sample areas, indicating a displacement of the indigenous R. (B). decoloratus tick in this area. Resistance testing using the Shaw Larval Immersion Test showed that no resistance to chlorfenvinphos was detected {{at any of the}} <b>dip</b> <b>tanks,</b> which was in keeping with the absence of known use of this product in the area. An important finding was the rapid development of resistance to the pyrethroids, which had only been in use for four months prior to conducting the study. Only one area (Hlalakane) yielded a R(B). spp population that was wholly susceptible to all three compounds. Resistance to amitraz was variable, with half (six out of 12) of the <b>dip</b> <b>tanks</b> comprising susceptible R(B). spp populations and two <b>dip</b> <b>tanks</b> with emerging resistance to amitraz.

40|$|Tick Infestation and Tick Borne Diseases (TBDs), are {{important}} conditions that affect livestock health and productivity in Zimbabwe. Ticks {{are responsible for}} the direct damage to livestock hides through feeding habits, damage to udders, teats and scrotum. Ticks transmit a large variety of diseases that affect livestock the major diseases include Babesiosis, Anaplasmosis, Theileriosis and Ehrlichiosis.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of BTB in the cattle population of selected <b>dip</b> <b>tanks</b> in Swaziland. Furthermore, the zoonotic risk to farmers whose cattle are infected with BTB was assessed by means of a questionnaire survey. Abattoir surveillance identified 16 <b>dip</b> <b>tanks</b> of study where at least 10 % of the cattle were tested for BTB using the comparative intra-dermal skin. In five of these <b>dip</b> <b>tanks,</b> the same cattle were tested for BTB using the IFN-γ Test. Eight BTB skin test positive animals were slaughtered and a detailed post mortem examination was conducted and samples collected for the isolation of M. bovis. Concurrent with BTB testing, a questionnaire survey was conducted to determine risk factors for humans. The prevalence of BTB was found to be 6. 75 % in the study population and 20 % of BTB positive animals were diagnosed by both the CIST and IFN-γ, indicating a correlation for the test positive animals in the two tests. M. bovis was isolated from seven of the eight animals slaughtered. Farmers’ knowledge of BTB as a cattle disease and serious zoonosis is insufficient and inadequate while consumption practices of products of bovine origin exposes them to the risk of infection by M. bovis. There is a need to investigate the extent of M. bovis infections in the human population. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013. gm 2014 Veterinary Tropical Diseasesunrestricte...|$|R

Using mixed bacterial populations optimum conditions for degradation of Amitraz in the laboratory were determined. Bacterial cultures degraded Amitraz most efficiently in media supplemented with yeast extract or with a high content of sterile cattle faeces.

40|$|Bovine {{babesiosis}} occurs {{worldwide and}} is one of the most costly tick-borne cattle diseases in the tropics. The Soutpansberg region of the Northern Province in South Africa is endemic for Babesia bigemina, but Babesia bovis was only reported from this area in the 1980 s when some farmers experienced heavy losses due to Asiatic redwater. The main objectives of the study were to confirm the presence of the tick vector Boophilus microplus in the Soutpansberg region where it had not been reported previously, and to determine the seroprevalence of Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina in cattle in these areas. Other objectives were to assess the relative numbers of Boophilus microplus in relation to Boophilus decoloratus and to determine a possible displacement of Boophilus decoloratus by Boophilus microplus. It was also the intention to map the potential distribution of the Boophilus ticks in the area and to more accurately predict the further spread of Boophilus microplus. Tick collections and serological surveys were carried out during 1999 and 2000 on cattle at 30 communal dip tanks and on 5 commercial farms in the Soutpansberg, Dzanani, Mutale, Thohoyandou and Vuwani Districts. Of the 25, 042 Boophilus ticks collected, 93. 9 % were Boophilus microplus and 6. 1 % were Boophilus decoloratus. At 8 of the dip tanks/farms both Boophilusspecies were found, and the displacement of Boophilus decoloratus by Boophilus microplus was monitored at 4 of these sites. There was a distinct displacement of Boophilus decoloratus at those dip tanks/farms where repeated tick collection was possible. Cattle at the communal dip tanks carried larger Boophilustick numbers than cattle on the commercial farms. Boophilus microplus was the most common Boophilustick collected at the dip tanks, and during the survey it also became the Boophilustick most commonly found on the commercial farms. CLIMEX was used to map the potential distribution of Boophilus microplus and Boophilus decoloratus in the survey area during years with average as well as double average rainfall. Ecoclimatic Indices were computed for each sampling location, using 30 years of climatic information. The displacement patterns of Boophilus species were also discussed. Blood samples (n = 2201) were collected for Indirect Fluorescent Antibody (IFA) testing. Serological evidence of Babesia bovis was detected in 97 % of the communal <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> herds and in 100 % of the commercial farm herds. The overall seroprevalence of Babesia bovis in the <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> herds during 1999 and 2000 was 63 %. The seroprevalence of Babesia bovis in the commercial herds increased significantly from 19 % in 1999 to 57. 5 % in 2000. There was a slight increase in endemic stability in comparable herds from 1999 to 2000. The increase in seroprevalence and endemic stability probably came as a result of the influx of Boophilus microplus into the survey area. There was a significant correlation between the presence of Boophilus microplus in the survey area and the increasing seroprevalence of Babesia bovis, which confirms that Boophilus microplus is the main and probably the only vector of Babesia bovis in South Africa. Serological evidence of Babesia bigemina was detected in 100 % of communal <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> and commercial farm herds. The overall seroprevalence of Babesia bigemina in the <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> herds decreased significantly from 56. 1 % in 1999 to 49. 3 % in 2000. There was a marked decrease in endemic stability for Babesia bigemina in comparable <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> herds from 1999 to 2000. The decrease in seroprevalence and endemic stability to Babesia bigemina in these herds was probably due to the substantial increase of Boophilus microplus in the survey area. This may indicate that Babesia bigeminaa was transmitted less effectively by Boophilus microplus than by Boophilus decoloratus. The seroprevalence of Babesia bovis was significantly higher than that of Babesia bigemina at those dip tanks/farms where only Boophilus microplus was present during 1999 and 2000. This may be explained by the possibility that Boophilus microplus transmits Babesia bigemina less effectively than it transmits Babesia bovis. This survey raises several questions on the ability of the African strain of Boophilus microplus to transmit African Babesiastrains. There are indications that the African Boophilus microplus is different to the Australian Boophilus microplus. More research needs to be done to investigate how the Babesia species are transmitted in Africa. Dissertation (MSc (Veterinary Sciences)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|East Coast Fever (ECF) - 2 Cue: For cattle keepers in East and Central Africa, one of {{the most}} serious {{diseases}} to threaten their herds is East Coast fever. The disease is of particular danger to young animals, especially those of exotic breeds. Spread to livestock by brown ear ticks, the first sign of infection that cattle owners should be aware of is a swelling that occurs just below the ear of the animal. A few days after this swelling takes place, the animal develops a fever, and within a week it may begin to experience other symptoms. These can include difficulty in breathing and a soft cough, caused by fluid in the lungs; diarrhoea; a general wasting or weakening of muscle strength, and unusual whiteness in the eyes and gums. Treatment of the disease is possible, using drugs such as parvaquone or buparvaquone, commonly known as Parvexon. But farmers should also consider protecting their animals from the disease where possible. Dr Jaribu Sultan is a veterinary specialist working for the NGO Farm-Africa in northern Tanzania. He spoke recently to Lazarus Laiser about East Coast fever, and in particular, how cattle owners can protect their animals against this deadly disease. IN:		?East Coast fever is one of ? OUT:		?many problems of animal health care. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 12 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Jaribu Sultan speaking about the value of investing in livestock health. Transcript Sultan	East Coast fever is {{one of the}} killer diseases in most of the livestock, and the mortality rate can reach as high as 100 %, especially to the young animals of exotic breeds. And in relation to the indigenous cattle, it also causes a lot of death to these young animals. Laiser	How can the farmer prevent the disease spreading to other animals? Sultan	East Coast fever can be prevented by two methods. First, animals can be dipped; animals can be sent to the <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> and dipped there. Or the animal can be sprayed by the farmer, using a knapsack sprayer, with a reputable acaricide. And the second method is through immunisation. They can be immunised or vaccinated against East Coast fever when they are still young or even when they are adult. The vaccine is a long-life vaccine, so you don?t need to repeat it. So it is economical actually to immunise your animal. Firstly you will protect the animal, and second, you can even reduce the cost of acaricides. Laiser	One of the ways of preventing the disease is to spray or dip the animals. Is it good for a farmer to spray an animal himself or herself? Sultan	Yes, it is much better if a farmer knows how to mix the acaricide, and he knows the area where ticks are mostly found in the body of the animal, then he can spray himself. That is very good, because at least he can protect the animal. But in case, if the farmer does not know, it is much better to use a <b>dip</b> <b>tank,</b> if the <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> is available in the village. Or else the farmer can also get assistance from a nearby Community Based Animal Health Worker, or can even ask a village extension officer, so that he can be trained. He can be shown how to calculate the dosage of acaricide with water, and shown the areas where he is supposed to spray the animal on the body. Laiser	How many livestock can be affected, according to your experience ? you are living in the villages and treating animals all the time? Sultan	Actually if you look at the trend of the life-cycle of the ticks, you find that, especially during the rainy season the incidence of East Coast fever is very high. And you may also find that many animals are suffering. And the high mortality rate is to the young animals ? it is very very high. If you don?t protect the young animals, then you may eventually lose most of them. But it is advisable that farmers should adhere to the advice from the extension officers, that they should regularly dip their animals or spray their animals, so that they can reduce the tick burdens, and hence reduce even tick borne diseases, and especially East Coast fever. Laiser	Do you have any word you would like to say to the farmers? Sultan	Yes, thank you very much. What I would like to say to the farmers, is that the farmers should come together, even to form their own small association. So that they will be able to discuss the welfare of their animals, and how can they also increase the production. They have to organise themselves to manage the <b>dip</b> <b>tank.</b> Suppose someone comes from outside and wants to manage the <b>dip</b> <b>tank,</b> they have to go there and dip their animals. Not that they send two out of 100 hundred animals to dip there, because they feel that if they dip all animals that is very expensive. But what I advise them, is that if you have 50 cattle, and you sell one, that money can assist you to solve many problems of animal health care. End of track.

40|$|Citrus {{is grown}} {{in almost all}} {{countries}} with a sub-tropical or tropical climate. Africa produces about 7 % of global citrus production representing 67 362 564 tonnes in the 2003 - 04 season. Of these countries, South Africa {{is the most important}} citrus producer with the bulk of its fruit being exported to mainly European countries. Although South Africa is the world’s fourteenth biggest producer, it is currently ranked third in terms of global export volumes. An {{increase in the number of}} foodborne disease outbreaks over the past few decades has been related to the shift towards consumption of fresh produce and growing world trade. Other factors include changing demographic profiles, changing farm practises, extensive distribution and handling networks, increased consumption of unprocessed products, emergence of new pathogens and more effective detection methods. Shigella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Hepatitis virus, Caliciviridae virus, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholera are some of the microorganisms implicated in disease outbreaks caused by the consumption of fresh produce. This dissertation focuses on citrus fruit safety and a selected foodborne pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Salmonella has been implicated in several outbreaks associated with the consumption of unpasteurized orange juice, mangoes, cantaloupes, sprouts and tomatoes. S. enterica sv. Typhimurium is also a water-borne pathogen, and its importance in agricultural irrigation and packhouse wash water was also studied. The presence of S. enterica sv. Typhimurium in biofilms in packhouse water and on fruit was finally investigated since biofilms are known to harbour a number of these pathogens. Biofilm formation was monitored in the warm water <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> using a photo acoustic monitoring device and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and enumeration. Water sources, i. e. bathroom, handwash stations, irrigation water and warm water baths had high total viable bacterial counts and faecalassociated contamination. Biofilms also formed within the packhouse <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> at an increased rate. The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to investigate the presence of Salmonella in the citrus export chain. No Salmonella spp. could be detected. S. enterica sv. Typhimurium survived for up to four weeks on the surface of citrus fruit under simulated export conditions. However, Salmonella is not able to survive uninterrupted cold storage conditions for a period longer than two or three weeks. Scanning Electron Micrographs showed that Salmonella is capable of attaching to and colonizing the citrus fruit surface and is able to be incorporated into existing biofilms in warm water tanks of packhouses. This study showed that Salmonella can thrive in packhouse water and potentially be a continuous source of contamination for fruit moving through the infected warm water <b>dip</b> <b>tank.</b> Everyone participating in fruit production, storage and post-harvest handling of fresh fruit should be involved in ensuring quality and safety, since events in the orchard can affect storage life, and incorrect handling during marketing may nullify all previous efforts of quality maintenance. To minimize the occurrence of these pathogens in the fruit chain from production to consumption, several basic good agricultural practices and food safety systems needs to be incorporated and managed correctly.

30|$|During the outbreak, the {{quarantine}} was not executed properly as pastoralists could still move their animals from one village to another {{to search for}} pastures. Also farmers were still selling animals to nearby country (Kenya) via unauthorized routes. The movement of animals from Tanzania to Kenya either for search of good pasture or for sale has been reported (Diallo et al. 2000) to facilitate further {{spread of the disease}} to unaffected areas during the 2006 – 07 RVF outbreak. It was observed that good pastures were found in the low land areas where mosquitoes were also found in large numbers and facilitated the disease transmission. However, the short difference in time of occurrence of disease in different regions of Tanzania is an indication that, those foci of outbreaks were caused by other factors other than animal movement as it was also highlighted by (FAO 2000). The results also indicated that few farmers used <b>dipping</b> <b>tanks</b> and the majority used spray pumps to control vector borne diseases. Since some of the farmers owned large number of animals, {{it was not possible to}} effectively spray all of them.

40|$|Arsenic-based {{compounds}} {{have been}} used for cattle dipping for about half a century to combat East Coast Fever in cattle in South Africa. The government introduced a compulsory dipping programme in communal areas to eradicate the disease in 1911. Concern has been raised regarding the ecological legacy of the use of arsenic-based compounds in these areas. We investigated the incidence of arsenic residue in soil at 10 dip sites in the Vhembe district of Limpopo Province, South Africa. We found high levels of arsenic contamination at a depth of 300 mm at some sites. Control samples indicated that these high arsenic levels are the result of the application of inorganic arsenic. Variation of arsenic concentrations is attributed to duration of exposure to the chemical, soil properties and distance from the <b>dip</b> <b>tank.</b> Concerns are raised regarding the structural condition of the dip tanks, encroaching villages and possible health threats to the human population in the area.

40|$|A {{multi-purpose}} prepregging {{machine has}} been designed and built for NASA Langley Research Center. The machine has numerous advantages over existing units due to its various modular components. Each of these can be used individually or simultaneously depending on the required prepregging method. A reverse roll coater provides the ability to prepare thin films from typical hot-melt thermoset formulations. Also, if necessary, the design allows direct fiber impregnation within the reverse roll coater gap. Included in the impregnation module is a solution <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> allowing the fabrication of thermoplastic prepregs from solution. The proceeding modules within the unit consist of four nip stations, two hot-plates, a hot-sled option and a high temperature oven. This paper describes the advantages of such a modular construction and discusses the various processing combinations available to the prepregger. A variety of high performance prepreg material systems were produced on IM 7 (Hercules) carbon fiber. These included LaRC RP 46, a PMR-type resin processed from methanol and two polyamide acids, LaRC IA and LaRC ITPI, prpregged from N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP). Parameters involved {{in the production of}} these prepreg materials are presented as are the mechanical properties of the resulting good quality laminates. A brief introduction into the existing prepregging science is presented. Topics relating to solution prepregging are identified with a focus on the current research effort and its future development...|$|E
40|$|A {{serological}} {{survey of}} leptospirosis in cattle originating from rural {{communities of the}} province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) in South Africa was carried out between March 2001 and December 2003. The survey {{was designed as a}} 2 -stage survey, using the local <b>dip</b> <b>tank</b> as the primary sampling point. In total, 2021 animals from 379 dip tanks in 33 magisterial districts were sampled and tested with the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). The apparent prevalence at district level was adjusted for clustering and diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity and displayed in maps. The prevalence of leptospirosis in cattle originating from communal grazing areas of KZN was found to be 19. 4 % with a 95 % confidence interval of 14. 8 - 24. 1 %. At district level the prevalence of leptospirosis varied from 0 to 63 % of cattle. Bovine leptospirosis was found to occur in communal grazing areas throughout the province with the exception of 2 districts. The southeastern regions showed a higher prevalence than other areas of the province; while in some of the northern and western districts a lower prevalence was noted. Several serovars were detected by the MAT and although Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona occurred most frequently, serovars tarrasovi, bratislava, hardjo, canicola and icterohaemorrhagica were also frequently identified. The findings of the survey are discussed...|$|E

There are also two old churches, {{some of the earliest}} cottages built between 1854 and 1860 in Vigne Lane {{and at the end of}} Vlei Street, as well as an old shepherd's cottage built prior to 1840, which is now incorporated into [...] "The Old Potter's Inn" [...] building on Greyton’s Main Road.|$|R
40|$|An unpredicted {{outbreak}} of African animal trypanosomosis or nagana in 1990 in north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal necessitated an emergency control programme, utilising the extensive cattledipping {{system in the}} area, {{as well as a}} reassessment of the tsetse and trypanosomosis problem in the province. Since 1990, sporadic blood sampling of cattle at the <b>dip</b> <b>tanks</b> in the naganainfested areas were undertaken to identify trypanosome species involved and to determine the infection prevalence in cattle. The distribution and species composition of the tsetse populations in the area were also investigated. From November 2005 to November 2007 selected <b>dip</b> <b>tanks</b> were surveyed for trypanosome infection prevalence. During April 2005 to August 2009 the distribution and abundance of tsetse populations were assessed with odour-baited H traps. The tsetse and trypanosome distribution maps were updated and potential correlations between tsetse apparent densities (ADs) and the prevalence of trypanosomosis were assessed. Glossina brevipalpis Newstead and Glossina austeni Newstead were recorded in locations where they have not previously been collected. No significant correlation between tsetse relative abundance and nagana prevalence was found, which indicated complex interactions between tsetse fly presence and disease prevalence. This was epitomised by data that indicated that despite large differences in the ADs of G. austeni and G. brevipalpis, trypanosome infection prevalence was similar in all three districts in the area. This study clearly indicated that both tsetse species play significant roles in trypanosome transmission and that it will be essential that any control strategy, which aims at sustainable management of the disease, should target both species.

50|$|The impossibility {{must not}} be {{the fault of the}} accused. In R v Korsten, an accused person took his cattle to be dipped in a {{township}} dip, but was prevented from dipping them by the township foreman, because he had not complied with a by-law which provided that no person should use the <b>dipping</b> <b>tank</b> except upon production of coupons, previously purchased, entitling him to do so. The accused's excuse for not having purchased such coupons was {{that he did not know}} that this was necessary. The court held that, inasmuch as the Animal Diseases Act imposed an absolute duty on the accused to dip his cattle, these facts afforded no defence.|$|R
