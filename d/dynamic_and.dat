5|$|As {{well as the}} patient, {{the partner}} of an injured person {{frequently}} needs support and counseling. It can help with adjustment to a new relationship <b>dynamic</b> <b>and</b> self-image (such as being placed {{in the role of}} caretaker) or with stresses that arise in the sexual relationship. Frequently, partners of injured people must contend with feelings like guilt, anger, anxiety, and exhaustion while dealing with the added financial burden of lost wages and medical expenses. Counseling aims to strengthen the relationship by improving communication and trust.|$|E

5|$|Following the reconciliation, a USA Today story {{detailed}} White's situation. Although White endured 20 flights {{for travel}} during his season at Iowa State, the Rockets' NBA schedule called for 98 flights. White {{had attempted to}} cope with travel in college through use of Benadryl and Xanax, but found both reduced his energy level, although it never showed in his statistical output. White cited that his concern for the increased number of flights and long term use {{of these types of}} medication could lead to dependence and addiction (which is common concern and a point of consensus concern regarding benzodiazepines in the medical community. White likened mental health conditions to a day-to-day physical injury in which symptoms can be <b>dynamic</b> <b>and</b> unclear, but support and policy should be adequately proactive).|$|E
40|$|This thesis, {{which is}} {{submitted}} for consideration of an award of Doctor of Philosophy {{is a record}} of research work carried out {{under the supervision of}} Professor Sue Grimes in the Centre for Environmental Research, BruneI University and, except where due reference is made, has been presented for no other degree. This thesis provides a background on the effects of applied and magnetic fields on crystallisation, and summarises the analytical techniques employed for characterisation and analysis. The study of applied fields was carried out on the crystallisation of one main system-solid nonadecane. This was then studied further to establish the effects of a solvent and a mixed solid system on the crystallisation of nonadecane. The systems studied were the crystallisations of: static <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> nonadecane, static <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> nonadecane in heptane, static <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> nonadecane <b>and</b> heneicosane, static <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> nonadecane <b>and</b> heneicosane in heptane <b>and</b> static <b>and</b> <b>dynamic</b> nonadecane <b>and</b> crude oil. The results of these studies showed that the magnetic and applied fields can affec...|$|R

5|$|From Aristotle until Darwin, {{the natural}} world was {{predominantly}} considered static and unchanging. Prior to The Origin of Species, there was little appreciation or understanding of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>and</b> reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment. An exception is the 1789 publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White (1720–1793), considered {{by some to be}} one of the earliest texts on ecology. While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution, he was one of the founders of soil ecology, and he made note of the first ecological experiment in The Origin of Species. Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.|$|E
5|$|L'Homme-Rivière is {{a statue}} {{representing}} a log driver at work. The logs are heavily stylized, reduced {{to little more}} than cylinders. The driver and his hook, however, are shown as transforming into a wooden plant. Its location, in a tight space between two tall buildings, gives the sculpture the appearance of travelling down a river gorge. L'Homme-Rivière is highly <b>dynamic,</b> <b>and</b> has been described as looking as though it is about to spill onto the sidewalk. The log driver is a symbolic figure in the history and culture of Quebec, thanks notably to Félix-Antoine Savard's famous novel Menaud, maître draveur.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} women soccer players of all time, and by many as the best ever, Hamm was an athletic, <b>dynamic,</b> <b>and</b> technically gifted striker, renowned for her speed, skill, footwork, stamina, and ability on the ball, as well as her consistency. An excellent, agile dribbler, she was highly regarded for her control, as well as her grace, pace, and elegance in possession. A prolific goalscorer, she was known for her powerful and accurate striking ability, although she was also a creative and hard-working forward, and a team player, who was equally capable of assisting many goals for her teammates, due to her accurate passing, and was also willing to aid her teammates defensively when possession was lost. She was capable of playing in any offensive position.|$|E

5|$|Shostakovich's musical {{influence}} on later composers outside the former Soviet Union {{has been relatively}} slight, although Alfred Schnittke took up his eclecticism and his contrasts between the <b>dynamic</b> <b>and</b> the static, and some of André Previn's music shows clear links to Shostakovich's style of orchestration. His influence {{can also be seen}} in some Nordic composers, such as Lars-Erik Larsson. Many of his Russian contemporaries, and his pupils at the Leningrad Conservatory were strongly influenced by his style (including German Okunev, Boris Tishchenko, whose 5th Symphony of 1978 is dedicated to Shostakovich's memory, Sergei Slonimsky, and others). Shostakovich's conservative idiom has grown increasingly popular with audiences both within and beyond Russia, as the avant-garde has declined in influence and debate about his political views has developed.|$|E
