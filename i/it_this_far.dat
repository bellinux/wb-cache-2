25|$|The South American teams {{performed}} strongly, {{with all}} five {{advancing to the}} knockout stages (four as group winners), and four made the quarter-finals (the only team from South America to not make <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>far</b> was Chile, who lost to Brazil); but only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.|$|E

Insects that have made <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>far</b> lose any chance of escape. It is also studded with digestive glands, which secrete digestive enzymes into the digestive fluid.|$|E
5000|$|Even when {{measured}} for a [...] "dummy head" [...] of idealized geometry, HRTF {{are complicated}} functions of frequency {{and the three}} spatial variables. For distances greater than 1&#160;m from the head, however, the HRTF {{can be said to}} attenuate inversely with range. <b>It</b> is <b>this</b> <b>far</b> field HRTF, H(f, θ, φ), that has most often been measured. At closer range, the difference in level observed between the ears can grow quite large, even in the low-frequency region within which negligible level differences are observed in the far field.|$|R

5000|$|From Three Rock Woods on the {{northern}} slopes of Three Rock Mountain, the Slang flows down through Ticknock, passing Ballinteer north to Dundrum, where <b>it</b> (sometimes known <b>this</b> <b>far</b> as [...] "Ticknock Stream") receives the Wyckham Stream, and then loops east, north, and west, coming to a mill pond north of the Dundrum Town Centre retail complex. The Slang then runs north via Windy Arbour and subsequently joins the River Dodder at Milltown, near the Nine Arches viaduct, now used by the Luas.|$|R
500|$|... "I {{would also}} like to note that even those that haven't found this fake feud {{particularly}} amusing must find a bit of sweetness in it. After all, these are hosts that have constantly expressed how lost they feel without their writers. There's something wonderful in seeing three comedians doing each other a favor by creating some silly material and taking <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>far,</b> just to help fill time. This one dumb fight alone has taken up so many episodes. Bless their little late night hearts for helping each other out." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Renner Brown of Entertainment Weekly {{praised the}} album's variety and scale: [...] "By nature, Radiohead albums {{will always be}} {{somewhat}} epic, {{but this one is}} more consistently grandiose than any of the band's releases since 2000's masterpiece Kid A." [...] Jon Pareles, writing for the New York Times, wrote that A Moon Shaped Pool was perhaps [...] " [...] darkest statement – though the one with the band's most pastoral surface." [...] He praised Yorke's vocals and Greenwood's string arrangements, writing: [...] "Both Mr. Yorke and Mr. Greenwood are relentlessly inquisitive listeners, lovers of melody and explorers of idioms, makers of puzzles who don't shy away from emotion." [...] Chris Barton of the Los Angeles Times described A Moon Shaped Pool as [...] "a rich and engrossing listen that somehow finds more undiscovered territory for a band that has built a career on doing just that." [...] MTV's Simon Vozick-Levinson wrote: [...] "A Moon Shaped Pool provides a thrilling answer to the existential concerns that confront any band that's made <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>far</b> ... After all this time, hearing these five old friends challenge themselves into a new phase of evolution can still blow even a jaded fan's mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nicholas [...] "Nick" [...] Pedro [...] (born July 9, 1981) auditioned in New York and is from Taunton, Massachusetts. Pedro {{dropped out}} of the {{competition}} the previous season after forgetting the lyrics of [...] "Buttercup" [...] in Hollywood. This audition, he gave a soulful rendition of [...] "Fly Me to the Moon" [...] which earned him a second chance to fulfill his Idol aspirations. Nick's feat seemed especially noteworthy as, unlike all other contestants making <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>far,</b> Nick received no experience ever onstage prior to Idol.|$|E
30|$|Glycomannans. Glycomannan, a glucose/mannose polymer {{derived from}} a plant called Amorphophallus konjak, which has several English names such as devil tongue, {{elephant}} yam and umbrella arum. It has unique hydroscopic abilities and will on contact with water swell and form a viscous gel, which like other gels will delay gastric emptying and intestinal transit time. It {{has been shown to}} be effective in delaying absorption of digestible energy. <b>It</b> has <b>this</b> <b>far</b> mainly been used in Japan and other Asian countries to treat diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Dietary supply of konjak mannans has been shown in experimental animals to alter the flora and reduce tumorigenesis. It is also effective to control of diarrhoea in enteral nutrition, especially in elderly patients, and to increase the Bifidobacteria flora.|$|R
5000|$|Remarkably, this {{learning}} rule is fairly biologically plausible {{because the only}} information needed to change the weights is provided by [...] "local" [...] information. That is, the connection (or synapse biologically speaking) does not need information about {{anything other than the}} two neurons <b>it</b> connects. <b>This</b> is <b>far</b> more biologically realistic than the information needed by a connection in many other neural network training algorithms, such as backpropagation.|$|R

[...] "There's all the promise {{in the world for}} a greater than he from Bleakhouse Fawn, or Alberta Maid, or Moravia's Nellie Signal. We missed <b>it</b> <b>this</b> year so <b>far,</b> but next year, or the year after, soon or late, King Polo is going to be {{responsible}} for a real humdinger of winner." ...|$|R

30|$|Probiotic {{treatment}} {{has never been}} given the chance as an alternative treatment, <b>it</b> has only <b>this</b> <b>far</b> been tried as a treatment complementary {{to all the other}} standard treatments. As discussed above, a series of auxiliary measures and particularly mechanical ventilation and treatment with various drugs, including antibiotics but also clinical nutrition solutions belong to those factors which promote super-inflammation and indirectly infection. Enteral nutrition formulas are also known to induce loss of intestinal barrier function, promotes bacterial translocation, and impair host immune defense, a phenomenon, observed in humans and further elucidated in animal studies.|$|R
5000|$|The single {{received}} generally favourable reviews at {{the time}} of its release. Cashbox Magazine described Johnson's work as [...] "full of touching ballads with all the right production touches, subtle instrumentation and poignant vocals necessary to keep the tenderness from becoming insipid." [...] In 1978, Johnson was quoted as saying, [...] "I knew it was potentially a successful song but I didn't think <b>it</b> would go <b>this</b> <b>far.</b> <b>It</b> seemed, well, too mature. The experience of being married or living with someone is hard to identify with for younger people." ...|$|R
5000|$|Roger Penrose criticises this: I {{wish to make}} {{it clear}} that, as <b>it</b> stands, <b>this</b> is <b>far</b> from a {{resolution}} of the cat paradox. For {{there is nothing in the}} formalism of quantum mechanics that demands that a state of consciousness cannot involve the simultaneous perception of a live and a dead cat. [...] However, the mainstream view (without necessarily endorsing many-worlds) is that decoherence is the mechanism that forbids such simultaneous perception.|$|R
50|$|At this point, {{the last}} {{audience}} speller is eliminated (he or she simply is called repeatedly in succession and given increasingly difficult words).

50|$|The Gap FC rose {{through the}} lower {{divisions}} in its early years, then spent a decade in Division 2 after winning promotion from the Third Division in 1966. During this period, The Gap reached the quarter-finals of the 1974 Ampol Cup, the only time to date <b>it</b> has advanced <b>this</b> <b>far</b> in a Brisbane senior cup competition. Following relegation in 1976, The Gap has mostly competed at {{the second and third}} level of the Brisbane football system. The Gap FC spent two seasons in the Brisbane Premier League in 2002 and 2003 after winning a promotion play-off against Pine Rivers United in 2001.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time Colville is packing to leave, at Palazzo Pinti the women are distressed. Miss Graham is weeping because she thinks Colville leaving is her doing. Mrs. Bowen is also upset because she didn’t mean for <b>it</b> to go <b>this</b> <b>far.</b> Finally Mrs. Bowen decides to write Colville a letter stating {{that there is no}} need for him to leave and invites him to lunch the {{following}} day to put everything behind them. This is the letter Colville receives when he gets back from his walk. He declines the invitation because he truly feels it was best if he left Florence.|$|R
40|$|Blockchain {{technologies}} {{offer new}} open source-based opportunities for developing {{new types of}} digital platforms and services. While research on the topic is emerging, <b>it</b> has <b>this</b> <b>far</b> been predominantly focused to technical and legal issues. To broaden our understanding of blockchain technology based services and platforms, we build on earlier literature on payments and payment platforms and propose a research agenda divided into three focal areas of 1) organizational issues; 2) {{issues related to the}} competitive environment; and 3) technology design issues. We discuss several salient themes within each of these areas, and derive a set of research question for each theme, highlighting the need to address both risks and opportunities for users, as well as different types of stakeholder organizations. With this research agenda, we contribute to the discussion on future avenues for Information Systems research on blockchain technology based platforms and services. Peer reviewe...|$|R

60|$|The {{shutters}} of {{the window}} were closed, but enough light streamed through the chinks and crevices {{for them to see}} dimly. There was odd rubbish strewn all about, and in one corner a heap of decaying sacks. To these both rushed, and threw some on the floor by the door, placing their feet on them to keep them firm, just as with a rush the men came against <b>it.</b> <b>This</b> door was <b>far</b> stronger than the one below, but it gave before the weight.|$|R
500|$|Speaking of Sarah's {{death and}} Zoe's false imprisonment, Lister stated: [...] "She's {{in a very}} {{difficult}} place. She's lost her best friend and there's so much history there and she's finished her degree — well she didn't even finish her degree, she failed that — so she's in a limbo land anyway. She's working silly jobs and she's not in a very good place at all in any aspect of her life. Oh, and she's in prison on suspicion of murder..." [...] When asked during another interview with Digital Spy about how the character is coping with being in prison, Lister stated: [...] "Not very well! It's all completely overwhelming for her. She can't get her head around the fact that her best friend's dead and the fact that she's being accused of murdering her is ridiculous. She's worried that because <b>it's</b> got <b>this</b> <b>far</b> its ludicrous, so who's to say that she won't be sent down?" ...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{etiquette}} expert Pamela Holland, {{there are}} no set guidelines for push presents. [...] "The standard {{is that there is}} no standard," [...] she said. [...] "It does make sense to have etiquette around wedding or baby shower gifts because you're inviting other people into <b>it.</b> But <b>this</b> is <b>far</b> too intimate to have a rule." [...] In general it is the woman who lets her man know about push presents, not the other way around, although there can be peer pressure from friends to buy one on either the man or the woman.|$|R
50|$|Most climbers {{approach}} Crystal Peak {{from the}} east, in particular via the Crystal Lakes basin. This approach, a pleasant hike, follows jeep trails until treeline and Lower Crystal Lake. Four wheel drive vehicles can generally make <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>far.</b> A trail {{on the north}} side of the lake takes climbers to Upper Crystal Lake, where gentle scree slopes provide access to the ridges north of the summit.|$|E

Mr. Päts, the Estonian head of state, specifically praised the school and stated in his speech, [...] "We could doubt if we, in our nation’s life, would have made <b>it</b> <b>this</b> <b>far,</b> if it weren’t for Treffner Gymnasium." ...|$|E
50|$|Today, Tudor-Pole {{concentrates}} {{partly on}} acting, but focuses mainly upon his new one-man-show, performing live shows {{described as a}} 'One Man Stadium Show'. He has re-formed Tenpole Tudor from time to time, notably in 2001, with Darrell Bath on guitar, Donagh O'Leary on bass and Ben Standage on drums. He currently performs his one-man live show throughout Britain and, in 2009, released a Tenpole Tudor album titled Made <b>It</b> <b>This</b> <b>Far.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The flag of Dalmatia {{consists}} of two identical horizontal stripes of blue and yellow. Like the Croatian flag, it draws its modern roots from {{the period of the}} Austrian Empire, specifically from the Kingdom of Dalmatia. The coat of arms of Dalmatia - blue with three golden crowned leopard (lion guardant) heads - is never used on it, it is a simple yellow over blue bicolour without any emblem, as was custom of Austrian [...] "landesfarben". The coat of arms was possibly sometimes set in <b>it,</b> but <b>this</b> was <b>far</b> from official.|$|R
40|$|Externalism {{is widely}} {{endorsed}} within contemporary philosophy {{of mind and}} language. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>it</b> is <b>far</b> from clear how the externalist thesis should be construed and, indeed, why we should accept <b>it.</b> In <b>this</b> entry I distinguish and examine three central types of externalism: what I call foundational externalism, externalist semantics and psychological externalism. I suggest that the most plausible version of externalism is not in fact a very radical thesis and {{does not have any}} terribly interesting implications for philosophy of mind, whereas the more radical and interesting versions of externalism are quite difficult to support. 1...|$|R
