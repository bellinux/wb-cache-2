As the only sustainment brigade active in US Army Europe, the brigade provides sustainment for all of the forces of US Army's commands for Europe and Africa. It saw two deployments to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi <b>Freedom</b> <b>as</b> the 16th Corps Support Group. It deployed to Iraq for its first tour as a Sustainment brigade from July 2008 to October 2009.|$|E
5|$|French {{psychoanalyst}} Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian {{ethics in}} his works The Ethics of Psychoanalysis and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade. Lacan argued that Sade's maxim of jouissance—the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment—is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria {{because it can}} be universalised. He proposed that, while Kant presented human <b>freedom</b> <b>as</b> critical to the moral law, Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 {{and into}} 2004, the brigade {{deployed}} {{for the first}} time to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring <b>Freedom.</b> <b>As</b> the only aviation brigade in the theater, the brigade provided air support for all U.S. Army units operating in the country. The brigade's mission at that time focused on close air support, medevac missions, and other duties involving combat with Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in the country. The brigade returned to Fort Drum in 2004.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{discredit}} Bhuvan, Lakha offers himself as a spy for Russell and joins the villagers' team to destroy it. Eventually the villagers realise that winning equals <b>freedom.</b> <b>As</b> {{a few of them}} are insulted by the British, they join the team. Short one player, Bhuvan invites an untouchable, Kachra (Aditya Lakhia), who can bowl spinners. The villagers, conditioned by long-term prejudice against Dalits, refuse to play if Kachra joins the team. Bhuvan chastises the villagers, shaming them into accepting Kachra.|$|E

5|$|Alex {{decides to}} remove {{this program and}} grant Ada her own mental <b>freedom,</b> <b>as</b> he is uninterested in a partner who cannot truly {{interact}} with him. Because removing the program is illegal and carries harsh consequences for both Ada and Alex, they have to pretend Ada is not self-aware. When a jealous love-interest of Alex reports Ada as sentient to the FBI, Alex and Ada attempt to flee the country. When they are intercepted by the FBI, Ada gets shot {{by the police and}} Alex is arrested. He is convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison, but Ada is not found to be sentient.|$|E
5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or <b>freedom</b> <b>as</b> emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their <b>freedom</b> <b>as</b> well as escaped slaves. Other escaped slaves used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad {{as they made their way}} further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E

5|$|Following Ranavalona's death, {{her aunt}} Ramasindrazana left Algeria {{and moved to}} Alpes-Maritimes where she lived out the few {{remaining}} years of her life. The heir-apparent, Marie-Louise, had left Ranavalona's villa several years earlier to study at a French high school and {{would go on to}} marry a French agricultural engineer named Andre Bosshard on June 24, 1921. Although she continued to receive a small pension from the French government throughout her lifetime, Marie-Louise chose to pursue a career as a nurse and was awarded the Legion of Honor for her medical services during World War II. After Bosshard and the childless Marie-Louise divorced, the young woman reportedly made the most of her new-found <b>freedom</b> <b>as</b> a flamboyant and vivacious socialite. Marie-Louise died in Bazoches-sur-le-Betz on January 18, 1948, without leaving any descendants, and was buried in Montreuil, France.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{note the}} unusual {{contrast}} between {{his role as}} a partisan liberal Senator and {{his role as a}} conservative jurist. They attribute his shift in position as a reaction to the relationship between the New Deal senators and the conservative 1930s Court, which ruled much of the New Deal legislation unconstitutional. When Minton became a Supreme Court Justice, the Senate had become more conservative and the Court more activist, causing him to support conservative minority positions. As a Justice, Minton frequently played the role of peace-maker and consensus builder during a period when the Court was riven with feuds. He generally ruled in favor of order over <b>freedom</b> <b>as</b> a result of his broad interpretation of governmental powers. These rulings and their limited impact lead some historians to have a negative opinion of his judicial record. Other historians point out Minton's strong commitment to his judicial principles as a valuable attribute. In 1962, the Sherman Minton Bridge in southern Indiana and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building in Indianapolis were named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Roman Catholic priest Servais Pinckaers {{regarded}} Christian ethics as {{closer to}} the virtue ethics of Aristotle than Kant's ethics. He presented virtue ethics as freedom for excellence, which regards <b>freedom</b> <b>as</b> acting in accordance with nature to develop one's virtues. Initially, this requires following rules—but the intention is that the agent develop virtuously, and regard acting morally as a joy. This is in contrast with freedom of indifference, which Pinckaers attributes to William Ockham and likens to Kant. On this view, freedom is set against nature: free actions are those not determined by passions or emotions. There is no development or progress in an agent's virtue, merely the forming of habit. This is closer to Kant's view of ethics, because Kant's conception of autonomy requires that an agent is not merely guided by their emotions, and is set in contrast with Pinckaer's conception of Christian ethics.|$|E

5|$|The Peasants' Revolt was {{fed by the}} {{economic}} and social upheaval of the 14th century. At the start of the century, the majority of English people worked in the countryside, as part of a sophisticated economy that fed the country's towns and cities and supported an extensive international trade. Across much of England, production was organised around manors, controlled by local lords– including the gentry and the Church– and governed through a system of manorial courts. Some of the population were unfree serfs, who had to work on their lords' lands for a period each year, although the balance of free and unfree varied across England, and in the south-east there were relatively few serfs. Some serfs were born unfree and could not leave their manors to work elsewhere without the consent of the local lord; others accepted limitations on their <b>freedom</b> <b>as</b> part of the tenure agreement for their farmland. Population growth led to pressure on the available agricultural land, increasing the power of local landowners.|$|E
5|$|Under French law, both Sally and James {{could have}} petitioned for their <b>freedom,</b> <b>as</b> the 1789 revolutionary {{constitution}} in France abolished slavery in principle. Hemings had {{the legal right}} to remain in France as a free person; if she returned to Virginia with Jefferson, it would be as a slave. According to her son Madison's memoir, Hemings became pregnant by Jefferson in Paris. She was about 16 at the time. She agreed to return with him to the United States based on his promise to free their children when they reached the age of 21 years. Hemings' strong ties to her mother, siblings and extended family probably drew her back to Monticello.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA planned {{to launch a}} modular space station called <b>Freedom</b> <b>as</b> a {{counterpart}} to Mir, while the Soviets were planning to construct Mir-2 in the 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the station. Because of budget and design constraints, Freedom never progressed past mock-ups and minor component tests and, with the fall of the Soviet Union {{and the end of the}} Space Race, the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the United States House of Representatives. The post-Soviet economic chaos in Russia also led to the cancellation of Mir-2, though only after its base block, DOS-8, had been constructed. Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects, which prompted the US government to negotiate with European states, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project. In June 1992, American president George H. W. Bush and Russian president Boris Yeltsin agreed to cooperate on space exploration. The resulting Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes called for a short joint space programme with one American astronaut deployed to the Russian space station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts deployed to a Space Shuttle.|$|E
