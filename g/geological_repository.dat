5|$|In the Peoples Republic of China, ten {{reactors}} provide about 2% {{of electricity}} and five more are under construction. China {{made a commitment to}} reprocessing in the 1980s; a pilot plant is under construction at Lanzhou, where a temporary spent fuel storage facility has been constructed. Geological disposal has been studied since 1985, and a permanent deep <b>geological</b> <b>repository</b> was required by law in 2003. Sites in Gansu Province near the Gobi desert in northwestern China are under investigation, with a final site expected to be selected by 2020, and actual disposal by about 2050.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium-237 is {{the most}} mobile {{actinide}} in the deep <b>geological</b> <b>repository</b> environment. This makes it and its predecessors such as americium-241 candidates of interest for destruction by nuclear transmutation. Due to its long half-life, neptunium will become the major contributor of the total radiotoxicity in 10,000 years. As {{it is unclear what}} happens to the containment in that long time span, an extraction of the neptunium would minimize the contamination of the environment if the nuclear waste could be mobilized after several thousand years.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen nuclear {{reactors}} produce about 3% of India’s electricity, and seven more are under construction. Spent fuel is processed at facilities in Trombay near Mumbai, at Tarapur {{on the west}} coast north of Mumbai, and at Kalpakkam on the southeast coast of India. Plutonium will be used in a fast breeder reactor (under construction) to produce more fuel, and other waste vitrified at Tarapur and Trombay. Interim storage for 30 years is expected, with eventual disposal in a deep <b>geological</b> <b>repository</b> in crystalline rock near Kalpakkam.|$|E

It expressed urgency to find a consolidated, <b>geological</b> <b>repository,</b> and said that any future facility should be developed by a new independent organization with {{direct access to the}} Nuclear Waste Fund, which is not subject to political and financial control as is the cabinet department of the Department of Energy.

30|$|Bentonite is {{identified}} as potential buffer material in deep <b>geological</b> <b>repositories</b> for disposal of high level radioactive wastes (HLW) owing to its very low hydraulic conductivity, large swelling ability and high adsorptive capacity to retain cations (Pusch 2008). However, owing to negative surface charge, bentonite repels anions (van Olphen 1963). 129 I (Iodide- 129) is a fission product encountered in nuclear power plant wastes and is generated from ion-exchange resins, filter sludge, evaporator bottoms, off-gas cartridge filter, trash, and decommissioning wastes (Zhang et al. 2002). The ability to retain iodide ions by bentonite buffer employed in deep <b>geological</b> <b>repositories</b> is important as high-level radioactive wastes contain long-lived radioactive iodide species (Oscarson et al. 1986; Krumhansl et al. 2002).|$|R

Intermediate-level wastes includes resins, chemical sludge and metal nuclear fuel cladding, as well as contaminated materials from reactor decommissioning.

It also contains the undesirable isotope uranium-236, which undergoes neutron capture, wasting neutrons (and requiring higher U-235 enrichment) and creating neptunium-237, which {{would be one of the}} more mobile and troublesome radionuclides in deep <b>geological</b> <b>repository</b> disposal of nuclear waste.|$|E
