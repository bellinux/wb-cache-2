5|$|In Beswick v Beswick {{an uncle}} gifted his nephew a business, on the {{condition}} that the nephew would pay the uncle (Mr Beswick) a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow (Mrs Beswick). When the uncle died the nephew refused to pay the widow the money required, arguing that as she was not party to the original agreement she could not benefit from it. The Court of Appeal under Lord Denning tried to use {{this as an opportunity to}} claim that the doctrine of privity was invalid, something the House of Lords rejected. However, the Lords did agree that Mrs Beswick could sue, not as a third party to the contract but as the <b>executrix</b> of her husband's estate. As <b>executrix</b> she would be acting as a representative of Mr Beswick, and the doctrine of privity would not apply.|$|E
5|$|Lettice Dudley {{was left}} a wealthy widow. Leicester's will {{appointed}} her as <b>executrix</b> and her income from both her husbands' jointures amounted to £3,000 annually, to which came plate and movables worth £6,000. However, her jointure was to suffer greatly from paying off Leicester's debts, which at some £50,000 were so overwhelming {{that she was}} advised to decline the responsibility of dealing with her husband's financial legacy.|$|E
5|$|On July 26, 1863, with Margaret at {{his bedside}} reading the 23rd Psalm to him, Houston died. His will named her as his <b>executrix,</b> and named his cousin Thomas Caruthers, {{as well as}} family friends Thomas Gibbs, J. Carroll Smith and Anthony Martin Branch, as executors. He had died land rich, but cash poor. The {{inventory}} compiled of his estate after his death listed several thousand acres in real estate, $250 cash, slaves (one of which was Joshua Houston), a handful of livestock and his personal possessions.|$|E
25|$|His Œuvres complètes were {{published}} by his <b>executrix,</b> , 5 vol. in-8°. in 1781.|$|E
25|$|He {{was buried}} at St Clement Danes on 22 October 1578. On 21 November 1578 probate was granted to his sole <b>executrix,</b> his widow Agnes.|$|E
25|$|Ellen Wright, {{who died}} on April 6, 2004, aged 92, was the <b>executrix</b> of the Richard Wright Estate and, in that capacity, she sued a biographer in Wright v. Warner Books, Inc. She was also a {{literary}} agent {{in her own right}} (as their daughter Julia Wright has noted), numbering among her clients Simone de Beauvoir, Eldridge Cleaver, Violette Leduc, and others.|$|E
25|$|Thomas' will named Lucy his sole <b>executrix</b> and legatee. The will asked (but did not require) her to {{seek the}} advice of her {{brother-in-law}} Andrew Carnegie and her father (deceased in 1878) in disposing of Thomas' business interests. Although Andrew Carnegie advised her to sell out to him, she refused and retained ownership in businesses which led to rapid rises in her personal wealth {{over the next several}} decades.|$|E
25|$|Visitors in 1998 {{reported}} that Bowles' wit and intellect remained. He continued to welcome visitors {{to his apartment}} in Tangier but, {{on the advice of}} doctors and friends, limited interviews. One of the last was an interview with Stephen Morison, Jr., a friend teaching at the American School of Tangier. It was featured in the July/August 1999 issue of Poets & Writers magazine. On June 6, 1999, Irene Herrmann, the <b>executrix</b> of the Paul Bowles Music Estate, interviewed him to focus on his musical career; this was published in September 2003.|$|E
25|$|Until 1931, the Experiment Farm {{fell into}} some disrepair, so Stark Bro’s sent emissaries to {{retrieve}} the most promising fruit, nut and ornamental shrubs, and in 1931 sold the flowers, vegetables and seeds to Burpee Seed Co. J. B. Keil came from Stark Bro’s to coordinate the efforts and worked there from 1931 to 1934. Over the following years, Elizabeth worked with the Stark brothers to patent 16 Burbank fruits and flowers. The patents name Luther Burbank, deceased, as “inventor” by Elizabeth Waters Burbank, <b>executrix</b> of his estate. In 1935, Stark ended the agreement with Mrs. Burbank (or vice versa).|$|E
25|$|Banda had {{no known}} heirs {{but had a}} vast fortune that is run by his family. He was {{unmarried}} when he died. Cecilia Kadzamira was the official hostess or first lady of Malawi. She essentially ruled the country with her uncle, John Tembo, during Banda's last years. His affair and relationship with Merene French remains largely a mystery. He had rejected companionship and marriage and {{turned his back on}} the Englishwoman who bore his son. In 2010, Jumani Johansson claimed to be the son of the late president and is seeking DNA testing through the courts of Malawi. Grand niece Jane Dzanjalimodzi was the former <b>executrix</b> of his estate.|$|E
25|$|Upon Rimsky-Korsakov's {{death in}} 1908, Nadezhda became the <b>executrix</b> of his {{literary}} and musical estates. This included the considerable job of editing and publishing his posthumous literary and musical works. These included his autobiography, My Musical Life, collections of articles and notes on music plus {{a part of}} his correspondence with friends. She spent {{the rest of her life}} preserving his legacy, among other things, protesting Sergei Diaghilev's use of music from Scheherazade and The Golden Cockerel for ballets. She died of smallpox in St. Petersburg (by then renamed Petrograd) at age 70. After her death, her son Andrei continued her efforts, writing a multi-volume study of his father's life and work.|$|E
500|$|During the 1990s, Martello {{retired from}} his public work. Doyle White noted that while Martello faded from {{prominence}} {{as the head}} of the Strega Wicca movement, the tradition gained a [...] "new public advocate" [...] in Raven Grimassi. Martello died of cancer on 29 June 2000. Bruno was the <b>executrix</b> of his estate.|$|E
500|$|In 1642 Hale married Anne Moore, the {{daughter}} of Sir Henry Moore, a Royalist soldier, and the granddaughter of Sir Francis Moore, a Serjeant-at-Law under James I. Moore and Hale had 10 children, but she was evidently a highly extravagant woman, with Hale warning his children that [...] "an idle or expensive wife is most times an ill bargain, though she bring a great portion". Moore died in 1658, and in 1667 Hale married Anne Bishop, his housekeeper. Descriptions of Bishop differ; Roger North wrote that [...] " [...] was unfortunate in his family; for he married his own servant made, and then, for an excuse, {{said there was no}} wisdom below the girdle". Richard Baxter, on the other hand, described Anne as [...] "one of [...] own judgment and temper, prudent and loving, and fit to please him; and that would not draw on him the trouble of much acquaintance and relations". Hale himself described her as a [...] "most dutiful, faithful, and loving wife" [...] who was appointed an <b>executrix</b> on his death.|$|E
2500|$|... {{mentions}} {{a daughter}} [...] "Matilda Denys" [...] who married Thomas Gamage(b.1408), son and heir of William Gamage(d.1419), Denys's co-besieger of Coity, by Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Rodborough. Thomas became a {{ward of the}} Earl of Worcester in 1421, following his father's death. There is apparently some confusion here with Joan, Denys's daughter and <b>executrix</b> by Margaret Corbet, who would however have been {{too old to be}} the wife of this Thomas Gamage(b.1408) as she acted as Denys's <b>executrix</b> in 1422, and would then have been an adult. However a Matilda Denys is mentioned in the Calendar of the Martyrologue of St. Augustine's Abbey, Bristol, as having died in October 1422: ...|$|E
2500|$|Gruenwald married singer Belinda Glass in May 1981. [...] They later divorced, and {{he married}} Catherine Schuller on October 12, 1992 in New York after a year's courtship. Catherine was the <b>executrix</b> {{of the famous}} will that {{indicated}} he wanted his cremains {{to be put into}} a comic book upon his death. [...] Gruenwald had a daughter, Sara.|$|E
2500|$|Buckingham {{had named}} his wife Anne sole <b>executrix</b> of his will. She {{was to give}} 200 marks to any clergy who {{attended}} his funeral, with the remainder being distributed as poor relief. She was also to organise the establishment of two chantries in his memory, and he left [...] "exceedingly elaborate" [...] instructions for {{the foundation of a}} college in Pleshy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{estate was}} [...] called Catton and was patented {{from the first}} proprietors of the Maryland Colony, the Calvert family, on August 26, 1681 by Robert Carvile of St. Mary's City, Maryland. Carvile sold the land in 1698 for £100 to Henry Ridgely. In 1700, Ridgely purchased an additional [...] adjacent to Catton called Enfield Chase. Upon Ridgely's death in 1699, his third wife, now twice widowed, Mary Ridgely (Duvall, née Stanton) was <b>executrix</b> of the will and inherited the properties. Mary had previously inherited Middle Plantation in Davidsonville, Maryland when her first husband, Mareen Duvall died in 1699.|$|E
2500|$|This {{will was}} proved at London before the worshipful Sir Richard Raines, knight, Doctor of Laws, Master Keeper or Commissary of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, {{lawfully}} constituted, on the twenty {{third day of}} the month of June {{in the year of}} our Lord one thousand six hundred and ninety seven, by the oath of Mary Bathurst, relict and <b>executrix</b> named in the said will, to whom administration was granted of all and singular the goods, rights and credits of the said deceased, sworn on the holy Gospel of God to well and faithfully administer the same. It has been examined".|$|E
2500|$|Denys's {{will was}} [...] dated the Feast of St. Michael the Archangel (16 October 1421), {{and he died}} on 24 March 1422. [...] His will is a very short and businesslike document. [...] He {{requested}} {{to be buried in}} Siston Church, near his first wife Margaret Corbet. The fact that he had appointed his daughter Joan, [...] "wife of Thomas Gamage" [...] as his <b>executrix</b> to arrange this burial, suggests she must have been a daughter of Margaet Corbet, not of his second wife Margaret Russell. This supposition is strengthened by the fact she must have been an adult to be thus appointed, which would place her date of birth before Denys's 2nd. Marriage to Margaret Russell, c. 1408.|$|E
2500|$|Van Zandt's {{third and}} final {{marriage}} was to Jeanene Munsell (born February 21, 1957). They met on December 9, 1980 at a memorial for John Lennon. When the terminally-ill Dorothy Van Zandt learned that her son had impregnated Munsell, she told him, [...] "You're {{going to do the}} right thing and honor that baby." [...] He soon divorced his estranged second wife and married Munsell on March 14, 1983; their first child, William Vincent, was born ten days later. Another child, Katie Belle, was born February 14, 1992. Van Zandt and Munsell were divorced on May 2, 1994. However, the two remained close until Townes' death, and Jeanene was an <b>executrix</b> of his estate.|$|E
2500|$|White-tailed eagles, being apex predators, tend to {{experience}} bioaccumulation from environmental pollutants present in their prey; they also suffer intensive persecution by shepherds and gamekeepers who consider them (usually wrongly) {{a threat to}} their livestock and gamebirds. During the period 1800-1970, white-tailed eagles in most of Europe underwent dramatic declines and became extinct in many regions of western, central and southern Europe. [...] A white tailed eagle was shot in the winter of 1857 at Stolford in Bridgwater Bay and subsequently preserved for display. [...] It may be seen at the Somerset Heritage Centre (TA2 6SF). [...] It was presented to the county museum by Miss Bailey, the <b>executrix</b> of the owner's will, in 1881.|$|E
2500|$|He married (1st) Katherine Gifford, {{who died}} 8 March 1479. [...] They had five sons, {{including}} Thomas, his heir, {{who died in}} 1500 without male issue, and four daughters. [...] He married (2nd) Mary Folville, widow successively of William Cotton, Receiver-general of the Duchy of Lancaster, Treasurer of the Queen’s Household (killed at the 2nd Battle of St. Albans in 1461), and Thomas Lacy, of Grantchester, Cambridgeshire (died 1479), and daughter and co-heiress of John Folville, Esq., of Sileby, Rotherby, Queniborough, etc., Leicestershire, by Joan, daughter of Robert Wesenham (died 1399), of Conington, Huntingdonshire. [...] She was born about 1423 (aged 54 in 1477). [...] In 1483 his widow and <b>executrix,</b> Mary, sued William Stokker, Knt., Mayor of the Staple of Calais, in the Exchequer of Pleas regarding a debt. [...] She was pardoned 20 Nov. 1484. [...] Mary died 14 March 1499/1500, and was buried {{on the south side}} of the altar of the church of St. Margaret, Westminster, Middlesex by her 1st husband.|$|E
2500|$|Margaret Corbet died in 1398, having {{produced}} no male heir, only a daughter, Joan, who married Thomas Gamage and {{was old enough}} by 1422 to serve as <b>executrix</b> of her father's will. Before 1408 Denys married Margaret Russell, elder daughter of his near neighbour Sir Maurice Russell of Dyrham. The marriage was socially advantageous for Denys as the Russells were wealthy and well established in Gloucestershire, yet little prospect existed {{at the time of}} the marriage of financial advancement as Maurice Russell then had an 8 year old heir, Thomas, produced by his young second wife Joan Dauntsey. Yet after Denys's death, Thomas Russell died in 1432, leaving an infant child who also died, leaving the Russell inheritance to Margaret, by then remarried to John Kemeys, and Isabel her sister. Thus Maurice Denys (1410–1466) the son and heir of Denys and Margaret Russell, and his Denys descendants, became heirs to half the Russell lands. According to the Heralds' Visitation of Glos. op.cit., Denys had by Margaret Russell the following children: ...|$|E
2500|$|Ann's sister Sarah's husband Mr Tebbitt died in 1833, {{leaving her}} {{unsupported}} with seven children. Ann's husband died some months later in 1834 aged 85 years, leaving her a fortune of around £500,000 and no children. William Thwaytes's Will makes her a [...] "joint <b>executrix</b> and main beneficiary" [...] and describes her as his [...] "beloved wife" [...] {{in spite of}} her earlier suspicion that he was poisoning her. Ann soon became [...] "very close" [...] to her London surgeon Simm Smith. After her husband died, she paid Smith £2,000 per year and a total of £50,000 in gifts to temporarily give up his London medical practice to manage her business affairs. Simm was living in Croydon with his family and visiting Ann fortnightly, and Ann sometimes paid him [...] "very large sums of money." [...] Before her husband was even buried she had made her Will, leaving everything to Simm Smith except a small annuity for Sarah Tebbitt and her children. Soon after the funeral she was befriended by Simm's brother Samuel; he was a stockbroker whose wife had died, leaving him with two daughters and a debt of £3,000 which Ann paid.|$|E
2500|$|Edmund Rice died on 3 May 1663 in Marlborough, Massachusetts, and {{is presumed}} to be buried at the Old North Cemetery (site of the first Sudbury Meeting House) {{in what is now}} Wayland, Massachusetts [...] [...] Probate records show that his wife, Mercy, was <b>executrix</b> and that his estate {{including}} lands and homes in both Sudbury and Marlborough was valued at £743, 8s, & 4p, which was a considerable sum for the time. For decades, the Edmund Rice estate was disputed in part by heirs of John Moore (1610-1673). The issue of land ownership was eventually settled in 1716 by a transfer of land to John Moore's son, Joseph Moore (1647-1725), by Edmund's grandson (a son of Matthew) Isaac Rice (1668-1717). The only surviving artifact known to be owned by Edmund Rice and his second wife Mercy Brigham Rice is an antique bible box from the pre-Elizabethan Tudor Period (early 16th Century); it was brought from England by Mercy when she sailed to Massachusetts in 1635. The bible box was donated to the Worcester Historical Museum by Thomas Brigham Rice (1817-1914) in 1910, and it is {{recognized as one of the}} earliest known pieces of furniture with a New England history.|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{remained}} childless. When Sir Edward Bromley died in 1626, disputes {{about the}} inheritance {{of the family}} estates had already begun. The codicil to his will showed {{that he had been}} forced to sacrifice some of the lands he had intended as part of Lady Margaret's jointure to placate the Davenports, his great-niece and her husband, who were ultimately to acquire the main estate at Hallon, next to Worfield, after protracted litigation. As compensation, he left her all his moveable property, although he had originally intended to give her only the use of it during her life and the right to bequeath £400-worth in her own will. For everything not relating to the property dispute, Lady Margaret was appointed <b>executrix.</b> Sir Edward set aside £100 for a monument [...] "to be set up in Shifnall Church, or elsewhere, to me and my wife Dame Margaret." [...] However, he directed that his burial itself be [...] "without funeral pompe," [...] probably an indication of Puritan views. He was buried in the church at Worfield, where his wife subsequently had the prescribed monument built, with an inscription attesting her role: [...] "Dame Margaret his wife according to his will did dedicate This monument to his memory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} difficult, you know, Chettam, {{as she is}} an <b>executrix,</b> and she likes to go into these things--property, land, that kind of thing. She has her notions, you know," [...] said Mr. Brooke, {{sticking}} his eye-glasses on nervously, and exploring the edges of a folded paper which he held in his hand; [...] "and {{she would like to}} act--depend upon it, as an <b>executrix</b> Dorothea would want to act. And she was twenty-one last December, you know. I can hinder nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Shelby {{showed his}} {{confidence}} in his wife's ability, by appointing her sole <b>executrix</b> upon his estates; and thus immediately a large and complicated amount of business was brought upon her hands.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, he isn't,' replied Mrs. Weller; for {{the rather}} stout lady {{was no other}} than the quondam relict and sole <b>executrix</b> of the dead-and-gone Mr. Clarke; 'no, he isn't, and I don't expect him, either.' ...|$|E
60|$|When the {{tradesman}} dies, {{it is to}} {{be expected}} that what estate or effects he leaves, is, generally speaking, dispersed about in many hands; his widow, if she is left <b>executrix,</b> has the trouble of getting things together as well as she can; if she is not left <b>executrix,</b> she has not the trouble indeed, but then it is looked upon that she is dishonoured in not having the trust; when she comes to look into her affairs, she is more or less perplexed and embarrassed, as she has not or has acquainted herself, or been made acquainted, with her husband's affairs in his lifetime.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Besides, mother, {{you being}} sole <b>executrix,</b> {{and having the}} {{direction}} {{and management of the}} estate, there remained little business, or I might say none, that I could transact, until you had had time to arrange matters to your satisfaction.' ...|$|E
60|$|The fourth clause {{left the}} whole of the testator's property, in lands and in money, {{absolutely}} to his widow. In the fifth clause he added a new proof of his implicit confidence in her--he appointed her sole <b>executrix</b> of his will.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am married. I have no children. I {{have not}} lived {{on good terms}} with my family. It was, therefore, quite {{reasonable}} to expect that I should leave my wife sole heir and <b>executrix.</b> It was also natural that she should go to my solicitors--the family solicitors--and ask them to manage her affairs.|$|E

Here you shall read how the soul of Charmion was slain of the sword her vengeance smithied.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How {{came the}} will to be {{permitted}} to be proved, as there could, after all, have been no complete evidence?' she asked. 'If I had been the <b>executrix</b> I would not have attempted it! As I was not, I {{know very little about}} how the business was pushed through. In a very unseemly way, I think.' ...|$|E
60|$|Iris {{took the}} will without a word. She understood, now, what it meant. If {{she was the}} sole <b>executrix</b> {{she would have to}} act. If {{everything}} was left to her she would have to receive the money. Thus, at a single step, she became not only cognisant of the conspiracy, but the chief agent and instrument to carry it out.|$|E
