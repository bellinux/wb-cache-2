30|$|According to Dinh and Kleimeier (2007), the {{determination}} of loans {{does not depend on}} the borrower’s income or the amount of collateral, but rather on the qualitative analysis (of, for example, the borrower’s personality, reputation, or social status). Because the maintenance of social credit relationships is expensive, banks typically adopt the credit scoring model to quantitatively analyze a borrower’s credit situation to determine loans and identify whether a borrower can obey the contract. Banks’ <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> of corporate customers is a multiple-criteria decision-making problem in which various elements are comprehensively assessed. The construction of an effective <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> model requires that credit staff possess sufficient professional knowledge and practical experience. Previous <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> studies have mostly analyzed the opinion of a group of credit staff by using a single precise value, which cannot fully describe the actual distribution of credit staff opinions and tends to diminish minority and peculiar opinions. Therefore, precise values are inapplicable in actual decision environments and constructed <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> models do not possess the features of anti-catastrophism and sensitivity, which are the criteria of a superior assessment system (Hsieh 2003). Srinivasan and Kim (1988) stated that <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> can be conducted using theory-based scientific and objective methods.

40|$|The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 1999 {{issued a}} draft New Basel Capital Accord (Basel 2). Its {{principles}} {{are to be}} incorporated into the European legislation and into the Czech banking regulations. The Standardised Approach to calculating the capital requirement for credit risk is newly based on external credit assessments (ratings). Banking regulators and supervisors have to be prepared for the process of determining eligible credit assessment institutions (ECAIs) and will have to elaborate a formal recognition procedure. This paper investigates the approaches a supervisor may apply to ECAI recognition and elaborates on the criteria of recognition. First, the paper reviews the available rating agencies on the market (including their rating penetration on the Czech market), their best practices and the experience with the use of their ratings for regulatory purposes. Second, drawing on international experience and the proposed Basel 2 rules, we outline the fundamental supervisory approaches to recognition, including the legal aspects thereof, and analyse their pros and cons and the frontiers of supervisory decision making. Third, we outline the rules for recognition, including requirements or expectations (e. g. soft limits), documentation and typical interview questions with the potential candidates.

40|$|The main {{difference}} between the New Basel Capital Accord („Basel II”) and the currently valid regulation is {{that the amount of}} equity capital that a bank has to allocate to company loans in Basel II is determined by the riskiness of the individual company loans. The risk information is either provided by <b>external</b> <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> agencies („Standard Approach”) or by the bank itself („Internal-Ratings-Based (IRB-) Approach”). The economic literature has not yet analyzed the effects of this regime for the investment incentives of banks in rating systems and the resulting welfare consequences. This is the reason why the dissertation focuses on the following questions: 1. Which incentives for investments in rating systems are set by Basel II ? 2. What are the welfare consequences from opportunistic behavior of banks who choose to apply the IRB-Approach ? 3. Which welfare differences result from the application of two different credit rating regimes ? 4. Do banks invest too little or too much in rating systems from a welfare standpoint of view ? The main result of the paper is that the IRB-Approach does not maximize the welfare in all cases. The reason is that banks with modern risk assessment systems have an incentive to use their private information to increase the risk of their portfolios. This opportunistic behavior leads to higher negative external effects. It works therefore contrary to the positive external effects that result from the increased credit risk quantification abilities of IRB-banks. The economic model that focuses on this trade-off shows that the banking regulator prefers for markets with a high proportion of defaulting loans banks which apply the IRB-Approach. In „safer” markets with a low proportion of defaults, banks which use the standard approach are preferred as they do not have private information. If the financing through banks creates large positive externalities, IRB-banks perform better than the banks with the Standard Approach. In what investments in rating systems are concerned, the model shows that over- as well as underinvestment is possible. The opportunistic behavior of the IRB-banks is the reason why the IRB-Approach is not preferable in all cases. If the regulator cannot eliminate opportunistic behavior the goals of Basel II are endangered. The reason is that the instrument of capital standards itself is not sufficient to make the IRB-Approach preferable in all cases as it cannot compensate opportunistic behavior entirely. This means that the implementation of Basel II can have disadvantages even before considering implementation costs...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four independent chapters on bank capital regulation {{and the issue of}} unsolicited ratings. The first chapter is introductory and reviews the motivation for regulating banks and credit rating agencies while providing a detailed overview of the thesis. The second chapter uses a simultaneous equations model to analyze how banks from six G 10 countries adjusted their capital to assets ratios and risk-weighted assets to assets ratio between 1988 and 1995, i. e. just after passage of the 1988 Basel Accord. The results suggest that regulatory pressure brought about by the 1988 capital standards had little effect on both ratios for weakly capitalized banks, except in the US. In addition, the relation between the capital to assets ratios and the risk-weighted assets to assets ratio appears to depend not only on the level of capitalization of banks, but also on the countries or groups of countries considered. The third chapter provides Monte Carlo estimates of the amount of regulatory capital that EMU banks must hold for their corporate, bank, and sovereign exposures both under Basel I and the standardized approach to credit risk in Basel II. In the latter case, Monte Carlo estimates are presented for different combinations of <b>external</b> <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> institutions (ECAIs) that banks may choose to risk weight their exposures. Three main results emerge from the analysis. First, although the use of different ECAIs leads to significant differences in minimum capital requirements, these differences never exceed, on average, 10 % of EMU banks’ capital requirements for corporate, bank, and sovereign exposures. Second, the standardized approach to credit risk provides a small regulatory capital incentive for banks to use several ECAIs to risk weight their exposures. Third, the minimum capital requirements for the corporate, bank, and sovereign exposures of EMU banks will be higher in Basel II than in Basel I. I also show that the incentive for banks to engage in regulatory arbitrage in the standardized approach to credit risk is limited. The fourth and final chapter analyses the effect of soliciting a rating on the rating outcome of banks. Using a sample of Asian banks rated by Fitch Ratings, I find evidence that unsolicited ratings tend to be lower than solicited ones, after accounting for differences in observed bank characteristics. This downward bias {{does not seem to be}} explained by the fact that better-quality banks self-select into the solicited group. Rather, unsolicited ratings appear to be lower because they are based on public information. As a result, they tend to be more conservative than solicited ratings, which incorporate both public and non-public information.

40|$|Title: The {{amortization}} requirements' {{impact on}} banking operations organization and <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> Authors: Annie Majlöf and Therese Hasselgren Supervisor: Titti Eliasson Examiner: Eva Berggren Keywords: <b>Credit</b> <b>assessment,</b> organization change, banks, amortization requirement Purpose: The {{purpose of our}} study {{is to increase the}} understanding and to find out how a regulation change, as the amortization requirement, may affect and change the organization and <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> in various banks. Problem background: Swedish households are currently highly leveraged where the high indebtedness is partly a result of low amortization rate. Measures to reduce debt may therefore be necessary to reduce households' sensitivity to economic disruptions. If the amortization rate increases, the high leverage of households would attenuate. For this reason, an amortization requirement is introduced with the purpose of reduce debt and increase households’ resistance. If the market requires change it is necessary that organizations change accordingly. As a result of new regulations and requirements the need of change arises and directly affects organizations, such as adaptation of procedures and processes, internal systems and skill development. Research problem: How can the amortization requirement affect and change the organization and <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> in banks? Method: This study is of qualitative character since the empirical material consists of qualitative interviews. The intention is to acquire increased comprehension rather than to make generalization possible. We derived our empirical study based on our theoretical framework in order to later analyze the two parts. Based on the analysis {{we have been able to}} draw conclusions and to bring discussion. Conclusion: The study came out into that the amortization requirement creates a rational and a saner repayment culture. As a result of the regulation change there has been some change in the banks’ organization in various aspects. A conclusion is that the <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> when granting <b>credit</b> is more restrictive and limited as a result of the requirement claim.
