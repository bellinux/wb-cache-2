25|$|Over the 20th century, {{companies}} in the UK became the dominant organisational form of economic activity, which raised concerns about how accountable those who controlled companies were to those who invested in them. The first reforms following the Great Depression, in the Companies Act 1948, ensured that directors could be removed by shareholders with a simple majority vote. In 1977, the government's Bullock Report proposed reform to allow employees to participate in selecting the board of directors, as was happening across Europe, exemplified by the German Codetermination Act 1976. However the UK never implemented the reforms, and from 1979 the debate shifted. Although making directors more accountable to employees was delayed, the Cork Report led to stiffer sanctions in the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 against directors who negligently ran companies at a loss. Through the 1990s the focus in corporate governance turned toward internal control mechanisms, such as auditing, separation of the chief executive position <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> and remuneration committees {{as an attempt to}} place some check on excessive executive pay. These rules applicable to listed companies, now found in the UK Corporate Governance Code, have been complemented by principles based regulation of institutional investors' activity in company affairs. At the same time, the UK's integration in the European Union meant a steadily growing body of EU Company Law Directives and case law to harmonise company law within the internal market.|$|E
25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E

500|$|In the 1990s, {{elements}} within the growing Indonesian middle class created by Suharto's economic development, were becoming restless with his autocracy and corruption of his children, fueling demands for [...] "Reformasi" [...] (reform) of the almost 30-year-old New Order government. By 1996, Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Sukarno and chairwoman of the normally compliant PDI, was becoming a rallying point for this growing discontent. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction of PDI led by Suryadi, which removed Megawati <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> On 27 July 1996, an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant-General Sutiyoso on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting.

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a closed caption that reads [...] "Britney Spears – Stronger", amidst {{the sound of a}} storm. It then cuts to a close up of Spears looking at her boyfriend, who is smiling with another woman holding him. She realizes she is better without him and walks away, after saying, [...] "Whatever," [...] to the audience. There is a shot of the tower hotel they were in, in an {{apparent}} semi-futuristic world, having a party in the restaurant in the hotel tower at the top, and then the hotel tower explodes and blows up. At the beginning of the first chorus, Spears starts dancing with an Emeco 1006-style chair in front of a black background. The second half of the video finds Spears driving away from the party in a classic Ford Mustang car during a thunderstorm; however, before long, her car goes into a spin out, then stops on {{the very edge of the}} bridge. After recovering from the shock of it, she's forced to continue walking on in the rain. Cuts of her dancing with a cane, transformed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> are also included. The video ends with Spears walking across a bridge. Two versions of the video exist, one in which at the end of video, Spears stands in mid-air above the spinning chair, and in the other a close up of her singing. Nuzhat Naoreen of MTV praised the music video, saying, [...] "few performers can work an entire routine on and around a chair as well as Britney did in 'Stronger'". The music video received a nomination on the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Pop Video.|$|E

According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography [...] "though he never achieved distinction as speaker, his frequent and well-informed interventions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> demonstrated initiative and judgement.

2500|$|A chair {{may or may}} {{not have}} armrests; chairs with armrests are termed [...] "armchairs". In French, a {{distinction}} is made between fauteuil and chaise, the terms for chairs with and without armrests, respectively. If present, armrests will support part of the body weight through the arms if the arms are resting on the armrests. Armrests further have the function of making entry and exit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> easier (but from the side it becomes more difficult). [...] Armrests should support the forearm and not the sensitive elbow area. [...] Hence in some chair designs, the armrest is not continuous to the chair back, but is missing in the elbow area.|$|E

This body produced the first drafts of the document that, after many changes, would become the Council's Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (1963). When the Council convened in October 1962, the Preparatory Commission was succeeded by the Conciliar Commission on the Sacred Liturgy, on which Bugnini was assigned {{the role of a}} peritus (expert).

2500|$|Garfielde {{sought the}} Democratic Party {{nomination}} for Territorial Delegate in 1861. Stevens saw unification of the Democratic Party {{as the only}} solution to the national crisis over slavery, which was threatening to tear the United States apart. Garfielde, however, broke with pro-secession Democrats, putting him at odds with Stevens. At the Democratic Party's territorial convention, pro-Union forces obtained a ruling <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> that proxy votes could not be counted. This heavily damaged Stevens' chances for renomination as Territorial Delegate. After two rounds of balloting, some of Stevens' supporters became disgusted with their treatment by the chair and walked out. [...] His candidacy crippled, Isaac Stevens withdrew his name from contention. The convention then split, with pro-Union forces nominating Garfielde and pro-secession forces nominating territorial judge Edward Lander. Republicans, meanwhile, nominated attorney William H. Wallace. Garfielde and Lander spent the campaign attacking one another, and on election day Wallace won election to Congress with 43 percent of the vote. Garfield had 37.6 percent, and Lander 19.4 percent.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson {{was raised}} a Sedevacantist traditionalist Catholic.

My wife is a saint. She's a much better person than I am. Honestly. She's... Episcopalian, Church of England. She prays, she believes in God, she knows Jesus, she believes in that stuff. And it's just not fair if she doesn't make it, she's better than I am. But that is a pronouncement <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> I go with it." [...] When he was asked whether [...] is an intolerant position, he said that [...] "through the merits of Jesus' sacrifice... even people who don't know Jesus are able to be saved, but through him." [...] Acquaintance Father William Fulco has said that Gibson denies neither the Pope nor Vatican II. Gibson told Diane Sawyer that he believes non-Catholics and non-Christians can go to Heaven.|$|E

[...] In any event, Wythe, Alexander Hamilton and Charles Pinckney, served on the committee which established the Convention's rules and procedures. However, Wythe left Philadelphia in early June to tend to Elizabeth, who was dying. The following year, York County neighbors elected Wythe and John Blair to represent them at the Virginia Ratifying Convention. As Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, Wythe presided over oft-heated exchanges until the final day. Stepping down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> Wythe spoke to urge ratification.

2500|$|However, {{despite this}} two-thirds {{requirement}} being {{written into the}} Senate rules, any Senator may attempt to nullify a Senate rule by making a point of order that the rule is unconstitutional or just that {{the meaning of the}} rule should not be followed. The presiding officer is generally expected to rule in favor of the rules of the Senate, but any ruling <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> may be appealed and overturned by a simple majority of Senators. This happened in 2013, when Harry Reid of the Democratic Party made a point of order that [...] "the vote on cloture under rule XXII for all nominations other than for the Supreme Court of the United States is by majority vote." [...] Although there is no simple majority vote provision in the text of rule XXII, Reid's point of order was sustained by a 52-48 vote, and that ruling established a Senate precedent that cloture on nominations other than those for the Supreme Court requires only a simple majority. On April 6, 2017, that precedent was further changed by Mitch McConnell and the Republican majority to include Supreme Court nominations.|$|E
