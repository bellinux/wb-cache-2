40|$|The lower-middle Upper Triassic {{succession}} of the Fatricum domain from the Tatra Mts is commonly called the Carpathian Keuper. During Late Triassic, the Fatricum Basin was a proximal {{part of the}} central Inner Carpathian Basin. In early Carnian times, carbonate sedimentation stopped. Emersion of the Middle Triassic carbonate platform resulted in development of palaeokarst and pedogenic fabrics and deposition of conglomerates. Typical Carpathian Keuper sediments – variegated shales with intercalations of sandstones and dolomites represent mixed continental/shallow marine environments. Variegated mudstones with pedogenic carbonate concretions and intercalations of thin sandstone beds originated in mudflat environment under the semi-arid climate condition. Thick-bedded, cross-stratified sandstones with common plant debris represent fluvial deposits. They were deposited during the periods of climate pluvialisation. According to δ 13 C and δ 18 O data, thick, continuous dolomitic sediments containing local cherts represent marine sediments of perilittoral environments, which were commonly emerged as <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>common</b> palaeokarst and palaeosols featuring these complexes. Cyclicity in {{the lower part of}} the Carpathian Keuper resulted from climatic changes, whereas dolomite-clastic cycles from the upper part of the succession were generated probably by sea level fluctuations. Moreover, deposition of the Keuper succession was controlled by synsedimentary tectonic which resulted in big facies variability...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} use of colour and light in four seventeenth-century church {{interiors}} in Arbanassi, Bulgaria. The aim is to elucidate {{the appearance of the}} wall paintings in these churches {{in the context of the}} specific use of colour and in the lighting conditions pertaining when they were painted. The investigation both uses existing methods and also creates new scientifically-based ones to address questions concerning the extent to which colour and light were intentionally employed in ways <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>common</b> patterns. The underlying hypothesis is that the decoration can be asserted as an embodiment of the ways colour and light were employed in Eastern Church decoration at that period in the Bulgarian province of the Ottoman Empire. In all the churches examined the artists used palettes restricted to a small but constant number of hues. I discuss how they used light and colour contrast to manipulate the appearance of the images. As present the interiors are lit by electric light. The investigation into the interior lighting reveals that the natural lighting is of an even but low intensity, allowing the artificial lighting to dominate. I devised a methodology to assess the effect of the original interior illumination on the appearance of the naves in the con-text of Professor Chalmers and others in the computer reconstruction of historic sites under their original illumination. By departing from conventional art-historical assessments, without merely accumulating technical data, my research challenges previously accepted presumptions and offers a means of revealing the optical complexity of the interiors. While this provides increased knowledge and understanding of the visual practices employed by the artists, the wider significance of this thesis lies in the way it bridges the existing division between science and the humanities and in its development of new methods for art historical research...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{significant}} list of reported reasons for why the construction industry is not adopting Building Information Modelling (BIM), or delaying {{the decision to use}} BIM. The most common reasons, regardless of the global location, have been ‘limited demand for BIM from clients or from other companies on projects’, ‘lack of standardised tools and protocols’, and ‘lack of expertise and insufficient training’. These barriers to adoption are also evident in New Zealand (NZ) context. This case study discusses the support mechanisms in place in NZ for wider BIM adoption and implementation. To address the barriers in New Zealand National Technical Standards Committee (NTSC) was established in 2012, BIM Acceleration Committee (BAC) and National BIM Education Working Group (NBEWG) in 2014. Members of the first two committees represent both industry and government. The National BIM Education Working Group has representatives from all tertiary institutes who have interest in BIM and wish to include it as part of their programmes. National Technical Standards Committee is overseeing the development of open industry standards for building and location data. BAC’s main role is to increase the use of BIM in New Zealand by generating demand for BIM through client education and by enabling the industry. This is being done through training, networks and communication, and BIM guidelines and BIM project examples. NBEWG promotes integration of BIM into all architectural, engineering and construction programmes in New Zealand by providing national curriculum guidelines and guidance in adopting BIM curriculum. All three groups work in close collaboration, supporting each other and sharing resources to guarantee consistency of the BIM message from government to industry to education.

40|$|Transient lower {{oesophageal}} sphincter relaxation (LOSR) is {{the major}} mechanism underlying gastro-oesophageal reflux. The mediation and control of LOSRs are incompletely understood but evidence suggests a neural inhibitory mechanism. In this study we have evaluated the effect of gastric distension on LOS function in 16 patients with untreated idiopathic achalasia and compared it with that in 10 healthy controls. With the subjects sitting, the stomach was distended with a liquid mixture that generated 750 ml CO 2. Oesophageal pH and motility were monitored for 10 minutes before and after distension. In normal controls, gastric distension induced a four-fold increase {{in the rate of}} LOSRs and gas reflux episodes (as <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> oesophageal <b>common</b> cavities), whereas this response was absent in the achalasia patients.

40|$|Porphyry and epithermal {{mineralization}} {{of early}} Late Cretaceous Age (ca. 76 - 74 Ma) at Casino, Revenue/Nucleus and Sonora Gulch {{areas in the}} central and eastern Dawson Range in west-central Yukon is spatially related to numerous placer gold mining areas. Placer- lode relationships have been established through study of gold alloy compositions and associated mineral inclusion assemblages. At Casino, hypogene gold grains are liberated by erosion and pass into the placer system without compositional modification, as <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the <b>common</b> alloy signatures and a mineral association of Au, (Bi-Pb-Te-S) minerals and chalcopyrite. A second signature of higher- Ag, chalcopyrite- poor gold has been identified in placer populations, but this gold type also exhibited the Bi-Pb-Te-S signature. The results suggest that placers contain a mixture of gold derived from the porphyry and peripheral or shallower level epithermal mineralization.

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} {{the motif of}} madness in four literary works by Africana women: Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, Myriam Warner-Vieyra’s Juletane, Tsitsi Dangarembga’s Nervous Conditions, and Bessie Head’s A Question of Power. The study {{was based on the}} premise that Africana women’s literature serves a receptive purpose. The primary goal was to demonstrate fictionalized madness as a social metaphor and to show how it relates to the existential realities of black women. A deconstructionist approach was used to analyze the four novels, and, a convergence of feminist and Afrocentric theories was used to unearth the diverse realities of black women. This writer found that in each novel female protagonists were driven mad due to the oppressive forces in their societies. In their journeys through madness, they attempted to redefine their self-identities. The outcomes of these journeys ranged from fatal to successful. The conclusions drawn from this study suggests that there are universal truths in the lives of black women, <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the <b>common</b> themes in Africana women’s literature...|$|R
40|$|Despite their {{widespread}} and well-established use, powders are challenging materials to work with, as <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the <b>common</b> problems encountered during storage and processing, {{as well as}} in the quality and consistency of final products. The diverse range of unit operations used to handle and manipulate powders subject them to extremes of stress and flow regimes; from the high stress, static conditions present in hoppers to the dispersed, dynamic state of a fluidised bed dryer. It is therefore possible for a powder to behave a certain way in a given unit operation, but entirely differently in another. Many existing powder testing techniques don’t deliver the required information as the test conditions do not represent the conditions in the process. Modern powder rheometers generate process relevant data by accurately measuring dynamic flow, bulk and shear properties. This approach enables a powder’s response to aeration, consolidation, forced flow and changes in flow rate to be reliably quantified thereby simulating the conditions which a powder will be subjected to in process. This paper provides an introduction to powder rheology, including a comparison with traditional techniques, and uses case studies to demonstrate how powder rheology can be applied to optimise production processes and enhance product qualit...|$|R

40|$|Small fossils are {{preserved}} as phosphatic (carbonate fluorapatite) micro-steinkerns (~ 0. 5 mm diameter) in Upper Ordovician beds from Iowa to the Cincinnati area. Molluscs are common, but bryozoan zooecia, echinoderm ossicles and other taxa are present. These micromorphic mollusks have been interpreted as ecologically-dwarfed and adapted to oxygen-starved conditions, an interpretation with implications for ocean anoxia. An alternative explanation for small phosphatic steinkerns is taphonomic. Stable phosphate may have selectively filled small voids, preserving small fossils that include larval/young molluscs. Reworking would have concentrated small phosphatic steinkerns from multiple generations whose calcareous shells were destroyed along with larger unfilled shells, resulting in small fossils progressively replacing larger fossils. With thin sections and insoluble residues, we document {{evidence suggesting that}} this taphonomically biased process created these fossil assemblages. Gastropods and monoplacophorans in thin section are often only partially filled with phosphate—starting at the apex—also <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> meniscus-like terminations <b>common</b> in whole steinkerns released by acid digestion. Umbilical steinkerns, much narrower than body-chamber fillings, are also present, and represent shells much larger than those of body-chamber steinkerns. Despite most steinkerns being similarly sized, stages of development are <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> progressive secondary nacre accretion that thickened the apical area of growing shells, again suggesting a size limit to these steinkerns. Bivalve steinkerns are similarly sized but without signs of partial filling because of their enclosed nature. However, phosphatic fillings between the hinge teeth of much larger bivalves suggest again that phosphate fillings were size-selective. Imprints of larger fossils are found in phosphatic particles apparently deposited within the sediment between grains. Bryozoans and echinoderms {{are preserved}} as zooecia/stereom fillings. The fossils are comparable to non-phosphatic counterparts, and were preserved because of their many small pores.

40|$|Upper Tertiary aeolian strata (Río Negro Formation) outcrop in {{extensive}} sea cliffs at the Northeast of Patagonia. These outcrops show deposits {{corresponding to}} a complete suite of aeolian and aeolian related sub-environments, and also provide excellent exposures to analyse the sedimentology and internal architecture from a sequence stratigraphic point of view. Field studies, supplemented withline-drawings of oblique photographs, allowed the recognition of seven aeolian depositional sequences within the succession, each one bounded by regional super surfaces (or deflation surfaces). Internally these aeolian sequences display a cyclic recurrence in facies, that yields a tentative genetic model for their evolution. As documented from field examples, each basic aeolian depositional sequence was deposited during a single aggradational period, and is bounded by unconformities related to degradational periods. Degradational periods are regional deflationary events, that resulted in deep-scoured to flat surfaces, characterised by erosion / non deposition in which the only recognised accumulation is isolated and large angular blocks of fine-grained aggregates, interpreted as residual remnants of deposits of the previous sequence. Aggradational periods are characterised by a near- continuous accumulations responsible for the sequence building. Differences in the aeolian sediment budget to the area and the rising rate of water table control the related facies types, and allow to discriminateearly and late aggradational sub-periods. Early aggradational sub-periods form under conditions of relatively fast rising water tables associated with moderate aeolian sediment budget, thus resulting {{in the development of}} extended wet interduneslaterally associated with aeolian dunes and dry interdunes. During late aggradational sub-periods, the depositional surface outdistanced the water table, and aeolian dunes and dry interdunes tend to predominate. This sub-period is also characterised by an upward tendency to stabilisation, <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the <b>common</b> occurrence of palaeosols in upper levels. Although the preserved thickness of each aeolian sequence is closely related to the average subsidence rate, the internal facies evolution suggests an overall climatic control for their origin.  </p...|$|R
