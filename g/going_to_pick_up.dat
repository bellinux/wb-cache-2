In 2007, 15,000 protesters of all ages began a rally and march as part of the March 17, 2007 anti-war protest, including local activists affiliated with the radical Students for a Democratic Society. After a fringe group broke off from the protest and burned a US soldier in effigy, Michelle Malkin stated that [...] "Portland hates America." [...] The Drudge Report, Lars Larson, and conservative blogs also commented on the effigy, and protest organizers with the American Friends Service Committee stated [...] "We had a massive, peaceful demonstration against the killing and destruction going on every day in Iraq, a positive experience for thousands of people from different walks of life, and apparently the right-wing fringe is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> that little portion." ...|$|E
500|$|On 16 April 2014, in {{response}} to earlier reports that the band may be retiring due to Malcolm Young being seriously ill and unable to perform, Brian Johnson commented that AC/DC are not retiring, stating [...] "We are definitely getting together in May in Vancouver. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> guitars, have a plonk and see if anybody has got any tunes or ideas. If anything happens we'll record it." [...] AC/DC subsequently announced in an official statement on their Facebook page that Malcolm Young would be {{taking a break from}} the band due to his ill health. It ended: [...] "The band will continue to make music." [...] In June, Johnson announced that AC/DC are [...] "very likely" [...] to be on the road again before the end of 2014. In July 2014, AC/DC confirmed that they have finished recording their next album and that Malcolm's nephew, Stevie Young replaced Malcolm in the studio.|$|E
500|$|Ian, Rachel and Geraldine join Rebecca and Carl. Geraldine {{says that}} the room is {{normally}} locked, but Rebecca rebukes her. Stuart rejoins the group after using the toilet. As the group talk, Mark and his wife, Liz, enter the bedroom, unaware of the people hiding in the wardrobe. The pair talk candidly before beginning foreplay and lying down on the bed. Geraldine shouts to alert them, {{and those in the}} wardrobe pretend they did not hear Mark and Liz's conversation. Mark and Liz reluctantly enter the wardrobe. As the doors close, Rachel's boyfriend Lee enters the room, but as the wardrobe has become more cramped, Stuart and Lee hide under the bed and Ian moves to the en suite bathroom. Stuart and Carl argue, and it is revealed that Carl has a fear of intimacy. When [...] "Stinky" [...] John enters the room, both those in the wardrobe and under the bed claim there is no room, so he hides behind a curtain. Jeremy enters the room and tells Rebecca he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> another guest from the train station, but as he turns to leave he mistakenly calls her [...] "Rachel". Andrew, Rebecca's father, enters and becomes annoyed when he sees people hiding in different places. He forces Jeremy, Stuart, Lee and Stinky John into the wardrobe with everyone else and follows them in.|$|E

60|$|Rollo, {{finding that}} he had no excuse for sitting there any longer, {{presently}} got up, and sauntered along towards the house, saying that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work, <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> chips.|$|R
500|$|The {{people in}} the {{wardrobe}} are uncomfortable, not least because of John's odour. Geraldine passes around mints as Andrew tells Mark {{that he no longer}} has contact with Dicky Lawrence, a potential business contact of Mark's. Andrew sings the [...] "sardine song", but Carl angrily stops him. Andrew and Geraldine reminisce about a scout jamboree held in the house many years ago, but Geraldine remembers that a boy named Phillip Harrison, nicknamed [...] "Little Pip", said Andrew did [...] "terrible things", and that the police were involved. Carl says how Andrew paid Pip's family to move away, and Andrew counters by claiming he did nothing to Pip and was only teaching him how to wash himself. Carl implies that he and John were not as lucky as Pip, and John says he can smell carbolic soap. There is silence, and Stuart points out no one else is looking for them, but they realise Ian has not yet returned from the bathroom. Jeremy says Ian is the person he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> from the station, but when Mark claims Ian is already at the party, Jeremy reveals the person Mark is referring to is not Ian. Outside, [...] "Ian" [...] locks the wardrobe and sprays it with lighter fluid while singing the sardine song. Carl realises Ian is actually Phillip, and the episode ends with Phillip leaning against the wardrobe, a lighter in his hand.|$|E
2500|$|Orbison {{had some}} success at Sun Records, however, and was {{introduced}} to Elvis Presley's social circle, once <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac. Orbison sold [...] "Claudette"—a song he wrote about Claudette Frady whom he married in 1957—to the Everly Brothers and their subsequent recording of it was released as the B-side of their smash hit [...] "All I Have to Do Is Dream". The first, and perhaps only, royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled {{him to make a}} down-payment on his own Cadillac. Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas, and then quit performing for seven months in 1958. In dire financial straits, his car repossessed, he turned to family and friends for funds.|$|E

[...] "This freight goes out first;" [...] and now Gaites noticed that up on a siding beyond the station an engine with a train of freight-cars was fretfully fizzing. The {{engineer}} put a silk-capped {{head out of}} the cab window and looked back at the station-master, who began to work his arms like a semaphore telegraph. Then the locomotive tooted, the bell rang, and the freight-train ran forward on the switch to the main track, and commenced backing down to where they stood. Evidently it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the car with Phyllis Desmond's piano in it.|$|E

Then they began to hurry, did Mr. Gray Squirrel and Mr. Fox Squirrel and Mr. Red Squirrel, each trying to make sure of his thousand nuts. They quarreled and they fought over the nuts on the ground and even up in the trees. And because they were so big and so strong, they pushed Mr. Chipmunk this way and they pushed him that way and often just as he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a fat nut one of them would knock him over and make off with the prize.|$|E

Of course those who don't know drains think horrible things; but under this London are miles and miles--hundreds of miles--and a few days rain and London empty will leave them sweet and clean. The main drains are big enough and airy enough for anyone. Then there's cellars, vaults, stores, from which bolting passages may be made to the drains. And the railway tunnels and subways. Eh? You begin to see? And we form a band--able-bodied, clean-minded men. We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> any rubbish that drifts in. Weaklings go out again." ...|$|E
