5|$|By 1897, {{the year}} of the launch of Spinks & Company, he <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> {{overcome}} his seeming reluctance to face World Champions again (perhaps from having several years' experience with his own product prototypes). Spinks competed in (but did not win) a December 3 open tournament.|$|E
5|$|By 926 Sihtric <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> {{acknowledged}} Æthelstan as over-king, adopting Christianity and {{marrying a}} sister of Æthelstan at Tamworth. Within {{the year he}} may have abandoned his new faith and repudiated his wife, but before Æthelstan and he could fight, Sihtric died suddenly in 927. His kinsman, perhaps brother, Gofraid, who had remained as his deputy in Dublin, came from Ireland to take power in York, but failed. Æthelstan moved quickly, seizing much of Northumbria. In less than a decade, {{the kingdom of the}} English had become by far the greatest power in Britain and Ireland, perhaps stretching as far north as the Firth of Forth.|$|E
5|$|In 1155, a Byzantine {{squadron}} of 10 ships {{in support of}} Norman rebel Robert III of Loritello arrived at Ancona, launching the last Byzantine bid to regain Southern Italy. Despite initial successes and reinforcements under megas doux Alexios Komnenos Bryennios, the expedition was ultimately defeated in 1156, and 4 Byzantine ships were captured. By 1169, the efforts of Manuel <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> borne fruit, as a large and purely Byzantine fleet of about 150 galleys, 20 large transports and 60 horse transports under megas doux Andronikos Kontostephanos was sent to invade Egypt {{in cooperation with the}} ruler of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. The invasion failed however, and the Byzantines lost half the fleet in a storm on the way back.|$|E

5|$|Pain is {{the presumed}} builder of Pain's Castle in the Welsh county of Radnor. He also {{controlled}} Caus Castle in Shropshire, and through his wife Ludlow Castle {{in the same}} county. Although he held the title to Weobley Castle, he {{does not appear to}} have exercised any control over it, which eventually went to Gilbert de Lacy. Pain was not the only recipient of Hugh de Lacy's lands; some went to Jocelin de Dinan and some to Miles of Gloucester. Pain's share included property in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire, and he succeeded in acquiring additional lands near Ludlow, adding to the manors he held there through his wife; his holdings of land were considered to be worth 17 knights fees. By 1130 he <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> acquired additional properties in Oxfordshire, where he is recorded as being excused payment of danegeld that year.|$|E
5|$|Soon, all {{the bodies}} except that of Alexey, which was never found, had been recovered. Those {{of the last}} three to die—De Long, Ambler and Ah Sam—were some {{distance}} from the rest, where they <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> attempted to set up a final camp on higher ground. Melville's party wrapped all the bodies in canvas, and carried them to a hill high enough to be safe from seasonal flooding. There they placed them in a large coffin improvised from driftwood, which they covered with rocks surmounted by a large wooden cross, inscribed with the names of the lost men. Melville's group left the site on April 7, 1882, then spent a further month in the delta, searching without success for signs of Chipp and his crew.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> not {{expected}} a landing at Lugos and their positions there were quickly overrun. The 1stSquadron, 8thCavalry then advanced eastward {{until it was}} stopped by a Japanese bunker complex {{on the edge of}} the Lorengau airstrip. An artillery barrage was brought down, followed by an airstrike by Kittyhawks with 500pound bombs. The cavalry resumed their advance and occupied a ridge overlooking the airstrip without opposition. In the meantime, the 7thCavalry had been landed at Lugos from the LST on its second trip and took over the defense of the area, freeing the 2ndSquadron, 8thCavalry to join the attack on Lorengau. The first attempt to capture the airstrip was checked by an enemy bunker complex. A second attempt on 17March, reinforced by the 1stSquadron, 7thCavalry and tanks, made good progress. The advance then resumed, with Lorengau itself falling on 18March.|$|E

25|$|On Thursday, 27 February (Julian), the Daily Advertiser {{reported}} that George Smith of the Artillery Ground {{had taken the}} late Duke of Somerset’s house at Marlborough and intended to open it as an inn. Smith offered the Artillery Ground and its dwelling house, etc. on lease for 7 years. Smith <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> overcome his bankruptcy problems in 1748.|$|E
25|$|Bi Sheng also {{developed}} wooden movable type, {{but it was}} abandoned in favor of ceramic types due {{to the presence of}} wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink. However wooden movable type <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> reached the Tangut Western Xia to the west by the 12th century. There, the Tanguts printed the Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union, a 449-page text considered to be the earliest extant example of a text printed using the wooden movable type.|$|E

25|$|In May 1540, the Abbey {{was visited}} {{by the local}} Protestant bishop. The Catholic Mass and the veneration of saints were banned, and Protestant {{services}} were ordered {{to be held in}} the Abbey church. The nuns are reported to have plugged their ears during the sermon. An inventory of the abbey's valuables was made by the Crown, and in 1543, most of the books and valuables were confiscated. The abbey was allowed to receive private donations on condition that the monks refrain from the public Catholic sermons they <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> been preaching until then.|$|E
25|$|After the 4th Light Horse Brigade {{was pushed}} off the Jisr ed Damieh to Es Salt track {{and forced to}} retire, {{a large number of}} German and Ottoman {{soldiers}} which <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> worked south along the Jordan, suddenly appeared at 10:00 in the open to attack the two squadrons of the 1st and 11th Light Horse Regiments defending the height of Red Hill. The squadrons were quickly forced to withdraw to the broken ground south and south-east of the hill. Only a narrow gap now remained for the 4th Light Horse Brigade to retreat southwards.|$|E
25|$|The Low Countries, Flanders, Brabant and Holland, {{were part}} of the {{inheritance}} of Philip II of Spain, who was a devout Catholic and self-proclaimed protector of the Counter-Reformation, and suppressed Protestantism through his Governor-general or Regent, Margaret of Parma the illegitimate daughter of Emperor Charles V, who was herself more willing to compromise. Although Protestants so far represented only a relatively small proportion of the Netherlandish population, but including disproportionate numbers from the nobility and upper bourgeoisie, the Catholic Church <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> lost the loyalty of the population, and traditional Catholic anti-clericalism was now dominant.|$|E

25|$|Mindful of {{the fact}} the killer <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> {{returned}} to sites of his previous murders to move the bodies, possibly in a sexual ritual, police theorized the killer may also attempt to return to this latest crime scene. Although earlier attempts to enforce news blackouts as {{to the discovery of}} victims Dawn Basom and Alice Kalom had proven unsuccessful, on this occasion, police successfully ordered a news blackout relating to the discovery of this latest victim. Beineman's body was replaced with that of a tailor's mannequin, and the gully surrounding this mannequin monitored by undercover officers.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 President Ronald Reagan awarded Helms the National Security Medal, {{given to}} both civilians and the military. That year Helms {{also served as}} a member of the President's Commission on National Security. After Reagan's {{election}} in 1980, Helms <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> been a behind-the-scenes proponent of William Casey for the DCI position. Helms and Casey (DCI 1981–87) first met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during the second world war. Also in 1983 Helms gave a prepared speech on intelligence issues, before dignitaries and five hundred invited guests gathered at a Washington awards banquet held in his honor. Here Helms was given the Donovan Award.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to prevent}} a war, Samuel Nelson enlisted Campbell to help broker {{negotiations}} over Fort Sumter. On March 15, Campbell relayed to Martin Jenkins Crawford a supposed promise from Seward {{that the federal government}} would evacuate Fort Sumter within five days. As the Fort remained occupied on March 21, Confederate commissioners pushed Campbell to find out more; Seward reassured Campbell that evacuation would take place and Campbell reassured Crawford: on March 21, March 22, April 1, and hesitantly on April 7. Lincoln had already ordered the fort resupplied. By April 12 diplomacy <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> failed and the Battle of Fort Sumter began. Campbell resigned his position on the court and went South. Fearing he would be persecuted as a Union sympathizer {{in his home state of}} Alabama, he moved instead to New Orleans.|$|E

25|$|On 6 June 1937, {{a family}} boating on the River Idle in Bawtry spotted {{an object in}} the water, close to the bank. Upon closer inspection, this family {{discovered}} that the object was the partially decomposed body of a child, with the head and upper torso embedded in silt and trapped in a drain below water level. Her body had been weighted down with wood and metal. On {{the banks of the}} river was a torn and rotting sack which <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> been used to transport the child's body. The location was approximately 30 miles from where Nodder had lived. The body was moved to an inn at Newington, where the clothing present with the body was identified by Wilfred Tinsley as belonging to his daughter. A subsequent autopsy at the Retford Mortuary confirmed Mona had been strangled—most likely with a ligature—and that she had been dead before entering the water. Due to the extensive period of time the body had been in the river, the extensive adipocere formation upon the corpse prevented the pathologist from being able to determine whether Mona had been sexually assaulted before her murder.|$|E
25|$|Arnold Davis also {{informed}} police Collins {{had been}} in the company of victim Alice Kalom on the evening of her disappearance. According to Davis, he had heard Collins and Kalom arguing behind closed doors, before Kalom had run out of his (Collins') apartment, with Collins chasing after her. Collins had returned to their shared apartment shortly thereafter and asked Davis to hide a knife for him. Davis had reported this incident to police, and later handed them the knife Collins had allegedly asked him to hide. Investigators determined the knife was consistent with the weapon used to stab Kalom. When Kalom's body was found, a distinctive boot print on her skirt was found to be a perfect match to a boot Collins had owned, and although Collins <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> cleaned his car in an effort to destroy evidence prior to his arrest, investigators would find bloodstains in this vehicle and upon a raincoat he owned which were determined to match Kalom's blood type. Moreover, although the prosecution at Collins' trial had been unable to question Arnold Davis in detail as to the contents of the laundry box he had observed his roommate hurriedly remove from their apartment and towards his car two days prior to his arrest, one of the items he had seen within this laundry box had been a distinctive purple leather shoe, which may have belonged to Kalom.|$|E
25|$|With David II in his custody, Edward III {{had a good}} {{opportunity}} to try to reach terms, though Edward Balliol's interests were a sticking point. He <b>had</b> <b>evidently</b> prepared to overlook them by the time he made his first offer, in 1348, which seems to have been that David II would hold Scotland as a fief for England, naming Edward III or one of his sons as his successor, should he die without children. This had altered somewhat by 1350 when Edward III sent Douglas of Liddelsdale, also in custody in the Tower of London, to see if the Scots would be willing to take different terms: to ransom David II for a fee of £40,000, the restoration of the disinherited lords, and the naming of Edward III's young son John of Gaunt as David's successor, should he die without children. David himself is credited with removing Edward III's name from the line of succession in Scotland, and the Scots seem to have been willing to entertain the idea as they sent Douglas of Liddesdale back for further negotiation and David II was himself permitted to briefly return to Scotland in early 1352 to try to seal the deal. Stewart would obviously be disinclined to support terms that removed him from succession, but he seems ultimately not to have been alone. The Parliament convened in March 1352 did not find the prospect of submitting to the English a fair trade for the freedom of their king. David II was sent back.|$|E
