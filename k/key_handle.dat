50|$|A key {{management}} system (KMS), {{also known as a}} crytographic {{key management}} system (CKMS), is an integrated approach for generating, distributing and managing cryptographic keys for devices and applications.

In an holistic approach, it covers all aspects of security - from the secure generation of keys over the secure exchange of keys up to secure <b>key</b> <b>handling</b> and storage on the client. Thus, a KMS includes the backend functionality for key generation, distribution, and replacement as well as the client functionality for injecting keys, storing and managing keys on devices.

Ensuring that this assumption holds is one of the most crucial problems for all current digital signature applications. This paper describes the solution developed and prototyped by the authors – using a mobile computing device with a smart card reader for creating digital signatures. We give an overview of several common settings for digital signature applications and problems they have, describing also several frameworks for mobile security applications. A discussion about the choice of devices, design issues, concrete solutions and their security concerns follows. We conclude that although nothing can prevent careless private <b>key</b> <b>handling,</b> careful management is easier and more convenient when using our solution. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{beauty of}} identity-based {{encryption}} (IBE) {{lies in the}} convenience of public <b>key</b> <b>handling,</b> {{in the sense that}} any identification such as an email address, a name, or an IP number can serve as a public key of a party. However, such convenience is not inherited by a system where a party possesses many identities (e. g., many email addresses) and has to use them as his public keys. When this system is handled with a standard IBE, the user must manage all the private keys that are associated with all the public keys (identities). However, keeping these private keys is inconvenient to the user. In this paper, we solve this problem by proposing a novel identity-based encryption where we set a private key that maps multiple public keys (identities); namely, we can use a private key to decrypt multiple ciphertexts; each was encrypted with a different public key (identity) ...|$|R

50|$|Asymmetric {{encryption}} expands on {{symmetric encryption}} by incorporating {{two different types}} of keys into the encryption method: private and public keys. A public key can be accessed by anyone and is unique to one user whereas a private key is a secret key that is unique to and only known by one user. In most scenarios the public key is the encryption key whereas the private key is the decryption key. As an example, if individual A would like {{to send a message to}} individual B using asymmetric encryption, he would encrypt the message using Individual B's public key and then send the encrypted version. Individual B would then be able to decrypt the message using his private key. Individual C would not be able to decrypt Individual A's message, as Individual C's private key is not the same as Individual B's private key. Asymmetric encryption is often described as being more secure in comparison to symmetric database encryption given that private keys do not need to be shared as two separate <b>keys</b> <b>handle</b> encryption and decryption processes.|$|R
