25|$|Housing {{and urban}} {{development}} were major issues throughout Bates’ long tenure as mayor. Bates’ success in promoting an environmental agenda as a member the California Assembly led him to partner with the environmental groups like the Sierra Club in promoting a series of “Smart Growth” policies for Berkeley and the Bay Area. In addition to advocating dense, transit-oriented urban development, Bates worked to mitigate the effects of Berkeley’s rapidly rising housing costs on the city’s low-income residents. Bates proposed a municipal density bonus program to incentivize the inclusion of affordable units in new developments and to increase the fees that developers must pay into the city’s Housing Trust Fund. Bates also put up resistance to UC Berkeley’s expansion. In 2004, following the release of UC’s Long-Range Development Plan, Bates promised to fight the expansion “tooth and nail.” Claiming, “The university asked us to sign {{the equivalent of a}} blank check,” Bates announced that the city would file a $4.1 million lawsuit against the university. After a year of negotiations in which the university agreed to increase its ongoing <b>fiscal</b> <b>support</b> for city services, the lawsuit was settled for $1.2 million.|$|E

2500|$|According to Amherst College {{sociology}} professor Jerome L. Himmelstein, antifeminism {{is rooted in}} social stigmas against feminism and is thus a purely reactionary movement. Himmelstein identifies two prevailing theories that seek to explain the origins of antifeminism: the first theory, proposed by Himmelstein, is that conservative opposition in the abortion and Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) debates has created a climate of hostility toward the entire feminist movement. The second theory Himmelstein identifies states that the female antifeminists who lead the movement are largely married, low education, and low personal income women who embody the [...] "insecure housewife scenario" [...] and seek to perpetuate their own situation in which women depend on men for <b>fiscal</b> <b>support.</b> However, numerous studies have failed to correlate the aforementioned demographic factors with support for antifeminism, and only religiosity correlates positively with antifeminist alignment. Thus, Himmelstein concludes that antifeminism is a conservative religious reaction against the progress of modern feminism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} {{refugees}} fleeing into Britain reached its climax in autumn of 1792. In September alone, {{a total of}} nearly 4000 refugees landed in Britain. The number of displaced persons who found themselves in Great Britain was high, although the exact number is debated, it {{is believed to be}} in the thousands. [...] The uncontrolled influx of foreigners created significant anxiety in government circles and the wider community. [...] After much debate, the Parliament of Great Britain passed the Aliens Act of 1793 which served to regulate and reduce immigration. Those entering the country were required to give their names, ranks, occupations, and addresses to the local Justice of Peace. Those who did not comply, were deported or imprisoned. Community concern at the influx of French refugees slowly abated as time passed and the circumstances of the French Revolution became better known, and there is considerable evidence of charitable and hospitable acts toward the émigrés. [...] The Wilmot Committee, a private network of social elite, provided <b>fiscal</b> <b>support</b> to the refugees, and later the government adopted a national relief campaign which gained support both from those with political clout as well as the masses.|$|E
