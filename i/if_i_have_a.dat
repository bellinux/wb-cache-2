25|$|Look, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{triangle}} in midfield – Claude Makélélé {{behind and}} two others just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That's because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makélélé, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him {{he can see the}} whole pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team's wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs. There is nothing a pure 4–4–2 can do to stop things.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} a quote from the French philosopher Ernest Renan, taken from A Skeptic's Prayer—"O Lord, {{if there is a}} Lord, save my soul, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> soul". Guest star Steve Makaj, who played one of the state troopers in the episode, would have a minor {{recurring}} role in The X-Files as assassin Scott Ostelhoff. Fellow guest actor John Pyper-Ferguson would reappear in Millennium second season, playing an unrelated character in [...] "Anamnesis". Pyper-Ferguson also appeared in [...] "Leviathan", an episode of Millennium creator Chris Carter's next series, Harsh Realm.|$|E
500|$|Diaby {{is often}} {{described}} as a typical box-to-box midfielder; a midfielder who is adept both offensively and defensively. While he can play as a defensive midfielder, Diaby has often attempted to distance himself from that position, admitting that [...] "I am better <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> holding midfielder with me". His club manager Arsène Wenger describes him similarly stating [...] "He (Diaby) is more of an offensive player. He is not a defensive-minded player and he's not a holding player. He's a player who crosses the field at ease, goes from box to box like it's no distance and has good power as well". During his early years with Auxerre, he was often used as an attacking midfielder or a support striker due to his technical ability, close control, and dexterity to dribble past opponents or slip passes to teammates.|$|E

500|$|Carol Swiderski of the Chicago Tribune {{wrote that}} {{although}} saying [...] "have a nice day" [...] {{may not be}} sincere, the speaker has acknowledged that the recipient is there. She argued [...] "ave we become so analytic that we can't accept these little niceties without asking ourselves, 'Did he really mean it? Does she really care <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> nice day?'" [...] Writing that society has become so automated that going through a check-out line at a grocery store without having made eye contact or spoken with the checker is possible, Swiderski favored [...] "insincerely meant human kindness to a robot". She encouraged people to respond to [...] "have a nice day" [...] with [...] "you have a nice day, too" [...] because she hoped that when {{a sufficient number of}} people do this, there could be a time when people will sincerely intend it.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Youkilis {{started the}} season with the Portland Sea Dogs. In 94 games, he led the Eastern League with a [...]487 on-base {{percentage}} (best all-time for the team through 2007), and was third in the league with a [...]327 batting average (second-best all-time for the team through 2007). Later, he earned {{a spot on the}} Eastern League All-Star team, the Baseball America AA All-Star team, and on the U.S. roster for the 2003 All-Star Futures Game. After Portland, Youkilis moved up to play for the Pawtucket Red Sox, the Boston Red Sox Class-AAA franchise. During his time with Pawtucket, Youkilis managed to complete a streak he started while in Portland: he reached base in 71 consecutive games, tying future teammate Kevin Millar's minor-league record for consecutive games reaching base. His 104 walks were the third-highest number recorded in the minors in 2003. Asked, however, about the focus in position-playing baseball on five-tool players, Youkilis quipped, [...] "I don't even know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tool." ...|$|E
500|$|According to The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, {{the most}} {{important}} element of Lichtenstein's procedure in the early 1960s was [...] "the enlargement and unification of his source material". Although, according to some sources, the changes made to produce Drowning Girl are not regarded as significant, Lichtenstein made several notable changes from the original source: [...] "In the original illustration, the drowning girl's boyfriend appears in the background, clinging to a capsized boat. Lichtenstein cropped the image dramatically, showing the girl alone and encircled by a threatening wave. He changed the caption from 'I don't care <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cramp!' to 'I don't care!' and the boyfriend's name from Mal to Brad." [...] With the former narrative change, Lichtenstein removed evidence that the drowning girl has a cramp in her leg. With the latter narrative change, Lichtenstein attempted to change the perception of the boyfriend. When discussing another work (I Know...Brad), Lichtenstein stated that the name Brad sounded heroic to him and was used with the aim of clichéd oversimplification.|$|E

2500|$|The writer Al Aronowitz, {{while working}} on a profile of Jane Fonda for The Saturday Evening Post in the 1960s, asked Henry Fonda about method acting: [...] "I can't {{articulate}} about the Method", he told me, [...] "because I never studied it. I don't mean to suggest that I have any feelings {{one way or the}} other about it...I don't know what the Method is and I don't care what the Method is. Everybody's got a method.

2500|$|Kitt {{later became}} a vocal {{advocate}} for LGBT rights and publicly supported same-sex marriage, which she considered a civil right. She had been quoted as saying: [...] "I support it [...] because we're asking for the same thing. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> partner and something happens to me, I want that partner to enjoy the benefits {{of what we have}} reaped together. It's a civil-rights thing, isn't it?" [...] Kitt famously appeared at many LGBT fundraisers, including a mega event in Baltimore, Maryland, with George Burns and Jimmy James. Scott Sherman, an agent at Atlantic Entertainment Group, stated: [...] "Eartha Kitt is fantastic... appears at so many LGBT events in support of civil rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} it will cause consumers, {{particularly}} those less wealthy and educated, to avoid needed and appropriate healthcare {{because of the cost}} burden and the inability to make informed, appropriate choices. [...] "Consumer-driven healthcare is badly named, because it's certainly not driven by consumers," [...] said Jonathan Oberlander. It is [...] "really just shifting the cost of healthcare onto the backs of the patients". People with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, will be hurt, because with a deductible of $3000 to $4000, such people {{will never be able to}} save anything in their savings accounts. [...] "Employers like it because they're going to save money," [...] but they're not going to fund these healthcare accounts adequately, he said. [...] "Conservatives tend to support consumer-driven healthcare. They believe, as do a fair number of health economists, that people use too much healthcare, and use too much healthcare of little value. If you move to high-deductible plans, people will think twice. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sore throat, instead of going to my physician, I'll have a cup of tea instead." ...|$|E
