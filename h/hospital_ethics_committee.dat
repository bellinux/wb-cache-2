40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine {{critical}} care nurses' perceptions of the usefulness of <b>hospital</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> as a coping strategy for resolving ethical dilemmas. The conceptual framework was Lazarus and Folkman's theory of stress, appraisal, and coping (1984). The convenience sample was five critical care nurses from five midwestern hospitals. Confidentiality was maintained by identifying participants as numbers. The research design for the study was an exploratory case study. The research question, nurses perceptions' of the usefulness of <b>hospital</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> as a coping strategy to resolve ethical dilemmas, was analyzed using a qualitative methodology. Findings indicated that the nurses did not perceive <b>hospital</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> as useful resources in ethical conflicts. Barriers to use of committees included lack of education about the committees, lack of timely intervention by committees in a crisis and risks involved in confronting physicians via committees. Conclusions were that <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> were not fulfilling a role as support systems empowering nurses to act as patient advocates in ethical dilemmas. Results can be used to develop strategies to increase the ethics committees' effectiveness in ethical dilemmas. School of NursingThesis (M. S. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Ethics</b> <b>committees</b> {{and their}} system of {{research}} protocol peer-review are currently used worldwide. To ensure an international standard for research ethics and safety, however, data is {{needed on the}} quality and function of each nation's <b>ethics</b> <b>committees.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the characteristics and developments of <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> established at medical schools and general hospitals in Japan. Methods This study consisted of four national surveys sent twice over a period of eight years to two separate samples. The first target was the <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> of all 80 medical schools and the second target was all general hospitals with over 300 beds in Japan (n = 1457 in 1996 and n = 1491 in 2002). Instruments contained four sections: (1) committee structure, (2) frequency of annual meetings, (3) committee function, and (4) existence of a set of guidelines for the refusal of blood transfusion by Jehovah's Witnesses. Results Committee structure was overall interdisciplinary. Frequency of annual meetings increased significantly for both medical school and <b>hospital</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> over the eight years. The primary activities for medical school and <b>hospital</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> were research protocol reviews and policy making. Results also showed a significant increase in the use of ethical guidelines, particularly those related to the refusal of blood transfusion by Jehovah's Witnesses, among both medical school and <b>hospital</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committees.</b> Conclusion Overall findings indicated a greater recognized degree of responsibilities and an increase in workload for Japanese <b>ethics</b> <b>committees.</b> </p...|$|R

Lawyers representing Emilio's mother Catarina filed for a restraining order on March 20 to allow the family more time to locate another facility willing to accept Emilio.

On April 4, lawyers for Ms. Gonzales challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} ADA in Federal court, saying that it violated Emilio's 1st and 14th Amendment rights. However, on April 6, federal judge Sam Sparks declined to intervene and sent the matter back to state court. As of April 9, over 30 hospitals nationwide had refused to accept Emilio as a transfer patient. [...] On April 10, Travis County Probate Judge Guy Herman issued an emergency restraining order to prevent the hospital from removing Emilio from his respirator. A hearing was scheduled for April 19.
