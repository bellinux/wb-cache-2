50|$|The amplified <b>insert</b> <b>assembly</b> method {{does not}} depend on prefix and suffix sequences, {{allowing}} to be used in combination with a majority of assembly standards. It also has a higher transformation rate than 3A assembly, and it does not require the involved plasmids to have different antibiotic resistance genes. This method reduces noise from uncut plasmids by amplifying a desired insert using PCR prior to digestion and treating the mixture with the restriction enzyme DpnI, which digests methylated DNA like plasmids. Eliminating the template plasmids with DpnI leaves only the insert to be amplified by PCR. To decrease the possibility ofcreating plasmids with unwanted combinations of insert and backbone, the backbone can be treated with phosphatase to prevent its religation.|$|E

Through-the-thickness and partially inserted fully potted inserts are studied. Insert materials considered are: aluminum and 3 D woven composite. Experimental results are compared with the analytical predictions. It is observed that the specific strength of 3 D woven composite inserts is more than that of aluminum inserts. Further, it is observed that the specific strength of through-the-thickness inserts is more than that of partially inserted fully potted inserts. Delamination between upper face plate and core material and sliding of attachment/insert within the core are the main modes of failure initiation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop an indigenous Magnetorheological damper or shock absorber for automotive application especially to be fitted in passenger vehicle. The research involves the design and development of the MR damper prototype, which the design was considering an optimum number of coils winding for the prototype. The research works also involve {{the development of a new}} control algorithm for the prototype where the algorithm is used to control the operation of the MR damper prototype. The algorithm is also functioning as a tool to improve the performance of the MR damper prototype. The prototype, which was made in a tube form, is suitable to be applied in vehicleâ€™s suspension system. A wider range of damping characteristic of the MR damper made it suitable to be assembled in any passenger vehicleâ€™s suspension system with the capacity of 2. 0 L and below. The tube design is meant for the strut <b>insert</b> <b>assembly</b> where the user just need to replace the MR damper tube in the original strut housing. The result from the tests carried out on the prototype using the dynamic loading machine shows wider damping force range characteristic, as estimated during the design phase. Further simulation work were using the prototype characteristics data by applying it on a vehicle simulation model which shows that the MR damper are able to improve passenger ride comfort significantly.

40|$|Controlling the {{temperature}} of the exhaust valves is paramount for proper functioning of engines and for the long lifespan of valve train components. The majority of the heat outflow from the valve takes place along the valve-seat-cylinder head-coolant thermal path which is significantly influenced by the thermal contact resistance (TCR) present at the valve/seat and seat/head interfaces. A test rig facility and experimental procedure were successfully developed to assess the effect of the valve/seat and seat/head interfaces on heat outflow from the valve, in particular the effects of the valve/seat interface geometry, seat <b>insert</b> <b>assembly</b> method, i. e. press or shrink fit, and seat insert metallic coating on the operating temperature of the valve. The results of tests have shown that the degree of the valve-seat geometric conformity is more significant than the thermal conductivity of the insert: for low conforming assemblies, the mean valve head temperature recorded during tests on copper-infiltrated insert seats was higher than that recorded during tests on noninfiltrated seats of higher conformance. The effect of the insert-cylinder head assembly method, i. e. shrink-fitted versus press-fitted inserts, has proved negligible: results have shown insignificant valve head temperature variations, for both tin-coated and uncoated inserts. On the other hand, coating the seat inserts with a layer of tin (20 - 22 ¿m) reduced the mean valve head temperature by approximately 15 °C as measured during tests on uncoated seats. The analysis of the valve/seat and seat/head interfaces has indicated that the surface asperities of the softer metal in contact would undergo plastic deformation. Suitable thermal contact conductance (TCC) models, available in the public domain, were used to evaluate the conductance for the valve/seat and seat/cylinder head interfaces. Finally, a FE thermal model of the test rig has been developed with a view to assess the quality of the calculated TCC values for the valve/seat and seat/head interfaces. The results of the thermal analysis have shown that predicted temperatures at chosen control points agree with those measured during tests on thermometric seats with an acceptable level of accuracy, proving the effectiveness of the used TCC models.

40|$|In {{response}} to the budget environment and to expand on the International Space Station (ISS) Fluids and Combustion Facility (FCF) Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR), common hardware approach, the NASA Combustion Science Program shifted focus in 1999 from single investigator PI (Principal Investigator) -specific hardware to multi-user 'Minifacilities'. These mini-facilities would take the CIR common hardware philosophy to the next level. The approach that was developed re-arranged all the investigations in the program into sub-fields of research. Then common requirements within these subfields were used to develop a common system that would then be complemented by a few PI-specific components. The sub-fields of research selected were droplet combustion, solids and fire safety, and gaseous fuels. From these research areas three mini-facilities have sprung: the Multi-user Droplet Combustion Apparatus (MDCA) for droplet research, Flow Enclosure for Novel Investigations in Combustion of Solids (FEANICS) for solids and fire safety, and the Multi-user Gaseous Fuels Apparatus (MGFA) for gaseous fuels. These mini-facilities will develop common Chamber <b>Insert</b> <b>Assemblies</b> (CIA) and diagnostics for the respective investigators complementing the capability provided by CIR. Presently there are four investigators for MDCA, six for FEANICS, and four for MGFA. The goal of these multi-user facilities is to drive the cost per PI down after the initial development investment is made. Each of these mini-facilities will become a fixture of future Combustion Science NASA Research Announcements (NRAs), enabling investigators to propose against an existing capability. Additionally, an investigation is provided the opportunity to enhance the existing capability {{to bridge the gap}} between the capability and their specific science requirements. This multi-user development approach will enable the Combustion Science Program to drive cost per investigation down while drastically reducing the time required to go from selection to space flight...|$|R

40|$|In {{the design}} process of {{compressors}} for gas turbines, the application of casing treatments showed a substantial contribution to the enhancement of total pressure ratio and stability. The development of a treated casing endwall remains quite demanding due to the complicated flow features and interactions, particularly when applied to transonic rotors with strong shock systems. To achieve an insight into these flow mechanisms, the axial single-stage Darmstadt Transonic Compressor Test Rig was equipped with a casing treatment with 56 bend axial slots. Speedlines and exit plane measurements were made for design speed and for a completely subsonic flow field. Time resolved measurement techniques were chosen to investigate the rotorcasing treatment interaction. The casing treatment was designed to provide an optical access through two slots. In addition, the land between these slots was replaced with a glass <b>insert.</b> The <b>assembly</b> allowed phase-resolved particle image velocimetry investigations in the rotor tip area and inside the tip gap underneath one axial slot. Results showed an increase in stall margin for both operating conditions. Efficiency declined slightly. At design speed, a second shock structure develops when the casing treatment is applied. This additional shock front has considerable effect on the flow field. Vortices inside the slots account for the efficiency losses...|$|R

40|$|Creating highly {{articulated}} miniature structures requires {{assembling a}} large number of small parts. This is a very challenging task and increases cost of mechanical <b>assemblies.</b> <b>Insert</b> molding presents the possibility of creating a highly articulated structure in a single molding step. This can be accomplished by placing multiple metallic bearings in the mold and injecting plastic on top of them. In theory, this idea can generate a multi degree of freedom structures in just one processing step without requiring any post molding assembly operations. However, the polymer material has a tendency to shrink on top of the metal bearings and hence jam the joints. Hence, until now insert molding has not been used to create articulated structures. This paper presents a theoretical model for estimating the extent of joint jamming that occurs due to the shrinkage of the polymer on top of the metal bearings. Th...|$|R
40|$|Antigen {{receptor}} genes acquire junctional <b>inserts</b> upon <b>assembly</b> {{from their}} component, germ line-encoded V, D, and J segments. Inserts are generally of random sequence, {{but a small}} number of V-D, D-J, or V-J junctions are exceptional. In such junctions, one or two added base pairs inversely repeat the sequence of the abutting germ line DNA. (For example, a gene segment ending AG might acquire an insert beginning with the residues CT upon joining). It has been proposed that the nonrandom residues, termed "P nucleotides," are a consequence of an obligatory end-modification step in V(D) J recombination. P insertion in normal, unselected V(D) J joining products, however, has not been rigorously established. Here, we use an experimentally manipulable system, isolated from immune selection of any kind, to examine the fine structure of V(D) J junctions formed in wild-type lymphoid cells. Our results, according to statistical tests, show the following, (i) The frequency of P insertion is influenced by the DNA sequence of the joined ends. (ii) P inserts may be longer than two residues in length. (iii) P inserts are associated with coding ends only. Additionally, a systematic survey of published P nucleotide data shows no evidence for variation in P insertion as a function of genetic locus and ontogeny. Together, these analyses establish the generality of the P nucleotide pattern within inserts but do not fully support previous conjectures as to their origin and centrality in the joining reaction...|$|R

There are two main approaches to binary instrumentation: static and dynamic binary instrumentation. In this paper we present a static binary instrumentation toolkit for Linux on the x 86 /x 86 64 platforms, PEBIL (PMaC’s Efficient Binary Instrumentation Toolkit for Linux). PEBIL is similar to other toolkits {{in terms of how}} additional code is inserted into the executable. However, it is designed with the primary goal of producing efficient-running instrumented code. To this end, PEBIL uses function level code relocation in order to insert large but fast control structures. Furthermore, the PEBIL API provides tool developers with the means to <b>insert</b> lightweight hand-coded <b>assembly</b> rather than relying solely on {{the insertion of}} instrumentation functions. These features enable the implementation of efficient instrumentation tools with PEBIL.

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} rising demand of {{electronic}} systems with functional density for industrial and automotive applications. Those components, which are typically manufactured by overmoulding blanked metal <b>inserts</b> within an <b>assembly</b> injection process, are often exposed to rough operating conditions. Especially penetrating water {{can lead to}} a severe damage of electronic systems which are often crucial to safety. Leakage can be caused among other things by crack initiation within the polymer at sharp edges of the metal insert as a consequence of stress concentration. In order to reduce stress concentration the effect of metal inserts with rounded edges and the forming process to manufacture such inserts is investigated. Since typical sheet thicknesses for electronic components are 1 [*]mm and less the dimensions of the rounded edges are on the scale of micro features. The microforming operation of rounded edges is provided by open coining. The influence of varying part dimensions is investigated using FE-simulation. Furthermore, ideal rectangular insert shapes are compared to parts with sheared edge geometry. In addition the effect of rounded edges on stress distribution of overmoulded parts is analysed by combining resulting geometries of the forming simulation with the numerical analysis of stress distribution within the polymer...|$|R

This study evaluated the effect of concentration and application time of hydrogen peroxide on the surface topography and bond strength of glass fiber posts to resin cores. MethodsFiber posts were etched with 24 % or 50 % hydrogen peroxide for 1, 5, or 10 min (n = 10). Posts without any treatment were used as a control. After etching, the posts were silanated and adhesive resin was applied. The posts were positioned into a mold to allow a self-cured resin core to be <b>inserted.</b> The post/resin <b>assembly</b> was serially sectioned into five beams that were subjected to a tensile bond strength test.

ResultsNon-etched post presents a relatively smooth surface without fiber exposure. Application of hydrogen peroxide increased the surface roughness and exposed the fibers. All experimental conditions yielded similar bond strength values that were higher than those obtained in the control group.

40|$|DNA {{enters the}} {{herpes simplex virus}} capsid {{by way of a}} {{ring-shaped}} structure called the portal. Each capsid contains a single portal, located at a unique capsid vertex, that is composed of 12 UL 6 protein molecules. The position of the portal requires that capsid formation take place {{in such a way that}} a portal is incorporated into one of the 12 capsid vertices and excluded from all other locations, including the remaining 11 vertices. Since initiation or nucleation of capsid formation is a unique step in the overall assembly process, involvement of the portal in initiation has the potential to cause its incorporation into a unique vertex. In such a mode of assembly, the portal would need to be involved in initiation but not able to be <b>inserted</b> in subsequent <b>assembly</b> steps. We have used an in vitro capsid assembly system to test whether the portal is involved selectively in initiation. Portal incorporation was compared in capsids assembled from reactions in which (i) portals were present at the beginning of the assembly process and (ii) portals were added after assembly was under way. The results showed that portal-containing capsids were formed only if portals were present at the outset of assembly. A delay caused formation of capsids lacking portals. The findings indicate that if portals are present in reaction mixtures, a portal is incorporated during initiation or another early step in assembly. If no portals are present, assembly is initiated in another, possibly related, way that does not involve a portal...|$|R

This work is aimed at detecting and correcting a type of misassembly that we call Compression/Expansion or CE misassemblies whereby a section of sequence has been erroneously omitted or <b>inserted</b> in the <b>assembly.</b> Other types of deficiencies include gaps in the genome sequence. We developed a statistic for identifying Compression/Expansion misassemblies called the CE statistic. It is based on examining the placement of mate pairs of reads in the assembly. In addition to this, we developed an algorithm that is aimed at closing gaps and validating and/or correcting CE misassemblies detected by the CE statistic. This algorithm {{is similar to a}} shooting algorithm used in solving two-point boundary value problems in partial differential equations. We call this algorithm the Shooting Method. The Shooting Method finds all possible ways to assemble a local region of the genome contained between two target reads. We use a combination of the CE statistic and Shooting Method to detect and correct some CE misassemblies and close gaps in genome assemblies. We tested our techniques both on faux and real data. Applying this technique to 22 bacterial draft assemblies for which the finished genome sequence is known, we were able to identify 5 out of 8 real CE misassemblies. We applied the Shooting Method to a de novo assembly of the Bos taurus genome made from Sanger data. We were able to close 9, 863 gaps out of 58, 386.

40|$|Thermal Pu-recycling {{experience}} at KWU/ALKEM dates {{back as far}} as the mid- 60 s. Following the successful introduction of test fuel assemblies, thermal Pu-recycling has been demonstrated on a large scale {{since the beginning of the}} 70 s in the power plants at Kahl / (VAK), Gundremmingen (KRB-Al and Obrigheim (KWO). During the last few. years improved fabrication processes were de-veloped resulting in MOX-fuel with favourable reprocessing pro-e perties. The AUPuC-process, a co-conversion process, is used if the starting material is available as plutonium nitrate solution. In the case of plutonium oxide being the starting material. the OCOM-process, a co-milling process, is used. Since 1981 thermal Pu-recycling has been carried on with the improved MOX-,fuel at Obrigheim (KWO) and since 1982 at Neckarwest-heim (GKN). As agreed with the German utilities in the near future Pu-recycling will be concentrated in PWRs. c Optimization of the nuclear design led to a MOX-fuel assembly with a minimum of 2 types of rods of different Pu-content. High flexibi-lity exists in the number of MOX-fuel assemblies to be loadejd in 9207 fyo 1 PWR cores. Extensive experience has been gained during the large- c scale German recycling programmes. The MOX-fuel <b>assemblies</b> <b>inserted</b> up to now exhibit an operating performance which is as good as that of the uranium fuel assemblies supplied by KWU. The experience was extended by the irradiation of special test rods. Postirradiation investigations on MOX-fuel show high mechanical stability, low shrinkage and swelling and good behaviour at power transients. On the basis of this experience the large-scale use of MOX-fuel is technically feasible and will be extended to PWRs of the 1300 MWe type in 1984. 1...|$|R
40|$|Bone tissue {{mechanical}} properties are deemed {{a key component}} of bone strength, but their assessment requires invasive procedures. Here we validate a new instrument, a reference point indentation (RPI) instrument, for measuring these tissue properties in vivo. The RPI instrument performs bone microindentation testing (BMT) by <b>inserting</b> a probe <b>assembly</b> through the skin covering the tibia and, after displacing periosteum, applying 20 indentation cycles at 2 Hz each with a maximum force of 11 N. We assessed 27 women with osteoporosis-related fractures and 8 controls of comparable ages. Measured total indentation distance (46. 0 ± 14 versus 31. 7 ± 3. 3 µm, p =. 008) and indentation distance increase (18. 1 ± 5. 6 versus 12. 3 ± 2. 9 µm, p =. 008) were significantly greater in fracture patients than in controls. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the two measurements were 93. 1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 83. 1 – 100) and 90. 3 % (95 % CI 73. 2 – 100), respectively. Interobserver coefficient of variation ranged from 8. 7 % to 15. 5 %, and the procedure was well tolerated. In a separate study of cadaveric human bone samples (n = 5), crack growth toughness and indentation distance increase correlated (r = – 0. 9036, p =. 018), and scanning electron microscope images of cracks induced by indentation and by experimental fractures were similar. We conclude that BMT, by inducing microscopic fractures, directly measures bone {{mechanical properties}} at the tissue level. The technique is feasible for use in clinics with good reproducibility. It discriminates precisely between patients with and without fragility fracture and may provide clinicians and researchers with a direct in vivo measurement of bone tissue resistance to fracture. © 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research...|$|R
