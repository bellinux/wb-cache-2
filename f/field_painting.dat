25|$|I don't {{know what}} Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting</b> means. I {{think it was}} {{probably}} invented by some critic, which is okay, but I don't think the phrase means anything. Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting?</b> I mean, what is color? Painting {{has to do with}} a lot of things. Color is among the things it has to do with. It has to do with surface. It has to do with shape, It has to do with feelings which are more difficult to get at.|$|E
25|$|Another {{artist whose}} best known works relate to both {{abstract}} expressionism and to color <b>field</b> <b>painting</b> is Robert Motherwell. Motherwell's style of abstract expressionism, characterized by loose opened fields of painterly surfaces accompanied by loosely drawn and measured lines and shapes, {{was influenced by}} both Joan Miró and by Henri Matisse. Robert Motherwell's Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 110 (1971) {{is the work of}} a pioneer of both Abstract Expressionism and Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting.</b> Robert Motherwell's Elegy to The Spanish Republic series embodies both tendencies, while Motherwell's Open Series of the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s places him firmly within the Color Field camp. In 1970 Motherwell said, Throughout my life, the 20th-century painter whom I've admired the most has been Matisse, alluding to several of his own series of paintings that reflect Matisse's influence, most notably his Open Series that come closest to classic Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although Color Field is {{associated}} with Clement Greenberg, Greenberg actually preferred {{to use the term}} Post-Painterly Abstraction. In 1964, Clement Greenberg curated an influential exhibition that traveled the country called Post-painterly abstraction. The exhibition expanded the definition of color <b>field</b> <b>painting.</b> Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting</b> clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from abstract expressionism. In 2007 curator Karen Wilkin curated an exhibition called Color As Field:American Painting 1950-1975 that traveled to several museums throughout the United States. The exhibition showcased several artists representing two generations of Color Field painters.|$|E

Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting</b> as related to but different from Action painting. The Color Field painters sought to rid their art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like Robert Motherwell, Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Adolph Gottlieb, Hans Hofmann, Helen Frankenthaler, Sam Francis, Mark Tobey, and especially Ad Reinhardt and Barnett Newman, whose masterpiece Vir heroicus sublimis is in the collection of MoMA, used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery, in the case of Rothko and Gottlieb sometimes using symbol and sign as replacement of imagery. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color <b>field</b> <b>painting</b> presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of modern art, artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s Richard Diebenkorn began his Ocean Park series; created {{during the final}} 25 years of his career and they are {{important}} examples of color <b>field</b> <b>painting.</b> The Ocean Park series exemplified by Ocean Park No.129, connects his earlier abstract expressionist works with Color <b>field</b> <b>painting.</b> During the early 1950s, Richard Diebenkorn was known as an abstract expressionist, and his gestural abstractions were close to the New York School in sensibility but firmly based in the San Francisco abstract expressionist sensibility; a place where Clyfford Still has a considerable influence on younger artists {{by virtue of his}} teaching at the San Francisco Art Institute.|$|E
25|$|The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the Leo Castelli Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the Park Place Gallery were {{important}} showcases for Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting,</b> shaped canvas painting and Lyrical Abstraction in New York City during the 1960s. There {{is a connection}} with post-painterly abstraction, which reacted against abstract expressionisms' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – {{as well as the}} solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting</b> and Minimal art were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.|$|E

25|$|Digital art, hard-edge painting, {{geometric}} abstraction, minimalism, lyrical abstraction, op art, abstract expressionism, color <b>field</b> <b>painting,</b> monochrome painting, assemblage, neo-Dada, shaped canvas painting, {{are a few}} continuing {{and current}} directions relating to abstraction {{at the beginning of}} the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|In {{abstract}} {{painting and}} sculpture during the 1950s and 1960s Geometric abstraction emerged as an important direction {{in the works of}} many sculptors and painters. In painting color <b>field</b> <b>painting,</b> minimalism, hard-edge painting and lyrical abstraction constituted radical new directions.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} distinction that made color <b>field</b> <b>painting</b> different from abstract expression was the paint handling. The most basic fundamental defining technique of painting is application {{of paint and}} the color field painters revolutionized the way paint could be effectively applied.|$|E

He deconstructs the social role of painting and the position of the viewer. The theme of his paintings is often media, especially film, which continues to shape his perception most today.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fields</b> {{continued}} <b>painting</b> {{on his own}} time, {{and began}} sending out samples of his work; Dragon magazine was among the clients those {{who were interested in}} his work. <b>Fields</b> <b>painted</b> his first cover for Dragon in 1988, for issue #142. He applied to TSR's art department soon after and was hired. [...] "I went from freelancing, completely on my own, to sitting in a room with the likes of Clyde Caldwell, Brom, Tony Szczudlo, Robh Ruppel, Dana Knutson, Randy Post, and Todd Lockwood. I just sort of stopped and thought, 'Wow, I've arrived.'" [...] Fields worked on scenes from worlds such as Forgotten Realms, and even Ravenloft, saying [...] "It was fun doing the Gothic horror stuff. In some cases, I think I took it further than other artists. I put a lot more blood in there." ...|$|R
25|$|Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting</b> {{sought to}} rid art of {{superfluous}} rhetoric. Artists like Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Adolph Gottlieb, Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Friedel Dzubas, and Frank Stella, and others often used greatly reduced formats, with drawing essentially simplified to repetitive and regulated systems, basic references to nature, {{and a highly}} articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated overt recognizable imagery in favor of abstraction. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color <b>field</b> <b>painting</b> presents abstraction {{as an end in}} itself. In pursuing this direction of modern art, these artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image often within series' of related types.|$|E
25|$|Jackson Pollock, Adolph Gottlieb, Hans Hofmann, Barnett Newman, Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Ad Reinhardt and Arshile Gorky (in {{his last}} works) {{were among the}} {{prominent}} abstract expressionist painters that Greenberg identified as being connected to Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting</b> in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Lyrical {{abstraction}} shares similarities {{with color}} <b>field</b> <b>painting</b> and abstract expressionism {{especially in the}} freewheeling usage of paint — texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color <b>field</b> <b>painting.</b> However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from abstract expressionism and action painting of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in lyrical abstraction {{there is a sense}} of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Frank Stella was a {{significant}} figure {{in the emergence of}} Minimalism, Post-Painterly Abstraction and Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting.</b> His shaped canvases of the 1960s like Harran II, 1967, revolutionized abstract painting. One of the most important characteristics of Stella's paintings is his use of repetition. His Black Pin Stripe paintings of 1959 startled and shocked an art world that was unused to seeing monochromatic and repetitive images, painted flat, with almost no inflexion. During the early 1960s Stella made several series' of notched Aluminum Paintings and shaped Copper Paintings before making multi-colored and asymmetrical shaped canvases of the late 1960s. Frank Stella's approach and relationship to Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting</b> was not permanent or central to his creative output; as his work became more and more three-dimensional after 1980.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting</b> {{initially}} {{referred to}} {{a particular type of}} abstract expressionism, especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Robert Motherwell and Adolph Gottlieb. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting</b> as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck {{in the face of an}} expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early to mid-1960s, Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting</b> came to refer to the styles of artists like Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, and Helen Frankenthaler, whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like Larry Zox, and Frank Stella – all moving in a new direction. Artists like Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Helen Frankenthaler, Larry Zox, and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. In Mountains and Sea, from 1952, (see above) a seminal work of Colorfield painting by Helen Frankenthaler the artist used the stain technique for the first time.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1960s Larry Poons whose earlier Dot {{paintings}} {{were associated with}} Op Art began to produce looser and more free formed paintings that were referred to as his Lozenge Ellipse paintings of 1967-1968. Along with John Hoyland, Walter Darby Bannard, Larry Zox, Ronald Davis, Ronnie Landfield, John Seery, Pat Lipsky, Dan Christensen and several other young painters a new movement that related to Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting</b> began to form; eventually called Lyrical Abstraction. The late 1960s saw painters turning to surface inflection, deep space depiction, and painterly touch and paint handling merging with the language of color. Among {{a new generation of}} abstract painters who emerged combining color <b>field</b> <b>painting</b> with expressionism the older generation also began infusing new elements of complex space and surface into their works. By the 1970s Poons created thick-skinned, cracked and heavy paintings referred to as Elephant Skin paintings; while Christensen sprayed loops, colored webs of lines and calligraphy, across multi-colored fields of delicate grounds; Ronnie Landfield's stained band paintings are reflections of both Chinese landscape painting and the Color Field idiom and John Seery stained painting as exemplified by East, 1973, from the National Gallery of Australia. Poons, Christensen, Davis, Landfield, Seery, Lipsky, Zox and several others created paintings that bridge Color <b>Field</b> <b>painting</b> with Lyrical Abstraction and underscore a re-emphasis on landscape, gesture and touch.|$|E
