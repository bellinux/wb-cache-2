5|$|Later in 2010, Trenyce {{joined the}} Michael Jackson tribute concert revue Thriller – Live {{as the leading}} female vocalist during a European tour. She reprised her role when the show played at the Lyric Theatre in London's West End. She starred in the concert for three years, from 2010 until 2013, {{performing}} material from different periods in Jackson's career. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Trenyce said that the audience was initially hesitant to hear a woman interpret Jackson's music. Theatreworld's Geoff Billingsley praised Trenyce's performance, writing that <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> very similar to Jackson's and describing her as an improvement over the previous female lead Cleo Higgins.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{standing}} only [...] tall in heels, {{she often}} caught {{the gaze of}} men in the street, being attractive and full-figured. She was always well-dressed and even went to bed with make-up on so as to [...] "look beautiful when she woke up". [...] A nephew later said that she could [...] "make a joke out of nothing", and could have [...] "walked out of a burning house with a smile and a joke". She frequented Liverpool's dance halls and clubs where she was often asked to dance in jitterbug competitions with dockers, soldiers, sailors, and waiters. It was remarked that she could be as humorous as any man and would sing the popular songs of the day at any time of day or night. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> similar to Vera Lynn's, whilst Lennon specialised in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. [...] She played the ukulele, the piano accordion, and the banjo (as did Lennon), although neither pursued music professionally. They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and talking of what they would do in the future: opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{described}} the recording process as challenging {{because she was}} provided with little visual aid, explaining, [...] "All I had to work off were a few sketches ... {{but it was also}} fun because it allows you to go into the depths of your imagination." [...] She also revealed that creating Rapunzel's voice was simply a process of [...] "let go". Moore was often required to re-record a single line a total of four times before the directors finally heard a version with which they were satisfied. After watching the completed film for the first time, Moore was disappointed with her own performance because she felt that <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> [...] "shrill". According to composer Alan Menken, Moore's musical background made her [...] "a delight to work with". Moore found the practice of performing in character challenging in comparison to recording her own original music, explaining, [...] "I can't just be like Mandy and sing something the way that I want to necessarily, because you know, you sort of have to stick to certain guidelines." [...] She found recording [...] "When Will My Life Begin" [...] particularly difficult due to the speed at which she had to say certain words, and cites both Menken and discovering Rapunzel herself as a character with guiding her through the process.|$|E

6000|$|She {{smiled back}} at him, a pale, timid smile, like a gleam of {{sunshine}} from a wintry sky. [...] "That matters nothing," [...] she assured him, and strove to make <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> brave.|$|R
50|$|Maybeth Tillerman: Now 14 years old, Maybeth {{resembles the}} Tillerman's mother, Liza, in looks and personality. She is {{described}} by James as pretty, strong looking, with a good figure. She has a great talent for music and singing; even <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> like <b>her</b> mother's.|$|R
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "You and I" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major. During the song Gaga's voice spans from the notes of E3 to C5. The song begins with an A–G–A chord progression, which changes to A–Bm/A–D/A–Bm during the chorus, {{and back to the}} former chords afterwards. The opening lyrics—"It's {{been a long time since}} I came around/ It's been a long time, but I'm back in town/ And this time, I'm not leaving without you"—describe a whiskey-breathed lover for whom she is pining. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described it as the [...] "tune eschewed most of her dance flavor, right down to a rollicking barrel-house piano solo." [...] <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> like growling during the main verses, where she sings the lines: [...] "He said, 'Sit back down where you belong, in the corner of my bar with your high heels on, Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time..." [...] Noting the differences between live performances of the song and the studio version, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed that the piano parts were replaced mostly by [...] "fizzing synths, a stomping beat sampled from [...] "We Will Rock You", thundering electric guitars and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian described the song as an [...] "umlaut-toting digital country power ballad" [...] with two Bruce Springsteen references: [...] "born to run" [...] and Nebraska.|$|E
500|$|After {{the second}} verse and chorus, the song {{features}} a break down influenced by house music. Gaga chants {{the lines in}} the same way she does in the middle of [...] "Born This Way". Then she sings, [...] "I wanna love you/ But something's pulling me away from you/ Jesus is my virtue, Judas is the demon I cling to, I cling to." [...] In this section, Gaga's vocals drew comparison to that of Rihanna's by Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone. He also added that <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> less dark and dramatic and was full of [...] "bubbly sweetness". Popjustice wrote that the breakdown sounded like tribal-techno, and the whole song was [...] "a turbo-charged electrogothic wrongness anthem". Dan Martin from NME wrote that the breakdown was in the dubstep genre with the chorus being [...] "pure-pop". There were some similarities and influences of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] in the song, which Gaga said was deliberate. She explained that while sometimes it is important for her to push herself in new directions, she did want her characteristic sound to be imbibed in her records. [...] "I wanted [...] to be an evolution from where I’ve been before {{but in terms of the}} formula I wanted there to be something about 'Judas' that reminded people of what I’ve done in the past," [...] she added. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of C minor with a tempo of 131 beats per minute. Gaga's voice ranges from the tonal nodes of B3 to E5 and the song follows a basic sequence of A–Fm7–Cm–B–Cm as its chord progression.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{scheduling}} {{conflicts with}} other projects (Moore {{had to travel}} to different places such as London or New York, and Levi could only record on weekends for five hours once every six weeks), they did not necessarily record dialogue {{in the same order}} as in the final film. [...] ", maybe that sequence or scene had been recorded by Mandy (Moore) already, maybe it hadn't. We'd end up doing the same scene five times, depending," [...] Levi said. After watching the finished film, Moore was disappointed because she felt that <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> [...] "shrill", while Levi thought that his performance sounded [...] "incredibly nasally".|$|E
60|$|She stopped breathlessly, with a {{break in}} <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> that <b>sounded</b> just short of a sob.|$|R
60|$|At the word, with a small, sudden motion, {{she clung}} near to me. I raised {{her face to}} mine, I kissed it, and she bowed her brow upon my bosom, {{clasping}} me tight. I sat in a mere whirl like a man drunken. Then I heard <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> very small and muffled in my clothes.|$|R
5000|$|On May 17, 2012, Jones {{attended}} {{an interview with}} radio show, The Breakfast Club. When asked {{about whether or not}} she had spoken to Brown at all in recent years, Jones replied, [...] "I don't even know her. And when I say that; I don't know who she is to these days. I wouldn't even know what <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> like." ...|$|R
2500|$|Unfortunately, Voigt {{caught the}} flu {{when she was}} to perform, yet went on with the show; the {{photograph}} caption for the New York Times review was, [...] "Deborah Voigt, even with the flu, led a Collegiate Chorale concert performance on Tuesday." [...] The reviewer wrote, [...] "she did some impressive work, singing with power, gleaming sound and sensitive phrasing, though she clearly struggled. Often <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> congested and her top range tight ... her voice nearly gave out, {{and she had to}} drop down an octave to get though a phrase." [...] The review reserved judgment but noted that some fans were [...] "disappointed." [...] Another reviewer wrote, [...] "One would like very much to hear Voigt undertake this dramatic role again when she is in peak form." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{playing a}} piano riff and singing the melody for Jimmy Jam, they {{recorded}} a rough vocal track. Jam stated, [...] "She sang me the melody, {{and then asked}} [...] "well, {{what do you think}} it needs?" [...] I said, Nothing. Go write some lyrics, it's fine," [...] adding, [...] "She had a bunch of different melodies, so we picked the two melodies that worked best." [...] Jam and Lewis chose to forego its production, deciding another producer should execute the song: [...] "We stay away from things we can't do. It's not like, 'We've got to do this, and it's got to be our way.' We're going for the best way." [...] Jam contacted Jellybean Johnson to develop the song with Jackson and help her produce it. Johnson recalled, [...] "She first played the groove for me on piano... I thought it would be cool if I could make Janet sound like a heavy metal queen. I knew the rest of them thought I was out of my mind, but I got a friend to play the guitars. I put toms and cymbals on it. Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there." [...] In addition to Johnson, guitarist Dave Barry was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] from Jackson's prior album. Barry stated, [...] "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas." [...] Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, [...] "One night I told her I wanted her to sound like a rock and roll queen on it–she usually uses one of her other voices [...]. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes." [...] Jam added, [...] "I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [...] with kind of an edge on it; she [...] didn't like the way <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded,</b> but for Black Cat, that was exactly what was needed." ...|$|E
60|$|Sally spoke again. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> {{small and}} far off, an odd {{flatness}} in it.|$|E
60|$|He leaned {{a little}} closer towards <b>her.</b> His <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> to <b>her</b> very deep and firm. It {{was the voice of}} a man immensely in earnest.|$|R
50|$|Twinkle-Twinkle is a vain fairy who is {{the best}} singing superstar in Jubilee Park. She does sing her songs. She sings, having a tape play the voice she once had. How she lost <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> is unknown. In one of the episodes, she has been tricked by Sapphire whose plan was to make <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> terrible, (Opal helped, since it would benefit Pearlie, who's been bossed around by Twinkle-Twinkle {{throughout}} the episode). It was the only plan that ever worked for Sapphire. Pearlie unknowingly helps by pulling the plug on Twinkle-Twinkle's tape player.|$|R
6000|$|... "Render thee a service," [...] she said, and <b>her</b> low <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> quite cooing and gentle, [...] "I would thank God on {{my knees}} if I could render thee a service. Didst thou not save my life...." ...|$|R
60|$|Then at last did she speak. But <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> toneless and dull, as of one {{who speaks}} in a dream.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I let him," [...] she murmured, {{catching}} his intonation, so that <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> unconscious, sounded far off and slavish, like an echo.|$|E
60|$|Nora Miall {{leaned over}} {{from her chair}} and laid her hand on Tallente's arm. After Miller's raucous tones, <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> almost like music.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's splendid!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} {{and he could}} not doubt the {{approval}} in <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> It <b>sounded</b> as if she meant to applaud him as well as show her satisfaction with the consequences of his exploit.|$|R
60|$|In an instant, {{while she}} stood before me repeating these words, she fell {{down on the}} floor. I {{had no need to}} cry out; <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> had <b>sounded</b> through the house and been heard in the street.|$|R

5000|$|More recently, Webb invited Linda Ronstadt to {{join him}} in a duet version for his 2010 album Just Across the River. Ronstadt had just {{announced}} her retirement from singing when Webb sent her an email describing his new CD of duets. Webb asked if she would sing [...] "All I Know" [...] with him, with just a guitar backup. Ronstadt called him and said, [...] "Damn it, you've gotten me interested in that song." [...] Webb later recalled, [...] "There was a poignancy to that moment ... because I didn’t know if she'd ever sing again. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> elegantly beautiful on 'All I Know' ... I loved the meticulous way she covered my voice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I don't see how I {{can forgive}} myself for making you come," [...] said Ellen, but <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> did not <b>sound</b> {{as if she}} were very unhappy.|$|R

60|$|It was Mrs. Paston Benedek {{who opened}} it. She {{stared at the}} first sheet for a moment with eyes which were almost dilated. Then she looked around. <b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> unnatural.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] {{answered}} Jess with {{a little}} laugh, and <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> cold and strange in her own ears. [...] "Has he been following Frank Muller's example, and proposing to you too?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> {{as though}} {{something}} had offended her. Rising from {{inspection of the}} horse's leg, Shelton saw Antonia and Toddles standing by. They had come through a wicketgate leading from the fields.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary!" [...] said he, and as {{he spoke}} {{he put his hand}} on the donkey's neck, and looked tenderly into her face.

6000|$|... “Don’t {{be so sure}} of that,” she said, with a {{flash of}} mischief, which made <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>sound</b> more melancholy than before. “I am not so sure myself,” she {{continued}} with a curious, vanishing, intonation of despair. “I don’t know the truth about myself because I never {{had an opportunity to}} compare myself to anything in the world. I have been offered mock adulation, treated with mock reserve or with mock devotion, I have been fawned upon with an appalling earnestness of purpose, I can tell you; but these later honours, my dear, came to me {{in the shape of a}} very loyal and very scrupulous gentleman.
