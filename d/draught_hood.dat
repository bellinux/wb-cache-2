For the appropriate adjustment of the gas boiler to the conditions of the building, computer-generated calculation results have to be obtained which can help the positioning of the appliance and the air supply outlets in the room in which the appliance is installed. Chimneys of natural draught are very sensitive to the changes in the amount of combustion air due to inside or outside ambient phenomena or forced effects. For the purposes of modelling, a numerical simulation (CFD method) can be used. The aim of numeric modelling is to investigate velocity and temperature conditions around the flue gas outlet and in the room and, subsequently, to define design approaches and the requirements for different conditions. The conclusion of our investigations is that the air supply of the room can be accomplished with correctly sized air outlets and inlet elements...|$|E
