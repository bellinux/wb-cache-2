5|$|The slight {{radioactivity}} of rubidium {{was discovered}} in 1908, {{but that was before}} the theory of isotopes was established in 1910, and the low level of activity (half-life greater than 1010years) made interpretation complicated.

40|$|A {{main purpose}} of this paper is to trace the roots of modern discussions about animal ethics. First, I sort out and survey major discussions about modern animal ethics. Next, I review the discussions about moral {{considerations}} for animals in eighteenth-century England which are probably thought of as templates of modern discussions about animal ethics. Additionally, I track back <b>discussions</b> <b>in</b> the seventeenth century, as a germ of <b>discussions</b> <b>in</b> eighteenth- century England, in the area of animal experiments, such as vivisection. Lastly, I speculate why these <b>discussions</b> <b>in</b> the seventeenth century spread out explosively in the following centuries in England...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the early}} workers in Alberta did not {{recognize}} it at the time, they were finding the remains of juvenile Lambeosaurus as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested duckbills were interpreted as adults of a distinct lineage of hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae. The first such animal to be named was Trachodon altidens, a left upper jaw (GSC 1092) from the Dinosaur Park Formation described by Lawrence Lambe in 1902. In the same volume, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested T. altidens could belong to a new genus, which he labelled Didanodon without further <b>discussion.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, Lund and Gates stated that Didanodon altidens was a nomen nudum, without further discussion.|$|E
5|$|As {{the three}} {{suspects}} {{had been killed}} while preparing an act of terrorism, the court rejected the families' claims for damages, {{as well as their}} claim for expenses incurred at the inquest. The court did order the British government to pay the applicants' costs incurred during the proceedings in Strasbourg. The government initially suggested it would not pay, and there was <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> parliament of the UK withdrawing from the ECHR. It paid the costs on 24 December 1995, within days of the three-month deadline which had been set by the court.|$|E
5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, Polaris {{had reached}} her furthest north of 82°29'N. Tension flared {{again as the}} three leading {{officers}} could not agree on whether to proceed further or not. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance {{they would have to}} travel to the Pole by dogsled. Budington did not want to further risk the ship, and walked out on the <b>discussion.</b> <b>In</b> the end, they sailed into Thank God Harbor (now called Hall Bay) on Sept. 10, 1871, and anchored for the winter on the shore of northern Greenland.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1997 general election, polls {{suggested}} that Eurosceptic sentiment was running high in the UK, and the question of the country's ongoing membership of the EU was a topic of regular <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> the media. Much of this press coverage took a negative stance toward the EU, mainstream newspapers like the Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Times promoting Eurosceptic sentiment. Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the looming possibility that the country would adopt the euro currency.|$|E
5|$|Chikhachov {{instructed}} Andrey Toropov of the Nikolaev Shipyard {{to draft}} two proposals, one armed with 10-inch {{and the other}} with 12-inch guns. Toropov estimated that the ship should have displaced at least 8,880 tons. Chikhachov admitted the fact and presented the two options to the NTC. The admiral himself and the active fleet commanders voted for the 12-inch caliber, which had already become a worldwide battleship standard, but the NTC strongly advised against it. The Navy brass spent April and May 1893 in lengthy debates. They agreed to increase displacement to 8,880 tons and were leaning toward accepting 12-inch guns when General Admiral Grand Duke Alexey resolved the <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> favor of the smaller caliber.|$|E

5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Sexual Preference {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} the historian Paul Robinson in Psychology Today and Richard P. Halgin in Library Journal, a negative review from the sociologist John Gagnon in The New York Times, a notice in Newsweek, and a <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> The Chronicle of Higher Education, {{which focused on}} the controversy surrounding the book. The following year, it received a negative review from Michael Ignatieff in the London Review of Books. Reviewers faulted the work on grounds such as the questionable representativeness of its sample of homosexuals, though those who reviewed it positively praised it for reasons including the sophistication of its path analysis.|$|E

On 17 March 1990, the Ministry of Community Development confirmed in Parliament that the new National Library would be sited at the former Raffles Girls' School site in Queen Street.
