In many cases, the incorporation of risk will change the optimal decisions in different ways.

Water quantity is the timing and total yield of water from a watershed, and is measured by total yield and peak flow over a specified period of time. Water quality is the suitability of water for drinking, recreational uses, and as habitat for aquatic organisms and other wildlife (Neary 2002).

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the effects of irrigation frequency on flower production and quality of rose plants can help to propose optimal irrigation scheduling. For this purpose, experiments were conducted on a soilless rose crop (Rosa hybrida, cv. First Red), with a closed hydroponic system, in a greenhouse located near Volos, on the continental area of eastern Greece. The plants were grown following the bending technique, on rockwool slabs. Irrigation scheduling was based on crop transpiration, and irrigation was performed whenever accumulative solar radiation outside the greenhouse reached 1600 kJ m - 2 [high irrigation frequency (HIF) ] and 3200 kJ m- 2 (low irrigation frequency). The amount of water applied was 0 · 2 and 0 · 4 mm for high and low irrigation frequencies, respectively. Accordingly, the total water applied was equal for both cases. In order to study the effects of irrigation frequency on rose crop, measurements of fresh and dry weight of the cut flower shoots, number of harvested flowers and flowering stem's length, as well as measurements of microclimate variables were carried out. The total period of measurements ended 100 days after the last severe shoot bending (which was performed 60 days after planting). The results showed that irrigation frequency influenced cut flower fresh and dry weight, since the total fresh and dry weight of cut flower shoots measured {{at the end of the}} experimental period was about 33 % higher in the HIF treatment. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between the mean fresh or dry weight of cut flower shoots of the two treatments. As far as the number of shoots <b>harvested</b> is <b>concerned,</b> the results showed that the higher the irrigation frequency, the higher the production, as the total number of cut flowers measured at the end of the experimental period was 20 · 7 and 16 · 2 per greenhouse m - 2 for high and low irrigation frequencies, respectively, namely about 28 % higher in the HIF. Furthermore, the results showed that the length of rose flowering shoots was not affected by the irrigation frequency. In conclusion, it seems that the higher irrigation frequency improved the biomass production but did not affect the quality of harvested flowers. © 2005 Silsoe Research Institute.

Two pressing questions for forestry and conservation biology are whether periodic logging in forest ecosystems significantly changes biodiversity and whether the changes can be mitigated through appropriate harvest methods. Such questions of timber resource management, however, are rarely applied to nonpest insect species, particularly in temperate forest systems. We studied the effects of timber harvest on species richness, abundance, and community composition of forest Lepidoptera (moths). Moths were sampled in 16 forest stands occurring in two watersheds (managed and wilderness) in southeastern Ohio during summer 2000. Stands were chosen from one of four management categories: clear-cut, selectively logged, unlogged, and wilderness. Specifically, we tested the following predictions: (1) shifts in moth community composition would be affected by postharvest changes in stand structure and floristic composition, (2) variation in species richness would be determined by the magnitude of the logging disturbance, and (3) unlogged stands within managed landscapes would contain different species assemblages compared to wilderness stands. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed significant compositional differences among moth communities sampled from forest stands differing in harvest regime. Variation among moth communities was mainly attributable to postharvest changes in stand floristic composition rather than stand structure. Postdisturbance shifts in moth community composition were related to the magnitude of displacement of a given forest stand to earlier successional stages. We also found that both species richness of the overall moth community and several feeding guilds were significantly lower in clear-cut stands, but species richness did not differ between selectively logged and unlogged stands. Thus, selective logging appears to be a better strategy for timber <b>harvest</b> when <b>concern</b> is for maintaining species richness of Lepidoptera within stands. Finally, although no differences were detected in overall species richness or abundance of moths sampled from stands in managed or wilderness watersheds, the CCA suggested that the surrounding landscape influenced the variation in community composition within and among forest stands. Therefore, we suggest that the long-term maintenance of lepidopteran species diversity and community composition within temperate deciduous forests managed for timber may ultimately depend on successful regeneration of harvested stands to precut floristic composition as well as the preservation of larger areas of unlogged forests.

The lowest figure is for demolition wood substituting oil in large combustion facilities, the highest for fuel wood used in dwellings to substitute electricity produced by coal-based power plants. Avoided GHG emissions per m 3 wood used for energy were from 0. 210 to 0. 640 tonne CO 2 -equivalents. Related to GWh energy produced, avoided GHG emissions were from 250 to 360 tonne CO 2 -equivalents. Avoided GHG emissions per tonne CO 2 in the wood are 0. 28 – 0. 70 tonne CO 2 -equivalents. The most important factors were technology used for combustion, which energy that is substituted, densities, and heating values. Inputs <b>concerning</b> <b>harvest,</b> transport, and production of the wood energy are not important. Overall, taking the uncertainties into account there is not much difference in avoided GHG emissions for the different kinds of wood energy...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{harvest of}} algae in Eastern Canada {{has been active}} for over 50 years. Benthic ecology studies by the 1950 ’s had {{established}} {{the value of the}} algal thallus and algal populations as habitats for many species of animals. However, for the first 35 years of marine plant <b>harvests</b> the primary <b>concern</b> of resource scientists was the sustainability of the resource. The incidental removal (bycatch) of non-targeted species was recognized by fisheries managers in the Chondrus crispus Stackhouse (Irish Moss) harvest but bycatch limits were {{not a part of the}} management plans. The implications of removing algal biomass and the potential of changing the structure of the algal habitat were only recently realized and integrated in resource management plans. A managed Ascophyllum nodosum L. Le Jolis harvest removes 17 % of the harvestable standing crop and less than 7. 5 % of the total biomass. In terms of the total productivity of attached macrophytes in the Bay of Fundy ecosystem this is less than 1 % removals. In general the degree of complexity of an algal thallus is directly related to invertebrate abundance on a per unit biomass basis Ascophyllum nodosum harvests can change the relative spatial distribution of the biomass and the complexity of the plant structure. However harvesting is not homogeneous and hence, it increased the patchiness in the habitat. At an exploitation rate of 17 % it was not possible to detect changes in the structure of A. nodosum beds at a landscape scale. Precautionary management measures incorporated in the management plan for this harvest has made it a model in coastal zone management...|$|R
40|$|Background {{and aims}} Eucalyptus {{plantations}} cover 20 million hectares on highly weathered soils. Large amounts of nitrogen (N) exported during <b>harvesting</b> lead to <b>concerns</b> about their sustainability. Our {{goal was to}} assess the potential of introducing A. mangium trees in highly productive Eucalyptus plantations to enhance soil organic matter stocks and N availability. Methods A randomized block design was set up in a Brazilian Ferralsol soil to assess the effects of mono-specific Eucalyptus grandis (100 E) and Acacia mangium (100 A) stands and mixed plantations (50 A: 50 E) on soil organic matter stocks and net N mineralization. Results A 6 -year rotation of mono-specific A. mangium plantations led to carbon (C) and N stocks in the forest floor that were 44 % lower and 86 % higher than in pure E. grandis stands, respectively. Carbon and N stocks were not significantly different between the three treatments in the 0 - 15 cm soil layer. Field incubations conducted every 4 weeks for the two last years of the rotation estimated net soil N mineralization in 100 A and 100 E at 124 and 64 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1), respectively. Nitrogen inputs to soil with litterfall were of the same order as net N mineralization. Conclusions Acacia mangium trees largely increased the turnover rate of N in the topsoil. Introducing A. mangium trees might improve mineral N availability in soils where commercial Eucalyptus plantations have been managed for a long time.
