5000|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>Edge's</b> {{response}} to this in 2009 was that the data that flash trading used reduced market impact, increased average size of executed orders, reduced trading latency, and provided additional liquidity. <b>Direct</b> <b>Edge</b> also allowed all of its subscribers {{to determine whether they}} want their orders to participate in flash trading or not so brokers have the option to opt out of flash orders on behalf of their clients if they choose to. Because market participants can choose to utilize it for additional liquidity or not participate in it at all <b>Direct</b> <b>Edge</b> believes the controversy was overstated stating: [...] "Misconceptions respecting flash technology have, to date, stirred a passionate but ill informed debate."
