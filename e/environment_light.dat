(Left) Aug-mented Reality based interior shopping application. (Middle, Right) Physical gaming using depth cameras. Photorealistic Augmented Reality (AR) requires {{knowledge of the}} scene geometry and <b>environment</b> <b>lighting</b> to compute photomet-ric registration. Recent work has introduced probeless photometric registration, where <b>environment</b> <b>lighting</b> is estimated directly from observations of reflections in the scene rather than through an inva-sive probe such as a reflective ball. However, computing the dense radiance transfer of a dynamically changing scene is computation-ally challenging. In this work, we present an improved radiance transfer sampling approach, which combines adaptive sampling in image and visibility space with robust caching of radiance trans-fer to yield real time framerates for photorealistic AR scenes with dynamically changing scene geometry and <b>environment</b> <b>lighting...</b>|$|R

Real-time rendering of scenes illuminated by environmental lighting, is beneficial in many applications such as lighting/material design, animation, and games. For photorealistic rendering under environmental lighting, the triple product of the environmental lighting, the BRDF, and the visibility function is integrated. Integrating the triple product is computationally expensive and this prevents from real-time rendering under all-frequency <b>environment</b> <b>lighting.</b> To address this, we propose an efficient rendering method for scenes illuminated by all-frequency environmental lighting.

The radiance calculation at each shading point of the cloth fabrics is simplified to a linear combination of triple product integrals of two circular Gaussians and the visibility function, multiplied by precomputed spherical Gaussian convolutions of the weighting function. We propose an efficient calculation method of the triple product of two circular Gaussians and the visibility function by using the gradient of signed distance function to the visibility boundary where the binary visibility changes in the angular domain of the hemisphere. Our GPU implementation enables interactive rendering of static cloth fabrics with dynamic viewpoints and lighting.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the dependence of}} photosynthetic capacity on leaf nitrogen content and <b>light</b> <b>environment</b> in leaf microsites of six rainforest species growing naturally in understory and clearing habitats. All nine descriptors of the <b>light</b> <b>environment</b> in leaf microsites, encompassing canopy openness, potential exposure to sunflecks, and photosynthetically active photon flux density (PFD) integrated over one day, three months, and an entire year, were highly correlated with each other. Among species, Amax was strongly dependent on leaf nitrogen and on all descriptors of the <b>light</b> <b>environment</b> in the leaf microsite. Leaf nitrogen was also dependent on all descriptors of the <b>light</b> <b>environment.</b> Simple regressions of Amax on all measures of the <b>light</b> <b>environment</b> were significant for plants in the clearing, but not for plants growing in the understory. Regressions of leaf nitrogen {{on at least one}} descriptor of the <b>light</b> <b>environment</b> were significant for both clearing and understory plants. Over all species, and for the clearing plants alone, leaf nitrogen and a single descriptor of the <b>light</b> <b>environment</b> together explained significantly more variance in Amax than either variable alone. Multiple regressions using leaf nitrogen and all nine descriptors of the <b>light</b> <b>environment</b> did not explain a significantly greater amount of variance in photosynthetic capacity than multiple regressions using leaf nitrogen and a single light descriptor. In most cases, Amax was predicted better by the most general descriptors of the <b>light</b> <b>environment,</b> such as canopy openness and long-term photon flux density, and less accurately by shorter-term sensor measurements or descriptors based on the duration of potential sunfleck exposure.

5000|$|Before the mid-1980s, it was {{believed}} that only eukaryotes had circadian systems. The conclusion that only eukaryotes have circadian oscillators seemed reasonable, because it was assumed that an endogenous timekeeper with a period close to 24 hours would not be useful to prokaryotic organisms that often divide more rapidly than once every 24 hours. The assumption might be stated as, [...] "why have a timer for a cycle that is longer than your lifetime?" [...] While intuitive, the conclusion was flawed. It was {{based on the assumption that}} a bacterial cell is equivalent to a sexually reproducing multicellular organism. However, a bacterial culture is more like a mass of protoplasm that grows larger and larger and incidentally subdivides. From this perspective, it is reasonable that a 24-hour temporal program could be adaptive to a rapidly dividing protoplasm if the fitness of that protoplasm changes as a function of daily alterations in the <b>environment</b> (<b>light</b> intensity, temperature, etc.).|$|E

40|$|Inspired by the {{mechanism}} of imaging and adaptation to luminosity in insect compound eyes (ICE), we propose an ICE-based adaptive reconstruction method (ARM-ICE), which can adjust the sampling vision field of image according to the <b>environment</b> <b>light</b> intensity.

However, standard SAR systems in dark room settings may suffer from insufficient light radiance causing bright colors to exhibit unexpected color shifts, resulting in a misleading visualization. We introduce a SAR framework which focuses on minimally altering the appearance of arbitrarily shaped and colored objects to exploit the presence of environment/room light as an additional light source to achieve compliancy for bright colors.

The key idea and main contribution of the paper is therefore to show that the registration should also be performed in the <b>lighting</b> <b>environment</b> space, instead of in the image space only. This lets us recover very accurate pose estimates because the specularities are very sensitive to pose changes. An interesting side result is an accurate estimate of the <b>lighting</b> <b>environment.</b> Furthermore, since the mapping from <b>lighting</b> <b>environment</b> to specularities has no analytical expression for objects represented as 3 D meshes, and is not 1 -to- 1, registering <b>lighting</b> <b>environments</b> is far from trivial.
