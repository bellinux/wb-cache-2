6000|$|My Lords, at {{the treaty}} of Chunar, as it is called, Mr. Hastings (for he always artfully feels his way as he proceeds) first says, that the Nabob shall be {{permitted}} to do this act, if he pleases. He does not assume the government. He does not compel the Nabob to do anything. He does not force upon him this abandoned and wicked confiscation of {{the property of the}} whole nobility of a great country. All that he says is this,--"The Nabob may be permitted to resume these jaghires." [...] Why permitted? If the act had been legal, proper, and justifiable, he did not want our permission; he was a sovereign in his own dominions. But Mr. Hastings recollected that some of these jaghires (as they are called, and on which I shall say a very few words to your Lordships) were <b>guarantied</b> by the Company. The jaghires of his own house, of his mother and grandmother, were <b>guarantied</b> by us. I must inform your Lordships, that, upon some of our other exactions at an earlier period, the Nabob had endeavored to levy a forced loan upon the jaghiredars. This forced loan was made and submitted to by those people upon a direct assurance of their rights in the jaghires, which right was <b>guarantied</b> by the British Resident, not only to the Begums, and to the whole family of the Nabob, but also to all the other objects of the tax.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBesides of {{its high}} efficiency, in {{particular}} its scalability, geographic greedy routing is of a memoryless nature (i. e., nodes do not maintain any routing tables) which makes it well suitable for large-scale sensor networks with limited resources. Nevertheless, the occurrence of local minimum phenomenon, especially in networks with many holes, limits considerably the applicability of such routing protocol. The local minimum situations occur when the packet could not be delivered by the current node based only on distance to the destination. This problem has been tackled in previous research works to guarantee packets delivery by routing around {{the boundaries of the}} hole but at an excessive consumption of control overheads.
