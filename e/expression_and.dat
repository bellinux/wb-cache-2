40|$|AbstractAlgebraic <b>expressions</b> <b>and</b> linear {{equations}} are a {{vital part}} of the secondary school mathematics. A substantial amount of research has shown that students have some difficulties recognizing the structure of both of these concepts. In this study, it is analyzing the studentsâ€™ understanding of the differences and similarities between algebraic <b>expressions</b> <b>and</b> linear equations. For this purpose, six eighth grade students were interviewed and observed as they worked with various mathematical tasks relating to algebraic <b>expressions</b> <b>and</b> linear equations. The data collected in this study showed that these students simplified algebraic <b>expressions</b> <b>and</b> solved linear equations with one unknown, arriving at the correct result. But, they still had difficulties indicating a relation between algebraic <b>expressions</b> <b>and</b> linear equations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviewed}} the relationship existing between {{the recognition of}} emotional <b>expressions</b> <b>and</b> identities in faces. First, we {{reviewed the}} studies which suggested that the recognition of <b>expressions</b> <b>and</b> identities was mediated through independent processes. Although this hypothesis of independence was supported in several areas of research, recent studies suggested that two of these processes were not completely independent. Therefore, we reviewed the studies which supported {{the idea that there}} was an interaction of the processing of <b>expressions</b> <b>and</b> identities. Finally, we argued that future studies should focus on the individual differences of the interaction of <b>expressions</b> <b>and</b> identities using a selective attention paradigm to contribute to the issues of social communication...|$|R

People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders.

5|$|While not {{uncommon}} in predominantly Catholic cultures, Christian metal is rooted in evangelical Protestantism, beginning {{as a means of}} evangelism among the non-Christian metal scene. Over the years the focus changed because of the increased secularization of Christianity in the West during the 1990s. Moberg (2008) notes that the current scene seems to have very little interest in evangelism, especially in Northern Europe. Instead, it is argued that the current Christian metal music scene ultimately provides its core members with important resources for the shaping of an alternative and complementary form of religious <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> practice and an alternative Christian identity. Thus, Moberg states that Christian metal serves four main purposes: an alternative form of religious <b>expression</b> <b>and</b> identity; as a legitimate form of religious expression; as an effective means of evangelism and fighting and standing up for the Christian faith; as a positive alternative to non-Christian metal.|$|E
