25|$|If the decedent dies {{without a}} will, known as <b>intestacy,</b> the estate is {{distributed}} {{according to the}} laws of the state where the decedent resided.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the rules}} for {{distribution}} of estates without a will (the <b>Intestacy</b> Rules), where a child under 18 would inherit or a life interest would arise, the Court or District Probate Registry would normally appoint {{a minimum of two}} administrators. On some estates, even under an intestate, it is not clear who are the next-of-kin, and probate research may be required to find the entitled beneficiaries.|$|E

40|$|On {{the death}} of a landowner, members of his family may become {{entitled}} to the land as co-owners under his will or the rules governing <b>intestacies.</b> Many years may pass without anyone taking the steps necessary to administer the estate while one or only some of his successors enjoy possession of the land with or without the tacit approval of the others. The operation of the doctrine of adverse possession in this context gives rise to a number of doctrinal complications and Irish and English law on this issue has become polarised; while the occupying family member may rely on the doctrine of adverse possession in Ireland, in England and Wales he is precluded from doing so...|$|R

Next, he pays any debts and taxes, including estate tax in the United States, if the estate is taxable at the federal or state level. Finally, he distributes the remaining property to the beneficiaries, either as instructed in the will, or under the <b>intestacy</b> laws of the state.|$|E
25|$|Under his reign, Cnut brought {{together}} the English and Danish kingdoms, {{and the people}} saw a golden age of dominance across Scandinavia, as well as within the British Isles. His campaigns abroad meant the tables of Viking supremacy were stacked in favour of the English, turning the prows of the longships towards Scandinavia. He reinstated the Laws of King Edgar {{to allow for the}} constitution of a Danelaw, and for the activity of Scandinavians at large. He also reinstituted the extant laws with a series of proclamations to assuage common grievances brought to his attention, including: On Inheritance in case of <b>Intestacy,</b> and On Heriots and Reliefs. He also strengthened the currency, initiating a series of coins of equal weight to those being used in Denmark and other parts of Scandinavia.|$|E
2500|$|In {{international}} terms {{family law}} is relatively underdeveloped in the British Virgin Islands. [...] Levels of maintenance payments are fixed by {{out of date}} statutory provisions which mean that levels of support after divorce or separation are derisorily low.

2500|$|While the Bahá'í teachings {{assert the}} full spiritual and social {{equality}} {{of women to}} men, there are some aspects of gender distinctiveness or gender differentiation in certain areas of life. One of these aspects relate to the biological fact of potential motherhood for women, and thus the Bahá'í teaching that girls should be given priority in education as they potentially would be the children's first educator. [...] In the same sense, the Bahá'í view of family life gives the right to the mother to be supported by the husband if needed. [...] Similarly, {{the differences in the}} provisions of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá'u'lláh's book of laws, where in the case of <b>intestacy</b> it provides slightly more inheritance to men than women, {{can be seen in the}} same light.|$|E
2500|$|In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá'u'lláh {{wrote that}} all Bahá'ís must write a will {{where they have}} {{complete}} freedom in determining how to dispose of their property. Bahá'u'lláh, however, did create a schedule of inheritance in case of <b>intestacy,</b> that is, when the individual dies without leaving a will. [...] The system of inheritance in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas {{is based on the}} provisions written by the Báb and provides for distribution of the deceased's estate among seven categories of heirs.: children, spouse, father, mother, brothers, sisters, and teachers, with higher categories obtaining a larger share. [...] In cases where some of the categories of heirs do not exist, the share falls partly to the children and partly to the Local Spiritual Assembly. The distribution among heirs is uneven: children receive nine parts; the spouse receives eight; the father, seven; the mother, six; the brothers, five; the sisters, four; and the teachers, three.|$|E
2500|$|Mackworth's widow, Mary, {{was in some}} {{difficulty}} because of his <b>intestacy.</b> On 14 March 1655 her mews home was assigned to Major-General Philip Skippon, pending her vacating the premises. Edmund King, who acted {{as an assistant to}} Mackworth in his work for the State, also seems to have suffered financially and was given £30 by the Council in June 1655, with the recommendation that Cromwell find him a suitable post, possibly in the customs service. Johnstone says Mrs Mackworth was allowed £300 for funeral expenses, and Coulton follows, stating that [...] "his burial was paid for by the state at a cost of £300." [...] The State Papers seem to show that only in March 1657 did the Protector's Council did give his widow £300 towards the funeral costs. Moreover, this was not a grant but part of Mackworth's pay arrears, which appear to have been considerable, as a further £300 was paid to his son and executor at the same time, using Walter Strickland as intermediary. In May 1658 Mackworth's daughter Anne petitioned the Council: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Commons Registration Act 1965 {{provided}} for the registration of all common land and village greens, whilst under the Countryside Act 1968, local authorities could provide facilities [...] "for enjoyment of such lands to which the public has access". The Family Provision Act 1966 amended a series of pre-existing estate laws mainly related to persons who died interstate. The legislation increased the amount that could be paid of surviving spouses if a will hadn't been left, and also expanded upon the jurisdiction of county courts, which were given the jurisdiction of high courts under certain circumstances when handling matters of estate. The rights of adopted children were also improved with certain wording changed in the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act 1938 to bestow upon them {{the same rights as}} natural-born children. In 1968, the Nurseries and Child-Minders Regulation Act 1948 was updated to include more categories of childminders. A year later, the Family Law Reform Act 1969 was passed, which allowed people born outside marriage to inherit on the <b>intestacy</b> of either parent. In 1967, homosexuality was partially decriminalised by the passage of the Sexual Offences Act. The First Wilson Government also introduced a thirty-year rule for access to public records, replacing a previous fifty-year rule.|$|E

6000|$|... "If Mrs. Vanstone should die," [...] {{pursued the}} doctor, {{completing}} the question which Miss Garth {{had not the}} heart to conclude for herself, [...] "I believe I am right in telling you that the property would, {{as a matter of}} legal course, go to the children. Whatever necessity there may be for the interview which Mr. Pendril requests, I can see no reason for connecting it with the question of Mr. Vanstone's presumed <b>intestacy.</b> But, by all means, put the question, for the satisfaction of your own mind, to Mr. Pendril himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Frankly, however, I {{must admit}} {{that in this case}} any other form of {{disposition}} would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no will, and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case, have been treated at her decease as under <b>intestacy.</b> In which case Lord Godalming, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world. And the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced." ...|$|E
60|$|It follows, therefore, that {{although}} the right of bequest, or gift after death, forms part {{of the idea of}} private property, the right of inheritance, as distinguished from bequest, does not. That the property of persons who have made no disposition of it during their lifetime should pass first to their children, and, failing them, to the nearest relations, may be a proper arrangement or not, but is no consequence of the principle of private property. I see no reason why collateral inheritance should exist at all. Mr. Bentham long ago proposed, and other high authorities have agreed in the opinion, that, if there are no heirs either in the descending or in the ascending line, the property, in case of <b>intestacy,</b> should escheat to the state. The parent owes to society to endeavor to make the child a good and valuable member of it, and owes to the children to provide, so far as depends on him, such education, and such appliances and means, as will enable them to start with a fair chance of achieving by their own exertions a successful life. To this every child has a claim; and I can not admit that as a child he has a claim to more.|$|E
60|$|The {{preference}} {{should be}} given to such laborers, and there are many of them, as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in, or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security. The tools, the manure, and in some cases the subsistence also, might be supplied by the parish, or by the state; interest for the advance, at the rate yielded by the public funds, being laid on as a perpetual quitrent, with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years’ purchase. These little landed estates might, if it were thought necessary, be indivisible by law; though, if the plan worked in the manner designed, I should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision. In case of <b>intestacy,</b> and in default of amicable arrangement among the heirs, they might be bought by government at their value, and re-granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price. The desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become, as on the Continent, an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population; and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided, an intermediate class between them and their employers; affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes, and, as there would be good reason to anticipate, an example for their imitation.|$|E
