50|$|In botany {{a capsule}} {{is a type}} of simple, dry rarely fleshy, <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> {{produced}} by many species of Angiosperms (flowering plants).|$|E
50|$|Fruits and reproduction: Stems creep {{and root}} at the nodes and spreads by rhizomes. Produces a dry <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> that at {{maturity}} splits {{two or more}} parts each with a single seed.|$|E
50|$|The Limnocharitaceae {{are closely}} related to the Alismataceae, but differ from them by the fully <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruit,</b> {{numerous}} ovules per carpel, and laminar placentation. Members of both of these families have laticifers, petioles, a terminal pore on each leaf, a sepaloid calyx, and thin, evanescent petals.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruit is}} fleshy to non-fleshy (leathery), and {{contains}} a single seed. The fruits are typically quite large and, {{in almost all}} the species, the fruits break spontaneously when mature (<b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits).</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{detailed}} description of specialized anatomical mechanisms of fruit dehiscence in two sections of Trithuria (Hydatellaceae), a basal angiosperm lineage with a markedly ascidiate carpel. The <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> of Hydatellaceae are unique among angiosperms. Earlier studies suggested the follicle as a primitive type of <b>dehiscent</b> angiosperm <b>fruit,</b> developing from a conduplicate carpel. In contrast with follicles, the single-seeded apocarpous (or unicarpellate) <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> of Hydatellaceae dehisce by three equally spaced valves separating from three fruit ribs. There {{is no evidence of}} pseudomonomery. In mature fruits, all cell layers except the outer epidermis of the ovary are obliterated, so that only one pericarp layer (the exocarp) remains, except in the regions around the vascular bundles and at the fruit apex and base. Morphological cladistic analyses reveal data incongruence between characters describing fruit morphology and other morphological features of Hydatellaceae, including those linked with dioecy/monoecy. As a result, strict consensus trees inferred from maximum parsimony analyses based on each of the two sub-sets of morphological data are more resolved than ones inferred from the analysis of the entire morphological dataset. Fruit characters correspond closely with the recently published molecular phylogeny of the sole genus, Trithuria. The occurrence of an apparently rudimentary mechanical tissue at the fruit apex of most Hydatellaceae with indehiscent fruits suggests that the stem group of Hydatellaceae was characterized by <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> with lignified endocarp fibres. The occurrence of Strelitzia-type surface waxes characteristic of Trithuria sect. Trithuria provides further evidence of the homoplasy of this epicuticular wax type at the scale of seed plants.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of fruit dehiscence, that involve different types of structures. Some fruits are indehiscent, and do not open to disperse the seeds. Xerochasy is dehiscence that occurs upon drying, and hygrochasy is dehiscence that occurs upon wetting, the <b>fruit</b> being hygroscopic. <b>Dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> that are derived from one carpel are follicles or legumes, and those derived from multiple carpels are capsules or siliques.|$|R
50|$|Vauquelinia, {{along with}} Lindleya and Kageneckia were {{formerly}} placed in family Quillajaceae, and have dry <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruit.</b> Unlike the pome-fruited members of tribe Maleae within the Rosaceae, which share a base chromosome number of 17 with Lindleya and Kageneckia, Vauquelinia has a base chromosome number of 15.|$|E
50|$|The 7 to 11 {{leaflets}} of {{the large}} compound leaf have 7 to 12 lateral veins, typically less than the related Natal mahogany. The <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> is reddish brown, spherical and about 3 cm in diameter. As with the Natal mahogany, each black seed is almost enveloped by a red aril.|$|E
5000|$|Leaves with deeply incised lobes {{radiating}} {{out from}} the same point. Every leaf has no set number of leaflets, but commonly will have 5-7. The plant is not tall but the fruiting stalk will rise up to 2 feet, bearing green diminutive flowers in spring. In fall the fruiting stalk carries <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> that splits, bearing small spines.|$|E
50|$|Stephanandra is a genus in {{the family}} Rosaceae that is {{sometimes}} included in the genus Neillia. The deciduous, thicket-forming shrubs have attractive wavy-margined leaves that resemble maple leaves {{and have a good}} orange-yellow fall color. Cutleaf Stephanandra grows to less than 2 feet tall but spreads by suckering. In winter it has rich brown, arching shoots. It grows in full sun. The fruits of Stephanandra are dry <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits.</b>|$|R
50|$|E. mediohispanicum produce tiny seeds (less than 0.5 mg) {{that are}} autochorously (by gravity) {{dispersed}} during August and September (about 40-60 days after pollination), when the valves of the <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> (siliquae) open due to moving vegetation, wind rain or physical contact. Dispersal distance is very short in this species, just very few seeds travelling farther than 1 meter {{from the plant}} source. Seed dispersal distance is positively related to flowering stalk height, taller plants usually dispersing seeds farther.|$|R
50|$|The {{types of}} fruit {{produced}} by {{different species of}} Indigofera can also be divided into broad categories that again show great variation. The three basic types of fruit categories can be separated by their curvature including straight, slightly curved, and falcate. In addition, several of the species including Indigofera microcarpa, Indigofera suffruticosa, and Indigofera enneaphylla have shown delayed <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> This variety of fruit could again allow for artificial selection {{that would allow the}} most abundant and nutritious fruit types and shapes to be selected for.|$|R
50|$|Hesperoyucca is {{distinct}} from Yucca in having loculicidally <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> and a scape more than 2.5 cm diameter with reflexed (not erect) bracts. The stigma is capitate, whereas those of Yucca split into three reflexed lobes. The glutinous pollen is released in a sticky mass; that of Yucca species is released as single grains. Hesperoyucca is also distinct in DNA analysis. The genus is native to Mexico and the southwestern United States.|$|E
50|$|The {{fossils of}} the late Cretaceous poppy Palaeoaster inquirenda from the Western Interior of North America occurs from 74.5 million year old {{deposits}} in the Fruitland Formation in New Mexico to 64.5 million year old deposits in the Hell Creek Formation in North Dakota. <b>Dehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> fossils of Palaeoaster have been found at the excavation site for the well known Tyrannosaurus rex specimen BHI 3033. The seed capsule of Palaeoaster has some similarities {{to that of the}} extant poppy genus Romneya.|$|E
50|$|In the APG IV system (2016), {{the genus}} Nerine {{is placed in}} the {{subfamily}} Amaryllidoideae of a broadly defined family Amaryllidaceae. Within the subfamily, Nerine {{is placed in the}} Southern African tribe Amaryllideae. The phylogenetic relationships of the Amaryllideae have been investigated through molecular analysis of DNA combined with morphological data. This cladistic analysis has demonstrated that Nerine belongs to a monophyletic group forming subtribe Strumariinae. The members of this clade all originate from South Africa and often have prostrate leaves, fused stamens forming a tube towards the base of the flower, <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruit,</b> and seeds with a well developed seed coat and chlorophyll. Within the Strumariinae, Nerine is most closely related to Brunsvigia Heist., Namaquanula D. & U. MÃ¼ll.-Doblies and Hessea Herb.|$|E
40|$|A {{synopsis}} for {{the genus}} Commelina {{in the state}} of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is presented here, including a new species, ten new synonyms, five designated lectotypes, two designated epitypes and an excluded name. Commelina huntii, a new species, is remarkable due to the combination of rusty to rusty-brown hairs at the margin of its leaf-sheaths, connate spathes, white flowers with auriculate medial petal, ovaries with sparse black papillae and <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits.</b> Additionally, we provide an identification key, illustrations, and conservation status for the species of Commelina recorded {{in the state of}} Rio de Janeiro...|$|R
5000|$|Another way to {{categorize}} Indigofera is by its pericarp thickness. The pericarp {{can be categorized}} as type I, type II, and type III with type I having the thinnest pericarp and fewest layers of schlerenchymatous layers and type III having the thickest pericarp and most layers of schlerenchymatous layers. Despite, the previous examples of delayed <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> most fruits of this genus show normal explosive dehiscence to disperse seeds [...] Similar to fruit shape, a variety of fruit sizes allows for traits to be selected for that would allow for the thickest and most bountiful fruits especially when paired with fruit shape.|$|R
5000|$|Based on {{molecular}} phylogenetic studies, Kanaloa {{is closely}} related to Schleinitzia and Desmanthus. [...] Shared features include: lack of spines or prickles, presence of sessile petiolar glands, petals free to the base, and inflorescence a capitulum. Kanaloa differs from Schleinitzia in lacking glands at the apex of the anthers and having simple rather than compound pollen grains. <b>Fruits</b> are <b>dehiscent</b> along the sutures in Kanaloa; in Schleinitzia the sutural ribs separate from the valves forming a craspedium similar to that in Mimosa. Kanaloa is most closely related to Desmanthus, sharing peltate floral bracts and inertly <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits.</b> Kanaloa differs from Desmanthus in having 3 leaflets per pinna and cordiform seeds.|$|R
50|$|One {{example of}} a <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> is the silique. This fruit {{develops}} from a gynoecium composed of two fused carpels, which, upon fertilization, grow to become a silique that contains the developing seeds. After seed maturation, dehiscence takes place, and valves detach from the central septum freeing the seeds. This {{is also known as}} shattering and can be important as a seed dispersal mechanism. This process is similar to anther dehiscence and the region that breaks (dehiscence zone) runs {{the entire length of the}} fruit between the valves (the outer walls of the ovary) and the replum (the persisting septa of the ovary). At maturity, the dehiscence zone is effectively a non-lignified layer between two regions of lignified cells in the valve and the replum. Shattering occurs due to the combination of cell wall loosening in the dehiscence zone and the tensions established by the differential mechanical properties of the drying cells.|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the post-germination phases of plants allows the recognition of transitional structures that support the relationships among taxa and their establishment. Together with fruit and seeds, seedlings and saplings provide useful characters for identifying many species. This study aimed to describe and characterize the morphology of the fruits, seeds, seedlings and saplings of Macrolobium acaciifolium, M. bifolium and M. pendulum, {{as well as to}} evaluate the ecological, taxonomic and phylogenetic value of the structures identified. In this work, the seeds were sown in plastic trays with sterilized sand and sawdust, without pre-germination treatment. The fruits of the three species are woody legumes, <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> or indehiscent fruit. The seeds have seed coats with or without venation and variable embryos, with plumules differing among the three species; this trait can be helpful in distinguishing among the species studied. The seedlings are of the cryptocotylar-hypogeal-reserve or phanerocotylar-epigeal-reserve type. Macrolobium bifolium and M. pendulum are similar species, differing in only a few characters. These characters have taxonomic value and aid species identification. The characteristics of M. pendulum are described here for the first time...|$|E

50|$|Historically, the Myrtaceae {{were divided}} into two subfamilies. Subfamily Myrtoideae (about 75 genera) was {{recognized}} as having fleshy fruits and opposite, entire leaves. Most genera in this subfamily have one of three easily recognized types of embryos. The genera of Myrtoideae can be very difficult to distinguish in the absence of mature fruits. Myrtoideae are found worldwide in subtropical and tropical regions, with centers of diversity in the Neotropics, northeastern Australia, and Malesia.In contrast, subfamily Leptospermoideae (about 80 genera) was recognized as having dry, <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> (capsules) and leaves arranged spirally or alternate. The Leptospermoideae are found mostly in Australasia, with a centre of diversity in Australia. Many genera in Western Australia have greatly reduced leaves and flowers typical of more xeric habitats.|$|R
50|$|Paeonia tenuifolia is a hairless {{herbaceous}} perennial with a stem of 30-60 cm high, {{which are}} densely set with alternately arranged compound leaves. The lowest leaves are twice compounded or the leaflets are deeply divided into many fine linear segments, Â½-6 mm wide, with a blunt to rounded tip, dark green above, and lighter glaucous green below. The mostly single flower per stem {{seems to be}} floating on the foliage. The flower is 6-8 cm across, cup-shaped, with deep crimson, long inverted egg-shaped petals, with a rounded or even blunt top. The stamens are 1Â½â2 cm long, with yellow filaments, anthers and pollen. There are usually three, sometimes two, coarse felty haired carpels, that will eventually develop into 2 cm long, dry, <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> called follicles. This species is diploid with ten chromosomes (2n=10).|$|R
50|$|This is a {{flowering}} shrub growing 2 - 3 m in height. Its many stems bear waxy lance-shaped leaves 5 - 7 cm long.

40|$|Taishanzaoxia â fruit rapid {{softening}} and dehiscence during ripening {{stage and}} {{this process is}} very sensitive to endogenous ethylene. In this study, we cloned five ethylene signal transcription factors (ZMdEIL 1, ZMdEIL 2, ZMdEIL 3, ZMdERF 1 and ZMdERF 2) and one functional gene, ZMdPG 1, encoding polygalacturonase that could loose the cell connection which associated with fruit firmness decrease and fruit dehiscence to illustrate {{the reasons for this}} specific fruit phenotypic and physiological changes. Expression analysis showed that ZMdERF 1 and ZMdEIL 2 transcription were more abundant in âTaishanzaoxia â softening fruit and <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruit</b> and their expression was inhibited by an ethylene inhibitor 1 -methylcyclopropene. Therefore, ZMdERF 1 and ZMdEIL 2 expression were responses to endogenous ethylene and associated with fruit softening and dehiscence. ZMdPG 1 expression was induced when fruit softening and dehiscence but this induction can be blocked by 1 -MCP, indicating that ZMdPG 1 was essential for fruit softening and dehiscence and its expression was mediated by the endogenously occurred ethylene. ZMdPG 1 overexpression in Arabidopsis led to silique early dehiscence while suppressing ZMdPG 1 expression by antisense ZMdPG 1 prevented silique naturally opening. The result also suggested that ZMdPG 1 related with the connection between cells that contributed to fruit softening and dehiscence. ZMdERF 1 was more closely related with ethylene signaling but it was not directly regulated the ZMdPG 1, which might be regulated by the synergic pattern of ethylene transcription factors because of both the ZMdERF 1 and ZMdERF 2 coul...|$|E

The {{castor bean}} crop in SÃ£o Paulo has been expanding {{in recent years}} and reached about 30, 000 tona of seed annually. The IAC- 38 cultivar is the most planted It has a dwarf size, a cycle of 180 to 200 days, and yields about 2, 000 tons of seed per hectare. Its seed oil content is 41 %. It is an outstanding cultivar, but has the disadvantage of having <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruit.</b> This requires a great number of harvests and consequently increases the labor costs. Hybrids between IAC- 38 and the non-shattering cultivar Cimarron were made in 1957. After five generations of successive selfings and individual selection testings, a progeny was found that associates good vegetative characters with high yield and indehiscent capsules. Plants representative of this new selected cultivar have medium height, erect branches, and a cycle of 140 to 150 days. They show a partial defoliation at hervest time. The yield is comparable to that of the IAC- 38 and its seed oil content is better (46 %).

2500|$|Fruit type {{has been}} {{considered}} to be a useful character in classification and in understanding the phylogeny of plants. The evolution of fruits with a berry-like pericarp has been studied {{in a wide range of}} flowering plant families. Repeated transitions between fleshy and dry pericarps have been demonstrated regularly. One well-studied family is the Solanaceae, because of the commercial importance of fruit such as tomatoes, bell peppers, and eggplants or aubergines. Capsules, which are dry <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits,</b> appear to be the original form of the fruit in the earliest diverging members of the family. Berries have then evolved at least three times: in Cestrum, Duboisia, and in the subfamily Solanoideae. Detailed anatomical and developmental studies have shown that the berries of Cestrum and those of the Solanoideae are significantly different; for example, expansion of the fruit during development involves cell divisions in the mesocarp in Solanoideae berries, but not in Cestrum berries.|$|R
50|$|Some dry <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> form {{specialised}} capsule-like strucures. A follicle {{is derived}} from a single carpel that splits along a suture, as in Magnolia, while a legume splits along two sutures, and are {{a defining feature of}} the Fabaceae. Some variants of legumes that have retained vestigial sutures include loments that split transversly into segments, each with a single seed, and indehiscent legumes, such as Arachis hypogaea (peanuts). Capsules derived from two carpels include silicles and siliques that dehisce along two suture lines but retain a partition called the replum, which is a septum with attached seeds. While both are characteristic of Brassicaceae, silicles is at least as broad as it is long, and vice a versa. A schizocarp {{is derived from}} a compound ovary with two or more locules which then separate radially as one of the above types, such as a schizocarp of follicles, as in Asclepias (Asclepiadoideae) (see illustration).|$|R
50|$|Flowering {{usually takes}} place during rainy season, but flowers can appear {{throughout}} the year in moist conditions. Senna italica is usually propagated by seeds. Treating the seed by abrasion improves germination. Flowers of Senna italica, are actinomorphic and the inflorescence {{takes the form of}} axillary racemes, which are about 2-25 cm long. Petals of these flowers are usually yellow or orange in color, up to 13 mm long and are of obovate shape. Rhombic to ovate bracts are conspicuously present, but very small in size (up to 5mm long). The flower of Senegal senna is bisexual, zygomorphic and 5-merous. It usually has 10 stamens (lower 2 are the largest; 5 are medium-sized; 3 are short and sterile), Style up to 6 mm long and a superior ovary with short and stiff hair.Senegal senna has freely <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits.</b> Fruits are oblong or ellipsoidal; they are strongly curved, falcate, bent or lunate shaped.

40|$|International audienceThe tribe Alberteae, {{presently}} {{classified in the}} subfamily Ixoroideae (Rubiaceae), {{has historically}} been an artificial grouping of genera. In the present study, phylogenetic analyses of the chloroplast DNA markers rbcL, ndhF, trnS-G, trnT-F and trnH-psbA {{as well as the}} ITS region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, are done to assess the delimitation of Alberteae. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis is highly resolved, with most clades strongly supported. The genus Alberta is found to be paraphyletic as presently circumscribed. As a consequence, we propose the new genus Razafimandimbisonia Kainul. & B. Bremer to accommodate the Malagasy species. The newly delimited Alberta is distinguished by having two calycophylls that expand after anthesis as well as awl-shaped stigma lobes. Razafimandimbisonia is distinguished from the remaining Alberteae by having <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> and anthers without basal appendages.

Fruit production of 10 mature trees per species was measured at five sites for seven months during 1988 - 9 (n= 50 per species). Fruit yields varied according to site, season and species X site (each at P 0. 05 in all cases).

50|$|Paeonia cambessedesii is a clump-forming, perennial, {{herbaceous}} peony, which dies {{down in the}} autumn, and overwinters with buds {{just under}} the surface of the soil, and may reach a height of 25-60 cm. The reddish purple stem carries several alternately arranged leaves. The lowest leaves consist of nine leathery, hairless leaflets which are lanceolate to inverted egg-shaped with a pointy tip. The upper surface of the leafblade is bluish green with a metallic gloss, while the main veins are reddish purple, and the underside of the leafblade is purple. Each stem carries one cup-shaped flower of 6-12 cm with usually eight (5-10) pale to purplish pink petals, and is said to smell of roses. Within is a circle of numerous purple filaments topped by yellow anthers. The center of the flower consists of three to nine, initially purple carpels, each of which is connected through a thick style with a reddish stigma on top. The stigmas ripen before the stamens, a situation called protogyny. The three to eight (mostly four to six) carpels develop into dry <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> (called follicles) of about 6 cm long, that open with a suture along their lengths, and contain initially carmine colored seeds that turn glossy black when fully ripe.|$|R
40|$|Background: Rutaceae {{subfamily}} Rutoideae (46 genera, c. 660 species) is {{diverse in}} both rainforests and sclerophyll vegetation of Australasia. Australia and New Caledonia are centres of endemism {{with a number}} of genera and species distributed disjunctly between the two regions. Our aim was to generate a high-level molecular phylogeny for the Australasian Rutoideae and identify major clades as a framework for assessing morphological and biogeographic patterns and taxonomy. Methodology/Principal Findings: Phylogenetic analyses were based on chloroplast genes, rbcL and atpB, for 108 samples (78 new here), including 38 of 46 Australasian genera. Results were integrated with those from other molecular studies to produce a supertree for Rutaceae worldwide, including 115 of 154 genera. Australasian clades are poorly matched with existing tribal classifications, and genera Philotheca and Boronia are not monophyletic. Major sclerophyll lineages in Australia belong to two separate clades, each with an early divergence between rainforest and sclerophyll taxa. <b>Dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> with seeds ejected at maturity (often associated with myrmecochory) are inferred as ancestral; derived states include woody capsules with winged seeds, samaras, fleshy drupes, and retention and display of seeds in dehisced fruits (the last two states adaptations to bird dispersal, with multiple origins among rainforest genera).

40|$|AbstractBackground: Several {{processes}} of plant development, such as abscission, pollen release, fruit dehiscence, and seed dispersal, require organs or tissues to physically disassociate or split open. Due to the immobility of plant cells, these processes occur through coordinated mechanisms of cell separation {{that are not}} found in animals. Arabidopsis produces dry <b>dehiscent</b> <b>fruits</b> (siliques) making it a convenient system for the genetic study of cell separation associated with dehiscence. Results: We describe here a novel mutation in Arabidopsis called alcatraz (alc), which prevents dehiscence of fruit by specifically blocking {{the separation of the}} valve cells from the replum. The ALC gene is shown to encode a protein related to the myc/bHLH family of transcription factors and is expressed in the valve margins of the silique, which is the site of cell separation during dehiscence. Detailed studies using TEM indicates that ALC enables cell separation in Arabidopsis fruit dehiscence by promoting the differentiation of a strip of labile nonlignified cells sandwiched between layers of lignified cells. Transgenic plants expressing antisense or dominant-negative ALC are defective in silique dehiscence. Conclusions: Cell separation in fruit dehiscence requires a specialized cell layer which is nonlignified and capable of autolysis, specified by a myc/bHLH protein encoded by ALC. These findings may have relevance to other processes requiring cell separation, {{as well as for the}} practical design of crops with reduced seed losses...|$|R
