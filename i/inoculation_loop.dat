5000|$|The {{three-phase}} streaking pattern, {{known as}} the T-Streak, is recommended for beginners.The streaking is done using a sterile tool, such as a cotton swab or commonly an <b>inoculation</b> <b>loop.</b> The <b>inoculation</b> <b>loop</b> is first sterilized by passing it through a flame. When the loop is cool, it is dipped into an [...] such as a broth or patient specimen containing many species of bacteria. The <b>inoculation</b> <b>loop</b> is then dragged {{across the surface of}} the agar back and forth in a zigzag motion until approximately 30% of the plate has been covered. The loop then is re-sterilized and the plate is turned 90 degrees. Starting in the previously streaked section, the loop is dragged through it two to three times continuing the zigzag pattern. The procedure is then repeated once more being cautious to not touch the previously streaked sectors. Each time the loop gathers fewer and fewer bacteria until it gathers just single bacterial cells that can grow into a colony.The plate should show the heaviest growth in the first section. The second section will have less growth and a few isolated colonies, while the final section will have the least amount of growth and many isolated colonies.|$|E
40|$|Six {{strains of}} Streptococcus pneumoniae were {{distributed}} to 405 United Kingdom laboratories who were asked to test the susceptibility of the strains to penicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin and to provide details of methodology to test the standards of susceptibility testing. High error rates were seen only in failure to detect moderate resistance to penicillin (12 %) and resistance to chloramphenicol (16 %). Increased error rates were associated with several methods or practices. These included the use of certain culture media; failure to standardise the inoculum; <b>inoculation</b> by <b>loop</b> rather than by swab; failure to use control organisms; failure to measure zone sizes; the use of discs containing a high content of penicillin to test susceptibility to penicillin, {{and the use of}} high content discs for testing erythromycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} of the mucosal enzyme systems Na+-K+-activated adenosine triphophatase (Na-K-ATPase) and adenylate cyclase and their associated intestinal transport processes was studied in the rat ileum. Two ileal loops were constructed in each anesthetized rat; one loop was inoculated with saline, the other loop with choleragen. Net transport of water and electrolytes was measured in vivo after which enzyme activity was measured in the mucosa of the perfused loops. All doses of choleragen between 5 and 150 mug decreased water movement as early as 3 1 / 2 h after inoculation. A linear relationship between the dose of choleragen {{and the level of}} net water and electrolyte secretion was observed when choleragen doses between 5 and 150 mug were incubated in ileal loops for 4 h. Adenylate cyclase activity was always increased in secreting intestinal loops, whereas Na-K-ATPase was unaffected by choleragen. In animals pretreated with methylprednisolone acetate, 3 mg/ 100 g per day for 3 days before <b>loop</b> <b>inoculation,</b> saline <b>loops</b> had enhanced mucosal Na-K-ATPase activity had increased net water and electrolyte absorption; choleragen-exposed loops had increased adenylate cyclase and Na-K-ATPase activities, and net absorption of water and electrolytes 4 h after inoculation. These effects of methylprednisolone acetate were still present 19 1 / 2 h after inoculation. When a single injection of methylprednisolone acetate was given 3 1 / 2 h after choleragen inoculation, both adenylate cyclase and Na-K-ATPase were activated, and net intestinal absorption of water and electrolytes was observed 19 1 / 2 h after inoculation. These results suggest that methylprednisolone can prevent and reverse the secretory effects of choleragen by selectively stimulating a coexisting absorptive process...|$|R
40|$|Brucella is an {{intracellular}} pathogen able {{to persist}} {{for long periods}} of time within the host and establish a chronic disease. We show that soon after Brucella <b>inoculation</b> in intestinal <b>loops,</b> dendritic cells from ileal Peyer’s patches become infected and constitute a cell target for this pathogen. In vitro, we found that Brucella replicates within dendritic cells and hinders their functional activation. In addition, we identified a new Brucella protein Btp 1, which down-modulates maturation of infected dendritic cells by interfering with the TLR 2 signaling pathway. These results show that intracellular Brucella is able to control dendritic cell function, which may have important consequences in the development of chronic brucellosis...|$|R

40|$|The {{intestinal}} {{stage of}} listeriosis was studied in a rat ligated ileal loop system. Listeria monocytogenes translocated to deep organs with similar efficiencies after <b>inoculation</b> of <b>loops</b> {{with or without}} Peyer’s patches. Bacterial seeding of deep organs was demonstrated as early as 15 min after inoculation. It was dose dependent and nonspecific, as the ΔinlAB, the Δhly, and the ΔactA L. monocytogenes mutants and the nonpathogenic species, Listeria innocua, translocated similarly to wild-type L. monocytogenes strains. The levels of uptake of listeriae by Peyer’s patches and villous intestine were similar and low, 50 to 250 CFU per cm 2 of tissue. No listeria cells crossing the epithelial sheet of Peyer’s patches and villous intestine were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The lack of significant interaction of listeriae and the follicle-associated epithelium of Peyer’s patches was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The follicular tissue of Peyer’s patches was a preferential site of Listeria replication. With all doses tested, the rate of bacterial growth was 10 to 20 times higher in Peyer’s patches than in villous intestine. At early stages of Peyer’s patch infection, listeriae were observed inside mononuclear cells of the dome area. Listeriae then disseminated throughout the follicular tissue except for the germinal center. The virulence determinants hly and, to a lesser extent, actA, but not inlAB, were required for the completion of this process. This study suggests that Peyer’s patches are preferential sites for replication rather than for entry of L. monocytogenes, due {{to the presence of}} highly permissive mononuclear cells whose nature remains to be defined...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{levels of}} invasiveness of two bovine isolates each of Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella dublin and of invH mutants of S. typhimurium were determined in MDCK and Int 407 cultured-cell assays and in bovine ileal loops. S. dublin {{was found to}} be significantly less invasive in cultured cells than S. typhimurium, but this difference was not observed in bovine intestines. The invH mutants exhibited a significant reduction in invasion in both cultured cells and bovine intestines. The invasive phenotypes of the strains were confirmed by fluorescent microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The wild-type strains were observed in the laminae propriae of the intestinal villi, while in contrast the invH mutants were generally associated with the enterocyte layer. The degree of damage in the bovine ileum was related to the magnitude of the invasion. There was no difference in the amount of S. typhimurium or S. dublin recovered from the bovine ileum either with or without Peyer’s patches 3 h after <b>inoculation</b> of the <b>loop.</b> Salmonellosis is an important disease of cattle, and in the United Kingdom Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella dub-lin account for over 80 % of bovine Salmonella isolates (3).

40|$|The {{colonization}} of intestinal and systemic tissues by Salmonella enterica serovars with different host specificities was determined 7 days after inoculation of 1 to 2 -month-old lambs. Following oral inoculation, S. enterica serovars Abortusovis, Dublin, and Gallinarum were recovered in comparable {{numbers from the}} intestinal mucosa, but serovar Gallinarum was recovered in lower numbers than the other serovars from systemic sites. The pattern of bacterial recovery from systemic sites following intravenous inoculation was similar. The magnitude of intestinal invasion was evaluated in ovine ligated ileal loops in vivo. Serovars Dublin and Gallinarum and the broad-host-range Salmonella serovar Typhimurium were recovered in comparable numbers from ileal mucosa 3 h after <b>loop</b> <b>inoculation,</b> whereas the recovery of serovar Abortusovis was approximately 10 -fold lower. Microscopic analysis of intestinal mucosae infected with serovars Typhimurium and Dublin showed dramatic morphological changes and infiltration of inflammatory cells, whereas mucosae infected with serovars Abortusovis and Gallinarum were indistinguishable from uninfected mucosae. Together {{these data suggest that}} Salmonella serovar specificity in sheep correlates with bacterial persistence at systemic sites. Intestinal invasion and avoidance of the host’s intestinal inflammatory response may contribute to but do not determine the specificity of serovar Abortosovis for sheep. Intestinal invasion by serovar Abortusovis was significantly reduced after mutation of invH but was not reduced following curing of the virulence plasmid...|$|R
50|$|Dependent on the strain, {{the plate}} may then be incubated, usually for 24 to 36 hours, {{to allow the}} {{bacteria}} to reproduce.

40|$|Abstract Background Porcine proliferative enteropathy in pigs {{is caused}} by the obligate, {{intracellular}} bacterium Lawsonia intracellularis. In vitro studies have shown close bacterium-cell interaction followed by cellular uptake of the bacterium within 3 h post inoculation (PI). However, knowledge of the initial in vivo interaction between porcine intestinal epithelium and the bacterium is limited. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the usefulness of a ligated small intestinal loop model to study L. intracellularis infections and to obtain information on the very early L. intracellularis -enterocyte interactions. Methods A ligated small intestinal loop model using three different L. intracellularis inocula was applied to 10 - 11 -week-old pigs. The inocula were 1) wild type bacteria derived from overnight incubation of L. intracellularis bacteria from spontaneous disease, 2) crude vaccine bacteria (Enterisol ® Ileitis Vet), and 3) vaccine bacteria propagated in cell culture. The bacteria-enterocyte interaction was visualised using immunohistochemistry on specimens derived 1, 3 and 6 h PI respectively. Results Although at a low level, close contact between bacteria and the enterocyte brush border including intracellular uptake of bacteria in mature enterocytes was seen at 3 and 6 h PI for the vaccine and the propagated vaccine inocula. Interaction between the wild-type bacteria and villus enterocytes was scarce and only seen at 6 h PI, where a few bacteria were found in close contact with the brush border. Conclusions The ligated intestinal loop model was useful with respect to maintaining an intact intestinal morphology for up to 6 h. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that L. intracellularis interacts with villus enterocytes within 3 to 6 h after <b>inoculation</b> into intestinal <b>loops</b> and that the bacterium, as shown for the vaccine bacteria, propagated as well as non-propagated, was able to invade mature enterocytes. Thus, the study demonstrates the early intestinal invasion of L. intracellularis in vivo. </p...|$|R
40|$|Strains of Shiga toxin (Stx) -producing Escherichia coli, {{also called}} enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), are {{important}} food-borne pathogens for humans. Most EHEC strains intimately {{adhere to the}} intestinal mucosa in a characteristic attaching and effacing (A/E) pattern, which is mediated by the bacterial adhesin intimin. Subsequent release of Stx 1 and/or Stx 2 leads to the frequent development of hemorrhagic colitis and, less commonly, to hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop an attenuated A/E E. coli strain for use as a vaccine against EHEC infection encoding a truncated intimin lacking adhesive capacity, but which would still express somatic antigens, other products of the locus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity island, and an immunogenic remnant of the intimin molecule. A single-nucleotide deletion was generated in the eae gene in the prototype rabbit A/E E. coli strain RDEC- 1 (O 15 :H−), which resulted in truncation of intimin by 81 C-terminal residues (860 to 939 amino acids) containing a disulfide <b>loop.</b> <b>Inoculation</b> of rabbits with large doses of the truncated intimin mutant (RDEC- 1 Δeae 860 - 939) was well tolerated, as observed by the absence of clinical signs of disease or evidence of intestinal A/E lesions. The efficacy of RDEC- 1 Δeae 860 - 939 as a vaccine was evaluated by orogastric inoculation of rabbits with RDEC- 1 Δeae 860 - 939 followed by challenge with the virulent strain RDEC-H 19 A, an Stx 1 -producing derivative of wild-type RDEC- 1 capable of inducing hemorrhagic colitis in rabbits. Following RDEC-H 19 A challenge, nonimmunized control rabbits exhibited characteristic weight loss with watery to bloody diarrhea and demonstrated intimate bacterial attachment, effacement of microvilli, submucosal edema, mucosal heterophile infiltrates, and Shiga toxin-induced vascular lesions. In contrast, the RDEC- 1 Δeae 860 - 939 -immunized rabbits showed no clinical signs of disease, maintained normal weight gain, had reduced fecal shedding of challenge organisms, and showed an absence of gross or microscopic lesions in the intestinal mucosa. Serum antibodies specific to intimin were detected among rabbits immunized with RDEC- 1 Δeae 860 - 939, indicating that truncation of the intimin functional domain not only attenuated bacterial virulence, but also retained at least some of the immunogenicity of native intimin. Although it is not possible to gauge the exact contribution of residual intimin immunity to protection, this attenuation strategy for A/E E. coli strains shows promise for the development of effective vaccines to prevent EHEC infection in humans and animals...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Yuri G. Strukov and Andrew S. Belmont This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “Development of Mammalian Cell Lines with lac Operator-Tagged Chromosomes,” Chapter 25, in[*Live Cell Imaging*]([URL] Goldman and Spector). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2005. ### INTRODUCTION The discovery and use of fluorescent proteins to label chromosomal proteins has yielded basic structural information as well as insights into dynamics that were previously inaccessible. This protocol describes a method for tagging specific chromosome sites using the *lac* operator/repressor system, wherein direct repeats of bacterial operator sequences are coupled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged proteins that recognize these sequences. Direct *lac* operator repeats are generated by directional cloning. Although the use of direct repeats, as opposed to inverted repeats, reduces recombination within the bacterial host at high copy number, even the direct repeats are unstable, requiring the use of special bacterial hosts and low-copy-number plasmids for cloning. The introduction of the *lac* operator repeats into eukaryotic cells uses traditional transformation methods. Techniques for the isolation of stable cell clones with varying transgene copy numbers are described in the protocol, as are several methods for visual screening {{of large numbers of}} stable cell clones to isolate rare clones containing labeled chromosomal regions with desired features. ### RELATED INFORMATION In principle, chromosome tagging can be accomplished through the use of any repetitive sequence to which a specific protein binds. The first application of this approach used the bacterial lac operator and Lac repressor combination. The lac operator/Lac repressor-labeling system has been successfully adapted for tagging chromatin in live bacteria, yeast, and mammalian tissue culture cells (Fig. 1), as well as in multicellular organisms including *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *Drosophila*, and *Arabidopsis*. Subsequent approaches have used tet operator or glucocorticoid receptor element repeats. Recently, the lac operator system has been used in combination with the bacteriophage viral replicase translational operator and several color variants of GFP to label DNA, RNA, and protein in living cells. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1. ** Examples of different stable cell lines with lac operator-tagged chromosome regions visualized by GFP-Lac repressor in vivo expression.

Agarose gel (0. 7 %) - Ampicillin (add at 100 μg/mL to both LB medium and LB agar plates) - Bacteria (e. g., Stbl 2 competent cells; Invitrogen/GIBCO) - CaCl 2 (250 mM) - Cells for transfection: CHO DG 44 - DNA preparation kits (e. g., QIAGEN miniprep and maxiprep kits) - Ethanol (70 %; ice-cold 100 %) - Fetal bovine serum (FBS), defined and dialyzed (HyClone Lab) - Fluorescein-labeled methotrexate (FMTX) (Molecular Probes) - Glycine (100 μM) - Hypoxanthine (30 μM) - LB medium (liquid and agar plates) - Media for cells used for transfection - F- 12 (HAM) medium (Invitrogen/GIBCO) supplemented with 10 % defined FBS: for growth of DG 44 cells - F- 12 medium, lacking thymidine and hypoxanthine, with 10 % dialyzed FBS: for selection and further passaging of stably transfected cells - Phosphate-buffered saline, calcium- and magnesium-free (CMF-PBS) - Restriction enzymes SalI and XhoI - Sodium acetate (3 M, pH 5. 5) - TE buffer (optional; see Step 4. vii) - Thymine (30 μM) - TR buffer - Trypsin - Vector (e. g., psv 2 -DHFR- 8. 32) and appropriate insert (e. g., 256 -copy lac operator repeat) (see Steps 1 and 2) ### Equipment 1. Dry ice - Equipment for agarose gel electrophoresis - Filter paper - Flasks (25 -cm 2 tissue culture; 75 -cm 2) - Fluorescence-activated cell sorter - Forceps (sharp-tipped) - Incubator preset to 30 °C - <b>Inoculation</b> <b>loops</b> - Marker (permanent) - Microcentrifuge - Microcentrifuge tubes (1. 5 mL) - Micropipette tips (sterile 200 -μL) (1 mL) (optional; see Step 8. viii) - Microscope - Petri dishes (150 -mm) - Pipette - Plastic hose (optional; see Step 8. viii) - Plates for growing bacterial cultures - Plates (96 -well) - Shaking platform - Tubes for transfection ### METHOD **Preparing Vector DNA Containing Large Direct Repeats** 1. Clone the lac operator repeat into a vector. - *This protocol is based on preparations from our laboratory using the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat*. - i. Use Stbl 2 competent cells grown at 30 °C to help maintain full-length lac operator repeats. - ii. Clone the lac operator repeats into low-copy-number vectors (e. g., psv 2 -DHFR- 8. 32). - *Having too many copies in a cell increases the possibility of recombination*. - Purify vector DNA as follows: - The purification of vector DNA should take no more than 3 d to complete (4 d if the optional second minipreps are performed in Step 2. viii). Recombination may occur if plates or cultures from Step 1 are allowed to stand at 4 °C; thus it is important to complete this procedure without delay. However, the plasmid DNA, once prepared from the cells, is stable. Because low-copy-number plasmids are used, expect low yields at every purification step. - i. Streak bacteria from a stab culture onto an LB plate containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL). Store the stab culture in the dark at room temperature. - ii. Incubate the inoculated LB plate for 24 h at 30 °C. - *Even after this length of time, the colonies will be small*. - iii. Inoculate at least 10 3 -mL cultures of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with well-isolated colonies. Incubate the cultures on a shaker overnight at 30 °C. - iv. Prepare DNA using a miniprep procedure (e. g., QIAGEN) from 1. 5 mL of each culture. Store the remainder of each culture at 4 °C. - v. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI. Separate the DNA fragments on an agarose gel (0. 7 %). - *At this step, it is critical to be very discerning. Any bands present other than those expected could indicate recombination of the plasmid (in the case of the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat, expect 10 -kb and 5 -kb fragments) *. - vi. Prepare and freeze a glycerol stock, or prepare a stab culture of each positive clone (from the stored cultures in Step 2. iv). - vii. Inoculate 500 mL of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with the remaining culture from one of the positive clones. Incubate the culture overnight at 30 °C with shaking. - *It may be preferable to prepare two 500 -mL cultures, each from a different positive clone, in the event that one clone is lost during large-scale growth*. - viii. (Optional) Before proceeding with the maxiprep DNA isolation, isolate DNA from an aliquot of the 500 -mL culture by repeating Steps 2. iv- 2. v. While preparing the miniprep DNA, centrifuge the 500 -mL culture. Discard the supernatant, and freeze the bacterial pellet until ready to use. Use positive cultures for the following step: - ix. Isolate DNA from the 500 -mL culture using a maxiprep procedure. If using QIAGEN maxipreps with Qiafilters, double the volume of P 1, P 2, and P 3 added to each pellet, and then split the prep into two Qiafilters. This prevents the Qiafilter from clogging. - *The yield of DNA will be low. A good yield is ~ 125 μg of DNA per 500 -mL culture*. - x. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI to confirm that only DNA fragments of the expected size are present. **Making Stable Cell Lines Containing lac Operator Repeats** 3. Grow cells for transfection for ~ 1 wk. - *CHO DG 44 cells are derivatives of CHO K 1 cells and are doubly deleted for the DHFR locus. The product of the DHFR gene is necessary for intermediary metabolism of thymidylates and purines. An imbalance of nucleotides in cells may be the cause of both insert instability due to gene amplification and an abnormal cell cycle due to interference with replication timing*. 4. Purify plasmid DNA for transfection as follows: - i. Transfer 300 μL of vector DNA solution (~ 100 μg/mL) into a 1. 5 -mL microcentrifuge tube. - ii. Add 33 μL of sodium acetate (3 M, pH 5. 5) to the DNA, and thoroughly mix the solution with a pipette. - iii. Add 660 μL of ice-cold 100 % ethanol to the tube, and mix the contents by inverting the tube several times. Let the tube stand on dry ice for 5 min. - *At this step, white fibers of DNA precipitate should be visible*. - iv. Centrifuge the reaction in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. For convenience, label the location of the pellet inside the tube with a permanent marker. - v. Remove the supernatant, and wash the pellet with 1 mL of 70 % ethanol at 4 °C by inverting the tube several times. Centrifuge the tube in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000|$|R

30|$|Sample {{preparation}} {{was carried}} out according to the Bruker protocols using three methods: (1) direct transfer (DT), (2) extended direct transfer (eDT), and (3) ethanol (EtOH)–formic acid (FA) extraction. In the DT method, a thin smear of biological material was placed onto a target plate, which was immediately overlaid with 1  μl of alpha-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution (HCCA; Bruker Daltonics, Gr.), prepared according to the protocol of the manufacturer. In the eDT method, the biomass was treated with 1  μl of 70  % FA on the target plate prior to the HCCA matrix overlay. In the EtOH–FA method, one or two loops of yeast biomass (1  μl volume, sterile <b>inoculation</b> <b>loop)</b> {{was used for the}} crude protein extraction, as described previously (Lacroix et al. 2014). One microliter of the crude protein extract was spotted onto the target plate, and after air-drying, it was overlaid with 1  μl of HCCA matrix solution. For all methods, each tested strain was spotted in duplicate. Standard commercially available Bruker Daltonics database (BDAL) was used in this study: individual spectra using the MALDI Biotyper automated FlexControl software version 3.0 (Bruker Daltonics). The MALDI-TOF MS identification results were automatically classified using the log-score values generated by the MALDI Biotyper software (Bruker Daltonics, Germany), performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the presence of Aeromonas spp., Vibrio spp. and Plesiomonas shigelloides in Cameroonian tilapia. 120 samples of tilapia were collected from June to December 2005 in four localities in the north of Cameroon and were delivered to the laboratory in cool boxes. For the sample preparation to isolate the bacteria, 50 g of sample (gills, intestine and skin of individually fish) were taken using a sterile scalpel. These 50 g were homogenized in 450 ml of sterilised peptone solution. After 18 h of incubation, the homogenate sample was inoculated on thiosulphate citrate bile salt sucrose (TCBS) using an <b>inoculation</b> <b>loop</b> and incubated at 37 °C for 18 to 24 h. The isolated colonies were subjected to morphological, physiological and commercially available API kits tests. In addition, the antimicrobial pattern of the identified strains to ten different antibiotics was studied using the agar disk diffusion method. The results obtained from this study show the presence of bacterial species belonging to Aeromonas spp. (n= 39), Vibrio spp. (n= 41) and P. shigelloides (n= 14). The results of antimicrobial susceptibility show that the highest rates of resistance was found in ampicillin (100 % of isolates), nitrofurantoin (more than 68 % of isolates), association of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (51 % of isolates) and sulfamide (46 % of isolates). This work therefore highlights an important incidence of Aeromonas spp., Vibrio spp. and P. shigelloides with potential antimicrobial resistance, isolated from tilapia in four localities of Cameroon.

30|$|A {{total of}} eight {{isolates}} {{were used for}} the pathogenicity test against larvae and adults of H. postica. Therefore, each fungal isolate was plated on PDAY and incubated at 25  °C for 4  weeks. Conidial suspensions were prepared by adding 10  ml of 0.1 % Tween 80 (AppliChem) into the 4 -week-old Petri dishes, and the conidia were taken from the agar surface, using a sterile <b>inoculation</b> <b>loop</b> to dislodge. The concentrations of conidial suspensions were determined, using a Neubauer hemocytometer and adjusted to 1 [*]×[*] 107 conidia/ml. For the screening test, H. postica larvae and adults were collected from infested alfalfa fields in the Adana and Igdir, Turkey. Healthy larvae and adults were randomly selected and used for bioassays. For bioassays, 30 third instar larvae and adults were used for each test and each fungal isolate. All experiments were repeated three times on different days, using fresh collected larvae. Larvae and adults were inoculated by dipping into 1  ml of 1 [*]×[*] 107 conidia/ml suspension, prepared from different cultures at different times for 4 – 5  s. Thereafter, they were placed in plastic boxes (15  cm wide[*]×[*]  8  cm deep) including alfalfa leaves. The control groups of larvae and adults were treated by a sterile water supplemented with 0.1 % Tween 80. All boxes were incubated at 20  °C for 1  week, at 12 / 12 photoperiod. Fresh alfalfa leaves were provided daily for 7  days. The mortality rates of larvae and adults were estimated daily after inoculation for 14  days. Dead insects were surface sterilized by dipping into 1 % sodium hypochlorite for 3  min followed by 70 % ethanol for 3  min and washed three times in sterile distilled water. Then, they were placed on a wet filter paper in sterile plastic Petri dishes, covered with parafilm, and incubated at 25  °C to stimulate fungal sporulation on the cadavers. Finally, the pathogenicity of the isolates was measured by determination of mortality rates and calculation of percentage of mycoses by using Schneider-Orelli’s formula (Püntener 1981). The isolates that caused more than 90 % of mortality (total or confirmed) were selected to the next phase of the study.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the efficiency of the Cryotop and Calibrated plastic <b>inoculation</b> <b>loop</b> (CPIL) devices for vitrification of rabbit embryos on in vitro development and implantation rate, offspring rate at birth and embryonic and fetal losses. CPIL is a simple tool used mainly by microbiologists to retrieve an inoculum from a culture of microorganisms. In experiment 1, embryos were vitrified using a Cryotop device and a CPIL device. There {{were no significant differences in}} hatched/hatching blastocyst stage rates after 48 h of culture among the vitrified groups (62 ± 4. 7 % and 62 ± 4. 9 %, respectively); however, the rates were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) than those of the fresh group (95 ± 3. 4 %). In experiment 2, vitrified embryos were transferred using laparoscopic technique. The number of implanted embryos was estimated by laparoscopy as number of implantation sites at day 14 of gestation. At birth, total offspring were recorded. Embryonic and fetal losses were calculated as the difference between implanted embryos and embryos transferred and total born at birth and implanted embryos, respectively. The rate of implantation and development to term was similar between both vitrification devices (56 ± 7. 2 % and 50 ± 6. 8 % for implantation rate and 40 ± 7. 1 % and 35 ± 6. 5 % for offspring rate at birth); but significantly lower than in the fresh group (78 ± 6. 6 % for implantation rate and 70 ± 7. 2 % for offspring rate at birth, P< 0. 05). Likewise, embryonic losses were similar between both vitrification devices (44 ± 7. 2 % and 50 ± 6. 8 %), but significantly higher than in the fresh group (23 ± 6. 6 %, P < 0. 05). However, fetal losses were similar between groups (10 ± 4. 4 %, 15 ± 4. 8 % and 8 ± 4. 2 %, for vitrified, Cryotop or CPIL and fresh, respectively). These results indicate that the CPIL device is as effective as the Cryotop device for vitrification of rabbit embryos, but at a cost of € 0. 05 per device...|$|E
30|$|Bacteria were {{isolated}} using trypticase soy agar (TSA) and selective agar thiosulphate–citrate–bile salts–sucrose agar (TCBS) for isolating Vibrio sp. The colony-forming unit (CFU) from fifth time serial dilution (10 − 5) {{was selected for}} colony counting. Gram staining also was done to identify Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Catalase test was done to identify Gram-positive bacilli. API kit (Biomerieux) API 20 E and API 20 NE were used to identify Gram-negative bacteria. Incubation box, tray and lid were prepared for the strip preparation. For the inoculum preparation, an ampule of API NaCl 0.85  % (2  ml) was selected and 1 – 4 colonies of bacteria were picked up using <b>inoculation</b> <b>loop</b> from the agar plate and then suspension was prepared with the turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland. For the API 20 NE strip inoculation, test nitrate reduction (NO 3) and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside hydrolysis (PNPG) were inoculated by distributing the saline suspension into the tubes using Pasteur pipette. API AUX medium was added to approximately 200  µl of the remaining suspension into the ampule and was homogenized well. Tubes and cupules of test glucose fermentation (GLU) and Phenyl-acetate assimilation test (PAC) were filled with the suspension. Mineral oil {{was added to the}} cupules of 3 tests (GLU), arginine hydrolysis (ADH), and urea hydrolysis (URE) until convex meniscuses formed. The incubation box was closed and incubated at 29  ±  2  °C for 24  h. After the incubation period, the strips were read by referring to the reading table. The reactions for (GLU, ADH, URE, aesculin hydrolysis test (ESC)), gelatine hydrolysis (GEL) and (PNPG) were recorded on result sheet. For NO 3 test, 1 drop of NIT 1 and 1 drop of NIT 2 reagents were added to NO 3 cupule. For tryptophan deaminase test (TRP), 1 drop of JAMES reagent was added and immediate reaction took place. NIT 1, NIT 2 and JAMES reagents were removed using pipette and test NO 3 and TRP were covered with mineral oil. Kit was reincubated at 29  ±  2  °C for 24  h and all tests were read again except for NO 3, TRP and underlined GLU, which were only read once at 24  h. Identification is obtained with the numerical profile. Database (V 6.0) in the API web index was used by entering the seven digit numerical profile in the identification software for species identification.|$|E
