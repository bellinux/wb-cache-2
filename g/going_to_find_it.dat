She stated, [...] "I was just really intimidated because I don’t have a child. I’ve never experienced that unconditional love with someone – for someone [...] I really didn’t have that much to connect to in my own personal life. I think that’s what scared me the most – how I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> within myself to tell a truthful story." [...] Having previously noted that becoming a mother [...] "matured" [...] Chloe, Hendrickson said, [...] "I {{would love to see}} {{a little bit of the}} old Chloe come out of this extreme loss that she’s just experienced. I think it would make a lot of sense." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jessie Morris from Complex wrote; [...] "The song if {{fueled by}} a very smooth, R&B beat that makes it feel like the trio is {{channeling}} their old school sound. As always, Ma's hard-hitting bars provide the perfect offset to Joe's verses while Ty Dolla Sign polishes the whole thing from the background with some incredibly silky ad-libs." [...] Emmanuel C.M. of XXL wrote that the song [...] "sounds like <b>it’s</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>it’s</b> way on the charts too". Rap-Up praised Ty Dolla Sign's vocals saying that he [...] "lays down some smooth melodies". OnSMASH wrote; [...] "TY$ delivers a fire hook as usual, while Fat Joe and Remy Ma {{do what they do}} on the verse side of things." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{suppose we}} do stave Rojas off, {{and you get}} safely away with Mercedes. Isn't Rojas <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> out quick? Then what'll he try to do to us who're left here?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The ghostly voice!" [...] {{he muttered}} to himself. He gave a sudden shiver and then steadied himself. [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out what <b>it</b> means, or know the reason why!" [...] And he gripped his gun tightly.|$|R

"I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out who <b>it</b> is {{that built}} this dam, and {{who it is}} that filled the hole I made in <b>it!</b> I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out if I have to move up here and live all summer!"

50|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} (which uses the shorter single version) shows the guilt felt {{by a man}} (portrayed by Michael) over an affair, and his acknowledgement that his partner (Lisa Stahl) is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out. <b>It</b> was filmed on location in Miami, Florida, in 1984 and features such locales as Coconut Grove and Watson Island. The final part of the video shows Michael leaning out of a balcony at the last floor of Miami's Grove Towers. The Wexler production of the song has a rarer music video {{using some of the}} same footage as the official release, as well as a brief appearance by Andrew Ridgeley playing a taxi driver.|$|R
5000|$|The three Fimbles have {{a special}} [...] "sixth sense" [...] - when the Tinkling Tree tinkles its bell-like blossoms, it makes the nose, fingers and topknot {{of one or more}} Fimbles twitch as they get the [...] "Fimbling Feeling". This tells the character(s) that they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> something. <b>It</b> may be a natural {{phenomenon}} - a patch of sunlight for example, an everyday object, e.g. a tambourine, or something which would be totally inexplicable in the real world, such as a puddle of blue [...] "goo". Whatever is found becomes the catalyst for the episode's adventures and the trigger for the Fimbles' creative play.|$|R
5000|$|Margaret also {{acted as}} part of a {{committee}} devoted to water issues after the Victorian Government signed a land management agreement with the Yorta Yorta tribe in 2004. She is quoted as saying, [...] "We concentrate too much on what happens overseas and not enough on what's going on here. When the water level gets low enough, we're all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out what <b>it</b> means to survive." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "This {{may have}} been done by the police search," [...] he remarked, [...] "or it may not. Don't spread out too far, girls, and go slowly.

6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Devine, indifferently. [...] "There's grit in him. A curious kind of man.

60|$|The stairs down which Mr Kay was {{approaching}} {{were at the}} end of the passage. To reach the dining-room one turned to the right. Beyond the stairs on the left the passage ended in a wall, so that Mr Kay was bound to take the right direction in the search. Fenn wondered if he had a pistol. Not that he cared very much. If the house-master was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> him, <b>it</b> would be very little extra discomfort to be shot at. And Mr Kay's talents as a marksman were in all probability limited to picking off sitting haystacks. The important point was that he had a candle. A faint yellow glow preceded him down the stairs. Playing hide-and-seek with him in the dark, Fenn might have slipped past in safety; but the candle made that impossible.|$|R
6000|$|... "That nest {{was built}} by Red-tail the Hawk, and it hasn't even been repaired," [...] muttered Farmer Brown's boy, as he stared up at it. [...] "If Hooty {{and his wife have}} taken it for their home, they are mighty poor housekeepers. And if Mrs. Hooty has laid eggs this time of year, she must be crazy. I suppose the way <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out is <b>to</b> climb up there. It seems foolish, but I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it.

Between that and my four children, I don't have the time or the energy for anything else. For example, I do appreciate that lots of people worked long and hard putting together things like the DVD of the Sticky & Sweet Tour that we just released, and I have seen the finished product, but I have got no idea how people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out about <b>it</b> or how it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be sold." ...|$|R

It's the gum we came for, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> if I {{tear the}} ballast tanks and limbeys out of her.

"Now, Hester, don't lecture or be prim when I {{tell you}} that we are going on a frolic," [...] she began, after getting the old woman into an amiable mood by every winning wile she could devise.

5000|$|Noah {{then goes}} to his dad (Bruce Altman) for help, but he refuses because he now hates Noah due to him {{dropping}} {{out of college and}} just being a loser in general. An angry Noah steals his father's car keys and drives to a jewelry store his dad owns. Noah then steals enough jewelry to pay back Karl, but then Rodrigo blows the store up after placing a cherry bomb in the bathroom. Rodrigo then throws a temper tantrum, and then throws Slater's fanny pack containing pills out the window. Noah stops the car so Slater can get the pills. Noah tells Slater that he's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> them, and <b>it</b> is then revealed that Slater is homosexual, and the pills were the only thing that kept him [...] "normal." [...] Noah then makes Slater accept the fact that he's gay, and that {{there is nothing wrong with}} it.|$|R
50|$|Dan, Sean and Gordito try <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{out what}} the demon samurai is up to {{so that they can}} find Goodrich & Doc again so they can cure Mitzi; Gordito {{suspects}} it is one of his teachers at Catholic school. Dan & Sean manage <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Bestein, the only man who can defeat the demon samurai, and rescue Gordito from him. Meanwhile, King Radical takes it upon himself to fight McNinja's former enemies and bring order back to Cumberland, until he realizes that Dr. McLuchador is completely radical. It is later revealed that Dr. McLuchador is actually Dr. McNinja in disguise, trying to earn Radical's trust in an extreme show of radical medicine by summoning a giant crab deity in order to cure a teenager's acne. (The real McLuchador died alone in Arizona.) The gambit works and Radical hires McNinja as his court physician. McNinja then cures Mitzi, confirming to them that the future King Radical from the Futures Trading arc told him he was planning something sinister, and he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out what <b>it</b> was.|$|R

5000|$|The DVD was {{released}} in the United States on April 6, 2010. Spin collaborated with Madonna's official website and launched a promotional campaign for the release, giving away an autographed DVD of the album, a Sticky and Sweet tour T-shirt, a tour photo book, an official tour program and a free one-year subscription to their website. During an April 2010 interview with Interview magazine, Madonna noted how she {{was not able to}} focus {{on the development of the}} DVD as she was involved in her directorial venture, W.E. She said,"I haven't really been focused as much as I should be on the music part of my career because this movie has just consumed every inch of me.

A closet he's afraid to show anyone. A closet he's locked and thrown away the key. Additional Information: It's begun to strike me, reading the book of GENESIS, that God's hiding something.

It's urgent that we explore different understandings {{of what it means to}} be a man; and to do so we need to explore different forms.

6000|$|The {{evidence}} as yet in truth was meagre; which, for that matter, was {{perhaps a little}} why his expectation had had a drop. There was somehow not quite a wealth in her; and a wealth was all that, in his simplicity, he had definitely prefigured. Still, {{it was too much}} to be sure already that there was but a poverty. They moved away from the house, and, with eyes on a bench at some distance, he proposed that they should sit down. [...] "I've heard a great deal about you," [...] she said as they went; but he had an answer to it that made her stop short. [...] "Well, about YOU, Madame de Vionnet, I've heard, I'm bound to say, almost nothing"--those struck him as the only words he himself could utter with any lucidity; conscious as he was, and as with more reason, of the determination to be in respect to the rest of his business perfectly plain and go perfectly straight. It hadn't at any rate been in the least his idea to spy on Chad's proper freedom. It was possibly, however, at this very instant and under the impression of Madame de Vionnet's pause, that <b>going</b> straight began <b>to</b> announce itself as a matter for care. She had only after all to smile at him ever so gently in order to make him ask himself if he weren't already going crooked. It might be <b>going</b> crooked <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> of a sudden just only clear that she intended very definitely to be what he would have called nice to him. This was what passed between them while, for another instant, they stood still; he couldn't at least remember afterwards what else it might have been. The thing indeed really unmistakeable was its rolling over him as a wave that he had been, in conditions incalculable and unimaginable, a subject of discussion. He had been, on some ground that concerned her, answered for; which gave her an advantage he should never be able to match.|$|R
