25|$|I {{actually}} {{never met}} the Three Kings—it didn't matter how hard my little brother and I tried to keep awake at night {{to catch a glimpse}} of the Three Royal Visitors, we would always fall asleep just before they arrived. But I do remember hearing them. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the film}} {{received}} generally favorable reviews. [...] Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it [...] "a rollicking musical memoir.... Weller's inventions make this Hair seem much funnier than <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> show's having been. They also provide {{time and space}} {{for the development of}} characters who, on the stage, had to express themselves almost entirely in song.... he entire cast is superb.... Mostly... the film is a delight." ...|$|E
500|$|Simon Hopkinson, {{writing in}} The Independent in 2000, praises Acton's Christmas pudding: [...] "It {{was to the}} cookery writing of the legendary Eliza Acton where Joyce Molyneux [...] went to find her perfect pudding recipe. And, as far as <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>the</b> {{particular}} reason why she liked the result of Acton's recipe above all others was because it had this unusual lightness to it, yet also seemed to offer up the required richness too." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{musical score}} for Girl with a Pearl Earring {{was written by}} the French {{composer}} Alexandre Desplat. Webber decided to hire Desplat after hearing a score he had composed for a Jacques Audiard film. Webber explained, [...] "He {{had a sense of}} restraint and a sense of lyricism that I liked. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> first time I saw the cue where Griet opens the shutters. He was really describing what the light was doing, articulating that in a musical sphere." [...] Desplat was then known primarily for scoring films in his native language.|$|E
500|$|In 1960 Leigh {{recalled}} her ambivalence {{towards her}} first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, [...] "that some critics saw {{fit to be}} as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 6, 2012, Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Everybody" [...] during The MDNA Tour in San Jose {{to celebrate}} the single's 30th anniversary. She said, [...] "Today {{is a very special}} day for me. It is the 30th anniversary of the release of my first-ever single. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> amazing feeling I had when I heard the song on the radio the first time." [...] Aidin Vaziri from San Francisco Chronicle commented that [...] "Three decades later, the simple synth-pop lift and naive R melody still felt amazing. It was an off-script moment that inadvertently became the highlight of the show." ...|$|E

500|$|Scully traces Doggett's {{phone call}} and has Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) travel to the Mexican town where he was last seen. It is {{revealed}} that Caballero, an enforcer for the local drug cartel, is a [...] "memory vampire": he can absorb the memories of those posing {{a threat to the}} cartel. Reyes finds Doggett and faces gunfire from the police, who are likewise controlled by the cartel; all the while, Reyes attempts to remind Doggett of who they are. Doggett remembers his son. The agents are rescued by Skinner and the Mexican Federales. Doggett tearfully admits that he is happy to have all of his memories, even the bad ones, [...] "as long as <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> good.” ...|$|E
500|$|Piccard was {{the mother}} of a house full of boys. Robert R. Gilruth, one of her {{students}} and collaborators, said later in his oral history that he remembered a breakfast he had with the Piccards in a St. Cloud, Minnesota hotel before a balloon launching, [...] "I don't know how many there were. It seems like there was a dozen.... <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> youngest one took the corn flake box and dumped it on his father's head. Of course, Piccard just brushed it off his head and said, 'No, no.'" [...] "He was very gentle. He loved his boys, and he thought boys would be boys, I guess." [...] The Piccards had three sons of their own, John, Paul, and Donald (who would become a famous balloonist and ballooning innovator in his own right), as well as foster children. The Piccard family archive in the Library of Congress mentions correspondence from foster children whom the Piccards took in, although nothing else seems to be known about them.|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Al Jean {{noted in}} an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly that it was easy to cast Lynch, since [...] "she can do edge, sweetness, and a mix of both". He further noted that the crew was happy when she agreed to take the role, and that he was [...] "embarrassed [...] didn’t ask her before she was so successful because she’s funny in everything she does." [...] Lynch recorded her scenes together with cast member Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer. In an interview with the website Hollywood Outbreak, she commented that [...] "It was pretty amazing to {{every once in a while}} look up at his face and go 'Oh my God, it's that guy that does that voice.'" [...] Lynch added that she [...] "had the best time. I would do it again and again. This is kind of very much a milestone in my career. I will point to this as a big deal." [...] In an interview with Fox All Access, Lynch revealed that she is a longtime fan: [...] "Indeed I am a fan of The Simpsons. I started watching twenty years ago. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> first season. I remember clearly moments from the episodes and I thought it was revolutionary, the comedy of it. I really loved it." ...|$|E

2500|$|About {{the picture}} and its legacy, Lorrie Stirm Kitching once noted, [...] "We have this very nice picture of a very happy moment, but every time I look at it, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> {{families}} that weren't reunited, {{and the ones that}} aren't being reunited today— many, many families— and I think, I'm one of the lucky ones." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burstein's {{short story}} {{collection}} <b>I</b> <b>Remember</b> <b>the</b> Future: The Award-Nominated Stories of Michael A. Burstein {{was released by}} Apex Publications on November 1, 2008. [...] On February 19, 2010, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America announced that the title story from the collection had been nominated for the 2009 Nebula Award for Best Short Story.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> {{way she had}} {{abandoned}} this very arm and hand to the white-haired ruffian. It rendered me gloomy and idiotically obstinate.|$|R

2500|$|In the film, Emin {{describes}} leaving {{school at}} age 13 and spending her time on Margate's Golden Mile, dreaming and having sex. Sex [...] "was {{something you could}} just do and it was for free". She was [...] "13, 14" [...] and having sex with men of [...] "19, 20, 25, 26". In the film, the narration states: “It could be good, really something. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> first time someone asked me to grab their balls, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> power it gave me. But it wasn’t always like that; sometimes they’d just cum, and then they’d leave me there, wherever I was, half naked.” In the final scenes, the artist performs at a local dance competition and people begin to clap. A gang of men, “most of whom [...] had sex with {{at one time or}} another" [...] began to chant [...] "slag, slag, slag".|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> day {{he bought}} the {{painting}} from Picasso, who strange as it may seem, appeared to be intimidated by Doucet and even offered no resistance when the price was set at 25,000 francs: [...] "Well then, it's agreed, M. Picasso." [...] Doucet then said: [...] "You shall receive 2,000 francs per month, beginning next month, until the sum of 25,000 francs is reached.|$|E

2500|$|Pepper {{aligned with}} Jay Lovestone's pro-Bukharin faction, as Whittaker Chambers {{recalled}} in his memoirs: [...] For {{the first and}} only time, I attended a Lovestone caucus meeting... <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> short, arrogant figure of John Pepper, who, as Joseph Pogany, had been the commissar for war in the Hungarian Soviet Government, and who was now the official representative of the Communist International to the American Communist Party, and Lovestone's [...] "gray eminence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Updike {{was born}} in Reading, Pennsylvania, {{the only child of}} Linda Grace (née Hoyer) and Wesley Russell Updike, and was raised in the nearby small town of Shillington. The family later moved to the unincorporated village of Plowville. His mother's {{attempts}} to become a published writer impressed the young Updike. [...] "One of my earliest memories", he later recalled, [...] "is of seeing her at her desk... I admired the writer's equipment, the typewriter eraser, the boxes of clean paper. [...] And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> brown envelopes that stories would go off in—and come back in." ...|$|E
2500|$|François Truffaut's Jules and Jim was an {{influence}} on the story arc between the characters Angela, Gerard and Marcus. Director Hudlin explained, [...] "I remember when I saw Jules and Jim when I was a kid, and that awkward, awkward feeling of two guys, one has a better time with girls than the other, and they both {{fall in love with}} the same woman. And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> agony of watching the emotional stakes of that picture. And, this is just a fun movie, not trying to compare myself to Truffaut on any level, but, at least, that's what inspired the moment." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> terrible story <b>I</b> had to tell, for {{in my own}} happiness I {{had forgotten}} everything that went before. I suddenly became grave.|$|R
