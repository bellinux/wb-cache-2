[...] He cut the heavy <b>hemp</b> <b>string</b> with his penknife. [...] "We must look into this thing. I should like to know who's sending {{packages}} to Mrs. Hubbard in my absence." [...] He unfolded the wrappings of paper, growing softer and finer inward, and presently pulled out a handsome square glass jar, through which a crimson mass showed richly. [...] "The Persis Brand!" [...] he yelled. [...] "I knew it!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Franklin {{realized}} {{the dangers of}} using conductive rods and instead used the conductivity of a wet <b>hemp</b> <b>string</b> attached to a kite. This allowed him {{to stay on the}} ground and the kite was less likely to electrocute him. According to the account, Franklin kept the silk string of the kite dry at his son's end to insulate him while the <b>hemp</b> <b>string</b> to the kite was allowed to get wet in the rain to provide conductivity. A house key belonging to Benjamin Loxley was attached to the <b>hemp</b> <b>string</b> and connected to a Leyden jar; a silk string was attached to this, held by Franklin's son William who flew the kite (while standing inside a doorway to keep himself and the silk string dry). Franklin assumed that the Leyden jar would accumulate electricity from the lightning. The kite was not struck by visible lightning; had it done so, Franklin would almost certainly have been killed. [...] However, Franklin did notice that loose threads of the kite string were repelling each other and deduced that the Leyden jar was being charged. He moved his hand near the key and observed an electric spark, proving the electric nature of lightning.|$|E
5000|$|Experimental {{reconstruction}} of tools used in prehistoric mining is often written about {{in conjunction with}} the tools use after the process of firesetting. [...] The experimental mining tool assemblage are primarily made up of hammerstones and antler picks that are reconstructed using willow and hazel sticks, rawhide, and <b>hemp</b> <b>string</b> to implement various hafting techniques and methods of utilization.|$|E

50|$|Sansevieria is a genus {{of about}} 70 species of {{flowering}} plants, native to Africa, Madagascar and southern Asia. Common names include mother-in-law's tongue, devil's tongue, jinn's tongue, bow <b>string</b> <b>hemp,</b> snake plant and snake tongue. It is often {{included in the}} genus Dracaena; in the APG III classification system, both genera are placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae). It has also been placed in the former family Dracaenaceae.|$|R
25|$|In kyudo, or Japanese archery, {{it may be}} used as an {{alternative}} to more expensive <b>hemp</b> for bow <b>strings.</b> It {{is one of the main}} materials used for paraglider suspension lines. It is used as an inner lining for some bicycle tires to prevent punctures. In table tennis, plies of Kevlar are added to custom ply blades, or paddles, in order to increase bounce and reduce weight. Tennis racquets are sometimes strung with Kevlar. It is used in sails for high performance racing boats.|$|R
50|$|The oldest phase at Jiahu only {{contains}} two flutes, which are tetratonic and pentatonic; the middle phase at Jiahu contains several flutes, including an interesting pair of hexatonic flutes. One of the flutes was broken, {{and the other}} flute {{seems to be a}} replica of the first flute, as it shows evidence of adjustments made to match the pitch of the first. Innovations in the last phase include the use of heptatonic flutes. The flutes were cut, smoothed at the ends, polished and finally drilled with a row of holes on one side. One of the broken flutes was repaired by drilling fourteen tiny holes along the breakage lines and then tying the sections together with <b>hemp</b> <b>string.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The diptych {{consisted}} of two small flat faces, joined by a hinge. [...] Diptychs usually folded into little flat boxes suitable for a pocket. The gnomon was a string between the two faces. When the string was tight, the two faces formed both a vertical and horizontal sundial. These were made of white ivory, inlaid with black lacquer markings. The gnomons were black braided silk, linen or <b>hemp</b> <b>string.</b> With a knot or bead on the string as a nodus, and the correct markings, a diptych (really any sundial large enough) can keep a calendar well-enough to plant crops. A common error describes the diptych dial as self-aligning. This is not correct for diptych dials consisting of a horizontal and vertical dial using a string gnomon between faces, no matter {{the orientation of the}} dial faces. Since the string gnomon is continuous, the shadows must meet at the hinge; hence, any orientation of the dial will show the same time on both dials.|$|E
50|$|Dom Pérignon (1638-1715) was a monk and {{cellar master}} at the Benedictine abbey in Hautvillers. He pioneered {{a number of}} {{winemaking}} techniques around 1670—being the first to blend grapes {{in such a way}} as to improve the quality of wines, balance one element with another in order to make a better whole, and deal with a number of their imperfections; perfecting the art of producing clear white wines from black grapes by clever manipulation of the presses; enhancing the tendency of Champagne wines to retain their natural sugar in order to naturally induce secondary fermentation in the spring; being a master at deciding when to bottle these wines in order to capture the bubble. He also introduced corks (instead of wood), which were fastened to bottles with <b>hemp</b> <b>string</b> soaked in oil in order to keep the wines fresh and sparkling, and used thicker glass in order to strengthen the bottles (which were prone to explode at that time). The development of sparkling wines as the main style of production in Champagne occurred progressively in the 19th century, more than a century after Dom Pérignon's death.|$|E
6000|$|... "My Lord and Earl of Eglintoune (who dwells {{within the}} space of one mile to the said burgh) having come to the said burgh at the earnest request of the said justices, for giving to them of his lordship's countenance, {{concurrence}} and assistance, in trying of the foresaid devilish practices, conform to {{the tenor of the}} foresaid commission, the said John Stewart, for his better preserving to the day of the assize, was put in a sure lockfast booth, where no manner of person might have access to him till the downsitting of the Justice Court, and for avoiding of putting violent hands on himself, he was very strictly guarded and fettered by the arms, as use is. And upon that same day of the assize, about half an hour before the downsitting of the Justice Court, Mr. David Dickson, minister at Irvine, and Mr. George Dunbar, minister of Air, having gone to him to exhort him to call on his God for mercy for his bygone wicked and evil life, and that God would of his infinite mercy loose him out of the bonds of the devil, whom he had served these many years bygone, he acquiesced in their prayer and godly exhortation, and uttered these words:--"I am so straitly guarded that it lies not in my power to get my hand to take off my bonnet, nor to get bread to my mouth." [...] And immediately after the departing of the two ministers from him, the juggler being sent for at the desire of my Lord of Eglintoune, to be confronted with a woman of the burgh of Air, called Janet Bous, who was apprehended by the magistrates of the burgh of Air for witchcraft, and sent to the burgh of Irvine purposely for that affair, he was found by the burgh officers who went about him, strangled and hanged by the cruik of the door, with a tait of <b>hemp,</b> or a <b>string</b> made of <b>hemp,</b> supposed to have been his garter, or string of his bonnet, not above the length of two span long, his knees not being from the ground half a span, and was brought out of the house, his life not being totally expelled. But notwithstanding of whatsoever means used in the contrary for remeid of his life, he revived not, but so ended his life miserably, by the help of the devil his master.|$|R
