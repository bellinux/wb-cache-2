5|$|A major Brundage {{investment}} was Chicago's La Salle Hotel, {{which had been}} built in 1908. Located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> of The Loop and the city's financial district, Brundage first leased it in 1940, later purchasing it. When the hotel was seriously damaged by fire in 1946, Brundage spent about $2.5 million remodeling and modernizing it. As Brundage made a home there during his time as IOC president, the hotel became famous in international sports as his residence. He sold the hotel in 1970, but later reclaimed it when the purchaser failed to make required payments.|$|E
5|$|AMPK {{probably}} {{also plays a}} role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; the metabolic actions of metformin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> muscle can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E
30|$|Immunohistochemistry for HMGB 1 was {{performed}} to assess whether ethyl pyruvate altered the localization of HMGB 1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> of AVMC mice. As shown in Fig.  4 c, HMGB 1 was predominantly located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nuclei of <b>the</b> cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> of sham mice, whereas HMGB 1 was not only positive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nuclei but also positive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cytoplasm of the cells and extracellular milieu <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> of AVMC mice. This results suggested that CVB 3 induced HMGB 1 translocation from nuclei to cytoplasm and extracellular milieu <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts,</b> {{which is consistent with}} the characteristics of HMGB 1 release. As expected, when compared to AVMC mice treated with RLS, positive staining for HMGB 1 in cytoplasm and extracellular milieu was significantly decreased in AVMC mice treated with ethyl pyruvate (Fig.  4 c), indicating that ethyl pyruvate inhibited release of HMGB 1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> of AVMC mice. Moreover, the levels of HMGB 1 in serum were evaluated by ELISA. As shown in Fig.  4 d, in comparison with sham mice, significant increase of HMGB 1 was detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> serum of AVMC mice (P <  0.001). However, serum HMGB 1 in AVMC mice was reduced by ethyl pyruvate treatment (P <  0.01; Fig.  4 d).|$|R

5|$|After the {{adoption}} of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in November 1947, a civil war erupted in the British Mandate of Palestine. The Jews living in Jerusalem constituted one of the weak points of the Yishuv and a main cause for concern to its leaders. With nearly 100,000 inhabitants, a sixth of the total Jewish population in the Mandate, the city was isolated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> of territory under Arab control.|$|E
5|$|Although Purkinje {{fibers and}} {{the bundle of}} His were {{discovered}} {{as early as the}} 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Heart</b> of a Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, and {{so that she can}} care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers for the first time <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Heart</b> of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, {{but this is the first}} time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E
