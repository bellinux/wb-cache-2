5|$|Some {{observers}} accused Kỳ and Thi {{of either}} allowing or deliberately orchestrating the plot to embarrass Khánh, portray themselves as heroes, and therefore gain prominence {{on the political}} stage. In later years, Cao Huy Thuan, a professor and Buddhist activist based {{in the city of}} Đà Nẵng in I Corps, claimed Kỳ and Thi met with <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days before the coup, and had discussed their plans for joining a coup against Khánh. At the subsequent military trial of Phát and Đức's faction, the plotters were acquitted. According to the historian George McTurnan Kahin, Khánh rigged the trial so that Đức and Phát were acquitted so they would be used as a Catholic counterweight to the Young Turks faction of Kỳ and Thi, who in Khánh's eyes had become increasingly strong and ominous. Khánh decided to build an alliance with the generals from Minh's junta by releasing them from house arrest and recalling them to active roles. However, Thi and Kỳ were aware of the motives for these moves and adjusted accordingly.|$|E
