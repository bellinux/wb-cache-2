5|$|By 1953, the {{lighthouse}} was in poor {{condition and the}} U.S. Coast Guard opted {{to replace it with}} a skeleton tower. The lighthouse was sold to the Fairfield <b>Dock</b> <b>Company,</b> which initially planned to move it ashore, but it was later decided to dismantle and scrap it. A plan existed to move {{the lighthouse}} ashore to a city park as a monument to Connecticut's maritime heritage, but the location could not be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, {{extensive}} docks {{had grown}} up around the Citadel and in 1802 the surrounding land was granted to the Hull <b>Dock</b> <b>Company.</b> The Citadel remained in military use until 1848, by when developments in military technology had made the fortification obsolete. In 1858 there were proposals to turn the site into a public park, but instead the Citadel, including Hull Castle and the South Blockhouse, was demolished in 1864 {{to make way for}} an expansion of the docks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, it was noticed that William S. Grattan was {{showing signs of}} age. Her boilers were only able to operate at 40 percent {{capacity}} and an engine room steam leak in 1951 injured part of her crew. During November 1952, William S.

5|$|From 1927 to 1942, Kasuga {{was used}} as a {{training}} vessel for navigators and engineers. On 27 July 1928 she rescued the crew of the semi-rigid airship N3 after it exploded in heavy weather during fleet maneuvers. In January–February 1934, Kasuga ferried 40 scientists to Truk to observe a total solar eclipse on 14 February. She was hulked and disarmed in July 1942 and used as a floating barracks {{for the rest of the}} Pacific War. Kasuga capsized at her mooring at Yokosuka on 18 July 1945 during an air raid by United States Navy aircraft from TF-38. Her wreck was salvaged in August 1948 and broken up for scrap by the Uraga <b>Dock</b> <b>Company.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April 1889, a {{resolution}} was passed for Millwall to drop 'Rovers' from their name {{and they were}} now playing under the name Millwall Athletic, inspired by their move to their new home The Athletic Grounds. They were founding members of the Southern Football League which they won {{for the first two}} years of its existence, and were runners-up in its third. They were forced to move to a new ground North Greenwich in 1901, as the Millwall <b>Dock</b> <b>Company</b> wanted to use their land as a timberyard. Millwall Athletic reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1900 and 1903, and were also champions of the Western Football League in 1908 and 1909.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{priorities}} of the regeneration was {{the restoration of the}} dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert <b>Dock</b> <b>company</b> appointed Tarmac to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.|$|E

The building was reopened in May 2001 as 'The Assembly at the Pierhead', which was a visitor and education centre for the National Assembly. The exhibition provided visitors with information on the National Assembly. On 1 March 2010, the building was again reopened to the public as a Welsh history museum and exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The five {{locomotives}} {{and spare}} parts acquired by Roger Broggie {{were sent to}} the Tampa Ship Repair & Dry <b>Dock</b> <b>Company</b> in Tampa, Florida, to receive the aesthetic and mechanical restorations necessary to run on the planned Walt Disney World Railroad (WDWRR). At the time, this was the closest facility to the Walt Disney World site in Bay Lake, Florida with the space and equipment needed to accommodate full-size railroad rolling stock. Here Transportation Superintendent Earl Vilmer, who had accompanied Broggie on his trip to Mexico, along with Project Engineer Bob Harpur and the facility's Machinist Supervisor George Britton were tasked with the project's completion.|$|E
5|$|The port {{expanded}} {{greatly in}} the 19th century, with {{the purchase of}} a steam tug in 1819, and the rebuilding of the breakwater in 1822. By this point, three ship building yards had also been established. The construction of the Blyth and Tyne Railway from 1849 allowed coal shipments to quickly expand, reaching 200,000 tons per annum. The Blyth Harbour and <b>Dock</b> <b>Company</b> was created in 1854, but with need for further expansion, it was replaced by a bill of parliament given Royal Assent on 19 June 1882, which constituted the current Blyth Harbour Commission. This allowed additional financing to be raised, for construction of the South Harbour.|$|E

The club was forced to move on again though, this time by the Millwall <b>Dock</b> <b>Company</b> who wanted {{to use it as}} a timberyard. They relocated in 1901 to a location near their second home, which became known as North Greenwich. They remained an east London club for a further nine years, with the last game played on the Isle of Dogs on 8 October 1910 against Portsmouth, which Millwall won 3–1.|$|E
5|$|Gan {{was later}} taken as an {{apprentice}} by Guthrie and Company. He was diligent and capable, and his ability won him the recognition and keen interest of Thomas Scott, one of the partners in the company. Scott {{was one of the}} early British pioneers responsible for developing Tanjung Pagar and the port of Singapore. Gan was subsequently promoted to the post of Assistant Storekeeper and then Chief Storekeeper of the company. In 1874, he became the company's Chief Compradore, a position which he held for the next 25 years. Scott later helped to finance some of Gan's early business ventures, one of which was to supply labour and transport to the Tanjong Pagar <b>Dock</b> <b>Company</b> which helped Gan make most of his personal fortunes.|$|E
5|$|Illinois {{was laid}} down on 10 February 1897 by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry <b>Dock</b> <b>Company</b> of Newport News, Virginia. She was {{launched}} on 4 October 1898, sponsored by Miss Nancy Leiter, daughter of Chicago multi-millionaire Levi Leiter and commissioned on 16 September 1901. The ship's first commander was Captain George A. Converse. Illinois {{was the first}} member of her class to be authorized, but the last to enter service. After commissioning, the ship began a shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay, followed by initial training. She left the area on 20 November to test a new floating dry dock in Algiers, Louisiana. The ship was back in Newport News in January 1902. She served briefly as the flagship of Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans from 15 to 28 February; during this period, she took part in a reception for Prince Henry of Prussia, the brother of the German Kaiser.|$|E

5|$|Passage through Hull {{had long}} been difficult, {{because of the number}} of ships which used the river for loading and {{unloading}} goods. In 1794, the merchants of Beverley had advocated the building of docks at Hull, with a separate entrance, so that traffic to the upper river would not be impeded, while the Driffield Navigation had unsuccessful attempted to get a clause inserted into the Act of Parliament which the Hull <b>Dock</b> <b>Company</b> obtained in 1840, to ensure free passage for vessels, and the removal of tolls for boats not using the docks. The Navigation Company also received complaints from the Beverley and Barmston Drainage Commissioners, who believed that water levels were being kept at a higher level than was good for drainage.|$|E
5|$|The keel for Louisiana {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry <b>Dock</b> <b>Company</b> in Newport News, Virginia on 7 February 1903. Her {{completed}} hull was launched on 27 August 1904, and she was commissioned into the fleet on 2 June 1906. The ship then conducted a shakedown cruise {{off the coast of}} New England before being ordered to Cuba. She left the United States on 15 September with Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Assistant Secretary of State Robert Bacon aboard; they were requested as a peace commission by Cuban President Tomás Estrada Palma to suppress an insurrection in the country. Taft and Bacon helped to create a provisional government, during which time Louisiana remained in Cuba. After their work was completed, Taft and Bacon returned to the ship, which took them back to Fortress Monroe, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|West Conob {{was built}} in 1919 for the , part of the West series of ships—steel-hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort—and was the 14th ship built at Los Angeles Shipbuilding & Dry <b>Dock</b> <b>Company</b> in San Pedro, California. She {{initially}} sailed for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company and circumnavigated the globe twice by 1921. She began sailing to South America for Swayne & Hoyt Lines in 1925, and then, to Australia and New Zealand. When Swayne & Hoyt's operation {{was taken over by}} the Oceanic and Oriental Navigation Company a few years later, she sailed under the name Golden Eagle until 1934, when she was taken over by the Matson Navigation Company for service between Hawaii and the U.S. mainland and renamed Mauna Loa, after the large shield volcano on the Island of Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|William S.

The decision was made to rebuild and in 1930 she was rebuilt at the Buffalo Dry <b>Dock</b> <b>Company</b> of Buffalo, New York. During this refit some improvements were made to William S. Grattan. One improvement was that her boilers were converted from burning coal to burning oil. The engines were rebuilt and her firefighting system was updated and could now handle foam fire retardant. Also, the pilot house was raised to the upper boat deck level and a fixed turret tower with a fire monitor was constructed on the stern of the ship. A fourth fire monitor was added {{to the top of the}} pilot house of the ship as well. As part of her acceptance ceremony she participated in a race against the harbor tug Kentucky, which was considered to be one of the fastest tugs on the Great Lakes.|$|E
25|$|In 1803, an Act of Parliament, {{promoted}} by the East India Company, established the East India <b>Dock</b> <b>Company,</b> {{with the aim of}} establishing a new set of docks (the East India Docks) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India <b>Dock</b> <b>Company</b> merged with the West India <b>Dock</b> <b>Company.</b> The docks were taken over by the Port of London Authority in 1909, and closed in 1967.|$|E

50|$|The {{enclosed}} docks {{were built}} by several rival private companies, notably the East & West India <b>Docks</b> <b>Company</b> (owners of the East India, West India and Tilbury docks), Surrey Commercial <b>Docks</b> <b>Company</b> and London & St Katharine <b>Docks</b> <b>Company</b> (owners of the London, St Katharine and Royal docks). By {{the beginning of}} the 20th century competition and strikes led to pressure for amalgamation. A Royal Commission led to the setting up of the Port of London Authority (PLA) in 1908. In 1909 the PLA took control of the enclosed docks from Tower Bridge to Tilbury, with a few minor exceptions such as Poplar Dock which remained as a railway company facility. It also took over control of the river between Teddington Lock and Yantlet Creek from the City corporation which had been responsible since the 13th century. The PLA head Office at Trinity Square Gardens was built by John Mowlem & Co and completed in 1919.|$|R
