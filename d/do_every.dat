25|$|In 2016, Jewish activists {{pushing for}} a third temple in Jerusalem {{attempted}} to ascend the Temple Mount carrying baby goats intended {{to be used as}} Passover sacrifices on Friday afternoon, as they <b>do</b> <b>every</b> year. Jerusalem police detained ten suspects in the Old City for interrogation, and seized four sacrificial goat kids. Among those arrested were Kach activist Noam Federman, who attempts make the sacrifice every year, and Rafael Morris, an activist in the Temple Mount Faithful movement.|$|E

She started the message by saying she hated all the housemates and that they were the worst people she had ever met, then left the screen.

25|$|In 1977, {{radio station}} WBUR-FM in Boston {{scheduled}} {{a panel of}} local car mechanics to discuss car repairs on one of its programs, but only Tom Magliozzi showed up. He did so well that {{he was asked to}} return as a guest, and he invited his younger brother Ray (who was actually more of a car repair expert) to join him. The brothers were soon asked to host their own radio show on WBUR, which they continued to <b>do</b> <b>every</b> week. In 1986, NPR decided to distribute their show nationally.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} voting in the United States. Even though most {{people say that}} voting is important, and a good {{practice}} for them to <b>do,</b> <b>every</b> year a sub-optimal percentage of Americans turn up to vote, especially in presidential elections (only 51% in the 2000 election). One vote may feel very small {{in a group of}} millions, so people may not think a vote is worth the time and effort. If too many people think this way, there is a small percentage of voter turnout. Some countries enforce compulsory voting to reduce this effect.|$|E

25|$|A new {{consciousness}} of the inequality of American women began sweeping the nation, starting with the 1963 publication of Betty Friedan's best-seller, The Feminine Mystique, which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its creation {{of the notion that}} women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives, mothers, and keepers of the home, and argued that women were just as able as men to <b>do</b> <b>every</b> type of job. In 1966 Friedan and others established the National Organization for Women, or NOW, to act for women as the NAACP did for African Americans.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this was seen when {{scientists}} studied red winged blackbirds. These birds are known for remaining in monogamous relationships {{during the course of}} mating season. During the course of the study, the researchers gave a few select males vasectomies just before mating season. The male birds behaved like they <b>do</b> <b>every</b> season, establishing territory, finding a mate, and attempting to make baby birds. Despite apparent social monogamy, the female birds whose partners were surgically altered still became pregnant, indicating that overt social monogamy did not predict for sexual fidelity. These babies were cared for by their sterile adoptive fathers.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the {{controversy}} surrounding the BCS became a topic of conversation within the United States government. In 2008 U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) had {{said that he would}} hold congressional hearings on the BCS in the future after his Utah team failed to play in the national championship game. Following up on Senator Hatch's actions in the Senate, in April 2011 the Attorney General of Utah announced that he would be initiating a class action anti-trust lawsuit against the BCS, despite the fact that Utah is joining to the Pacific-10 Conference, which is an automatic qualifying conference. In May 2011 the U.S. Justice Department {{sent a letter to the}} NCAA asking for a detailed explanation about why FBS football was the only NCAA sport that the NCAA did not 1) have a playoff system in place to determine a champion and 2) why the NCAA had abrogated its responsibility to do so and given the authority to determine the NCAA Champion to an outside group such as the BCS. The Justice Department's investigation and Utah Attorney General's lawsuit are both aimed at forcing the BCS to open its books, which they are as a non-profit required to <b>do</b> <b>every</b> year and have never done, and at determining whether the BCS is an illegal trust or cartel based on Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, the Clayton Anti-Trust Act of 1914 and the Robinson-Patman Anti-Price Discrimination Act. Two more states Attorneys General are said to be considering joining the Utah lawsuit, and the investigation by the Justice Department will probably include a minute and extensive examination of the Fiesta Bowl Scandal as well as conducting complete audits of the other BCS Bowls, the BCS itself and possibly even the schools of the 6 BCS Automatic Qualification Conferences.|$|E

500|$|The pared-down {{approach}} {{can also be}} seen in the way the business is run. Carlson maintains a staff of only four people to run his restaurant – himself and three other chefs.

500|$|The saxaul sparrow's nests are untidy {{dome-shaped}} constructions, with {{an entrance}} {{in the side}} or top. They are built of grasses, roots, and other plant materials, and are lined with feathers, fur, and soft plant material. The nest is mainly built by the female, though the male may actively take part in building. Typical clutches have five or six eggs, and two clutches a year are normal. Eggs are broad and ovular, slightly pointed at an end. They are glossy, coloured white and shaded with rusty grey or yellowish brown. In some clutches, one egg is noticeably paler than the others. Four eggs collected by Zarudny from Transcaspia had an average size of [...] Females play the main part in incubating eggs, and males can often be seen guarding the nests during incubation.
