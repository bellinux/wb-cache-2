40|$|Not {{only have}} {{different}} mammals different periods of gestation {{but they are}} born in very unequal degrees of development. These facts have constantly to be borne in mind when observations made upon the physiology of <b>the</b> embryo <b>in</b> one form are compared with those made in another form. To take an example: the sheep, though it has {{a longer period of}} gestation than the dog and a shorter one than man, is born in a much more developed condition than either. I am indebted to my colleague, Prof. H. A. Harris, for the information on which the following calculation is made. If the ossification of the distal end of the femur be taken as a standard, this takes place 30 <b>days</b> after insemination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rat, 46 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> guinea pig, 74 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dog and cat and 98 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sheep and goat.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the efficacy and safety of frequently inhaled nebulized hypertonic saline (HS) in infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. One hundred and twenty-six infants were randomized to receive either nebulized 3 % hypertonic saline (HS) or 0. 9 % normal saline (NS), but only 112 patients completed the whole study. Cough, wheezing, pulmonary physical signs, clinical severity scores and the hospital length of stay (LOS) were recorded. The wheezing remission time was 4. 8 ± 1. 0 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NS group and 3. 6 ± 0. 9 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HS group (p < 0. 01). The cough remission time was 5. 5 ± 0. 9 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NS group and 4. 3 ± 0. 7 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HS group (p < 0. 01). The moist crackles disappeared at 6. 2 ± 0. 7 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NS group and at 4. 4 ± 0. 9 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HS group (p < 0. 01). The clinical severity scores decreased more significantly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HS group than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NS group on each day within 96 h after enrolment (p < 0. 01). The LOS decreased from 6. 4 ± 1. 4 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NS group to 4. 8 ± 1. 2 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HS group (p < 0. 01). The treatment was well tolerated, with no adverse effects attributable to nebulized HS. The conclusions are that frequently inhaled HS relieved symptoms and signs faster than NS, and shortened LOS significantly for infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis, without apparent adverse effects...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the report}} of my study on the preoviposition period, egg {{maturation}} and resorption of the ovarian eggs of Tetrastichus sugitamabae Yasumatsu et Yoshii, an important larval parasite of Contarinia inouyei Mani. This work was carried out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory from June of 1964 to May of 1965. The material (twigs of Cryptomeria tree) haboring galls of Contarinia inouyei was collected at Iino in Miyazaki Prefecture and kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rearing boxes to get <b>the</b> larval parasites <b>in</b> question. <b>The</b> emerged females of the parasite were fed with honey and water in separate vials with males or without males. The following results were obtained. The female of this parasite is synovigenic and the egg is anhydropic. The preoviposition period lasts approximateley 4 <b>days</b> after emergence <b>in</b> all generations. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first generation, the oviposition period is about 11 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mated female and 6 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> virgin female. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second generation, this period is 16 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mated female and 13 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> virgin female, while 26 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> virgin female of the overwintering generation. The mean number of the mature and half-mature eggs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ovary of the mated female is more than that found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> virgin female <b>in</b> all generations. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> oviposition period, {{the mean number of}} the mature eggs is not constant. It seems to be due to a difference of the rate of egg maturation and resorption. In mated fem a les rapid resorption occurs from about 16 <b>days</b> after emergence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first generation and 21 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second generation. <b>In</b> virgin females it occurs from about 11 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first generation, 18 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second generation and 31 <b>days</b> after emergence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overwintering generation.
