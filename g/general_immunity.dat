"Very {{recently}} {{this dangerous}} {{enlargement of the}} meaning of the phrase 'emancipation of woman' has been fortified with a strange advocacy by the female 'champions of their sex.' Their argument runs this way: 'We are denied a voice in the making of the laws relating to infliction of the death penalty; it is unjust to hold us to an accountability to which we have not assented.' Of course this argument is as broad as the entire body of law; it amounts to nothing less than a demand for <b>general</b> <b>immunity</b> from all laws, for to none of them has woman's assent been asked or given. But let us consider this amazing claim with reference only to the proposal in the service and promotion of which it is now urged: exemption of women from the death penalty for murder.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether {{children who have}} had measles have reduced <b>general</b> cell mediated <b>immunity</b> three years later compared with vaccinated children who have not had measles. DESIGN: Historical cohort study. SETTING: Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. SUBJECTS: 391 children aged 3 - 13 years who were living in Bissau during a measles epidemic in 1991 and still lived there. These included 131 primary cases and 139 secondary cases from the epidemic and 121 vaccinated controls with no history of measles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>General</b> cell mediated <b>immunity</b> assessed by measurement of delayed type hypersensitivity skin responses to seven recall antigens. Anergy {{was defined as a}} lack of response to all antigens. RESULTS: 82 out of 268 cases of measles (31 %) were anergic compared with 20 of the 121 vaccinated controls (17 %) (odds ratio adjusted for potential confounding variables 2. 2 (95 % confidence interval 1. 2 to 4. 0); P 0. 009). The prevalence of anergy was higher in secondary cases (33 % (46 / 138)) than in primary cases (28 % (36 / 130)), although this difference was not significant. Anergy was more common in the rainy season (unadjusted prevalence 31 % (91 / 291) than in the dry season (11 % (11 / 98)) (adjusted odds ratio 4. 8 (2. 2 to 10. 3)).

Angelic judges would be undisturbed by extraneous influences and angelic journalists would not seek to influence them.

At Athens all resident aliens had to pay a tax (metoikion or xenikon telos) which we may term protection-tax, because it was the price for the protection they enjoyed at Athens; but as it was the interest of the state to increase commerce, and for that purpose to attract strangers to settle at Athens, many of them were exempted from this tax, i. e. enjoyed the ateleia metoikiou, (isoteleia equal rights) (Dem. c.Aristae): p. 691), and some were even exempted from custom duties, and the property tax or eisphora from which an Athenian citizen could never be exempted. The ateleia enjoyed by Athenian citizens was either a <b>general</b> <b>immunity</b> (ateleia apanton), such as was granted to persons who had done some great service to their country, and even to their descendants, as in the case of Harmodius and Aristogeiton; or it was a partial one exempting a person from all or certain liturgies, from certain custom duties, or from service in the army. The last of these immunities was legally enjoyed by all members of the [...] council of the Five Hundred (Lycurg. c.
