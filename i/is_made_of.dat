5|$|Since baryons are {{composed}} of quarks, they participate in the strong interaction. Leptons, on the other hand, are not composed of quarks and as such {{do not participate in}} the strong interaction. The most famous baryons are the protons and neutrons that make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe, whereas electrons, the other major component of atoms, are leptons. Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle known as an antibaryon in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> two up quarks and one down quark, while its corresponding antiparticle, the antiproton, <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.|$|E
