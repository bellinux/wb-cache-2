It had been booked in, that they were coming in to record their next single, and write it, with us. It was at Whitfield Street Studios and there was going to be an MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. Well, <b>how</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> can you possibly do this?

500|$|Meanwhile, {{efforts to}} stop the merger were stepped up at Reading by Roger Smee, a former Reading player, {{born and raised in}} the town, who had become a millionaire in the {{construction}} industry. Smee, who strongly opposed the merger plan, had read the club's accounts the previous year, and so was aware of how the team's stock was allocated. He knew that Waller and his boardroom allies, Leslie Davies and John Briggs, had not held a controlling interest in the club in 1982 and that a large number of Reading shares had then been noted as unissued. His interest was therefore piqued when the Thames Valley Royals deal was declared [...] "irrevocable" [...] on the basis that Waller's faction controlled the majority of the shares in Reading. [...] "A year ago they didn't have a majority," [...] Smee later said, [...] "so <b>how</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> have they issued these shares to themselves while Reading was a public company? That would be against the law." [...] Smee contacted Roy Tranter, a director at Reading who opposed the merger, and Tranter's legal team filed a complaint with the High Court objecting to the sale of the unissued shares.|$|E
500|$|Tomb Raider was {{critically}} acclaimed. In a 'world exclusive' review, GamesMaster magazine {{gave the}} game {{a score of}} 90%, {{as well as the}} [...] "GamesMaster Gold award" [...] (awarded to games that manage a score of 90% or above). The editor regarded the quality of the visuals, the length and depth of the gameplay, and the [...] "spectacular" [...] last third of the game as the highlights. The summary said [...] "sitting back exhausted we were left with just one question dribbling forth from our gaping jaws. <b>How</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> are they going to top this in the sequel? Because of one thing there can be no doubt. Lara is back." [...] IGN's Keza MacDonald also spoke extremely positively, stating that they felt the game was [...] "exciting" [...] and [...] "beautifully presented", included [...] "great characterization" [...] and [...] "more depth than you would expect". They gave the game an overall score of 9.1 out of 10, the highest score they have given a game in the series since 1996's Tomb Raider, describing it as [...] "amazing" [...] and concluding that the game [...] "did justice" [...] to both the character and franchise. Ryan Taljonick of GamesRadar lauded the location's setting and environment, and expressed that [...] "not one area ever feels like a rehash of another". Taljonick also felt that the game had great pacing, and that it is [...] "unrivaled by any other game in the genre". Furthermore, the reviewer considered Lara's character development as [...] "an integral part" [...] of the whole game's experience, and concluded that Tomb Raider [...] "is a fantastic game and an excellent origin story for one of gaming's original treasure seekers". Australian TV show Good Game praised the game: it was rated 10/10 by both hosts, becoming the eighth game in the show's seven-year run to do so. Giant Bomb gave the game four stars out of five, stating that [...] "Tomb Raiders tone is somewhat at odds with its action, but the reborn Lara Croft seems primed for a successful new adventuring career".|$|E

2500|$|Scavenius {{boarded a}} train {{and headed for}} Berlin, where he arrived on Monday 24 November. The next crisis came when he was met by Renthe-Fink, who {{informed}} him that Ribbentrop had informed Fink {{that there had been}} a [...] "misunderstanding" [...] regarding the four clauses and that clause 2 would be deleted. This had specified that Denmark only had police-like obligations. Scavenius had a strict mandate not to change a sentence and stated that he would be unable to return to Copenhagen with a different content from the one agreed upon, but that he was willing to reopen negotiations to clarify the matter further. This reply enraged Ribbentrop (and rumours claim that he was considering ordering the SS to arrest Scavenius). The task fell to German diplomat Ernst von Weizsäcker to patch up a compromise. He watered down the wording but left the content pretty intact. Nonetheless, for Scavenius it was a strong setback that the four clauses would now only get the status of a unilateral Danish declaration (...) with a comment on it by Fink that its content [...] "no doubt" [...] was in compliance with the pact. Furthermore, he was instructed to give a public speech while abstaining from mentioning the four clauses but only making general statements about Denmark's status as a neutral nation. Scavenius signed the pact. At the following reception, the Italian ambassador described Scavenius as [...] "a fish dragged on land ... a small old gentleman in a suit asking himself <b>how</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> he got to this place". Lidegaard comments that the old man remained defiant: during a conversation with Ribbentrop in which the latter complained about the [...] "barbarous cannibalism" [...] of Russian POWs, Scavenius rhetorically asked if that statement meant that Germany didn't feed her prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|Glass later {{stated in}} his {{autobiography}} Music by Philip Glass (1987) that the new music performed at Pierre Boulez's Domaine Musical concerts in Paris lacked any excitement for him (with the notable exceptions of music by John Cage and Morton Feldman), but he was deeply impressed by new films and theatre performances. His move away from modernist composers such as Boulez and Stockhausen was nuanced, rather than outright rejection: [...] "That generation wanted disciples and as we didn't join up it was taken to mean that we hated the music, which wasn't true. We'd studied them at Juilliard and knew their music. <b>How</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> can you reject Berio? Those early works of Stockhausen are still beautiful. But there was just no point in attempting to do their music better than they did and so we started somewhere else." [...] He encountered revolutionary films of the French New Wave, {{such as those of}} Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut, which upended the rules set by an older generation of artists, and Glass made friends with American visual artists (the sculptor Richard Serra and his wife Nancy Graves), actors and directors (JoAnne Akalaitis, Ruth Maleczech, David Warrilow, and Lee Breuer, with whom Glass later founded the experimental theatre group Mabou Mines). Together with Akalaitis (they married in 1965), Glass in turn attended performances by theatre groups including Jean-Louis Barrault's Odéon theatre, The Living Theatre and the Berliner Ensemble in 1964 to 1965. These significant encounters resulted in a collaboration with Breuer for which Glass contributed music for a 1965 staging of Samuel Beckett's Comédie (Play, 1963). The resulting piece (written for two soprano saxophones) was directly influenced by the play's open-ended, repetitive and almost musical structure and was the first {{one of a series of}} four early pieces in a minimalist, yet still dissonant, idiom. After Play, Glass also acted in 1966 as music director of a Breuer production of Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children, featuring the theatre score by Paul Dessau.|$|E

30|$|Even {{before the}} {{discovery}} of complex organic matter on Solar System bodies, many researchers had hypothesized a significant influence of extraterrestrial material {{for the development of}} life <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> (Orò 1961; Urey 1962). Essentially there are two theories <b>on</b> <b>how</b> life <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> has originated. For the first theory, life <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> has an endogenous abiogenic origin. Therefore, the primitive Earth conditions have promoted the formation of organic molecules from simple molecules. This theory is confirmed by Miller-Urey experiments (Miller 1953) in which small molecules such as H 2 O, CH 4, NH 3 and H 2, lead to the formation of several amino acids. According to the second theory, life <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> has developed thanks to an exogenous input from extraterrestrial material. This theory asserts that an important role in evolution of life is played by extraterrestrial prebiotic molecules, arrived <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> through meteorites delivery (Orò 1961; Chyba et al. 1990; Berstein et al. 1999).|$|R
