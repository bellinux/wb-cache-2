The 1972 Watergate disclosures, it is true, were made by only a score {{of the members of the}} mass media, but I remember Teapot Dome when only one of our 1,750 dailies (the Albuquerque Morning Journal) dared to tell the truth about White House corruption.

500|$|Retrospective reviews on Impossible Princess—both from European and Australasian areas—have {{been much}} more positive, with AllMusic's Chris True {{labelling}} it a [...] "pretty damn good record", and openly criticised the critical reception around the album's early release, deeming it a [...] "shame". Nevertheless, he believed that [...] "Unlike Minogue's early work, this album sounds stronger and has a more natural feel. Her songwriting abilities <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way,</b> and Impossible Princess actually flows together as an album." [...] Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani awarded it four stars, and {{was impressed with the}} album's [...] "starkly personal and unified cord", saying it [...] "is the work of an artist willing to take risks, not a pop queen concerned with preserving her reign." [...] Cinquemani added it to the staff choices of their Vital Pop: 50 Essential Pop Albums lists. Awarding four stars, Nick Levine from British tabloid Digital Spy commended the mixture of genres and Minogue's input. Although he noticed the material's lack of commercial appeal, he concluded, [...] "Brave, revealing and rarely less than surprising, it's a key piece in the trickier-than-you-think jigsaw puzzle that is Kylie Minogue's recording career." [...] While reviewing her tenth album X (2007), Evan Sawdey from PopMatters commented [...] "For those who still have a copy of her Manic Street Preachers-assisted Impossible Princess, then you have one of the most crazed, damn-near perfect dance-pop albums ever created." ...|$|E

On 24 October 2012, the group performed an acoustic {{version of the}} song during an online interview for SBTV on Ustream. The performance received praise by the band's fans on Twitter. Irish radio station Spin South West complimented the performance, [...] "Little Mix are killing it , not many pop stars could do this!" [...] Alicia Adejobi of Entertainment Wise praised the version, writing, [...] "Little Mix are not just an ordinary girl band, they can sing live, perform an acapella and even beat-box." [...] Little Mix performed the single live on the ninth season of The X Factor on 11 November 2012. The group performed the song backed by a troupe of dancers and wore matching black trousers, gold and blue tops with military jackets with ammunition belts. Little Mix's mentor during their time on The X Factor, Tulisa Contostavlos, praised the performance: [...] "You're professional, you're all on point and confident now." [...] Spin South West said that the performance manifested why Little Mix won the competition in 2011. Emily Sheridan of the Daily Mail positively reviewed the performance as well, writing, [...] "The group <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> since [...]" [...] The group performed [...] "DNA" [...] on 13 November 2012 for BBC's Live Lounge. On 23 November 2012, Little Mix performed an acoustic version of the song on ITV show Loose Women. In December 2012, the song was performed by the group at the Jingle Bell Ball and a Radio City 96.7 gig without Perrie Edwards who was suffering from tonsillitis at the time. During the Radio City performance, the group wore 1990s-inspired stonewashed denim outfits. Lucy Buckland of the Daily Mail positively reviewed the performance, [...] " [...] crowds with 'DNA' {{and their ability to}} carry off so much jean action in 2012." [...] Buckland went on to praise their look during the performance, describing it as [...] "glam." [...] She also commended, [...] "the girls seem to be doing a good job without [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Hagen {{delivered}} {{a speech at}} a convention of the independent Christian organisation Levende Ord, where he stated that [...] "we Christians are very much concerned with children. Jesus said, let the small children come to me. I can't understand that Muhammad could have said the same. In the case {{that he could have}} said the same, it would have been: Let the small children come to me, so that I can exploit them in my struggle to Islamify the world." [...] He also said that if Israel lost the fight in the Middle East, Europe would [...] "bow under to Islam," [...] if Muslim fundamentalists get it as they want. [...] "They have, {{in the same manner as}} Hitler, long ago made it clear that the long-term plan is to Islamify the world.

2500|$|Kent's hockey {{tradition}} {{began on}} a flooded field that had frozen over in 1910 and has continued until today with over 100 seasons. The {{team and the}} program <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> in that time, too. The first team consisted of only eight players who, after some practice, borrowed some football pants to play their first game against the Berkshire School, a team that Kent continues to compete against today. In the following seasons, the team would clear an area next to Macedonia Brook that would flood and freeze over, calling it Pater's Pond for the school's headmaster and founder. This makeshift rink is still used for Pond Hockey games today. Eventually, the school built its first proper hockey rink, the Manuel Nadal Rink, naming it for the team's first coach. When girls began coming to Kent, they started their own hockey program and the two teams have shared the Nadal Rink ever since. Nowadays, both the girls and boys teams compete in the Founders League, noted {{as one of the}} most competitive high school leagues in the country, and [...] have had many successes, with each team winning the 2014 Founders League Championship.|$|E
