5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, passive fire {{protection}} remains inactive in the coating system until a fire occurs. There are mainly two types of PFP: intumescent fire protection and vermiculite fire protection. In vermiculite fire protection, the structural steel members are covered with vermiculite materials, mostly a very thick layer. This is a cheaper option as compared to an intumescent one, but is very crude and aesthetically unpleasant. Moreover, if the environment is corrosive in nature, then the vermiculite option is not advisable, as {{there is the possibility}} of water seeping into it (because of the porous nature of vermiculite), and there it is difficult to monitor for corrosion. Intumescent fireproofing is a layer of paint which is applied along with the coating system on the structural steel members. The thickness of this <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> is dependent on the steel section used. For calculation of DFT (dry film thickness) a factor called Hp/A (heated perimeter divided by cross sectional area), referred to as [...] "section factor" [...] and expressed in m−1, is used. Intumescent coatings are applied as an intermediate coat in a coating system (primer, intermediate, and top/finish coat). Because of the relatively low thickness of this <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> (usually in the 350- to 700-micrometer range), nice finish, and anti-corrosive nature, intumescent coatings are preferred on the basis of aesthetics and performance.|$|E
40|$|<b>Intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> fire {{protection}} on steel structures is becoming widely {{popular in the}} UK and Europe. The current assessment for the {{fire protection}} performance method using the standard fire resistance tests is not accurate, owing to the reactive behaviour of <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> at elevated temperature. Moreover, the available <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> temperature assessment method provided in the Eurocode for structural steel at elevated temperature does not incorporate the steel beam's behaviour and/or assessment for partial protection and/or damaged protection. The research work presented provides additional information. on the assessment of partial and/or damaged <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> at elevated temperature. In {{the scope of the}} investigation on the thermal conductivity of <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating,</b> {{it was found that the}} computed average thermal conductivity was marginally sensitive to the density and emissivity at elevated temperature. However, the thermal conductivity was found to be reasonably sensitive to the differences in initial dft's (dry film thicknesses). In this research, a numerical model was developed using ABAQUS to mimic actual indicative test scenarios to predict and establish the temperature distribution and the structural fire resistance of partial and/or damaged <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> at elevated temperatures. <b>Intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> actively shields when the charring process occurs when the surface temperature reaches approximately 250 °C to 350 °C. Maximum deflection and deflection failure times for each damage scenario were analyzed by applying specified loading conditions. It was also found that the structural fire resistance failure mode of <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> on protected steel beams was particularly sensitive to the applied boundary conditions. Careful selection of nodes in the element was necessary to avoid numerical instability and unexpected numerical error during analysis. An assessment of various numerical models subjected to a-standard fire with partially protected 1 mm <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> was analysed using ABAQUS. An available unprotected test result was used as a benchmark. The outcome suggests that the fire resistances of the beams were found to be sensitive to the location of the partial and/or damage protection. The overall fire resistance behaviour of <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> at elevated temperature was summarized in a 'typical deflection regression' curve. An extensive parametric analysis was performed on localized <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> damage with various <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> thicknesses between 0. 5 mm to 2. 0 mm. It was found that the average deflection was linear for the first 30 mins of exposure for all the variables, damage locations and intumescent thicknesses. It was concluded that a thicker layered <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> may not be a better insulator or be compared to a much less thick <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> at elevated temperature. The use of passive fire protection, however, does enhance the overall fire resistance of the steel beam, in contrast to a naked steel structure. The research work investigated the <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> behaviour with different aspects of protection and damage and the outcome of the assessment provided a robust guide and additional understanding of the performance of <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> at elevated temperature.

40|$|The {{presented}} {{research paper}} deals with analytical method {{to determine the}} thermal conductivity of porous material (<b>intumescent</b> <b>coating)</b> where the main objective is to assess whether {{it is possible to}} treat the voids in <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> as having a uniform diameter. Considering the nature of <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating,</b> the mechanisms of its fire retardant properties are expansion and heat absorption. A predictive model should therefore include prediction of expansion behaviour, energy and mass conservation based on both physical and chemical behaviour, and also thermal conductivity of the coating. A 3 -D analytical model will be developed to determine the thermal conductivity of <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating.</b> Finite Element simulations using ABAQUS also will be performed to assess the influence of different pore size distributions. The results of this numerical study indicate that, given the same porosity, the overall thermal conductivity of the porous structure is very close to that with uniform distribution of pores of the dominant size.

Fireproofing provides two types of protection: ablation or dissipation of heat by burn-off and "intumescence" or swelling; the coating swells to about five times its original size, forming a protective blanket of char which retards transfer of heat to the metal structure preventing loss of structural strength and possible collapse which would compound the fire fighting problem...|$|R

SiN was synthesized via a sol–gel process and characterized by 29 Si-nuclear magnetic resonance. This <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> system lowered the thermal stability of the cotton due to the catalyzed effect on degradation, but significantly improved the char formation. In a vertical flame test, fabrics coated with 15 bilayers (BLs) of SiN–PA extinguished the flame immediately upon removing the ignition source, while untreated cotton was completely burned out. Cone calorimeter data revealed that 15 BL-coated cotton resulted in a 31 % and 38 % reduction in peak heat release rate and total heat release, respectively, relative to those of the uncoated control. This superior fire retardant performance is believed to be attributed to the formation of intumescent char layer on fibers that could effectively inhibit the oxygen and heat permeation when burning. In addition, as evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results, the increased amount of inflammable gases and the decreased amount of flammable gases during the degradation of coated cotton fabrics was another important factor to improve the flame resistance.

40|$|In the {{collaborative}} forum Positive footprint housing® Riksbyggen is building the Viva residential quarter, {{which is a}} sustainability project at the very forefront of what is possible with contemporary construction. The idea is that this residential quarter should be fully sustainable in ecological, economic and social terms. Since 2013, a number of pilot studies have been completed {{under the auspices of}} the Viva project framework thanks to financing from the Swedish Energy Agency. The various building frame alternatives that have been evaluated are precast concrete, cast in-situ concrete and solid wood, all proposed by leading commercial suppliers. The report includes a specific requirement for equivalent functions during the use phase of the building, B. An interpretation has been provided that investigates the building engineering aspects in detail, as well as an account of the results based on the social community requirements specified in Viva, durability, fire, noise and energy consumption in the Swedish National Board of Building, Planning and Housing building regulations (BBR), plus Riksbyggen’s own requirements, Sweden Green Building Council’s Environmental Building Gold (Miljöbyggnad Guld) and 100 -year life cycle. Given that the alternatives have different long-term characteristics (and also that our knowledge of these characteristics itself varies), these functional requirements have been addressed by setting up different scenarios in accordance with the EPD standard EN 15978. Because Riksbyggen has specified a requirement for a 100 -year life cycle, we have also opted for an analysis period of 100 years. The results show no significant differences between concrete and timber structures for the same functions during the life cycle, either for climate or for primary energy. The minor differences reported are accordingly less than the degree of uncertainty involved in the study. The available documentation on the composition of the relevant <b>intumescent</b> paint <b>coating</b> on solid wood frames differs from source to source, so it was not possible to fully allow for the significance of this. The LCA has not included functional changes in the building linked to load-bearing characteristics, noise, moisture, health or other problems that may result in increased maintenance and replacement. The concrete houses have been dimensioned for 100 years, for instance, in accordance with tried and tested standards and experience. The solid wood house is not dimensioned in the same way, and this has led to us having to assume various scenarios. The results also show the following:   • The uncertainties involved in comparing different structures and alternative solutions are very significant. The results are affected by factors such as life cycle, the functional requirements taken into consideration, transportation, design and structural details, etc.   • Variations in the built items and a considerable degree of uncertainty in the assumptions make it difficult to obtain significant results on comparisons. Only actual construction projects with known specific data, declared from a life cycle perspective that takes into account actual building developer requirements and involving different scenarios (best, documented and worst-case) for the user stage can currently be compared.   • In the other hand, comparisons restricted to different concrete structures only, or to different timber structures only, ought to involve a lower degree of uncertainty, These would then provide results that are significant as well as improvement requirements that are relevant.   • There is potential for improving concrete by imposing requirements on the material   • There is potential for improving solid wood frames by developing and guaranteeing well-documented long-term characteristics for all functional requirements.   The LCAs were performed as an iterative process where all parties were given the opportunity to submit their viewpoints and suggestions for changes during the course of the work. This helped ensure that all alternatives have been properly thought through. Because, during the project, Riksbyggen opted to procure a concrete frame, in the final stage the researchers involved focused on ensuring the procurement process would result in the concrete frame as built meeting the requirements set out above. As things currently stand, the material requirements for the concrete are limited by the production options open to the suppliers, and this is therefore being investigated in the manufacture of precast concrete frames for the Viva cooperative housing association. ...|$|R

The coating applied to the exterior of loaded weapons has increased the time-to-detonation from three minutes for the unprotected weapon to 10 - 13 minutes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBauxsol™ (BX) is {{a refined}} alumino-silicate waste {{derived from the}} brine {{neutralization}} of bauxite residue (BR). Due to this brine treatment, Bauxsol™ contains hydrotalcite-like minerals {{in addition to the}} zeolitic minerals, metal oxides and hydroxides found in bauxite residue. In this work, investigations are carried out to determine the effect of Bauxsol™ addition on the fire performance of an Ammonium Polyphosphate-based epoxy <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> system. Surface imaging, thermal analysis, elemental and phase analyses of the material were carried out using Field Emission Scanning Microscope, Thermogravimetric Analysis, X-ray Florescence Spectroscope and X-ray Diffraction respectively. Fire performance of the system was evaluated with Bunsen burner test for heat shielding capacity. The fire behavior was subsequently analyzed using the generated heat curves and thermogravimetric curves of the systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{charring}} {{rate and}} the char yield have been determined for specimens of pine sapwood treated with 15 different inorganic and organic chemicals, many of them known as effective flame retardants, and compared with data for un-treated wood. Retentions of 1, 5 and 15 % were used. At most, the charring rate was reduced by 17 % for impregnated wood (a phosphonate). At 1 % retention, no significant effects were obtained. The char yield was increased by 100 - 150 % at 15 % retention for some chemicals, but the increase was lower at lower reten-tions. The relationship between charring rate and char yield was different for different chemicals. Key words: char yield, charring rate, fire retardants, <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating,</b> wood...|$|E
40|$|Results {{of solving}} {{problems}} of simulating temperature fields in domains with movable boundaries of characteristic zones of intensive physical-chemical and thermomechanical transformations {{to be realized}} in materials upon high-temperature heating have been presented. Intumescent fire-protective coatings based on organic and mineral materials are the object of study. Features of numerical realization of input equation systems taking into account, in particular, a dynamics of considerable increase and subsequent decrease of the intumescent layer thickness have been considered. Example calculations for structures of metal and wood protected with various coatings are given. Results of calculating two-dimensional temperature fields in polymer composite square-shaped structures with internal cruciform load-bearing elements have been presented. The <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> is arranged on the external surface of a structure. The solution of the above-listed problems is of important significance to provide fire protection of different-purpose structures and products...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{mathematical}} models {{to predict the}} thermal resistance of polymer-based, intumescent coatings are reviewed and their limitations are discussed. A mathematical model is derived to describe the developing temperature profile across an <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> when exposed to a radiant heat source. The model includes the effects of: the endothermic and exothermic reactions; convective heat transfer as degradation gases are transported through the coating; radiation heat transfer across the developing porous solid; {{and the increase in}} thermal resistance as gases are formed and the coating expands. The model predictions are compared with experimental data from the heating of epoxy-based and vinyl acetate-based intumescent coatings in a cone calorimeter. A sensitivity analysis is performed to show the effect of the thermal characteristics of the coating on the thermal resistance of the material. The application of the model to newly developed intumescent coatings is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A thermal {{response}} mathematical model for an <b>intumescent</b> <b>coating</b> system is developed. The model predicts indepth temperature {{profiles of the}} solid {{as a function of}} the fundamental kinetic, mass, and heat-transfer properties of the original coating system. In the model, swelling is based on an empirical function of the paint's weight loss. The model is used to describe the effectiveness of the coating for thermal protection. Using the {{thermal response}} time at the backface of the material as a criterion, a sensitivity analysis is made with respect to variation in individual properties, such as total expansion, to provide a guide for designing improved intumescing agents. The sensitivity analysis shows that total expansion and rate of expansion, along with other material properties, are important parameters for providing thermal protection. Finally, backface temperature histories are predicted and compared to experimental data obtained from a representative fire environment. Predicted temperatures agree within a maximum error of plus or minus 20 %...|$|E
