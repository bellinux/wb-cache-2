5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of the optic nerve known as the chiasm, which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the outer side of the visual field on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the optic nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. Visual acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a visual field defect. The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve <b>is</b> <b>affected.</b> If the part of the nerve between the eye and the chiasm is compressed, the result is vision loss in one eye. If the part after the chiasm <b>is</b> <b>affected,</b> visual loss on one side of the visual field occurs.|$|E
