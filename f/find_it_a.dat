US beach volleyball player Gabrielle Reece described the bikini bottoms as uncomfortable with constant [...] "yanking and fiddling." [...] Many female beach volleyball players have suffered injuries by over-straining the abdominal muscles while {{many others have}} gone through augmentation mammoplasty to look appealing in their uniforms. Australian competitor Nicole Sanderson said about match break entertainment that [...] "it's kind of disrespectful to the female players.

You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes." ...|$|E

500|$|Andree Farias of Christianity Today {{gave the}} album a two-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, Farias praised Mark Hall's lyrical style and the album's lyrical concept and themes, but he criticized the music as being [...] "meandering melodies and an all-too-solemn disposition" [...] and said [...] "core fans will {{undoubtedly}} support this album, but those expecting the vitality and radio-friendliness of the band's previous releases will <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> relatively challenging listening experience". Justin Mabee of Jesus Freak Hideout gave it two-and-a-half out of five stars, calling the lyrical content [...] "slightly better [...] " [...] but deriding the music as [...] "more of the same".|$|E
500|$|Waters {{was drawn}} to the Victorian era because of the (mis)understandings of what social norms existed during the period. As she stated, [...] "I <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> {{fascinating}} period because it feels very close to us, and yet in lots of ways it is utterly strange: many of the things we think we know about it are stereotypes, or simply wrong." [...] Considering herself part of gay and lesbian literary heritage, Waters was influenced by Oscar Wilde, and Chris Hunt, who wrote Street Lavender, an historical novel with gay male themes also set in the Victorian era. She has stated that Tipping the Velvet is a female version of Street Lavender, with a plot similar to My Secret Life by [...] "Walter".|$|E
500|$|McCay first {{proposed}} a strip {{in which a}} tobacco fiend finds himself at the North Pole, unable to secure a cigarette and a light.

[...] The Herald asked McCay to make a series of the strip, but with a Welsh rarebit theme instead of tobacco, and McCay complied. [...] The strip appeared in a Herald subsidiary, the Evening Telegram, and the Heralds editor required McCay to use a pseudonym for the strip work to keep it separate from his other work. [...] McCay signed Rarebit Fiend strips as [...] "Silas", a name he borrowing from a neighborhood garbage cart driver. [...] After switching to William Randolph Hearst's New York American newspaper in 1911, McCay dropped the [...] "Silas" [...] pseudonym and signed his work with his own name.|$|E

500|$|Countdown to Extinction {{received}} generally {{positive reaction}} from critics. Spin {{wrote that the}} album [...] "may just be the finest thrash metal album ever made, although purists may <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> bit too polished and easy to swallow". AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey said that [...] "Megadeth guns for arena thrash success and gets it on Countdown to Extinction". However, Huey noted the simplification of Megadeth's sound on the album in response to Metallica's commercially successful self-titled album released the previous year. Sputnikmusic reviewer Mike Stagno praised Mustaine's vocals {{as well as a}} number of the album's tracks. Despite calling this effort [...] "Megadeth's first step into the world of mainstream music", he also noted that [...] "the band still maintains its identity". Reflex described the sound as [...] "impressively clean, streamlined, and sharp, brimming with killing riffs". They highlighted the vocal delivery on the record, saying [...] "Mustaine's never sounded more confident, verbally and vocally".|$|E
500|$|Cliff White of NME {{called the}} album [...] "almost a voyeur's delight", {{and was not}} {{favorable}} of Gaye's sensual themes, stating [...] "Although getting down, getting mellow, and getting it on are paramount considerations {{in the privacy of}} my own home, I don't particularly want to be party to someone else's night life. Not on record anyway... Like peeking through the windows of the Gaye residence in the wee wee hours. Perhaps that's your kick, but personally I <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> mite frustrating." [...] White also criticized the album's sound, describing the songs as [...] "all expressions of the same mood. Sensual, satisfied, and spaced out", and calling I Want You [...] "simply the explorative aftermath of Let's Get It On. The sweet nuthin's of a drowsy, sweat-streaked lover." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote favorably of the album's sound quality. However, he criticized the lyrical content, as well as Ware's involvement in songwriting, stating [...] "was it Ware who instructed Marvin to eliminate all depth and power from his voice? I mean, if you're into insisting on sex it's in bad taste to whine about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Kenney also {{insisted on}} {{speaking}} to the pilots himself, overriding Jones' protestations {{that it was an}} internal RAAF matter, and threatened to appear on behalf of the pilots should they be court-martialled. Jones sacked the Air Officer Commanding No. 1 TAF, his former No. 4 Squadron comrade Harry Cobby, along with two of Cobby's staff. In what may have been a reaction to Kenney's threat, Jones insisted that the subsequent inquiry before Justice John Vincent Barry focus not only on the attempted resignations but on reports of alcohol trafficking on Morotai. While no action was taken against the pilots over the mutiny directly, two of the RAAF's best-known aces, Group Captain Clive Caldwell and Wing Commander Bobby Gibbes, were court-martialled for their involvement in the alcohol racket and reduced in rank. Although Barry did not <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> significant factor, the Jones–Bostock conflict was also blamed for contributing to the poor morale that precipitated the [...] "mutiny". One of the other participants, Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, told the inquiry: [...] "I deplore the fighting and wrangling between them which is common knowledge throughout the Air Force. Every week there are instances of it." ...|$|E

500|$|Ultimately, [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] {{was both}} a {{commercial}} and critical disappointment despite Disney's efforts; the song has been met with generally negative reviews from music critics, who dismissed it as standard and uninspired. Jerry McCulley of Amazon.com described [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] as [...] "a serviceable slice of modern R boilerplate". Although AllMusic's Jonathan Widran believed that the song could potentially become a [...] "pop hit", he ultimately dismissed it as [...] "fairly generic Diane Warren-written fare." [...] In Billboard, radio personality Charles Karel Bouley agreed that the song is [...] "average pop fare" [...] while acknowledging its Top 40 potential. Film Score Monthlys Lukas Kendall strongly disliked the ballad, writing, [...] "The less said about...'Where the Dream Takes You,' the better." [...] James Barry of Soundtrack.net wrote, [...] "If I had to pick something to dislike, it'd be the song 'Where the Dream Takes You'" [...] because [...] "it suffers from sounding like so much other disposable end-credits music." [...] Telenet's Thomas Glorieux opined that the song [...] "fails to even stir up the attention because I <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> very ordinary song." ...|$|E
500|$|On 4 December 2008, Che premiered at Miami Beach's Byron Carlyle Theatre, {{as part of}} the Art Basel Festival. Taking {{place only}} a few miles from Little Havana, which is home to the United States' largest Cuban American community, the invitation-only {{screening}} was met with angry demonstrators. The organization Vigilia Mambisa, led by Miguel Saavedra, amassed an estimated 100 demonstrators to decry what they believed would be a favorable depiction of Guevara. Saavedra told reporters from the El Nuevo Herald that [...] "you cannot offend the sensitivities of the people", while describing the film as [...] "a disgrace". A supporter of the demonstration, Miami Beach's mayor Matti Herrera Bower, lamented that the film was shown, while declaring [...] "we must not allow dissemination of this movie". When asked days later about the incident, Del Toro remarked that the ability to speak out was [...] "part of what makes America great" [...] while adding [...] "I <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> little weird that they were protesting without having seen the film, but that's another matter". For his part, Soderbergh later stated that [...] "you have to separate the Cuban nationalist lobby that is centered in Miami {{from the rest of the}} country".|$|E
500|$|That same year, deHavilland {{made two}} more period films, {{beginning}} with The Great Garrick, a fictional romantic comedy about the 18th-century English actor's encounter with jealous {{players from the}} Comédie-Française who plot to embarrass {{him on his way}} to Paris. Wise to their prank, Garrick plays along with the ruse, determined to get the last laugh, even on a lovely young aristocrat, deHavilland's Germaine Dupont, whom he mistakenly believes {{to be one of the}} players. With her refined demeanor and diction, deHavilland delivers a performance that is [...] "lighthearted and thoroughly believable", according to Judith Kass. Variety praised the film, calling it [...] "a production of superlative workmanship". Despite the positive reviews, the film did not do as well at the box office. Her final film that year was Michael Curtiz's romantic drama Gold Is Where You <b>Find</b> <b>It,</b> <b>a</b> film about the late 19th-century conflict in the Sacramento Valley between gold miners and their hydraulic equipment and farmers whose land is being flooded. DeHavilland played the daughter of a farmer, Serena Ferris, who falls in love with the mining engineer responsible for the flooding. The film was released in February 1938, and was her first appearance in three-strip Technicolor.|$|E

500|$|Upon the film's {{theatrical}} release, Richard Roeper wrote, [...] "This is a {{very tough}} film to watch, especially for Beatles fans that worshipped Lennon, but it does provide a thought-provoking take on {{the inner workings of}} Mark David Chapman's twisted mind." [...] San Francisco Chronicles Joel Selvin praised Schaefer's direction writing, [...] "The film is impressively mounted and Schaefer has made a directorial debut of distinction, but it is an uncomfortable ride from the opening scenes of Chapman arriving in New York to the inevitable, inexorable final scene." [...] He also called Leto's performance utterly convincing. Rex Reed gave the film a positive review writing, [...] "Even if you are only moderately curious about the events that led up to the pointless death of a musical icon, I think you'll <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> film of arm-twisting fascination." [...] He praised Leto calling him unforgettable and writing, [...] "it is the pulverizing concentration and almost somnambulistic intensity of Jared Leto that gives the film its life and pulse." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B saying, [...] "Chapter 27 is far from flawless, but Leto disappears inside this angry, mouth-breathing psycho geek with a conviction that had me hanging on his every delusion." [...] Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News described Chapter 27 as [...] "a claustrophobic drama that gets uncomfortably into the head of Mark David Chapman," [...] and praised Leto saying, [...] "Leto's drawling, blotchy, creepy performance sets it apart." ...|$|E
