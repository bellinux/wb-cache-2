25|$|The Judiciary Law {{states that}} all litigants (who {{have the right}} to a jury trial) {{have the right to}} juries {{selected}} from a fair cross section of the community and that all eligible citizens shall have both the opportunity and the obligation to serve. Potential jurors are randomly selected from lists of registered voters, holders of a driver's licenses or ID issued by the Division of Motor Vehicles, New York state income tax filers, recipients of unemployment insurance or family assistance, and from volunteers. The <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> organized pursuant to article 190 of the Criminal Procedure Law.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> a pre-{{constitutional}} {{common law}} institution, and a constitutional fixture {{in its own}} right exclusively embracing common law. The process applies to the states {{to the extent that the}} states have incorporated grand juries and/or common law. Most states have an alternative civil process. [...] "Although state systems of criminal procedure differ greatly among themselves, the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> similarly guaranteed by many state constitutions and plays an important role in fair and effective law enforcement in the overwhelming [...] majority of the States." [...] Branzburg v. Hayes (No. 70-85) 1972. Grand juries, which return indictments in many criminal cases, are composed of a jury of peers and operate in closed deliberation proceedings; they are given specific instructions regarding the law by the judge. Many constitutional restrictions that apply in court or in other situations do not apply during grand jury proceedings. For example, the exclusionary rule does not apply to certain evidence presented to a grand jury; the exclusionary rule states that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth or Sixth amendments cannot be introduced in court. Also, an individual does not have the right to have an attorney present in the grand jury room during hearings. An individual would have such a right during questioning by the police while in custody, but an individual testifying before a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> free to leave the grand jury room to consult with his attorney outside the room before returning to answer a question.|$|E

2500|$|In Pennsylvania, {{the purpose}} of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> to {{recommend}} charges. The grand jury hears cases in full but does not have the authority to indict. [...] In the case of Jerry Sandusky, the grand jury investigation began in 2009 under then Attorney General and eventual Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett. [...] This was Pennsylvania's 30th Statewide Investigating Grand Jury. They subpoenaed records from both Penn State and the Second Mile and heard testimony from Victim 1 (Aaron Fisher), Mike McQueary, Joe Paterno, Tim Curley, Gary Schultz, Victim 7, Graham Spanier, Victim 4, and Ronald Petrosky (PSU Janitor). This grand jury did not recommend indictment.|$|E
2500|$|A grand jury, {{a type of}} jury now {{confined}} {{almost exclusively}} to federal courts and some state jurisdictions in the United States, determines whether there is enough evidence for a criminal trial to go forward. Grand juries carry out this duty by examining evidence presented to them by a prosecutor and issuing indictments, or by investigating alleged crimes and issuing [...] A <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> traditionally larger than and distinguishable from the petit jury used during a trial, usually with 12 jurors. It is not required that a suspect be notified of grand jury proceedings. [...] Grand juries {{can also be used}} for filing charges {{in the form of a}} sealed indictment against unaware suspects who are arrested later by a surprise police visit.|$|E
2500|$|In {{criminal}} law in federal courts and {{a minority of}} state court systems of the United States, a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> convened to hear only testimony and evidence {{to determine whether there}} is a sufficient basis for deciding to indict the defendant and proceed toward trial. [...] In each court district where a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> required, a group of 16–23 citizens holds an inquiry on criminal complaints brought by the prosecutor to decide whether a trial is warranted (based on the standard that probable cause exists that a crime was committed), in which case an indictment is issued. In jurisdictions where the size of a jury varies, in general the size of juries tends to be larger if the crime alleged is more serious. [...] If a grand jury rejects a proposed indictment the grand jury's action is known as a [...] "no bill." [...] If they accept a proposed indictment, the grand jury's action is known as a [...] "true bill." [...] Grand jury proceedings are ex parte: only the prosecutor and witnesses who the prosecutor calls may present evidence to the grand jury and defendants are not allowed to present mitigating evidence or even to know the testimony that was presented to the grand jury, and hearsay evidence is permitted. [...] This is so because a grand jury cannot convict a defendant. [...] It can only decide to indict the defendant and proceed forward toward trial. [...] Grand juries vote to indict in the overwhelming majority of cases, and prosecutors are not prohibited from presenting the same case to a new grand jury if a [...] "no bill" [...] was returned by a previous grand jury. [...] A typical grand jury considers a new criminal case every fifteen minutes. [...] In some jurisdictions, in addition to indicting persons for crimes, a grand jury may also issue reports on matters that they investigate apart from the criminal indictments, particularly when the grand jury investigation involves a public scandal. [...] Historically, grand juries were sometimes used in American law to serve a purpose similar to an investigatory commission.|$|E
