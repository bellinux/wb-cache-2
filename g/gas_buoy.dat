This book spotlights research on marine disaster prevention systems related to incidents involving oil tankers and offshore platforms, approaching these problems from new scientific and technological perspectives. The most essential aspect of this book {{is the development of}} a deep-sea underwater robot for real-time monitoring of blowout behavior of oil and gas from the seabed and of a new type of autonomous surface vehicle for real-time tracking and monitoring of oil spill spread and drift on the sea surface using an oil sensor. The mission of these robots is to provide the simulation models for gas and oil blowouts or spilled oil drifting on the sea surface with measured data for more precision of predictions of oil and gas behavior. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{development of the}} marine environment {{has resulted in the}} introduction of man-made structures (MMS) in the North Sea. These structures range from oil and <b>gas</b> platforms, <b>buoys,</b> wrecks to wind turbines, offering additional artificial habitat over predominantly soft-sediment areas. The expected effects from MMS in shallow shelf seas will modify benthic communities over various spatial and temporal scales with repercussions for overall ecosystem functioning. Research on large offshore structures have identified a suite of unique effects ranging from biodiversity changes with repercussions on local ecosystem functioning to the provision of habitat for fouling communities, acting as stepping stones and many other ecological modifications. Consequently, MMS might induce structural, functional and process-driven changes, which are different from those expected in natural soft bottom benthic systems. This study considers soft-sediment and introduced hard-substrate epifouling communities. The combination of these systems provides a unique ecological opportunity to ascertain biodiversity changes triggered by loss and gain of species provided by the addition of MMS. To date, our current understanding of how ecological functioning might be modified by the addition of these MMSs is still in its infancy. Our current analysis aimed at evaluating functional changes with a combination of biological traits analysis and energy flow changes calculated via modelled secondary production. Further, our study compared the different types of introduced MMS among the natural soft sediment communities, disentangling how the ecological functioning of the macrobenthos may be altered by the introduction of these structures, which provides improved concepts for current monitoring assessments...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between surface bubble composition and gas flux {{to the atmosphere}} was examined at Coal Oil Point seep field, which is located about 3 km offshore of Santa Barbara County, CA in the Santa Barbara Channel. The field research was conducted using a spar buoy designed to simultaneously measure the surface <b>gas</b> flux, the <b>buoy’s</b> position with differential GPS, and collect gas samples. Results show that the gas composition varies by 10 - 20 % at sub-seeps within seep areas. The nitrogen mole fraction correlated directly with oxygen mole fraction (R 2 = 0. 94) and inversely with methane mole fraction (R 2 = 0. 97). These data demonstrate that the bubble composition is modified by gas exchange during ascent from the seafloor: dissolved air enters and hydrocarbon gases leave the bubbles. While compositional differences were observed at sub-seeps, there was no {{relationship between}} flux and composition. Factors other than seep intensity controls the amount of gas transfer between the ocean water and bubbles. Therefore, when calculating the atmospheric source function of specific gases such as methane or ROGs from marine seeps, {{it is best to}} use mean compositional values determined for bubbles collected near the sea surface...|$|R

40|$|A few {{extremely}} halophilic Archaea (Halobacterium salinarum, Haloquadratum walsbyi, Haloferax mediterranei, Halorubrum vacuolatum, Halogeometricum borinquense, Haloplanus spp.) possess gas vesicles that bestow buoyancy on the cells. Gas vesicles {{are also}} {{produced by the}} anaerobic endospore-forming halophilic Bacteria Sporohalobacter lortetii and Orenia sivashensis. We have extensive information on the properties of gas vesicles in Hbt. salinarum and Hfx. mediterranei and the regulation of their formation. Different functions were suggested for <b>gas</b> vesicle synthesis: <b>buoying</b> cells towards oxygen-rich surface layers in hypersaline water bodies to prevent oxygen limitation, reaching higher light intensities for the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, positioning the cells optimally for light absorption, light shielding, reducing the cytoplasmic volume leading to a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio (for the Archaea) and dispersal of endospores (for the anaerobic spore-forming Bacteria). Except for Hqr. walsbyi which abounds in saltern crystallizer brines, gas-vacuolate halophiles are not among the dominant life forms in hypersaline environments. There only has been little research on gas vesicles in natural communities of halophilic microorganisms, and the few existing studies failed to provide clear evidence for their possible function. This paper summarizes {{the current status of}} the different theories why gas vesicles may provide a selective advantage to some halophilic microorganisms...|$|R

The frequency dependent nature of compressional waves in the gas-rich Holocene sediments of coastal Louisiana is examined in this study. Velocity and attenuation data, obtained at frequencies of 1, 3, 5, and 7 kHz from a cross well experiment, were used to test theoretical equations describing compressional-wave velocity and attenuation in gas-rich sediment. The cross well data were augmented with velocities derived from a nearby seismic refraction station, and were correlated with regional seismic velocity measurements. Results from tomographic modeling indicate that gas-induced low-velocities are present to depths of approximately 40 m, and average 912 m/s for a clay-peat zone and 1100 m/s for the bulk sediment. Signal attenuation in the clay-peat zone was 1. 45 dB/m at 1 kHz, 1. 57 dB/m at 3 kHz, 2. 95 dB/m at 5 kHz, and 3. 24 dB/m at 7 kHz. In the bulk sediment, attenuation values were 0. 57 dB/m (1 kHz), 1. 28 dB/m (3 kHz), 1. 68 dB/m (5 kHz), and 2. 12 dB/m (7 kHz). Forward models constructed from these data indicate gas volumes of 25 % to 35 % of the sediment pore space in the clay-peat zone, and 12 % to 20 % for the bulk sediment. Compressional-wave velocities were measured at 37 sites in the Mississippi River Delta Plain using the seismic refraction method. Cross-sections constructed from standard reverse-spread profiling indicate that the velocity within the upper 40 - 70 m of the sedimentary section ranges from 800 to 1300 m/s. These values were corroborated by velocities determined from uphole travel-time measurements for two nearby seismic-reflection profiles totaling 90 km in length. In terms of subsidence potential, this study has shown that the volume of biogenic methane gas can be as much as 20 % of the total sediment volume, and most likely averages 10 % throughout the delta plain region. The trapped <b>gas</b> acts to <b>buoy</b> overlying sediment against subsidence. Any quick-release triggering mechanism for the gas, such as trenching, digging canals, or extensive drilling could cause localized increases in subsidence rates. A 3 to 4 m drop in elevation would occur if all the gas in a 60 -m-thick section were quickly released...|$|R
