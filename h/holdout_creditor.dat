40|$|The {{market for}} {{sovereign}} debt {{differs from the}} market for corporate debt in several important ways including the risk of opportunistic default by sovereign debtors, the importance of political pressures, {{and the presence of}} international development organizations. Moreover, countries are subject to neither liquidation nor standardized processes of debt reorganization. Instead, negotiations between a sovereign debtor and its creditors lead to a voluntary restructuring of the sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s debt. One of the greatest difficulties in restructuring claims against sovereign debtors is balancing the interests {{of the majority of the}} creditors with those of minority <b>creditors.</b> <b>Holdout</b> <b>creditors</b> serve as a check on opportunistic defaults and unreasonable restructuring terms, yet their presence can interfere with the restructuring process. In this Article, we examine the role of <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors</b> within the context of the international capital markets. In particular, we consider the effect of a litigation remedy on the power of <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors</b> to influence current restructurings of sovereign debt. Recent commentators have criticized <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors</b> and proposed mechanisms designed to reduce their power-particularly their power to enforce contractual claims against sovereign debtors through litigation. We argue that these proposals may undervalue the role of <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors</b> in facilitating the restructuring process and in promoting the functioning of the international capital markets. Accordingly, we suggest that, prior to the implementation of broad reforms, the value of holdouts be tested through a market-based approach. We propose several modifications to the terms of agreements governing sovereign bonds that can be tested in the market as a mechanism for assessing the value of holdout litigation in the international financial architecture...|$|R

The need to intervene at national level to restrict the activities of distressed debt funds is questioned, on the basis of recent evolutions both in the sovereign debt market (introduction of collective action clauses) and in the legal framework of such debt (among others the tightening up of the enforcement immunity granted to central bank assets). On this basis, it is submitted that creditor litigation is more a nuisance than an obstacle.

40|$|The {{external}} debt of emerging market sovereign borrowers is now {{mainly in the}} form of bonds held by numerous institutional and individual bondholders. Many of these bonds are governed by the law of the state of New York. As a matter of drafting convention, bonds for sovereign issuers governed by New York law prohibit amendments to the payment terms of the instruments (the amount and the due dates of payments) without the consent of each affected bondholder. If a sovereign issuer finds it necessary to seek a restructuring of its bond indebtedness, it must therefore implement the restructuring by offering to exchange its old bonds for new debt instruments that reflect the new financial terms; a technique that inevitably risks leaving behind 2 ̆ 2 holdout 2 ̆ 2 creditors who may refuse to accept the proposed restructuring. Holdouts pose a litigation threat to the sovereign and may even jeopardize the sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s ability to service the new bonds it has issued to the other creditors participating in the exchange. A number of ideas - ranging from international bankruptcy codes and stays of creditor legal remedies administered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to reforming the explicit terms of sovereign bond contracts - have been suggested as a means of dealing with the <b>holdout</b> <b>creditor</b> threat. This article suggests a less radical, and more immediately applicable, alternative; allowing the majority creditors to use the amendment clauses in their existing bonds to change certain nonpayment terms contained in those bonds (such as financial covenants or waivers of sovereign immunity) as a means of encouraging prospective holdouts to participate in the exchange. Because the sovereign issuer solicits the consent of its creditors to amend the old bonds just as those lenders exchange their bonds for the sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s new debt instruments, this techinque is referred to as an 2 ̆ 2 exit 2 ̆ 2 consent...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Among various {{attempts}} to achieve swift and orderly sovereign debt restructuring (“SDR”), {{the approach to}} include collective action clauses (“CACs”) in bond contracts has been widely adopted. CACs are expected to reduce the holdout litigation risk as they allow a specified supermajority of creditors to impose changes to the restructuring terms on <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors.</b> Meanwhile, SDR faces a new chal-lenge {{in the sphere of}} the law on foreign investment: recent investment arbitration tribunal decisionsonSDRopened thegate to investment treaty arbitration for <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors.</b> Investment arbitration has potential to surpass the contractual restrictions set by CACs and therefore undermine the primary purpose of CACs {{to reduce the risk of}} holdout litigation. Thismay cause delay in the SDRprocess,which is not in the best interest of either the creditors or the debtor state’s economic recovery. The protection of foreign investments should be, therefore, balanced against the need for a swift SDR. Against this background, this article argues that a way to achieve the balance is to set limits on the use of investment treaty arbitration by <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors,</b> and defaults and restructurings of international bonds and/or the implementation o...|$|R

5000|$|The {{possibility}} that <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors</b> can attach future payments on restructured debt and receive better treatment than cooperating creditors distorts incentives and can derail efforts for a cooperative restructuring. It {{is likely to}} be of particular importance in cases in which the creditors are being asked to accept substantial debt and debt service reduction. However, it is unclear given the special circumstances of the Elliot case whether it will be broadly applicable to holdouts in other restructurings. The new Argentine government elected in late 2015 gave indications of its willingness to negotiate with the set of thousands of <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors.</b> The Argentine situation has increased awareness of the utility of Collective Action Clauses in preventing or reducing holdout complications in debt restructuring.|$|R
40|$|The rise of {{vulture fund}} {{investing}} in sovereign bonds has created additional hurdles to successful restructuring in an already fragile ad hoc process. Recent litigation in NML Capital, Ltd. v. Argentina has proven courts’ willingness to utilize powers of equity {{to enforce a}} ratable payment interpretation of the pari passu clause—the equal treatment provision commonly found in sovereign bond contracts—creating much uncertainty on how the ruling will affect future restructuring efforts. By looking to the tension in interpretations of the pari passu clause, discrepancies in remedial relief awarded, and international institutions’ proposed solutions, this Note analyzes {{the role of the}} pari passu clause as a tool for <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors</b> to disrupt restructurings. This Note argues for a contractual solution targeted at preventing vulture fund investors from access to pari passu injunctive relief coupled with creative restructuring strategies for outstanding bonds awaiting maturity. This resolution seeks to retain some protection for traditional <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors</b> while disincentivizing investments made with intent to derail restructurings from the start. Unlike debtors in the domestic bankruptcy system, sovereigns have no overarching mechanism to facilitate a successful restructuring when their debt burden becomes unsustainable. Using the pari passu clause as a means to enjoin payment to restructured bondholders leaves sovereign debtors with little recourse but to cede to the demands of <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors</b> and can have a devastating long-term impact on the sovereign’s capacity to rebuild debt sustainability. On the other hand, removing pari passu injunctive relief strips <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors</b> of a valuable enforcement mechanism and can leave sovereigns unrestrained. This Note balances these concerns by advocating for a solution that diminishes vulture creditor leverage that can obstruct a restructuring, while otherwise preserving creditor rights against unfair or coercive exchange terms...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of “holdouts” in recent sovereign debt swaps poses {{a challenge to}} bargaining models which assume all creditors to be homogeneous.

We use a two-creditor example to illustrate that a key strategic motivation of creditors in an unstructured negotiation environment is the desire to wait until others have settled, in an attempt to extract a larger settlement and show that this motivation is stronger, and expected delay is increased, as the number of creditors increases. We then use a three player example to demonstrate that collective action eliminates the strategic holdout motivation for delay, while introducing a free-rider motivation: each creditor prefers the others to incur the costs of negotiating for the collective. A perhaps surprising result is that this motivation can be su ¢ ciently strong, that it causes an increase in expected delay. We illustrate the exibility of our approach by applying the model to secondary markets for creditors and to the issue of credit vultures...|$|R
40|$|According to the World Bank, {{decentralization}} {{of government}} is a pivotal force that will shape global development policy in the twenty-first century. Subnational debt restructuring has {{emerged as one of}} decentralization 2 ̆ 7 s most difficult problems.

In a prior article, I argued that an international convention for sovereign debt restructuring based on several universal principles of bankruptcy reorganization law can effectively address these concerns for nations. In this Article, I argue that similar principles can be applied even more easily to the financial problems of subnational governments. To this end, I propose a model law based on these principles that might form the foundation for national laws, informed by local political and legal culture.

40|$|The {{pari passu}} clause is found in nearly every {{sovereign}} debt contract issued throughout the globe. In the private context, this clause is well understood to ensure fair distributions to all creditors {{in the event of}} bankruptcy and liquidation.

40|$|Sovereign debt crises occur {{regularly}} and often violently. Yet {{there is no}} legally and politically recognized procedure for restructuring the debt of bankrupt sovereigns. Procedures of this type have been periodically debated, but so far been rejected, for two main reasons. First, countries {{have been reluctant to}} give up power to supranational rules or institutions, and creditors and debtors have felt that there were sufficient instruments for addressing debt crises at hoc. Second, fears that making debt easier to restructure would raise the costs and reduce the amounts of sovereign borrowing in many countries. This was perceived to be against the interests of both the providers of both creditors and major borrowers. This report argues that both the nature and our understanding of sovereign debt problems have changed, {{over the course of the}} last decade, in a direction that creates a much stronger case for an orderly sovereign bankruptcy regime today than ten years ago. Pre-crisis policy mistakes are now recognized to be a much more severe problem for borrowing countries than the costs or limited availability of private financing. Recent court rulings – particularly a recent U. S. ruling that gives 2 ̆ 2 <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors</b> 2 ̆ 2 that decline a restructuring offer the right to interfere with payments to the creditors that accept such an offer. This will complicate efforts to resolve future debt crises on an ad hoc basis. Finally, sovereign debt crises are no longer just a problem in emerging markets, but a core concern in advanced countries as well – particularly in the Euro area. If the Euro is to survive, this will require both better ways to resolve debt crises and stronger, market-based incentives that prevent debt problems from occurring in the first place. To address these problems, policy proposals are presented at two levels: for the Euro area, and globally. A Euro area sovereign debt restructuring regime could be developed by amending the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). This would both restrict the scope for lending to highly indebted countries without also restructuring their debts, and protect Euro area members receiving ESM financial assistance from legal action by <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors.</b> At the global level, a number of proposals are discussed, ranging from a coordinated introduction of 2 ̆ 2 aggregate collective action clauses 2 ̆ 2 that would allow a supermajority of bondholders across all bonds to amend bond payment terms to an amendment of the IMF articles that would limit the legal remedies of holdouts when a debt restructuring proposal has been accepted both by a majority of creditors and endorsed by the IMF...|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{international}} framework to regulate sovereign debt restructuring, investment arbitration has recently been seen as a potential forum for <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors</b> and vulture funds to seek to enforce sovereign debt instruments. However, the system of investment arbitration was not designed to enforce financial obligations, and even less to provide an avenue for the claims of speculative hedge funds and non-cooperative creditors. To date, however, most investment tribunals have found jurisdiction over sovereign debt disputes. Notwithstanding a few arbitration decisions, the consideration of human rights issues in international investment arbitration has so far remained rather {{on the periphery of the}} international investment law regime. Given the deep and broad human rights implications of debt crises, the report of the Independent Expert argues that it would be a dangerous development if bilateral investment treaties became a forum for solving sovereign debt disputes. While the international community is making great efforts to prevent or minimize holdout litigation, investment arbitration may open a new door for such creditors to deploy disruptive strategies. The current system of investment arbitration may therefore impair economic recovery and undermine State funding for public services and State institutions that give effect to economic, social, cultural rights and the protection of civil and political rights...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in sovereign capital market, {{such as the}} debt crises in Eurozone, the massive restructuring by Greece, and the escalated tension between Argentina and its <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors,</b> have brought Collective Action Clauses (CACs) back to limelight. These clauses in sovereign bond contracts are claimed to address the coordination problem among creditors and thus enable a more orderly restructuring process, and previous researches have found little cost of carrying these “insurances” for debtor countries. In this research, I revisit the cost question through a replication method and new evidence made available by the Eurozone CACs mandate, and I examine the actual efficacy of CACs by surveying the 22 sovereign bond restructurings since 1970, on which {{there has been little}} empirical analysis as I am aware of. My analysis finds that Euro CACs with the aggregation feature are associated with little but positive addition to borrowing cost, and riskier investments with lower credit rating and longer maturity are subject to higher CACs premium. At the same time, CACs have not significantly affected the outcome of restructurings after controlling for other factors such as creditor structure, haircut, and government coerciveness. This cost-benefit analysis lead me to conclude that although CACs do not lead to substantially higher borrowing cost – even the “Super CACs” with the aggregation feature, including them does not necessarily guarantee a more orderly restructuring, and thus more dramatic reforms may be necessary if further improvement in the restructuring process is desired...|$|R
40|$|Unresolved {{sovereign}} debt problems and disruptive litigation are hurting debtor nations and their citizens, {{as well as}} their creditors. A default can also pose a serious systemic threat to the international financial system. Yet the existing “contractual” approach to {{sovereign debt}} restructuring, including the use of so-called collective action clauses, is insufficient to solve the holdout problem; recent empirical research indeed shows a drastic rise in sovereign debt litigation by <b>holdout</b> <b>creditors.</b> And the political economy of treaty-making makes a multilateral “statutory” approach highly unlikely to succeed in the near future. This article, prepared at the invitation of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) for presentation at its 50 th Anniversary Congress, shows why a model-law approach to sovereign debt restructuring should be realistic and effective. Nations and even subnational jurisdictions could individually enact a model law as their internal law, and contracts governed by that law would thereby become governed by the model law. Choice of law thus gives a model-law approach a powerful multiplier effect. A model-law approach could also solve the problem of pari passu clauses and address the critical need for a financially troubled nation to obtain liquidity during its restructuring process. The article proposes a form of Sovereign Debt Restructuring Model Law, which has been vetted in discussions with leading experts worldwide and also embraces the Basic Principles on Sovereign Debt Restructuring Processes adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. At the very least, pursuing the Model Law in parallel to other approaches would help to develop norms for a sovereign debt restructuring legal framework that goes beyond mere contracting...|$|R
