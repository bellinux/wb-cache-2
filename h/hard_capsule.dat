40|$|A new {{institutional}} {{clinical trial}} assessed {{the improvement of}} sleep disorders in 40 children with autism treated by immediate-release melatonin formulation in different regimens (0. 5  mg, 2  mg, and 6  mg daily) for one month. The objectives of present study were to (i) prepare low-dose melatonin <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> for pediatric use controlled by two complementary methods and (ii) carry out a stability study {{in order to determine}} a use-by-date. Validation of preparation process was claimed as ascertained by mass uniformity of <b>hard</b> <b>capsules.</b> Multicomponent analysis by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared (ATR-FTIR) of melatonin/microcrystalline cellulose mixture allowed to identify and quantify relative content of active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients. Absolute melatonin content analysis by high performance liquid chromatography in 0. 5  mg and 6  mg melatonin capsules was 93. 6 %± 4. 1 % and 98. 7 %± 6. 9 % of theoretical value, respectively. Forced degradation study showed a good separation of melatonin and its degradation products. The capability of the method was 15, confirming a risk of false negative < 0. 01 %. Stability test and dissolution test were compliant over 18 months of storage with European Pharmacopoeia. Preparation of melatonin <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> was completed manually and melatonin in <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> was stable for 18 months, in spite of low doses of active ingredient.

50|$|The Bayur tree {{produces}} large, white, finger shaped {{flowers in}} the spring. Flowers begin as one long bud, then separating into five more slender sepals as it matures. Each sepal can be up to seven inches long. The sepals of the flower curl outward and around the white and gold stamen located at the center. The flowers are nocturnal and exceptionally fragrant, suggesting they attract moths for pollination. Successfully pollinated flowers produce a fruit {{in the form of}} a <b>hard</b> <b>capsule.</b> The fruit has a very rough texture and is sometimes covered in brown hairs. Fruits can take a very long time to completely mature; up to an entire year. The capsule then splits open releasing a massive number of “winged seeds.” Because it takes such a long period to reproduce, it seems the Bayur tree can be out-competed by other faster growing plants.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) for improving oral absorption of poorly water-soluble drug, silymarin. The pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed using ethyl linoleate, Cremophor EL, ethyl alcohol, and normal saline to identify the efficient self-microemulsification region. The particle size and its distribution of the resultant microemulsions were determined using dynamic light scattering. The optimal formulation with the best self-microemulsifying and solubilization ability consisted of 10 % (w/w) of ethyl linoleate, 30 % of Cremophor EL, and 60 % of ethyl alcohol. The release of silymarin from SMEDDS was significantly faster than that from the commercial silymarin preparation <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> (Legalon®). The bioavailability results indicated that the oral absorption of silymarin SMEDDS was enhanced about 2. 2 -fold compared with the <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> in fasted dogs.

We compared {{the stability of the}} Panax notoginsenoside R 1 as well as the ginsenosides Rg 1, Rb 1, Re, and Rd in different formulations. Methods: Artificial stomach fluid (ASF) and artificial intestinal fluid (AIF) were prepared. Stability of three types of Xuesaitong capsules was examined for 4  h in stomachs and 24  h in intestines. Samples were analyzed at different times by high-performance liquid chromatography. Percent content of NGR 1, GRg 1, GRb 1, GRe, and GRd at different times was calculated. Results: <b>Hard</b> <b>capsules</b> incubated in ASF disintegrated within 2 – 3  min, whereas soft capsules disintegrated within 7 – 8  min. Components in <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> were dissolved rapidly in water, with content of each compound reaching 90 % in 5  min, and degradation of each compound reaching 30 – 50 % after incubation for 240  min. Dissolution and degradation of each component in soft capsules with a water-soluble base tended to balance at 30 – 90  min. Contents in soft capsules with a lipid-soluble base showed slow dissolution after ASF incubation for 120  min. Five saponins in identical types of capsules incubated in ASF had similar stability curves. Contents of <b>hard</b> <b>capsules</b> and soft capsules with a water-soluble base degraded rapidly within 30  min and reached a plateau when Xuesaitong capsules were incubated in AIF.

40|$|ABSTRACT – Purpose: The {{therapeutic}} equivalence {{of multiple}} registered fenofibrate formulations, several {{of which are}} suprabioavailable and therefore marketed at lower dosage strengths than their reference products, {{is based on the}} results of bioequivalence studies. Most of these formulations show a higher bioavailability when taken with a high-fat meal. The relative bioavailability of two of these formulations, the 200 mg Lidose hard capsules and the 145 mg nanoparticle tablets, was assessed when taken with a high-fat meal. Methods: In this single dose, 2 -way, randomized, crossover study, 24 healthy subjects received a 200 mg fenofibrate Lidose <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> (Test) and a 145 mg nanoparticle tablet (Reference) under high-fat fed conditions. Plasma concentrations of fenofibric acid were measured up to 72 hours by using a validated LC-MS/MS method. Results: The geometric mean ratios (Test/Reference) and the 90 % confidence intervals for AUC 0 -t and Cmax were 1. 37 (131. 58 – 142. 88) and 1. 38 (124. 60 – 152. 93), respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Understanding {{the product}} and process {{variable}} on the final product performance {{is an essential part}} of the quality-by-design (QbD) principles in pharmaceutical development. The <b>hard</b> <b>capsule</b> is an established pharmaceutical dosage form used worldwide in development and manufacturing. The empty hard capsules are supplied as an excipient that is filled by pharmaceutical manufacturers with a variety of different formulations and products. To understand the potential variations of the empty hard capsules as an input parameter and its potential impact on the finished product quality, a study was performed investigating the critical quality parameters within and in between different batches of empty hard gelatin capsules. The variability of the hard capsules showed high consistency within the specification of the critical quality parameters. This also accounts for the disintegration times, when automatic endpoint detection was used. Based on these data, hard capsules can be considered as a suitable excipient for product development using QbD principles.
