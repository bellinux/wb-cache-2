25|$|Malinga was {{included}} to the ODI squad for 2017 ICC Champions Trophy in June 2017. He played his comeback match against South Africa on 3 June 2017 {{at the pool}} match of Champions Trophy. However his comeback was not <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> where he finished the spell wicket less by giving 57 runs and put down a catch and was sloppy in the fielding as well. Sri Lanka suffered a heavy loss in the match by 96 runs finally.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} against Proteas, rain {{interrupted}} in numerous occasions, which gave only 7 over per side match. South Africa batted first and AB de Villiers smashed 30 runs from 13 balls, where they finished with 78/4 in 7 overs. Sri Lanka was not <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> only scored 46/5, no any batsmen scored more than 15 runs. South Africa won the match by 32 runs, {{which is a}} huge margin in T20s. However, both team qualified for the Super 8s.|$|E
25|$|After the {{retirement}} of Kumar Sangakkara, his position remained vacant for a new player and Kusal was brought into the team. He made his Test debut for Sri Lanka against India on 28 August 2015. His arrival to the test team was not <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> when he dropped Indian skipper Virat Kohli in fairly easy catch. But then he took 2 catches and 1 stumping in that innings. He showed his batting talents right on the first innings of the match, {{where he was the}} top scorer for Sri Lanka with 56 runs in first innings.|$|E

25|$|Explicit {{extrinsic}} {{rewards and}} punishments {{have been found}} to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{diplomatic}} philosophy {{behind the}} League represented {{a fundamental shift}} from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious Great Powers of World War I (France, the UK, Italy and Japan were the {{permanent members of the}} executive Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting Red Cross medical tents, Benito Mussolini responded that [...] "the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> when eagles fall out." ...|$|E
500|$|In the verses, Spears sings {{about being}} {{in love with a}} bad boy and outlaw, in lyrics such as [...] "He is a hustler / He's no <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> / He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum" [...] and [...] "He is a bad boy with a tainted heart / And even I know this ain't smart". During the chorus, she pleads to her mother not to worry in lines such as [...] "But mama I'm in love with a criminal" [...] and [...] "Mama please don't cry / I will be alright." [...] Andrew Leahey of The Washington Times and Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly {{compared}} the lyrics to those of Madonna's [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986), while David Bunachan compared them to Coolio's [...] "Mama I'm in Love Wit' a Gangsta" [...] (1994). The words in the chorus end in 'al's syllables, as evident in lyrics such as [...] "And this type of love isn't rational / It's physical". Keith Caufield noted that they were an unintentional nod to Supertramp's [...] "The Logical Song" [...] (1979). Thompson stated that Spears's vocals are less processed than {{on the rest of the}} album, while according to Amy Sciarretto they are [...] "heavily auto-tuned and studio-treated, [...] she delivers her lines in a monotone, robotic fashion." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics. Ramsey Isler of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "There {{was a time when}} [...] was one of the funniest shows on TV; it was comedy gold. But somewhere along the line, the show's shine faded, its image was tarnished, and the magic disappeared", but added, [...] "That's not to say that FG hasn't been <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> lately. Season 8 certainly had a few good episodes including the season opener, [...] "Road to the Multiverse", which had a clever premise that was executed well. But after the first episode, the quality of the stories started to decline". He listed [...] "Brian's Got a Brand New Bag", [...] "Jerome Is the New Black", [...] "Go Stewie Go", [...] "Peter-assment" [...] and [...] "April in Quahog" [...] as the worst episodes of the season. Isler praised the [...] "tail end of the season", however, citing [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as [...] "one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume eight DVD, Frank Rizzo of DVD Talk said, [...] "The episodes stand on their own, whether you care about the dependence on easy gags and gimmicky concepts or not, because they are simply funny." [...] Rizzo commented on the DVD release: [...] "Fans of Family Guy, or any of MacFarlane's series for that matter, have to be concerned that the very reason the series continues to air, the DVDs the fans buy, are getting diluted and weakened, especially when you're getting less extras, less MacFarlane, and, for the first time, less of the commentaries that give you a peek into the show's creation." ...|$|E

500|$|Davies had {{suspected}} that Renwick {{would one day}} revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Graves Victor Meldrew, {{who was killed in}} a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: [...] "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve." [...] He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: [...] "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when you work on a Jonathan Creek episode." [...] He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: [...] "Sheridan is extremely <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really been doing it for a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having [...] "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not want to play a [...] "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: [...] "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: [...] "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: [...] "After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [...] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Erik Wolpaw {{scored the}} PC version 7.7 out of 10, and {{although}} he was very critical of the trust/fear system and the controls, he concluded [...] "The Thing is kind of short, it's not especially effective at making you feel afraid, its most intriguing gameplay elements are somewhat extraneous, and it suffers from a wonky control scheme. Yet, thanks to some high production values and consistently interesting action scenes, The Thing rises above these flaws. It could have been great, but {{in light of the}} checkered history of movie-licensed games, being <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> is a pretty impressive achievement." [...] Ryan MacDonald scored the PlayStation 2 version 8.4 out of 10, writing [...] "when you look at everything the game offers in terms of its gameplay, presentation, and story, it's hard not to appreciate The Thing whether you're a fan of the film it's based on or just a fan of the survival horror genre in general." [...] He also scored the Xbox version 8.4 out of 10, calling it [...] "the best of the three, combining sharp graphics similar to those found in the PC version with the superior console-style control found in the PlayStation 2 version." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cinematographer Adam Greenberg, whose {{previous}} film credits included Three Men and a Baby, La Bamba and Near Dark, {{approached the}} film {{with a unique}} documentary-style technique. Commenting on the initial photography lighting tests, Greenberg remarked, [...] "The first ones were a disaster. They didn't look <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> I didn't know how to photograph these aliens. It {{was the first time}} I had to deal with this kind of thing. But I have an eye and I learned from these tests." [...] At the Biltmore Hotel, a peculiar situation arose where the ceilings were simply too tall for standard lighting equipment. An ingenious idea was devised by the crew to have six to eight weather balloons sent up and have artificial light bounce off of them to create the proper lighting mood. Greenberg remarked, [...] "I wanted a very rich look from that place, gold and very warm. In the story it is very late after a big party. I wasn't going for any special effect, just nice light from lamps on the tables. The problem was, the hotel management wouldn't let us hang anything from the ceiling. In pre-production they had told us we could hang lights, but I didn't believe them. The ceilings there are very high and very beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "How I Roll" [...] is {{the fifth}} track, {{produced}} by Bloodshy, Henrik Jonback and Magnus, where Spears [...] "pirouettes from a gulping in-and-out breath effect", and {{was described as a}} [...] "bubbly, playful pop song". Spears' voice is heavily altered, with her voice being put through many distorters, filters, and blenders. The song uses constant rushed handclaps, with elements which were compared to Janet Jackson's [...] "Strawberry Bounce". The sixth and seventh tracks [...] "Drop Dead (Beautiful)" [...] and [...] "Seal It With a Kiss" [...] were commented as [...] "fillers" [...] by Christopher Kostakis of Samesame.com.au. [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] is Femme Fatales eighth track, and it was said that it [...] "sticks to dancefloor essentials". The song was further noted as being catchy, but repetitive by Idolator. [...] "Trouble for Me", the ninth song on the album, features a pre-chorus filled with [...] "melting, wheezing synths" [...] likened to a [...] "Wiley grime wobble," [...] segueing into a [...] "Janet Jackson vocal." [...] Spears' voice had been Auto-Tuned, but her voice was described as [...] "raw" [...] and the tones and wines as [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "one of a kind". [...] "Criminal", the last track on the album's standard edition, is a guitar-driven midtempo song, which incorporates a folk-style flute melody. Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly said the song [...] "takes a breather from aggressive, wall-to-wall synths, driven instead by a steady guitar rhythm and an oddly Asian folky-sounding flute melody." [...] In the verses, Spears sings about being in love with a bad boy and outlaw, in lyrics such as [...] "He is a hustler / He's no <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> / He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum" [...] and [...] "He is a bad boy with a tainted heart / And even I know this ain't smart".
