40|$|<b>Galvanic</b> <b>isolations</b> are {{essential}} in many electrical patient-monitoring devices and industrial applications. In this paper, a low-profile wideband three-port isolation amplifier using coreless printed-circuit-board (PCB) transformers for isolation is studied. The PCB thickness {{used in the}} isolation amplifier is 0. 4 mm. The diameters of the two coreless PCB transformers are 9. 75 and 5. 856 mm, respectively. Operating conditions of the transformers and a design guideline of the isolation amplifier are detailed in this paper. Experimental {{results show that the}} isolation amplifier under investigation can transmit an analog signal from 20 mHz to 1. 1 MHz with good linearity. Comparison of the prototype with an industrial isolation amplifier is also included. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|For energy {{conversion}} systems that require bidirectional energy transfer between two DC sources, the generally preferred converter topology is a Dual Active Bridge (DAB), particularly when <b>galvanic</b> source <b>isolation</b> is required. However, for maximum efficiency the two bridges should operate under Zero-Voltage-Switching (ZVS) conditions, and hence {{it is important}} to be able to accurately identify this operating region as the input/output voltages and power transfer levels vary. When the two converters are switched using 3 -level modulation to increase their input and output operating voltage range, identifying the ZVS region becomes very challenging using time domain analysis strategies, requiring multimodal analysis and simplifications such as assuming only a simple ideal AC coupling inductance, to achieve even a constrained solution. In contrast, this paper shows how harmonic decomposition of the bridge modulation processes allows the ZVS boundaries for a 3 -level modulated DAB to be accurately determined. The approach readily accommodates complex ac coupling networks between the two bridges and practical impedance non-idealities such as frequency dependency, and gives an explicit and unique theoretical solution under all operating conditions. The practical switching impact of dead time and device capacitance is also analyzed using the same harmonic principles. The methodology is confirmed by matching simulation and experimental results for various cases of practical coupling impedances with non-ideal characteristics...|$|R
40|$|In {{a process}} monitoring/control {{applications}} tens {{to thousands of}} sensors are used for monitoring system parameters. To achieve overall system goals, their reliable performance is critical. Generally a sensor’s output signal is too small or too noisy {{and may not be}} compatible with the input requirements of a Data Acquisition System. The sensor is interfaced to Data Acquisition System, through cabling, junction boxes and Interface Electronics like excitation circuitry, multiplexers, signal-conditioning circuitry etc. An interface or signal conditioning circuit does impedance matching, filtering, multiplexing, pre-amplification, amplification and digitization to make the sensor’s output signal compatible with the Data Acquisition System. Conventional Signal Conditioning includes Multiplexers, Anti aliasing filters, Operational Amplifier, Instrumentation Amplifiers, Isolation Amplifiers and Charge Preamplifiers etc. Operational Amplifiers e. g. voltage followers with High input impedance and low output impedance are used for impedance matching between the sensor and processing electronics. Anti aliasing filters remove noise from the sensor’s output signal. Normally the sensor is located away from the processing electronics and data is transmitted through wires/cables. During transmission, interference from external fields’ especially strong Audio Frequency, Radio Frequency and 50 Hz power line fields affects the sensor’s output signal. To minimize the effect of external field twisted pair shielded cables are used. Amplifiers with Differential input configuration are used to suppress the effect of interfering signals. Differential input Instrumentation Amplifiers with High input impedance, high CMRR; are most widely employed. Isolation Amplifiers isolate the input and output circuits by an extremely high impedance. <b>Galvanic,</b> optical <b>isolations</b> are most common. The conditioned data is transmitted to Data Acquisition System (DAS) and at the DAS the signal is multiplexed, filtered and digitized using Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs), followed by Digital Filtering and processing. For Control applications, the processed data is converted back to analog form using Digital to Analog Converters (DACs) for interfacing to external world. The transmission distance varies from tens of centimeters to few meters. Depending upon the distance twisted pair cables, IR transmission and Optical transmission is employed. During transmission, the data is prone to interferences from EMI, EMC, Noise and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) degradation with distance. This affects the reliability of the system and increases the overall system cost. To eliminate the effects due to the environmental disturbances during transmission and to maintain signal integrity, it is preferred to have a unique and compact solution for each sensor where signal conditioning (excitation, filtering, amplification, compensation and digitization) is carried out and digital data can be transmitted to Data Acquisition System. Here each sensor has its own signal conditioning module. Directly interfacing sensors with micro controller yields simple and compact design solutions. Direct Sensor interface Technology (DSiT) is one {{of the state of the}} art technologies for sensor interfaces where an unconditioned, uncompensated, raw output signals from sensors are interfaced directly to a single-chip solution. The sensors’ output are multiplexed using Multiplexer; Amplified using Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA), digitized using ADC, filtered using Digital Filters and transmitted using Digital Interfaces (SPI, I 2 C, UART) in a single chip. DSiT scheme incorporates all the elements necessary in an instrumentation system creating a balanced combination of features, to create truly intelligent sensor systems. The sensors are interfaced directly to a single DSiT chip, without any additional circuitry and the direct digital data transmission is achieved with the help of Digital Interfaces SPI, UART, SMBus/I 2 C. As this involves onchip signal conditioning and digital data transmission, expenditure on additional signal conditioning circuitry, analog interfaces for analog data transmission, separate Analog to Digital Converter for each sensor is reduced. This reduces the overall system cost and as the count of discrete components is reduced the system reliability is improved. In addition, as the data is transmitted digitally the effects of noise, S/N degradation and electromagnetic interferences are eliminated. The accuracy level achieved is sufficiently good for monitoring and control applications. In Launch Vehicles/Satellites number of sensors are used for performance evaluation, monitoring and control purposes. Harnessing, signal conditioning of the sensors’ output and onboard processing of the sensor data is carried out individually for each sensor. Implementation of the DSiT system will reduce the total weight of the launch vehicles and satellites, resulting in reduced overall system cost, increased reliability and reduced onboard processing overhead. In addition, the reduction in weight allows incorporation of larger payloads/ more propellant loading in payloads which increases the life of the Satellites. As it is compact, it can be readily used for facility parameter measurements during the ground testing of liquid engines and stages at LPSC/ISRO. Implementation of DSiT for facility parameter measurements will reduce the cabling cost and improve the reliability of the chain...|$|R

50|$|Any {{electromagnetic}} relay {{has a certain}} level of isolation between the input and output circuits. However, in ordinary relays, this function is not prevalent and, hence, not considered in the existing system of relay classification. In interface relays, however, the property of <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> (decoupling) between the input and output circuits is significantly bolstered, and parameters of the <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> have an utmost importance from standpoint of the functions performed by this relay. On the other hand, the parameters associated with switching capacity are secondary and can significantly vary in interface relays with the same level of galvanic decoupling.|$|E
50|$|Readings from {{multiple}} slaves (up to three) can be enabled {{at the same}} time by connecting them to a common clock. However, to avoid ground loops and electrically isolate the slave, complete <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> by opto-couplers is needed.|$|E
50|$|The forward {{converter}} is a DC/DC converter {{that uses}} a transformer to increase or decrease the output voltage (depending on the transformer ratio) and provide <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> for the load. With multiple output windings, {{it is possible to}} provide both higher and lower voltage outputs simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> is a {{principle}} of isolating functional sections of electrical systems to prevent current flow; no direct conduction path is permitted. Energy or information can still be exchanged between the sections by other means, such as capacitance, induction or electromagnetic waves, or by optical, acoustic or mechanical means.|$|E
50|$|To use JTAG, a host is {{connected}} to the target's JTAG signals (TMS, TCK, TDI, TDO, etc.) through some kind of JTAG adapter, which may need to handle issues like level shifting and <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation.</b> The adapter connects to the host using some interface such as USB, PCI, Ethernet, and so forth.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{dangerous}} loops when connecting equipment in complex studio setups, better adapters offer voltage protection and <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> of the units. Such adapters will ensure {{that there is no}} electrical connection of any kind between both sides of the adapter, including ground. They either use transformers or opto-couplers to transfer the trigger impulse from the camera to the flash. Their electronics cannot be powered from the flash and therefore needs a power supply in form of a small battery.As an example, Minolta offered the PC terminal adapter PCT-100 (8825-691) for this purpose, which worked as a galvanic isolator and could withstand 400 volts DC or AC. The similar Sony flash sync terminal and ISO hotshoe adapters FA-ST1AM and FA-HS1AM offer <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> as well, but can withstand voltages up to 60 volts DC or AC only.|$|E
50|$|Inputs can use an opto-coupler for <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> (For {{more details}} see http://www.posital.sg/sg/products/POSITAL/AbsoluteEncoders_Context/AbsoluteEncoders_Context_Technology_SSI_AppNote.pdf) {{that can be}} driven by RS-422/485 levels. The DATA output of the sensor is driven by an RS-422/485 line driver. Differential {{signalling}} improves the resistance to electromagnetic interference (EMI), hence making it a reliable communication channel over long transmission lengths and harsh external environments.|$|E
50|$|An optically-isolated {{amplifier}} modulates current {{through an}} LED optocoupler. The linearity is improved {{by using a}} second optocoupler within a feedback loop. Some devices provide up to 60 kHz bandwidth. <b>Galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> {{is provided by the}} conversion of electric current to photonic flux through the space between the LED and the detector, regardless of the intervening medium.|$|E
50|$|Transformerless inverters, {{which are}} popular in Europe, are lighter, smaller, and more {{efficient}} than inverters with transformers. But transformerless inverters {{have been slow to}} enter the US market because of concerns that transformerless inverters, which do not have <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> between the DC side and grid, could inject dangerous DC voltages and currents into the grid under fault conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Booby trap: a fake {{dead drop}} or USB Killer might be rigged up to {{electrically}} damage any equipment connected to it, and/or constitute a {{health and safety}} hazard for potential users. This risk can be mitigated by using a USB <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> adapter, which allows data exchange while physically decoupling the two circuits. Wifi-based dead drops do not suffer from this threat.|$|E
5000|$|LEDs are {{connected}} in parallel with the 10 μF electrolytic filter capacitor. The four branches with 12 LEDs consume about 20 mA each. The diodes limit the voltage to about 40 V per branch. Since, normally, the circuit is connected directly to the network without <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation,</b> we need a residual-current circuit breaker [...] in any type of protection circuit used {{for this kind of}} LED light.|$|E
50|$|The latest audio {{interface}} is the SL4. It is {{the first}} standalone DJ interface with two USB 2.0 ports for seamless DJ changeover and back-to-back performances. It also has 96 kHz, 24-bit audio. The SL4 has built in <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> between USB and audio, with turn on/off muting. The unit also includes Low-latency ASIO and Core Audio drivers which allow the SL4 {{to be used as}} a studio production tool with third-party software applications.|$|E
50|$|The line-interactive UPS {{is similar}} in {{operation}} to a standby UPS, but {{with the addition of}} a multi-tap variable-voltage autotransformer. This is a special type of transformer that can add or subtract powered coils of wire, thereby increasing or decreasing the magnetic field and the output voltage of the transformer. This may also be performed by a buck-boost transformer which is distinct from an autotransformer, since the former may be wired to provide <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Use of {{a common}} ground is one {{weakness}} of RS-423 (and RS-232): if devices are far enough apart or on separate power systems, the ground will degrade between them and communications will fail, resulting in a condition {{that is difficult to}} trace. In this respect, balanced serial connections such as RS-422 or RS-485 are better, and Ethernet over twisted pair connections are better yet, because of the <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> provided by the signal transformers.|$|E
50|$|Any {{devices that}} provide <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> or {{buffering}} on the DMX line (such as DMX splitters) {{have traditionally been}} designed to allow transmission in one direction: from the controller to the devices. As RDM requires bi-directional communication these devices will typically fail. Only devices that have been designed with RDM compatibility as a feature will typically work. Older DMX splitters that are not RDM compatible should still reliably send the DMX data, and block RDM communication.|$|E
50|$|The flyback {{converter}} {{is used in}} both AC/DC and DC/DC conversion with <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> between the input and any outputs. The {{flyback converter}} is a buck-boost converter with the inductor split to form a transformer, so that the voltage ratios are multiplied with an additional advantage of isolation. When driving for example a plasma lamp or a voltage multiplier the rectifying diode of the boost converter is left out and the device is called a flyback transformer.|$|E
50|$|The faustino {{platform}} is geared towards {{measurement and control}} engineering by the hobby enthusiast. For that purpose, it is equipped with vibration resistant connectors, a wide temperature range (for example, silicone insulated leads are used), <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> of the PC interface and support for typical sensors such as ratiometric pressure sensors, thermocouples and a flow meter. Unlike other development platforms such as Arduino, only a few I/O pins of the microcontroller are unassigned and available for use with or by other circuits.|$|E
5000|$|Any {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} that gets its power from an AC power line (called an [...] "off-line" [...] converter) requires a transformer for <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation.</b> Some DC-to-DC converters may also include a transformer, although isolation may not be critical in these cases. SMPS transformers run at high frequency. Most of the cost savings (and space savings) in off-line power supplies result from the smaller size of the high frequency transformer compared to the 50/60 Hz transformers formerly used. There are additional design tradeoffs.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common methods for {{protection}} is to limit electric current by using multiple series resistors (assuming that resistors always fail open); and limit the voltage with multiple zener devices to ground (assuming diodes always fail shorted). Sometimes an alternative type of barrier known as a <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> barrier may be used. Certification standards for intrinsic safety designs, which vary by device type, generally require that the barrier not exceed approved levels of voltage and current with specified damage to limiting components.|$|E
50|$|The 4-pin Auto-lock Accessory Shoe (a.k.a. iISO hotshoe) on all Sony DSLRs/SLTs {{and some}} NEX models up to 2012-08 was {{introduced}} by Minolta in 1988 for their Maxxum/Dynax/α series of A-mount AF SLRs and was also used on their digital DiMAGE A cameras series. It offers a slide-on auto-locking mechanism but is mechanically incompatible with hotshoes based on the ISO 518 standard as utilized by most other camera and accessory manufacturers. A compatible 7-pin variant existed as well, but was rarely used by Minolta, {{and not at all}} by Sony. The passive adapters Minolta FS-1100 and FS-PC allow to adapt Minolta AF and TTL flashes with ISO-based foot to cameras with Auto-lock Accessory Shoe, whereas the FS-1200 allows to use AF TTL flashes with Auto-lock Accessory Foot on earlier Minolta SLRs. These adapters provide no voltage protection or <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation,</b> but they maintain TTL support with Minolta film cameras. Digital cameras, however, require digital-ready flashes for TTL support. If no TTL support, but voltage protection and <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> is required, the Sony FA-HS1AM can be used instead to mount ISO-based equipment on Auto-lock Accessory Shoe cameras. If no electrical connection is required, the mechanical adapter Sony FA-SA1AM can be used as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} level usesRS-485 {{levels at}} 1 Mbit/s data rate. The encoding uses a Manchester II code and a HDLC frame protocol with proper voltage balancing to avoid DC {{components in the}} <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> transformers. The Manchester decoder uses a phase/quadrature demodulation (not RS485, that operates with zero-crossings) which allows to span 750 m under worst-case conditions, especially when only the two extremity vehicles are equipped, {{as is the case}} with multiple traction for freight trains. No repeaters are foreseen since vehicles in between can have discharged batteries.|$|E
50|$|Electrically, IEEE 488 used a {{hardware}} interface {{that could be}} implemented with some discrete logic or with a microcontroller. The hardware interface enabled devices made by different manufacturers to communicate with a single host. Since each device generated the asynchronous handshaking signals required by the bus protocol, slow and fast devices could be mixed on one bus. The data transfer is relatively slow, so transmission line issues such as impedance matching and line termination are ignored. There was no requirement for <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> between the bus and devices, which created the possibility of ground loops causing extra noise and loss of data.|$|E
50|$|High voltage {{interface}} relays, a.k.a., interface relays: or coupling relays or insulating interfaces is {{a special}} class of electrical relays designed to provide informational and electrical compatibility between functional components isolated {{from each other and}} not allowing for a direct connection due to a high difference of potentials. A common design principle of these devices {{is a special}} <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> module between the input (control) and the output (switching) circuits of the relay. Interface relays are widely used in control and protection systems of high voltage (10-100 kV) electronic and electrophysical equipment and in high power installations.|$|E
50|$|The {{developmental}} {{trends of}} interface relay technology suggest {{the use of}} opto-isolator as the prevailing design principle of interface relays. An opto-isolator can be implemented {{in terms of an}} LED and a phototransistor (or photothyristor or a photodiode) or a lamp and a photoresistor. An example of an opto-electronic interface relay is shown in the figure. The transparent high voltage insulating barrier provides <b>galvanic</b> <b>isolation</b> of the circuits under the difference of potentials up to 5-7 kV. For higher voltages, they use an optical fiber, the length of which (depending on the voltage level) can take from dozens of centimeters to several meters.|$|E
