40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the cost of}} breaking ECC under the following assumptions: (1) ECC is using a standardized elliptic curve that was actually chosen by an attacker; (2) the attacker is aware of a vulnerability in some curves that are not publicly known to be vulnerable. This cost includes the cost of exploiting the vulnerability, but also the initial cost of computing a curve suitable for sabotaging the standard. This initial cost depends upon the acceptability criteria used by the public {{to decide whether to}} allow a curve as a standard, and (in most cases) also upon the chance of a curve being vulnerable. This paper shows the importance of accurately modeling the actual acceptability criteria: i. <b>e.,</b> <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> what the public can be fooled into accepting.

Next, we study heuristic models of repeated voting: we {{first look at the}} DeGroot model, and then we analyze the repeated majority model. 1 Gale-Kariv model We now study a model introduced by Gale and Kariv [2], which is more complicated than the models we have seen before.

In the beginning each agent receives an independent private signal picked from a distribution that depends {{on the state of the}} world, and from this they form a belief regarding the state of the world. Next, there are multiple rounds of voting in which each agent acts and observes simultaneously: they each make a declaration of the state of the world according to their current beliefs and observe the declarations of their neighbors. After each round, each agent calculates an updated posterior belief based upon what he or she observed. This is a Bayesian model, in the sense that the agents are Bayesian and their actions are aimed at maximizing their expected utility (i. <b>e.</b> <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> the true state of the world) at eac...|$|R

40|$|If you {{are taking}} an {{undergraduate}} operating systems course, you should already have {{some idea of what}} a computer program does when it runs. If not, the course is going to be difficult – so you should probably drop the course, or run to the nearest bookstore and quickly consume the necessary background material (both Patt/Patel [PP 03] and Bryant/O’Halloran [BOH 10] are pretty great books). So what happens when a program runs? Well, a running program does one very simple thing: it executes instructions. Many millions (and these days, even billions) of times every second, the processor fetches an instruction frommemory, de-codes it (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>figures</b> <b>out</b> which instruction this is), and executes it (i. e., it does the thing that it is supposed to do, like add two numbers together, access memory, check a condition, and so forth). After it is done with this instruction, the processor moves on to the next in-struction, and so on, and so on, until the program finally completes 1. Thus, we have just described the basics of the Von Neumann model of computing 2. Sounds simple, right? But in this class, we 1 Of course, modern processors do many bizarre and frightening things underneath the hood to make programs run faster, e. g., executing multiple instructions at once, and even issuing and completing them out of order! But that is not our concern here; we are just concerned with the simple model most programs assume: that instructions seem-ingly execute one at a time. 2 Von Neumann was one of the early pioneers of computing systems. He also did pioneeringwork on game theory and atomic bombs, and played in theNBA for six years. OK, one of those things isn’t true. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{movement}} towards {{high stakes}} testing promises to encourage rigor and accountability {{in middle school}} mathematics, {{but there is a}} danger that a toonarrow focus on testing will take time and attention away from mathematics instruction. The fundamental dilemma that teachers face in trying to use assessment to guide instruction (i. <b>e.,</b> to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what is the next best thing for a student to try to learn) is that because assessment takes time away from instruction, how can teachers be sure the time spent assessing will improve instruction enough to justify the cost of lost instructional time. We propose to address this dilemma by building and experimentally evaluating the effectiveness of a web-based &quot;Assistment &quot; system for middle school mathematics. This system will 1) quickly predict a student’s score on a standard-based test, 2) provide feedback to teachers about how they can specifically adapt their instruction to address student knowledge gaps, and 3) unlike other assessments system, provide an opportunity for students to get intelligent tutoring assistance at they same tim...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis volume {{contains}} the Proceedings of International Workshop on Optimization and Implementation of Declarative Programs (WOID′ 99). The Workshop {{was held in}} held {{in conjunction with the}} International Conference on Logic Programming ICLP′ 99 in Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA on the 2 nd and 3 rd of December, 1999. Overview:The aim of this workshop was to provide a forum where new trends, ideas and developments concerning the optimization and implementation of declarative languages could be discussed. It was especially geared towards bringing researchers from low-level compilation and high-level optimization together. Indeed, compilers and linkers are getting more and more sophisticated and employ more and more high-level optimizations, such as partial evaluation or deforestation. Researchers in high-level optimization and transformation, on the other hand, realise that low-level issues have {{to be taken into account}} in order to apply their techniques in practice. So, in this workshop we wanted to provide the possibility for these two areas to meet and accelerate their synergy. Contributions:Out of 11 submissions 8 papers were selected. To ensure a workshop character ample time was reserved for discussion and each paper was assigned a “key listener” from the program committee. This scheme was borrowed from the LOPSTR workshop series, and proved to be successful. The contributions were arranged in 3 sessions, described below. 1. Implementation & Low-level OptimizationThe first paper of the session by R. Muth, S. Watterson, and S. Debray, discussed how the information that certain program variables “almost always” have a particular value (as opposed to “always” as in partial evaluation or constant folding) can and should be exploited for optimization. (For various reasons this paper is not present in this volume of ENTCS.) The other two papers of the session presented new ways of efficiently implementing CLP languages and constructs. The paper by N-F. Zhou and S. Kaneko presented an efficient (hybrid) way to compile equality constraints, while the paper by M. Gavanelli and M. Milano showed how to efficiently implement lazy domain evaluation for Constraint Satisfaction Problems. 2. AnalysisThe session on analysis comprised two papers. The first one by K. Ueda developed a new linearity analysis for concurrent logic programs, with the aim of achieving compile time garbage collection. The paper by G. Puebla and M. Hermenegildo provided an encompassing and insightful overview of the important issues and problems that arise when analysing and specialising large programs decomposed into modules. 3. SpecializationThe first paper of the last session, by F. Fioravanti, A. Pettorossi, and M. Proietti, presented a novel way to specialise (C) LP programs within a given context. This context allows one to describe additional specialisation constraints which are hard (or impossible) to express in earlier approaches. The next paper, by W. Vanhoof and M. Bruynooghe, dicussed how to achieve a binding-time analysis (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> which values and operations are already known or executable at specialisation time) for offline partial evaluation in the context of Mercury programs with modules. Finally, the paper by M. Leuschel and J. Jorgensen (presented by H. Lehmann) gave an overview of a new, fast offline partial evaluation system (called LOGEN), which can handle partially static data structures and many pure and impure features of Prolog.
