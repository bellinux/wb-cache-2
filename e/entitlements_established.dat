40|$|EDITED VERSION SOON TO BE PUBLISHED In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} {{decoupling}} on the capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into agricultural rents in Ireland are analysed using a dynamic rental equations estimated with a two step system GMM estimator that accounts for expectation error and endogenous regressors. The findings illustrate the importance of institutional details in determining {{the extent to which}} subsidies are capitalised. In the period prior to decoupling Pillar 1 subsidies were highly capitalised into Irish agricultural rents in both the short and the long run. Depending on the farm system considered between 58 to 80 cents per euro of subsidies were capitalised into agricultural rents. In the post decoupling period the rate at which Pillar 1 subsidies are capitalised into Irish agricultural rents is found to have declined. This change is likely due to short term character of the Irish agricultural land rental market, where 11 month rental periods predominate, and the freedom that the 2003 reform of the CAP offered farmers to consolidate <b>entitlements</b> <b>established</b> on rented land. The generally very short term nature of Irish agricultural rental contracts offered farmers an opportunity to consolidate entitlements that is unlikely to have arisen in other Member States with agricultural land rental markets characterised by long term contracts. The results in both the pre and post decoupling periods highlight the high degree of inertia of agricultural rents in Ireland, and the importance of accounting for dynamics when investigating the capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into land rents. The high degree of inertia in rents means that the impact of previously capitalised agricultural policy persists through time...|$|E

40|$|During recent decades, {{the rapid}} pace of {{financial}} markets involving new modes of management, governance, and regulation has framed business firms. This corporate drift toward financialization is summarized under the “shareholder value” label. What do financial markets do? Unequivocally, they organize trading on shares that are securities: tradable financial <b>entitlements</b> <b>established</b> by law, which formalize expectations, and claims of financial rents {{paid by the}} issuing company. Actually, how continued quotation on share exchanges came to be the barometer of economic or social welfare is a different matter. The latter adoption has required quite a great leap from “the euthanasia of the rentier, of the functionless investor” involving changes in, and reforms of, monetary and financial architectures at policy-making and regulatory levels; banking and financial institutions; shareholding, monetary, and investment funds (including pension and insurance); and the management, organization, and accounting of business firms. This general trend has been further shaped by transnational imitation between various socioeconomic environments and regulatory regimes, led by some global institutions. This paper aims to address some theoretical problems with shareholder value that come from its misguided understanding of shareholding and the business firm. Shareholder value relies on complementary views that point to market and ownership to understand the dynamics of both securities markets and the enterprise activity. But what happens when shares, acquired at a definite price in a given circumstance, relate to the enterprise congeries of legal and economic systems involving flows and immobilizations that require an accounting system to explicate them? This Article engages this theoretical challenge by drawing upon {{the concept of the}} firm as an “enterprise entity,” which has significant implicationsfor governance and disclosure. It argues that the enterprise entity is a comprehensive approach to the firm that integrates accounting, economics, and law, thus improving on the received understanding of the firm. PartII discusses a framework based on the concept of the firm as an enterprise entity. Part III then contrasts this framework with three alternative views on the firm that jointly constitute the shareholder value rhetoric: the “black box,” the “proprietor-entrepreneur,” and the “legal person. ” Further, these views are criticized as “daydreams. ” Finally, Part IV applies this comparative assessment to matters of corporate governance and disclosure, clarifying the novel approach to governance and disclosure of the business firm...|$|E
40|$|Since its {{establishment}} by the Treaty of Rome in 1958, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{has had a}} {{huge impact}} on the agricultural sector in Europe and more widely. The original CAP altered production incentives, distorting input and output markets. The CAP has undergone a number of reforms, most recently the Fischler reform in 2003 which sought to remove the link between production and farm income support payments. Chapter 1 of this thesis offers some background on the Common Agricultural Policy and outlines the thesis. The move to `decoupled 2 ̆ 7 payments, and its impact on land rental markets, is the focus of Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis. In October 2011, the European Commission published proposals for further CAP reform (European Commission, 2011). At the heart of the proposals were reforms {{to the way in which}} Pillar I income support subsidies were distributed (both between Member States and between farmers within each Member State) and the linking of Pillar I direct income supports explicitly with environmental objectives (so-called 2 ̆ 7 greening 2 ̆ 7). Chapter 4 of this thesis explores the impact of changes in the distribution of subsidies upon the farm income inequality in the UK and Ireland. Chapter 5 discusses the findings and limitations of this research and suggests some future directions for research. I next offer abstracts of the three substantive chapters in this thesis. Abstract for Chapter 2 This chapter analyses the impact of the recent decision by the European Union to `decouple 2 ̆ 7 agricultural support payments from agricultural production on Irish farmers 2 ̆ 7 land market decisions. The land market participation decisions of Irish farmers are modelled using dynamic probit models while the extent of participation decisions are modelled using dynamic tobit models. Decoupling does not appear to have dramatically altered farmers 2 ̆ 7 land market decisions. One likely explanation for this is the cross-compliance obligation for farmers to maintain land in a state fit for agricultural production in order to receive their full payments. Abstract for Chapter 3 In this chapter the effect of decoupling on the capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into agricultural rents in Ireland is analysed using a dynamic rental equation estimated with a two step system GMM estimator that accounts for expectation error and endogenous regressors. The findings illustrate the importance of institutional details in determining the extent to which subsidies are capitalised. In the period prior to decoupling Pillar 1 subsidies were highly capitalised into Irish agricultural rents in both the short and the long run. Depending on the farm system considered between 67 and 90 cents per euro of subsidies were capitalised into agricultural rents. In the post decoupling period the rate at which Pillar 1 subsidies are capitalised into Irish agricultural rents is found to have declined. This change is likely due to the short term character of the Irish agricultural land rental market, where 11 month rental periods predominate, and the freedom that the 2003 reform of the CAP offered farmers to consolidate <b>entitlements</b> <b>established</b> on rented land. The generally very short term nature of Irish agricultural rental contracts offered farmers an opportunity to consolidate entitlements that is unlikely to have arisen in other Member States with agricultural land rental markets characterised by long term contracts. The results in both the pre and post decoupling periods highlight the high degree of inertia of agricultural rents in Ireland, and the importance of accounting for dynamics when investigating the capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into land rents. The high degree of inertia in rents means that the impact of previously capitalised agricultural policy persists through time. Abstract for Chapter 4 The agricultural sector in Europe is heavily dependent on support payments made as part of the Common Agricultural Policy. In 2011, the European Commission published proposals for CAP reform which might lead to the introduction of a basic payment scheme consisting of flat rate per hectare payments, possibly determined at a regional rather than national level. This paper explores the role that these payments may play in reducing farm income inequality in the UK and Ireland. Flat rate per farm payments are also considered to explore how a more dramatic reform would reduce inequality. Movement to flat rate per hectare payments does not uniformly decrease inequality of Farm Net Value Added (FNVA) in contrast to what one may anticipate a priori, in fact in Scotland the inequality of FNVA increases in this analysis. In contrast, flat rate per farm payments reduce inequality substantially. 2017 - 03 - 3...|$|E

For this purpose, we have introduced the new notion of Dedicated Innovation Systems (DIS) as an overarching framework for transformations towards sustainability. DIS go beyond exploitation-oriented Innovation systems because they attempt to achieve a dynamic balance between demand driven technology pull, science and market driven technology push, and social innovation moderating social and ethical considerations (Seidler and Bawa, 2009). Social and ethical considerations add the dedication to innovation systems and help to overcome inertia due to potential <b>entitlements</b> of <b>established</b> actors.

The law was introduced in 1963 and created an entitlement to 18  days of paid vacation on the basis of six working days per week. This minimum overall vacation period was raised to 4 weeks in 1994. The Federal Vacation Law rules out the possibility to substitute additional wage payments for such vacation entitlements if they are not used, unless the employment relationship is terminated. For the first 6 months of an employment contract, often matching the probationary period, the right to take paid vacation only exists on a pro rata basis. Since vacation entitlements are based on calendar years, employees can generally use remaining entitlements in the first months of the subsequent year. In addition to paid vacation entitlements, there are between 9 and 13 public holidays in Germany. Their number varies across federal states and regions and also depends on calendar dates (see Ray et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|As the {{greatest}} rainwater users among all vegetative land covers, tree plantations have been employed strategically to mitigate salinity and water-logging problems. However, large-scale commercial tree plantations in high rainfall areas reduce fresh water inflows to river systems supporting downstream communities, agricultural industries and wetland environmental assets. A bio-economic model {{was used to}} estimate economic demand for water by future upstream plantations in a sub-catchment (the 2. 8 million ha Macquarie valley in NSW) of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. Given four tree-product values, impacts were simulated under two settings: without and with the requirement that permanent water entitlements be purchased from downstream <b>entitlement</b> holders before <b>establishing</b> a tree plantation. Without this requirement, gains in economic surplus from expanding tree plantations exceeded economic losses by downstream irrigators, and stock and domestic water users, but resulted in reductions of up to 154 GL (gigalitres) in annual flows to wetland environments. With this requirement, smaller gains in upstream economic surplus, added to downstream gains, could total $ 330 million while preserving environmental flows. Extending downstream water markets to new upstream tree plantations, to equilibrate marginal values across water uses, helps ensure water entitlements are not diminished without compensation.

The historiography of English literacy {{has been dominated by}} a singular myth: the poor had an oral culture that fused slowly and imperfectly into a written culture only by the mid- and late nineteenth-century. While it is certainly true that the English poor had a strong oral culture, it is misleading to point to low literacy levels. My research on pauper letters suggests that the poor could and did write, either as an individual or collective endeavour. They sent letters to potential advocates, magistrates and above all to the officials who controlled the welfare system. These were more than petitions, often embodying sophisticated rhetorical and claims-making processes and fulfilling the intertwining purposes of communicating fact, <b>establishing</b> <b>entitlement</b> and navigating a discretionary welfare system.

40|$|Homecare is a {{major source}} of women’s low-wage {{employment}} in the UK. Practices of unpaid working time are widespread and many workers are not paid in accordance with their existing national minimum wage entitlements. On 1 April 2015, a new duty of well-being in social care came into force and local authorities are required to promote the control of care by service-users. As a consequence, homecare workers will increasingly be engaged in complex multi-lateral work relations and subject to multi-party control. This article examines how the national minimum wage entitlements of homecare workers have been legally interpreted and questions if their entitlements might be adversely affected under provisions of the Care Act 2014. There is a legacy of judicial decision-making in which care-giving is not recognised as ‘work’ {{for the purposes of the}} national minimum wage. Yet recent decisions have produced a more satisfactory <b>entitlement</b> framework by <b>establishing</b> that employer control over working time determines ‘work’. However, it seems this framework is put at risk by the statutory promotion of service-user control. As work relations are re-cast, contractual relationships in which care-giving falls outside the protection of national minimum wage law will appear increasingly attractive because they may both enhance service-user control and facilitate very low cost labour. Without innovation in legal treatments of multi-party control and sustained attention to the worth of care-giving as employment, the rights of homecare workers are at risk under the Care Act 2014...|$|R

As part of its social policy, the government of Lesotho has promulgated various pieces of legislation and introduced an assortment of public assistance programmes for the benefit of the people of the country. There are also various informal social security measures which are the result of coordinated activities by individuals and groupings in Lesotho. These initiatives together provide a broad spectrum of social security provisioning for the people of Lesotho. This article sets out to discuss the said social security provisioning measures and appraises the efficacy of their interventions. Lesotho is a constitutional state. The Constitution of Lesotho came into force on 2 April 1993. It provides for a Bill of Rights as well as principles of state policy. There is, however, no express provision in the Constitution for a right to social security. This is regrettable. Thus, the intersection between constitutional law and social security within the context of Lesotho can be achieved only through the interpretation of the fundamental rights as well as the principles of state policy provided in the Constitution. While the provisions relating to fundamental rights help to <b>establish</b> <b>entitlements</b> to social security, the principles of state policy play an important role in giving direction to service delivery. Understanding the link between the various governmental and social initiatives is crucial if interventions are to be designed which will enhance the provision of social security for the benefit of the people of Lesotho. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the motives that people with type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 D) have in seeking information about their condition, and how information is used in self-care. Semi-structured interviews (N = 25), focus groups (3 × N = 12 participants) and open-ended questionnaires (N = 6) were used to collect qualitative data. Data were analysed thematically using framework analysis. In total, 37 participants took part, all recruited from a community-based diabetes participation group. The majority of respondents were older people (aged 60 +) living in a socioeconomically deprived area. Information seeking is usually preceded by different types of uncertainty.

After discussion of the uncertain role charity plays in his account of property, we examine how it is defined in the Essay Concerning Human Understanding, and then turn to the crucial position it occupies in his theological corpus. Though Lockeâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s understanding of charity seems fraught with ambiguities, the reason for these ambiguities relate to his configuration of charity as a disposition rather than a mere act, a configuration linked inextricably to his account of toleration...|$|R
40|$|The {{business}} judgment rule is a judicially created {{doctrine that}} protects directors from personal civil liability for the decisions they make {{on behalf of}} a corporation. In today’s era of corporate scandals, global financial meltdowns, and directorial malfeasance, it has become especially important in setting the bar for when directors are appropriately responsible to shareholders for their actions. Traditionally the business judgment rule has been regarded as a standard of liability, although it has never really been explored or enunciated as such. This view determines eligibility for business judgment rule protection of a directorial decision after an examination of certain preconditions. An alternate view has developed that posits the business judgment rule is actually an abstention doctrine, and should be applied automatically absent the establishment of the same preconditions as the liability standard approach, only to be used as nullifying factors, to shield directors from having to account. The difference between the two positions essentially comes down to the order of the requirements, and who has the burden of establishing the existence of the factors that would grant or deny business judgment rule protection. This Article disagrees with both of the above approaches, and instead explores the business judgment rule as a type of immunity by comparing it to selected public and private immunities. The policy underpinnings of the business judgment rule mirror those of immunities, as does the practical impact. This means that the business judgment rule, properly construed, would require the director to <b>establish</b> <b>entitlement</b> to protection by proving that all preconditions for application of the rule are met. Much of the confusion between the courts and circuits could be alleviated by approaching the business judgment rule as a type of immunity, where the procedures and philosophies are much more enunciated. This helps place the business judgment rule back as a crucial part in the balancing act between directorial autonomy and accountability, which is especially timely given the current economic climate...|$|R
40|$|This {{occasional}} paper provides {{the views of}} 17 ‘thought leaders’ in the Australian vocational education and training (VET) sector. Their insight and opinions were sought to inform a larger research project focused on the student entitlement reforms that were introduced into the national VET system from 2012. A particular emphasis {{has been on the}} implications of the reforms and the challenges faced in its implementation in the context of achieving a balance between national consistency and jurisdictional flexibility. The interviewees considered key elements of the national training system, namely: standards for VET products (training packages and materials); standards for VET providers; and a flexible training market. The interviewees commented on the consistency and flexibility sought in each of these key elements, highlighting where tensions exist, particularly in student training entitlements. Key messages 	The views of experts highlight differing observations and opinions, yet also some unifying themes. 	Both consistency and flexibility are required in the national training system, with both balanced effectively to achieve meaningful outcomes at the national and jurisdictional levels. 	The distinct requirements and approaches of each of the jurisdictions have resulted in eight distinct training <b>entitlement</b> schemes being <b>established.</b> This has contributed to perceptions of fragmentation rather than these various approaches being received as ‘flexibility’ in the national VET system. 	Balancing local and national skills priorities is difficult and a perennial source of tension within the national training system. The entitlement system may not currently address whether and how a student could undertake courses {{in which there is a}} national but no local skill shortage. 	The eligibility criteria for the student training entitlement could have a greater level of consistency across the various training entitlement schemes. This would assist in meeting equity goals and provide increased functionality in the national training system. 	Prices, subsidies and fees have always been different across jurisdictions and even within jurisdictions, for good local reasons. Under any entitlement system, however, the subsidy level combined with the student fee needs to provide sufficient resources to allow for measurable quality in training. 	High-quality training experiences and outcomes is paramount to all aspects of entitlement schemes. National standards for registered training organisations (RTOs) and training products must be applied and continuously improved to be fit for purpose in a more marketised training environment. 	Adequate information for consumers about quality in VET and what to look for when choosing a suitable course or provider remains an important requirement in the national VET system...|$|R
40|$|Since the Federal Circuit’s {{adoption}} of Panduit’s causation standard for <b>establishing</b> <b>entitlement</b> to lost profits damages in patent litigation, application of its noninfringing alternatives prong has lacked consistency. The court’s decision in Grain Processing Corp. v. American Maize-Products Co., however, created an additional {{contribution to the}} Panduit standard, thereby raising the evidentiary bar while significantly altering the noninfringing-alternative inquiry. Grain Processing has given the infringer a potentially powerful defensive mechanism in {{an area in which}} patentees are generally favored, even when some infringement may be socially desirable. Grain Processing allows for the potential avoidance of lost profit damages, so long as the alleged infringer shows that it had the necessary equipment, know-how, and experience to produce an acceptable, noninfringing substitute during the alleged infringement period. The Grain Processing decision, however, raises some debate. As a judicially interjected gloss on damages, the added ability to limit damage awards to a reasonable royalty could have been too drastic. A closer look demonstrates a precarious policy balance. On the one hand, increases in patent litigation might justify implementing an additional hurdle to potential damage awards in order to further incentivize innovation. Added rigor provided by Grain Processing may deter frivolous and expensive litigation that might be asserted by patentees to keep new innovators out of the market. But on the other hand, if a market participant does unlawfully infringe, it is certainly reasonable to believe that the infringer should pay appropriate damages for the encroachment on another’s intellectual property. Grain Processing’s lost-profit-limiting defense against a patentee’s claim of entitlement to lost profits damages may serve to deter potentially useful innovation by increasing costs shouldered by patentees in defending their patent rights. This Note analyzes six Federal Circuit cases appealing lost profits determinations, decided both before and after Grain Processing, and attempts to discern the impacts that Grain Processing has had on patentees’ entitlements to lost profits. This Note is organized in four parts. Part I provides the historical and substantive context necessary to understand the Grain Processing decision and examines important statutory changes, especially their subsequent interpretation, both before and after Grain Processing. Part II summarizes three pre-, as well as three post-Grain Processing cases. Parts III and IV dissect and analyze the holdings in these cases and evaluate Grain Processing’s impact on patent damages...|$|R
40|$|When {{analyzing}} victimization by {{stressful life}} events, several questions {{are to be}} answered: Who {{is responsible for the}} stressful event? Which entitlements are hurt? Is someone to blame? Who is responsible for restitution or compensation? Answers to these questions are seldom given unanimously (they often change intraindividually, too, either as a function of external informations or of coping strategies). People have different and conflicting perspectives, beliefs, attitudes, value systems, ideologies. There are formal and informal negotiations about the answers, formal ones in trials, informal ones in everyday communication and interaction. The participants in these negotiations are victims, harmdoers, and observers. Until now, research on this topic has pointed to some puzzling phenomena, e. g., blaming the victim or denying being victimized. Theoretical accounts have brought forth some fascinating hypotheses like belief in a just world where everybody gets what he/she deserves (LERNER 1977, 1980), or belief in a controllable world (WALSTER 1966; SHAVER 1970). However, these concepts and hypotheses are often used post hoc for interpretation of observed phenomena. Perceived entitlements and responsibilities, as well as the needs for a just and a controllable world are not independently assessed. In many cases, it is open to question, whether persons after stressful events perceive themselves as victims of a blind fate, as victims of the actions and decisions of others (persons or institutions), or as losers in a fair play or a risky enterprise. The race driver, who suffers an accident, the gambler in Monte Carlo, who loses all his money, the AIDS-patient, they must not necessarily experience any injustice. Whether they feel victimized or not, depends on their perceived <b>entitlements,</b> which are <b>established</b> with reference to various rules of injustice, e. g., the rules of proportionality, of equality, of need, of legal, political, and social rights, or rules of procedural - 2 - justice. Certainly, there are situational and individual differences in selecting and applying rules of justice when appraising a situation (DEUTSCH 1975; LEVENTHAL 1976; SCHMITT & MONTADA 1982). And that again depends on perceived responsibilities for the disadvantages. Not every disadvantage or loss is judged as unjust, not necessarily because of repression of feelings or denial of injustice but because of a reasonable application of that very concept of justice. Some examples may illustrate this point. Bad events may be seen (a) as a just punishment for moral or legal offences in the past (e. g. failure in an examination which was not prepared carefully or legal punishment), (b) as a just compensation for undeserved advantages in the past (e. g. paying an extra tax when the own house was not destroyed in the war), c) as a retribution provoked by own behavior, d) as a consequence of a freely chosen commitment to a dangerous and risky enterprise motivated by the expectancy of highly valued gains, e) as generally imposed by social norms, obligatory for all similar members of the society (e. g. retirement or all the examinations which are an awful stress) ...|$|R
