25|$|The {{stations}} {{are built on}} the largest area of open shingle in Europe, measuring 12km by 6km, which has been deposited by the sea and built up over thousands of years. The entire area is moving slowly north and east as the sea moves the shingle {{from one side of}} the headland to the other. It is surrounded by a nature reserve Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). A fleet of lorries is used to continuously maintain shingle sea defences for the plant as coastal erosion would otherwise move shingle away at an estimated rate of 6 m per year. Around 30,000 cubic metres of shingle are moved each year. It seems that deposition on the north shore of the headland does not keep pace with erosion, although the power {{stations are}} about 1 km to the west of that shore. In all, 90,000 cubic metres are moved each year along parts of the coast between Pett Level and Hythe. This is necessary for the safety of the entire area including the power stations.

The time constant for drying a [...] red oak board at 150 <b>deg</b> <b>F</b> is then [...] days, which is the time required to reduce the moisture content to 1/e = 37% of its initial deviation from equilibrium.

The time to reduce the lumber from 85% moisture content to 25% moisture content is then about 4.5 days. [...] Higher temperatures will yield faster drying times, but they will also create greater stresses in the wood due because the moisture gradient will be larger. For firewood, this is not an issue but for woodworking purposes, high stresses will cause the wood to crack and be unusable. Normal drying times to obtain minimal seasoning checks (cracks) in 25mm (1 inch or 4/4 lumber) Red Oak ranges from 22 to 30 days, and in 8/4, (50mm or 2 inch) it will range from 65 to 90 days.|$|E

The approximate inclusion-exclusion problem, due to Linial and Nisan (1990), is to estimate P[A 1 ∪ · · · ∪ An] given P [� i∈S Ai] for |S | � k. Kahn et al. (1996) solved this problem optimally for each k. We study the following more general question: estimate P [f (A 1, [...] ., An) ] given P [� i∈S Ai] for |S | � k, where f: { 0, 1 } n → { 0, 1 } is a given symmetric function. (In the Linial-Nisan problem, f = OR.) We solve this general problem for every f and k, giving an algorithm that runs in polynomial time and achieves an approximation error that is essentially optimal. We prove this optimal error to be 2 − ˜Θ(k 2 /n) for k above a certain threshold, and Θ(1) otherwise.

40|$|Periodontal {{disease is}} caused by dental plaque biofilms. Fusobacterium nucleatum is an {{important}} periodontal pathogen involved {{in the development of}} bacterial complexity in dental plaque biofilms. Human gingival fibroblasts (GFs) act as {{the first line of defense}} against oral microorganisms and locally orchestrate immune responses by triggering the production of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 6 and IL- 8). The frequency and severity of periodontal diseases is known to increase in elderly subjects. However, despite several studies exploring the effects of aging in periodontal disease, the underlying mechanisms through which aging affects the interaction between F. nucleatum and human GFs remain unclear. To identify genes affected by infection, aging, or both, we performed an RNA-Seq analysis using GFs isolated from a single healthy donor that were passaged for a short period of time (P 4) 'young GFs' or for longer period of time (P 22) 'old GFs', and infected or not with F. nucleatum. Comparing F. nucleatum-infected and uninfected GF(P 4) cells the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in host defense mechanisms (i. e., immune responses and defense responses), whereas comparing F. nucleatum-infected and uninfected GF(P 22) cells the DEGs were involved in cell maintenance (i. e., TGF-β signaling, skeletal development). Most <b>DEGs</b> in <b>F.</b> nucleatum-infected GF(P 22) cells were downregulated (85 %) and were significantly associated with host defense responses such as inflammatory responses, when compared to the <b>DEGs</b> in <b>F.</b> nucleatum-infected GF(P 4) cells.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that when the polymer-substrate interaction, s, in a polymer film supported by substrate is strongly favorable, the Tg of the polymer film may increase with decreasing film thickness; but the opposite prevails if the interaction is less than weakly favorable. We present a quantitative study of the glass transition temperature, Tg, in thin films of polystyrene (PS) as a function of s by measuring the change in the thermal expansion using x-ray reflectivity. Using random copolymer of styrene and methylmethacryalte anchored to the substrate, s could be varied by varying the styrene content, f. With a fixed PS film thickness of 33 nm, the Tg was depressed by ~ 20 <b>deg</b> C as <b>f</b> was decreased from 1 to 0. 7. An analysis analogous to the Gibbs-Thompson model indicated that the surface energy was not a suitable parameter to use to describe the effect of interfacial interactions on the Tg of polymer thin films. Instead, an associated local fractional change in the polymer mass density at the substrate interface was introduced to describe the observed change in Tg with different s...|$|R
