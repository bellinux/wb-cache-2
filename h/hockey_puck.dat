5|$|Outside of his {{association}} with the Bruins, Ross also helped to improve the game. He created a style of <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> still used today, and advocated an improved style of goal nets, a change that lasted forty years. In 1947 Ross donated the Art Ross Trophy, awarded to the leading scorer of the NHL regular season. Ross {{was inducted into the}} Hockey Hall of Fame in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Walter Pipp {{was born}} on February 17, 1893, in Chicago, Illinois, to Pauline (née Stroeber) and William H. Pipp. He was raised as a Roman Catholic, and {{different}} sources describe him as being of Irish or German ancestry. He was raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan. As a child, Pipp {{said that he was}} hit {{in the head with a}} <b>hockey</b> <b>puck,</b> which resulted in headaches throughout his life.|$|E
50|$|Roller <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> {{are similar}} to ice <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks,</b> but made from plastic and thus lighter. They have small ribs {{protruding}} from their tops and bottoms which limit contact with the surface, allowing better sliding motion and less friction.|$|R

50|$|Air <b>Hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> are discs made of Lexan {{polycarbonate}} resin. Standard USAA and AHPA-approved pucks are yellow, red, and green. In competitive play, a {{layer of}} thin white tape {{is placed on the}} face-up side. Air <b>Hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> come in circles and other shapes (triangle, hexagon, octagon, or square).|$|R
25|$|Additional mascots have {{included}} Little Puck, an anthropomorphic <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> who partnered with Cool Ray from 1993 to 2008, and Excalibear, the Carolina Ice Palace's mascot, who joined Cool Ray for the 20102011 season.|$|E
25|$|A <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> is a disk made of {{vulcanized}} rubber {{that serves the}} same functions in various games as a ball does in ball games. The best-known use of pucks is in ice hockey, a major international sport.|$|E
25|$|For example, spectators {{to certain}} sports {{are assumed to}} accept a risk of injury, such as a <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> or {{baseball}} striking {{a member of the}} audience. Warnings by the defendant may also provide a defense depending upon the jurisdiction and circumstances. This issue arises, for example, in the duty of care that landowners have for guests or trespasses, known as occupiers' liability.|$|E

25|$|The old logo of the Ducks {{prior to}} the name change {{featured}} an old-style goaltender mask, shaped to form {{the appearance of a}} duck bill. Behind the mask are two intersecting hockey sticks, a black <b>hockey</b> <b>puck,</b> and a triangle; the color of the triangle was either green or gray, depending on how the logo is used. This is now used on a shoulder patch of the current uniforms, with the triangle in orange.|$|E
25|$|According {{to the law}} of {{conservation}} of energy, no energy is destroyed due to friction, though it may be lost to the system of concern. Energy is transformed from other forms into thermal energy. A sliding <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> comes to rest because friction converts its kinetic energy into heat which raises the thermal energy of the puck and the ice surface. Since heat quickly dissipates, many early philosophers, including Aristotle, wrongly concluded that moving objects lose energy without a driving force.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} Firepuck in {{the early}} 1990s was the first attempt to improve the {{visibility}} of hockey pucks as seen on television. This invention incorporated coloured retro reflective materials of either embedded lens elements or prismatic reflectors laminated into recesses on the flat surfaces and the vertical edge of a standard <b>hockey</b> <b>puck.</b> Yellow was the preferred reflected colour. A spotlight was required to be positioned on the TV camera and focused at {{the centre of the}} viewing area.|$|E
25|$|Roller <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> {{were created}} so inline hockey and street hockey players could {{play with a}} puck instead of a ball on {{surfaces}} such as hardwood, concrete, and asphalt.|$|R
25|$|Ice {{hockey is}} a popular past time in Yellow Grass. During the Great Depression when incomes {{prohibited}} buying sports equipment such as <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks,</b> a frozen potato would be used.|$|R
25|$|Roller <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> {{are similar}} to ice-hockey pucks, but made from plastic and thus lighter. They have small ribs {{protruding}} from their tops and bottoms which limit contact with the surface, allowing better sliding motion and less friction.|$|R
25|$|The International Hockey Hall of Fame, was {{established}} in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the Kingston Memorial Centre (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association, is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada. The museum's collection is home to various items that pay homage to Kingston's role {{in the history of}} hockey in Canada. These include: the original square <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> from the first Queens University vs. the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) game in 1886, hockey’s oldest sweater worn by a Queen’s student in 1894, and Canada’s first Olympic gold medal from 1924, among others.|$|E
25|$|Fast-flying pucks are {{potentially}} dangerous to players and spectators. Puck-related injuries at hockey games are not uncommon. This {{led to the}} evolution of various types of protective gear for players, most notably the goaltender mask. The most serious incident involving a spectator took place on March 18, 2002, when a 13-year-old girl, Brittanie Cecil, died two days after being struck on the head by a <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> deflected into the crowd at a NHL game between the Calgary Flames and Columbus Blue Jackets in Columbus. This is the only known incident of this type to have occurred {{in the history of the}} league. Partly as a result of this event, the glass or plexiglass panels that sit atop the boards of hockey rinks to protect spectators have been supplemented with mesh nets that extend above the upper edge of the glass.|$|E
500|$|The mascot is [...] "NJ Devil", a [...] tall devil {{who plays}} into {{the myth of}} the Jersey Devil. NJ Devil keeps the crowd excited, signs autographs, participates in {{entertainment}} during the intermissions, skates across the ice, throws T-shirts and runs throughout the aisles of the arena to high five fans. Prior to 1993, the mascot was [...] "Slapshot", a large Devils <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> that interacted with the fans. The man inside the costume resigned after he was accused of touching three women inappropriately while in costume. The man agreed to undergo psychological counseling for a year as part of his agreement to avoid trial. To remove the stigma of the lawsuit, Slapshot was retired and has not returned since.|$|E
50|$|Crock uses sporting-themed weapons such as {{exploding}} baseballs, flying bases, rocket baseball bats, knockout basketballs, lacrosse snare nets, exploding <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks.</b> Their outfits generally {{included a}} baseball cap, catcher's mask, padded jersey, catcher's chestguard, football-style pants, and cleats.|$|R

500|$|The {{exterior}} {{structure of}} the Ice Dome was designed to resemble a frozen ice droplet. [...] It has also drawn comparisons to a Fabergé egg, due to the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) resembling the [...] "jewel-encrusted surface" [...] of the famous Russian art piece. [...] Ustinov confirmed that the building {{was designed to be}} [...] "a combination of both." [...] The roof of the dome is mostly silver in colour and is covered with aluminium panels. [...] It is decorated with 38,000 LED lights which illuminate the outside of the arena at night. [...] The roof also doubles as a scoreboard that displays the live score of the game being played inside and an animation of a <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> whenever a goal is scored. [...] However, it famously did not display the final score after the United States defeated the hosts Russia 3–2 in an overtime shootout during the 2014 Winter Olympics.|$|E
2500|$|An {{underwater}} <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> (originally but now rarely {{referred to}} as a [...] "squid" [...] in the United Kingdom), while similar in appearance to an ice <b>hockey</b> <b>puck,</b> differs in that it has a lead core weighing approximately [...] within a teflon, plastic or rubber coating. This makes the puck dense enough to sink in a swimming pool, though it can be lofted during passes, while affording some protection to the pool tiles.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> is also {{referred}} to colloquially as a biscuit. To put the [...] "biscuit" [...] in the [...] "basket" [...] (colloquial for the goal/net) is to score a goal.|$|E
50|$|The {{cover sleeve}} depicts Lovich wearing a wedding dress {{and playing with}} <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> on a string. It was taken inside a {{stainless}} steel fermentation tank at a Guinness brewery, after it had been emptied prior to cleaning. It caused controversy and few members of the Baptist church {{tried to get the}} album banned in the United States, saying it depicted an act of witchcraft.|$|R
50|$|The term {{aerodynamic}} levitation {{could be}} applied to many objects that use gas pressure to counter the force of gravity, and allow stable levitation. Helicopters and air <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> are two good examples of objects that are aerodynamically levitated. However, more recently this term has also been associated with a scientific technique which uses a cone-shaped nozzle allowing stable levitation of 1-3mm diameter spherical samples without the need for active control mechanisms.|$|R
2500|$|Ice {{hockey is}} a full contact sport and carries {{a high risk of}} injury. Players are moving at speeds around {{approximately}} [...] and quite a bit of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players. Skate blades, hockey sticks, shoulders, hips, and <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> all contribute. The types of injuries associated with hockey include: lacerations, concussions, contusions, ligament tears, broken bones, hyperextensions, and muscle strains. Women's ice hockey players can have contact but are not allowed to body check.|$|R
2500|$|... to {{a family}} of {{solutions}} which are not distinguishable from the kinematic motion's characteristics. Furthermore, closed kinematic chains, such as swinging a bat or shooting a <b>hockey</b> <b>puck,</b> require the measurement of internal forces (in the bat or stick) be made before shoulder, elbow or wrist moments and forces can be derived.|$|E
2500|$|Ice hockey {{requires}} a hard disk of vulcanized rubber. A standard ice <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> is black, [...] thick, [...] in diameter, and weighs between some pucks are heavier or lighter than standard (see below). Pucks are often marked with silkscreened team or league logos {{on one or}} both faces. Pucks are frozen before the game to reduce bouncing during play.|$|E
2500|$|Ice {{hockey pucks}} of {{regulation}} [...] diameter and [...] thickness {{may be used}} as mechanical vibration dampening isolators in places such as feet for light industrial air compressors, and air conditioning units because they are of regulation materials and therefore consistent manufacture, size and shape, and are constructed of a repeatable and consistent vulcanized rubber material. [...] Since the material is rubber, it may be drilled out or milled easily to a fixed depth as rubber feet or used as rubber spacer or gasket material. [...] A very common use of a slotted <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> is as an adaptor between the metal foot of a trolley jack and the sill (rocker panel) of an automobile. [...] The sill has a spot-welded lip which fits into the slot of the puck and would otherwise be bent or marked by the metal foot. [...] Hockey pucks have been used to level furniture, beverage refrigeration systems, and as paper weights or door stops. [...] The <b>hockey</b> <b>puck</b> has many uses other than its original, intended purpose by virtue of its consistent physical properties.|$|E
2500|$|Impact {{energies}} {{of at least}} 50 joules {{are estimated to be}} required to cause cardiac arrest, when applied in the right time and spot of the precordium of an adult. Impacts [...] up to 130 joules have already been measured with <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> and lacrosse balls, 450 joules in karate punches, and 1028 joules in boxer Rocky Marciano's punch. The 50-joule threshold, however, can be considerably lowered when the victim's heart is under ischemic conditions, such as in coronary artery insufficiency.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{use of the}} mockumentary format in {{television}} comedy {{may be seen in}} several sketches from Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969-1974), such as [...] "Hell's Grannies", [...] "Piranha Brothers", and [...] "The Funniest Joke in the World". The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour (1970-1971) also featured mockumentary pieces which interspersed both scripted and real-life man-in-the-street interviews, the most famous likely being [...] "The Puck Crisis" [...] in which <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> were claimed to have become infected with a form of Dutch elm disease.|$|R
50|$|Ice {{hockey is}} a full contact sport and carries {{a high risk of}} injury. Players are moving at speeds around {{approximately}} 20 - 30 mph and quite a bit of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players.
