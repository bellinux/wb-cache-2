5|$|The ice trade {{enabled the}} {{consumption}} {{of a wide range}} of new products during the 19th century.

Iced milk also popular, and German lager, traditionally drunk chilled, also used <b>ice.</b> <b>Drinks</b> such as sherry-cobblers and mint juleps were created that could only be made using crushed ice. There were distinct differences in 19th-century American and European attitudes to adding <b>ice</b> directly to <b>drinks,</b> with the Europeans regarding this as an unpleasant habit; British visitors to India were surprised to see the Anglo-Indian elite prepared to <b>drink</b> <b>iced</b> water.
