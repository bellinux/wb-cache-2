She said of Ford, [...] "When I was 15, {{one of the few}} people who said, 'Well done', was my drama teacher, and she was really brilliant. She was a powerful woman. Those women change your life.

30|$|Happiness (xingfu) is {{a modern}} word from Japan’s late {{imperial}} period that began {{to be used in}} the early twentieth century (Chen 2014). A concept influenced by Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, xingfu encompasses friendship, learning, self-knowledge, virtue and living in simplicity. Colloquially, to say that someone is happy (xingfu) could mean that one <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> one’s life, that their relationships with friends and family (especially parents) are good. To say, “my family is happy (wo jiating hen xingfu),” might indicate that my parents are healthy, my children are well, that I have lots of friends, and personal accomplishments (like career or material wealth).|$|R

Alan Sepinwall of The Star Ledger wrote [...] "so the amazing four-year journey of Battlestar Galactica comes to an end, and I <b>feel</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> it-even as I suspect others may not." [...] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times praised Moore and the writing team for [...] "not copping out" [...] and commented that it was [...] "hard to imagine a more visually and thematically satisfying finale".

[...] He concluded that the episode was ultimately satisfying, noting that [...] "most of the major questions were dealt with in some form or another." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2000, Oracle Corporation hired {{a detective}} agency to {{investigate}} two research groups that supported Microsoft during the antitrust trial. After attempting to buy garbage, the agency discovered {{that those two}} research groups were falsely identifying themselves as independent advocacy groups {{when they were in}} reality funded by Microsoft. Oracle and the hired detective agency may have acted in questionable matters to obtain that information, but they believe that the outcome justifies their actions. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chairman, says: “I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> what we did. … Maybe our investigation organization may have done things unsavoury, but it's not illegal.

5000|$|There is a 2.16 acre (8,740 m2) hole (officially {{known as}} the [...] "Keystone Pit") in the refuge, which manager Steven Klett has wanted to fill in order to revitalize the hammock habitat. The pit was dug 30 to 40 years ago {{in order to obtain}} fossilized coral to build and {{decorate}} fireplaces and other types of architecture (much of the limestone rock was mined as well). According to an article published by McClatchy-Tribune Business News, [...] "ever-growing piles of muck from widening U.S. 1 north of Key Largo could be used to fill in a gaping hole in the Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge". The muck from the construction of the highway will most likely be used to help fill in the hole on the refuge. The main purpose of re-filling the hole is to populate the hardwood hammock by planting native vegetation in the area. The material referred to as 'muck' contains organic substances which will enhance the vegetation growth. Scientists in the area have claimed the substance to contain no damaging chemicals that would possibly harm animals or rather, the ecosystem. Originally, US Highway 1 had evacuated the muck in order to improve road conditions near the refuge. [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> possibly being able to solve our problem and the [...] problem," [...] Klett said in an interview. The Department of Transportation was required to move the muck in an effort to clean up the area; however, staff at the refuge decided to ask for permission to use the muck (layering 36 inches) for gaping the hole.|$|E
