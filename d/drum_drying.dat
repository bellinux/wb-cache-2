50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>drying</b> is {{a method}} used for drying out liquids from raw {{materials}} with drying drum. In the drum-drying process, pureed raw ingredients are dried at relatively low temperatures over rotating, high-capacity drums that produce sheets of drum-dried product.

Modern <b>drum</b> <b>drying</b> techniques results in dried ingredients which reconstitute immediately and retain much of their original flavor, color and nutritional value.|$|E

Low value dairy {{products such as}} lactose and acid whey, pose a huge opportunity to be converted into value-added products. This research evaluated the effect of formula and processing conditions on the polymerization of lactose by reactive extrusion into indigestible oligomers. Three citric acid concentrations (2 %, 4 % and 6 %) and two feed rates (15 kg/hr and 30 kg/hr) were evaluated for their effect on the polymerization of lactose. Samples extruded at 15 kg/hr resulted in a higher yield of indigestible oligomers (46. 7 - 56. 4 %) than at 30 kg/hr (33. 7 - 43. 5 %). A successful cleanup procedure for Greek yogurt acid whey was developed {{so that it could}} be concentrated and <b>drum</b> <b>dried.</b> Heat treating the acid whey resulted in a reduction of protein, fat, and moisture.

5000|$|In {{the most}} common case, a gas stream, e.g., air, applies the heat by {{convection}} and carries away the vapor as humidity.

Another indirect technique is <b>drum</b> <b>drying</b> (used, for instance, for manufacturing potato flakes), where a heated surface is used to provide the energy, and aspirators draw the vapor outside the room.

50|$|Fruits can be {{dried whole}} (e.g., grapes, berries, apricot, plum), in halves, or as slices, (e.g., mango, papaya, kiwi).

Food manufacturing plants use dried fruits in various sauces, soups, marinades, garnishes, puddings, and food for infants and children.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find innovative approaches for the production of iron fortified noodles that are natural and economically feasible. The functional food was produced using different combinations. The investigated variables were the ratio of sorghum to white bean flour, pre-gelatinized flours (<b>drum</b> <b>dried</b> or extruded) and guar gum addition while the emulsifier added was kept constant. Investigated parameters were the iron content and its bioavailability, as well as the functional properties (cooking weight, cooking time, cooking loss and texture) of the noodles. Results of the study showed that the content of white bean in the noodles had a direct influence on the iron content and bioavailability. As expected, the iron content and bioavailability was higher the higher the amount of white bean added. Additionally, the iron content and bioavailability was affected by the addition of guar gum and the pregelatinised flours. Iron content of noodles decreased with the increase of guar gum content while the addition of white bean pregelatinised flour showed an increase in the iron content and bioavailability. On examination of the functional properties, the 50 % white bean noodles gave the best results in terms of texture, cooking loss, cooking time and cooking weight. Cooking time, cooking weight and cooking loss were comparable to that of durum wheat noodles. Noodles prepared with 50 % white bean flour and pregelatinized flours (extruded or <b>drum</b> <b>dried)</b> received the best rankings in the sensory evaluation. The result of this study showed that the higher the amount of white bean added, the superior was the noodle quality, therefore fulfilling the requirements of the objectives i. e. good quality noodles with high iron content and bioavailability.
