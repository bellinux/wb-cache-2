5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan {{demonstrates that the}} female is continuously <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> quality of the male and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered {{by the arrival of}} a new male in a neighboring territory {{at the beginning of a}} new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male’s territory, <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E
