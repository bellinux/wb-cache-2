Towards the end of the 1950s, pressures to create a Legislative Council eventually led to a proclamation in December 1960 that the EAC and AAC would be dissolved in April 1961, and two new bodies, a Legislative Council and African Council, would be elected. The new Legislative Council had eleven directly elected members, ten of which were elected by Europeans and one by the Asian population. There were also ten indirectly elected African members, who were chosen by the African Council, as well as ten colonial officials and some co-opted members. The African Council was partly elected, with elected members sitting alongside the leaders of the eight chiefdoms.|$|E

40|$|Many {{people would}} not {{consider}} their family complete without a pet. Unfortunately, for some pet owners, circumstances arise that prevent them {{from being able to}} properly care for their companions and pet abandonment {{has become one of the}} most common pathways of vertebrate species introduction. It is also one of the most challenging pathways to address once the animals become established, eradication and control programs face significant public scrutiny and are often challenged by “animal rights” groups. Prevention measures are thus the key to minimizing the size and impacts of the “pet release pathway. ” Habitattitude™ is a proactive campaign designed and implemented by the Pet Industry <b>Joint</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Council</b> and partners to prevent the introduction of unwanted pets into natural systems. The campaign has three components: (1) educating consumers to make wise pet choices, (2) providing resources to enable high standards in animal care and maintenance, and (3) encouraging pet owners to choose among several alternatives to the release of their pets if problems do arise. Habitattitude™ messages are being promoted in pet stores, product advertisements, industry trade shows, and industry-relevant magazines...|$|E

40|$|As museums {{continue}} to emphasize engaging audiences and meeting community needs, some utilize <b>advisory</b> <b>councils</b> to deepen {{relationships with their}} communities. This thesis examines community-based <b>advisory</b> <b>councils</b> and the potential they have when used in museums for serving community needs. A survey was conducted of AAM accredited museums in California to reveal if museums showed evidence of <b>advisory</b> <b>councils</b> on their websites. Three museums with community-based <b>advisory</b> <b>councils</b> were then selected as case studies. Based on this research, {{it was concluded that}} discussion and sources within the museum field about the use of <b>advisory</b> <b>councils</b> is limited, creating the need for the development of standards and best practices.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this econometric {{analysis}} is to model the concentration of particle number emissions from a hybrid diesel-electric bus in terms of operating characteristics. Important aspects {{of this study are}} that particle number concentrations are modeled instead of particle mass, and the emissions are recorded using on-board instrumentation in real-world driving conditions. The operating characteristics included in the final models are two engine parameters: fuel rate and engine speed and two vehicle parameters: velocity and acceleration. The emissions data possess properties that frequently cause problems in regression analysis: nonstationarity, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation. Methods for overcoming and/or minimizing the effects of these properties are implemented. The Newey-West autocorrelation consistent covariance estimator is implemented using ordinary least squares (OLS) to produce a model that accounts for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation, without requiring assumptions to be made about the structure of the model disturbances. A first-order autoregressive process is used with feasible generalized least squares as a comparative model. Both models have similar coefficients, fit and predictive capability. However the models are specific in scope to typical freeway driving conditions. In future studies, the researchers anticipate applying econometric analysis to model particle number emissions among different routes, bus technologies, aftertreatments, and atmospheric conditions.
