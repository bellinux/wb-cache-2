5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} customers {{at a local}} gas station whenever he saw somebody that looked like they fit one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the creature was left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel {{into the trunk of}} his car and drove to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small post-production company and agreed to work on the film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. <b>He</b> <b>cleaned</b> the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E
5|$|Haynes' father {{attended}} the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 {{where he learned}} of a school that would fit his son's interests. Using the money he had saved, Haynes decided to attend the college and enrolled in the Worcester Technical Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, in September 1878. The school was revolutionary for its time, combining technical training with a classical liberal arts education. Although he easily passed the difficult entrance exam, he {{found that he was}} ill-prepared for some of his college courses, and he struggled with mathematics. To earn an income while away from home, he worked as a custodian and night guard at the local public library. <b>He</b> <b>cleaned</b> the building overnight and used his spare time to read books and study. During his final year at the school, boarding rates were increased beyond what Haynes could afford so with no other option, he lived in the library for several months. He could not afford to return home during his stay at the institute, so during the holidays he spent time with his family and friends in New England.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill {{started the}} 1964–65 {{tour of the}} West Indies strongly, scoring a century in the first match against Jamaica. He was often injured during the tour, but was at his most {{productive}} with the bat since the last series against the Caribbean team four years earlier. He made many starts, passing 20 in six of his seven Test innings, {{but was unable to}} convert them into big scores. In the First Test, O'Neill was struck on the hand by Wes Hall and was sent to hospital for X-rays after a break was suspected. During the Second Test, it was the turn of Charlie Griffith to send O'Neill to hospital, after hitting him on the forearm and causing a large bruise. His 51 and 74* in the Fourth Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, the last Test of his career, was the only time he passed 50 for the series. He ended with 266 runs at 44.33, missing the Fifth Test due to a broken hand. He managed a healthy return with the ball, taking nine of his 17 Test wickets in the series with an average of 25.55. This included his Test best of 4/41 with his leg-spinin the Second Test in Port of Spain, Trinidad. In this match, <b>he</b> <b>cleaned</b> up the hosts' tail in the first innings, removing Jackie Hendriks, Wes Hall, Charlie Griffith and Lance Gibbs.|$|E

While in Portland, Brown mailed a package containing clothes and golf equipment to his brother David John Brown II in San Diego. On April 20, 2005, David Brown was indicted for obstruction of justice.

25|$|Ireland {{said he was}} heterosexual– he {{had been}} married twice– and that he pretended to be gay only to befriend {{potential}} victims. Ireland claimed that his motives were not sexually motivated. He was highly organised, and carried a full murder kit of rope and handcuffs and a full change of clothes to each murder. After killing his victim <b>he</b> <b>cleaned</b> the flat of any forensic evidence linking him to the scene and stayed in the flat until morning {{in order to avoid}} arousing suspicion from leaving {{in the middle of the}} night.|$|E

25|$|From 1784, and {{for almost}} fifteen years, he was Governor of Córdoba, {{distinguishing}} {{himself as an}} excellent administrator. <b>He</b> <b>cleaned</b> and repaired the city streets, ordered {{the construction of the}} first water system, carrying running water to Córdoba from the Primero River, and also the construction of defenses against river flooding.

Improved the justice system which was lacking in attentio due to the distance to Buenos Aires.|$|E
25|$|Labre had an uncle, {{a parish}} priest, living some {{distance}} from his family home; this uncle gladly received him, and undertook his early education for the priesthood. At the age of sixteen, he approached his uncle about becoming a Trappist monk, but his parents {{told him he would}} have to wait until he grew older. When Benedict was about eighteen, an epidemic fell upon the city, and uncle and nephew busied themselves {{in the service of the}} sick. While the uncle took care of the souls and bodies of the people, Benedict went to and fro caring for the cattle. <b>He</b> <b>cleaned</b> their stalls and fed them; exchanging the life of a farm laborer for that of a student under his uncle's roof. Among the last victims of the epidemic was the uncle himself.|$|E
25|$|During the 2007 Cricket World Cup Super 8 {{match on}} 28 March between Sri Lanka and South Africa, Malinga {{became the first}} player to take four wickets in four {{consecutive}} balls in One Day International cricket. Needing five runs for victory and with five wickets in hand, Malinga was handed the ball in the 45th over of the South African's innings. In the final two balls of the over <b>he</b> <b>cleaned</b> bowled Shaun Pollock and had Andrew Hall caught at cover. In his next over, he removed Jacques Kallis caught behind then bowled Makhaya Ntini. This was only the fifth hat-trick in World Cup history, the third ODI hat-trick for Sri Lanka and the 24th overall in ODIs. He nearly took the final wicket as a ball shaved the stumps. Despite Malinga's lethal spell, however, South Africa proceeded to win the match by 1 wicket with 10 balls still left.|$|E

25|$|As Barât's {{birthday}} approached, Doherty organised {{a special}} celebration gig {{in an attempt}} to smooth the tensions between them. Barât, however, was already attending a party organized by some of his friends, and the hosts convinced him not to leave. Doherty was left to play the gig himself. Feeling betrayed, Doherty neglected to take the train to Germany the next day for the Libertines' European tour. The Libertines were forced to play without Doherty: a guitar technician learned his guitar parts and several songs were dropped altogether. Soon, however, positions changed and it was Barât who refused to let Doherty into the band unless <b>he</b> <b>cleaned</b> himself up. Doherty continued to play with separate musical project Babyshambles whilst the Libertines completed tour commitments in Japan without him. Distraught and angry, Doherty burgled Barât's flat and was subsequently arrested. On 11 August, he pleaded guilty at the preliminary hearing to the charge of burglary.|$|E
500|$|... is a 33-year-old Hume sky pirate from Balfonheim. In truth, he was {{originally}} the missing Judge Magister [...] of Archadia. In {{the war with}} Nabradia, {{he was responsible for}} the Midlight Shard destroying the kingdom under orders from Cid without being told what the effect would be. Filled with guilt, he abandoned his post and took on the name [...] "Reddas", arriving in Balfonheim where <b>he</b> <b>cleaned</b> up the town and became a patron to pirates. He was eventually approached by Ondore who asked that he retrieve deifacted nethicite, the shards of the Sun-Cryst, from Doctor Cid. Later, he accompanied Ashe to the Pharos at Ridorana to find the Sun-Cryst. When Cid activated the Sun-Cryst, Reddas sacrificed himself by using the Sword of Kings to destroy the crystal, unleashing an explosion which vaporized him and most of the upper Pharos. Reddas was voiced by Phil LaMarr in English and by Takayuki Sugo in Japanese.|$|E
500|$|As a {{so-called}} [...] "bleeding-heart conservative", Kemp was a logical choice for Bush as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, whose {{job would be}} to foster public sector and private sector methods {{to meet the demands}} of public housing. However, the scandals of Reagan's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce and the neglect of the president were obstacles from the start, and Kemp was unsuccessful at either of his major initiatives: enacting enterprise zones and promoting public housing tenant ownership. [...] The goal of these two plans was to change public housing into tenant-owned residences and to lure industry and business into inner cities with federal incentives. Although Kemp did not affect much policy as HUD's director, <b>he</b> <b>cleaned</b> up HUD's reputation, and developed a plan to salvage the troubled Federal Housing Administration. He halted or revamped corrupt programs and developed an antidrug offensive, which enabled him to collaborate with Director of the National Drug Control Policy Bill Bennett. He supported [...] "Operation Clean Sweep" [...] and similar movements to prohibit firearm possession in public housing.|$|E

500|$|The CSI {{effect may}} alter how crimes are committed. In 2000, {{the year that}} CSI: Crime Scene Investigation debuted, 46.9 percent of all rape cases in the United States were {{resolved}} by police. By 2005, the rate had fallen to 41.3 percent. [...] Some investigators attributed this decline to the CSI effect, as crime shows often explain in detail how criminals can conceal or destroy evidence. Several rape victims have reported that their assailants forced them to shower or clean themselves with bleach after their assaults. In December 2005, Jermaine McKinney broke into a home in Trumbull County, Ohio, where he murdered two women. [...] A fan of CSI, McKinney went to unusual lengths to remove evidence of his crime: <b>he</b> <b>cleaned</b> his hands with bleach, burned the bodies and his clothing, and attempted {{to dispose of the}} murder weapon in a lake. McKinney was eventually apprehended. Ray Peavy, head of the Los Angeles County homicide division, commented that, in addition to teaching criminals how to conceal evidence, crime shows may even [...] "encourage them when they see how simple it is to get away with [...] on television." ...|$|E
500|$|Welles's biographer Simon Callow has {{compared}} Falstaff to Welles's father Richard Head Welles, {{stating that}} like Falstaff, Welles's father was [...] "a drunkard, a trickster, a braggart, a womanizer, a gentleman and a charmerand he is {{rejected by the}} person he loves the most." [...] Welles's father was an alcoholic and womanizer who would often take a teenage Welles along {{with him when he}} was indulging in his vices. Welles observed his father much like Falstaff is observed by Hal and depends on his young protégé to bail him out of trouble. The love triangle between Prince Hal and his two father figures, Henry IV and Falstaff, is also similar to Welles's relationships with his father and the two men who became surrogate fathers to him: family friend Dr. Maurice Bernstein and Todd School for Boys headmaster Roger Hill. Both of Welles's surrogate fathers disapproved of Richard Welles's lifestyle and negative influence on Welles. When the younger Welles turned fifteen, he took the advice of Roger Hill and told his father that he would not see him again until <b>he</b> <b>cleaned</b> up his act and stopped drinking; Welles's father died shortly afterwards, alone and lonely, and Welles always blamed himself for his father's death, stating, [...] "I always thought I killed him." ...|$|E
