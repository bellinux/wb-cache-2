5000|$|Before the 19th century, hay {{was cut by}} {{hand and}} most {{typically}} stored in haystacks using <b>hay</b> <b>forks</b> to rake and gather the scythed grasses into optimal sized heaps [...] - [...] neither too large (promoting conditions that might create spontaneous combustion), nor too small, {{so much of the}} pile is susceptible to rotting. These haystacks lifted most of the plant fibers up off the ground, letting air in and water drain out, so the grasses could dry and cure, to retain nutrition for livestock feed at a later time. In the 1860s mechanical cutting devices were developed; from these came the modern devices including mechanical mowers and balers. In 1872 a reaper that used a knotter device to bundle and bind hay was invented by Charles Withington; this was commercialized in 1874 by Cyrus McCormick. [...] In 1936, Innes invented an automatic baler that tied bales with twine using Appleby-type knotters from a John Deere grain binder; an improved version patented by Ed Nolt in 1939 was more reliable and became commonly used.|$|R

It is a woodworking tool used in Germany prior to the industrial revolution. It was in regular use in colonial New England, and in the Appalachian region until early in the 20th century; it is still in use by specialist artisans today. In America it {{is known as a}} shaving horse. It uses the mechanical advantage of a foot-operated lever to securely clamp the object to be carved. The shaving horse is used in combination with the drawknife or spokeshave to cut down green or seasoned wood, to accomplish jobs such as handling an ax; creating wooden rakes, <b>hay</b> <b>forks,</b> walking sticks, etc. The shaving horse was used by various trades, from farmer to basketmaker and wheelwright.|$|R

6000|$|Their {{carriage}} {{had climbed}} from Carlsbad in long irregular curves to the breezy upland where the great highroad to Prague ran through fields of harvest. They had come by heights and slopes of forest, where the serried stems {{of the tall}} firs showed brown and whitish-blue and grew straight as stalks of grain; and now on either side the farms opened under a sky of unwonted cloudlessness. Narrow strips of wheat and rye, which the men were cutting with sickles, and the women in red bodices were binding, alternated with ribands of yellowing oats and grass, and breadths of beets and turnips, with now and then lengths of ploughed land. In the meadows the peasants were piling their carts with heavy rowen, the girls lifting the <b>hay</b> on the <b>forks,</b> and the men giving themselves the lighter labor of ordering the load. From the upturned earth, where there {{ought to have been}} troops of strutting crows, a few sombre ravens rose. But they could not rob the scene of its gayety; it smiled in the sunshine with colors which vividly followed the slope of the land till they were dimmed in the forests on the far-off mountains. Nearer and farther, the cottages and villages shone in the valleys, or glimmered through the veils of the distant haze. Over all breathed the keen pure air of the hills, with a sentiment of changeless eld, which charmed March, back to his boyhood, where he lost the sense of his wife's presence, and answered her vaguely. She talked contentedly on in the monologue to which the wives of absent-minded men learn to resign themselves. They were both roused from their vagary by the voice of General Triscoe.

5000|$|Historical {{records show}} that Stewarton has existed {{since at least the}} 12th century with various non-historical {{references}} to the town dating to the early 11th century. The most famous of these non-historical references concerns the legend of Máel Coluim III the son of Donnchad I of Scotland who appears as a character in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth. As the legend goes, Mac Bethad had slain Donnchad to enable himself to become king of Scotland and immediately turned his attention towards Donnchad's son Máel Coluim (the next in line to the throne). When Máel Coluim learned of his father's death and Mac Bethad's intentions to murder him, he fled for the relative safety of England. Unfortunately for Máel Coluim, Mac Bethad and his associates had tracked him down and were gaining on him as he entered the estate of Corsehill on the edge of Stewarton. In panic Máel Coluim pleaded for the assistance of a nearby farmer named either Friskine or Máel Coluim (accounts differ) who was <b>forking</b> <b>hay</b> on the estate. Friskine/Máel Coluim covered Máel Coluim in hay, allowing him to escape Mac Bethad and his associates. He later found refuge with King Harthacanute, who reigned as Canute II, King of England and Norway and in 1057, after returning to Scotland and defeating Mac Bethad in the Battle of Lumphanan in 1057 to become King of Scots, he rewarded Friskine's family with the Baillie of Cunninghame to show his gratitude to the farmer who had saved his life 17 years earlier. The Cunninghame family logo now features a [...] "Y" [...] shaped fork with the words [...] "over fork over" [...] underneath - a logo which appears in various places in Stewarton, notably as the logo of the two primary schools in the area - Lainshaw primary school and Nether Robertland primary school. Another reference to Stewarton, this time a historical recorded version, is that one Wernebald was given the Cunninghame lands by his superior, Hugh de Morville, the builder of Kilwinning Abbey who lived at this time in Tour near Kirkland in Kilmaurs. The family were originally from Morville in Normandy (Wernebald was from Flanders) and had been established in Scotland for at least twenty years when one of the family was involved in the murder of Thomas Becket. Dervorguilla of Galloway, mother of John Balliol, was a daughter of the Morvilles on her mother's side, and when Robert the Bruce won the crown the family of Balliol lost their lands in Cunninghame. The Red Comyn, whom Bruce murdered, was a nephew of Balliol. William Cunninghame de Lamberton was Archbishop of St. Andrews and a supporter of Bruce.|$|R

[...] But what he liked was someone to encourage. [...] Them that he couldn't lead he'd get behind [...] And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing-- [...] Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off. [...] I'd seen about enough of his bulling tricks [...] (We call that bulling). I'd been watching him. [...] So when he paired off with me in the hayfield [...] To load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble. [...] I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders [...] Combed it down with a rake and says, 'O. K.' [...] Everything went well till we reached the barn [...] With a big catch to empty in a bay. [...] You understand that meant the easy job [...] For the man up on top of throwing down [...] The hay and rolling it off wholesale, [...] Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting. [...] You wouldn't think a fellow'd need much urging [...] Under these circumstances, would you now? [...] But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands, [...] And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit, [...] Shouts like an army captain, 'Let her come!' [...] Thinks I, D'ye mean it? 'What was that you said?' [...] I asked out loud, so's there'd be no mistake, [...] 'Did you say, Let her come?' 'Yes, let her come.' [...] He said it over, but he said it softer. [...] Never you say a thing like that to a man, [...] Not if he values what he is. God, I'd as soon [...] Murdered him as left out his middle name.

He squeaked like a squeezed rat. [...] That was the last I saw or heard of him. [...] I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off. [...] As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck, [...] And sort of waiting to be asked about it, [...] One of the boys sings out, 'Where's the old man?' [...] 'I left him in the barn under the hay. [...] If ye want him, ye can go and dig him out.' [...] They realized from the way I swobbed my neck [...] More than was needed something must be up.

'Go keep his wife [...] Out of the barn.' Someone looked in a window, [...] And curse me if he wasn't in the kitchen [...] Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet [...] Stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer. [...] He looked so clean disgusted from behind [...] There was no one that dared to stir him up, [...] Or let him know that he was being looked at.

5000|$|In the U.S., older barns {{were built}} from timbers hewn from {{trees on the}} farm and built as a log crib barn or timber frame, {{although}} stone barns were sometimes built in areas where stone was a cheaper building material. In {{the mid to late}} 19th century in the U.S. barn framing methods began to shift away from traditional timber framing to [...] "truss framed" [...] or [...] "plank framed" [...] buildings. Truss or plank framed barns reduced the number of timbers instead using dimensional lumber for the rafters, joists, and sometimes the trusses. The joints began to become bolted or nailed instead of being mortised and tenoned. The inventor and patentee of the Jennings Barn claimed his design used less lumber, less work, less time, and less cost to build and were durable and provided more room for hay storage. Mechanization on the farm, better transportation infrastructure, and new technology like a <b>hay</b> <b>fork</b> mounted on a track contributed to a need for larger, more open barns, sawmills using steam power could produce smaller pieces of lumber affordably, and machine cut nails were much less expensive than hand-made (wrought) nails. Concrete block began to be used for barns in the early 20th century in the U.S.|$|E
5000|$|Plank-framed barns are {{different}} than a plank-framed house. Plank framed barns developed in the American Mid-West, such as the patente in 1876 (#185,690) by William Morris and Joseph Slanser of La Rue, Ohio shows (several other patents followed). Sometimes they were also called a joist frame, rib frame and trussed frame barns. Built of a “Construction in which none of the material used is larger than 2 inches thick.” rather than solid timbers. The reduction in availability of timber for barn building and experience with scantling framing resulted {{in the development of}} this lightweight barn framing using planks (“joists”) rather than timbers. Some stated advantages: cheaper, faster, no interior posts needed, use any length lumber, less skill, less lumber (either purchased or self-produced), “stronger”, lighter, all lumber can be purchased from a lumber yard, less labor, heavy timber getting scarce. Also, they were often similar to the Jennings barn design of 1879 (patent #218,031) with no tie beam so there were no beams to interfere with a <b>hay</b> <b>fork</b> (horse fork) on a track system (hay carrier) for pitching hay which became popular c. 1877. The gambrel roof shape lends itself to plank truss construction and became the most popular roof type. Plank frame barns were available by mail-order by 1910 from Chicago. Syn joist-frame, Shawver plank-frame and Wing plank-frame. “In large construction, such as barn framing, there are two general systems, the braced, pin-joint frame, made of heavy timbers, and the plank frame, made up of two inch planking, either {{in the form of the}} ‘plank truss’ or the ‘balloon frame.’” (Architectural Drawing and Design of Farm Structures, 1915) ...|$|E
