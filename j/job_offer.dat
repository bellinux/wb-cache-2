5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, {{the ranking}} Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, {{sent a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal for a government employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill Clinton to offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E

30|$|Ideally, all {{the real}} estate agent <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> posted in the Paris area should have the same {{probability}} of being tested. However, this requirement is physically impossible to meet. In this study, we focus only on <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> available in the website of Pole Emploi 16. This website centralizes most of the <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> for real estate agents. By taking this step, we introduce a possible bias into our results. Indeed, we cannot be sure that recruiters using the Pole Emploi website behave {{in the same way as}} recruiters prospecting on others channels for job search 17. More broadly, our results are biased in view of the fact that we test only one channel for job search. From this perspective, our study probably tends to underestimate hiring discrimination. However, the Pole Emploi website is still one of the most frequently used websites for job search, and it has the advantage of providing <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> with very detailed characteristics (wage offered, work experience required, etc.), which is not the case with others websites 18. Thus, we privileged the testing of <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> whose characteristics are identified (in particular the work experience requirement) rather than testing <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> whose characteristics are unknown and for which we are not sure that at least one of our applicants has the opportunity of being called back.|$|R

In the opening chapter, the dean of his architecture school tells Roark that the best architecture must copy the past rather than innovate or improve. Roark repeatedly loses jobs with architectural firms and commissions from clients because he is unwilling to copy conventional architectural styles. In contrast, Keating's mimicry of convention brings him top honors in school and an immediate <b>job</b> <b>offer.</b> The same conflict between innovation and tradition is reflected in the career of Roark's mentor, Henry Cameron.|$|E

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} if unemployed and employed individuals differ in their willingness to accept <b>job</b> <b>offers.</b> Standard economic theory in general and search and matching theories in particular expect that unemployed individuals can increase their chances of finding employment quicker by a higher willingness to relocate for a new job. However, strong regional differences in both unemployment rates and vacancies at the same time point to a fundamental problem in the labour market, namely matching individuals to jobs. This motivates our research, because up to now it is still not clear, whether this matching problem is the result of a lack of access to vacancies or of lacking willingness to accept (interregional) <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> on the side of unemployed individuals. On the one hand, <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> might be declined because of high mobility costs or a low willingness to work on the part of the unemployed (supply-side factors). On the other hand, unemployed individuals might be denied attractive <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> (the demand-side explanation) and therefore display comparatively low levels of mobility despite their general willingness to accept interregional <b>job</b> <b>offers.</b>|$|R

30|$|In this study, {{we take a}} {{step forward}} in {{investigating}} these questions by analysing the willingness to accept <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> in circumstance in which all individuals {{have access to the}} same <b>job</b> <b>offers.</b> Our approach is based on an experimental factorial survey module (FSM) that was incorporated into the Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS), a large-scale population survey with an over-representation of unemployed persons that is annually conducted by the German Institute for Employment Research (IAB) (see Trappmann et al. 2010 for an overview). Approximately 4, 200 employed or unemployed respondents available to the labour market evaluated their willingness to accept hypothetical <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> (vignettes) that differed in experimentally varied characteristics, such as expected income, working hours, and regional distance from the respondent’s home. Analyses of these evaluations make it possible to identify the dimensions that affect the willingness to accept <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> or to relocate. 1 Moreover, {{as a result of the}} experimental design, all of the respondents received <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> of the same quality, on average. Important demand-side characteristics are thereby standardised—in contrast to the real labour market. Thus, it is possible to focus solely on labour supply-side effects in the analysis. The PASS survey provides a sufficient number of cases for a comparison of unemployed and employed persons. These data facilitate an investigation of the dynamics of the decision-making process regarding <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> and testing of the assumptions derived from labour market and migration theories.|$|R

England had fallen to their heaviest Test defeat on Australian soil, losing 15 wickets {{in the space of}} 210 minutes on the fifth day. Miller's highly productive Ashes debut led to further speculation as to whether he was willing to end his Test career to turn professional in England.

As vignette sample a fractionalized, D-efficient design of 500 different vignettes was used (for details, see Frodermann et al. 2013). This design minimises correlations among the vignette dimensions, which enables estimation of their independent influences. 9 The respondents were confronted with random selections of five vignettes each. The experimental design (standardisation and random allocation of <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> to respondents to prevent correlations between dimensions and respondent characteristics) makes it possible to observe whether decision making differs between respondent groups if all of the respondents receive similar <b>job</b> <b>offers.</b>|$|R

30|$|Matching {{individuals}} to jobs {{is a fundamental}} problem in any labour market. This paper focuses on job characteristics, such as wages, job quality, and distance from the current place of residence, {{and the impact of}} these characteristics on the willingness of employed and unemployed {{individuals to}} accept new <b>job</b> <b>offers.</b> Using an experimental factorial survey module (FSM) implemented in the fifth wave of a large population survey (Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security), the willingness of employed and unemployed labour market participants to accept new <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> was compared while considering job characteristics like gain of income or commuting distance. In this study, unemployed and employed individuals received the same set of hypothetical <b>job</b> <b>offers.</b> Consistent with theoretical arguments, the about 20, 000 evaluations provided by about 4, 000 respondents showed that unemployed participants generally exhibit a greater willingness to accept new <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> than employed ones. Moreover, unemployed individuals were likely to make more concessions than employed individuals with respect to job quality, such as accepting fixed-term <b>job</b> <b>offers.</b> Interestingly, little evidence for different decision-making or weightings of mobility costs was found, which enables us to conclude that interregional unemployment disparities can scarcely be explained by unemployed individuals lacking the willingness to work or relocate.|$|R
