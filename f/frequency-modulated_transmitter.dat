40|$|Phase {{measurements}} of waves reflecting {{from the lower}} regions of the ionosphere using frequencies in the range 15 to 100 kc/s furnish a new method of investigating the effects of solar activity on radio communication. In an effort to explore this method of measurement the Ionospheric Research Project of the California Institute of Technology constructed a complete 50 -kc/s station in the Mojave desert with the transmitter near Randsburg and the receiver near Victorville. This paper describes the equipment requirements of the station, and a paper by R. S. Macmillan (Cf. Ref. 1) will present the theoretical aspects of the data that were obtained. A crystal-controlled transmitter was used to drive a half-wave resonant dipole, which at 50 kc/s was 8600 feet long. The antenna pattern was such that radiated power was directed upward to the inosphere and thence back to the receiving site by means of reflection. The necessary reference signal {{was sent to the}} receiving site by means of a very-high-frequency, <b>frequency-modulated</b> <b>transmitter.</b> A double superheterodyne receiver received the 50 -kc/s signal and converted it to 1. 61 kc/s. This output was then compared by means of a phase meter with a 1. 61 -kc/s reference, derived from the 50 kc/s reference signal. The output of the phase meter was filtered (bandwidth= 1 c/s) and then recorded. A commercial field-strength meter (bandwidth= 350 c/s) was used in conjuction with this receiver to obtain the amplitude of the reflected wave...|$|E
40|$|A {{case-control study}} of radio {{frequency}} electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and childhood leukemia was con-ducted in West Germany. The study region included municipalities near high-power radio and TV broadcast towers, including 16 amplitude-modulated and 8 <b>frequency-modulated</b> <b>transmitters.</b> Cases were aged 0 – 14 years, {{were diagnosed with}} leukemia between 1984 and 2003, and were registered at the German Childhood Cancer Registry. Three age-, gender-, and transmitter-area-matched controls per case were drawn randomly from pop-ulation registries. The analysis included 1, 959 cases and 5, 848 controls. Individual exposure to RF-EMFs 1 year before diagnosis was estimated with a field strength prediction program. Considering total RF-EMFs, the odds ratio derived from conditional logistic regression analysis {{for all types of}} leukemia was 0. 86 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 67, 1. 11) when upper (95 %/ 0. 701 V/m) and lower (< 90 %/ 0. 504 V/m) quantiles of the RF-EMF distribution were compared. An analysis of amplitude-modulated and <b>frequency-modulated</b> <b>transmitters</b> separately did not show increased risks of leukemia. The odds ratio for all types of leukemia was 1. 04 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 65, 1. 67) among children living within 2 km of the nearest broadcast transmitter compared with those living at a distance of 10 –< 15 km. The data did not show any elevated risks of childhood leukemia associated with RF-EMFs. child; electromagnetic fields; leukemia; radiation, radio; televisio...|$|R
