40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a layer-model based method to segment moving objects from image sequence with accurate boundaries. The seg-mentation framework involves three stages: Motion seed detection, Mo-tion layer expansion and Motion boundary refinement. In the first stage, motion seeds, which determine {{the amount and}} initial position of motion layers, are detected by corner matching between consecutive frames, and classified by global motion analysis. In the second stage, the detected motion seeds are expanded into motion layers. To preserve the spatial continuity, an energy function is defined to evaluate the spatial smooth-ness and accuracy of the layers. Then, Graph Cuts technique is used to solve the energy minimization problem and <b>extract</b> motion <b>layers.</b> In the last stage, the <b>extracted</b> <b>layers</b> are combined with edge information to find accurate boundaries of moving objects.

Linking MOGs across frames then allows temporal consistency to be imposed and <b>layers</b> to be <b>extracted.</b> The approach provides a flexible framework within which to combine local and global constraints both spatially and temporally, enabling robust motion segmentation and layer extraction.
