50|$|The {{roots of}} both the term “fine chemicals” and the {{emergence}} of the <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>industry</b> as a distinct entity date back to the late 1970s, when the overwhelming success of the histamine H2 receptor antagonists Tagamet (cimetidine) and Zantac (ranitidine hydrochloride) created a strong demand for advanced organic chemicals used in their manufacturing processes. As the in-house production capacities of the originators, the pharmaceutical companies Smith, Kline & French and Glaxo, could not keep pace with the rapidly increasing requirements, both companies (now merged as GlaxoSmithKline) outsourced part of the manufacturing to chemical companies experienced in producing relatively sophisticated organic molecules. Lonza, Switzerland, which already had supplied an early intermediate, methyl acetoacetate, during drug development, soon became the main supplier of more and more advanced precursors. The signature of a first, simple supply contract is generally acknowledged as the historical document marking the beginning of the <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{products}} and services offered by the <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>industry</b> fall into two broad categories: (1) “Exclusives”, a.k.a. custom manufacturing (CM) and (2) “standard” or “catalogue” products. “Exclusives”, provided mostly under contract research or custom manufacturing arrangements, prevail in business with life science companies; “standards” prevail in other target markets. Service-intense custom manufacturing (CM) constitutes the most prominent activity of the <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>industry.</b> CM is the antonym of outsourcing. In custom manufacturing, a specialty-chemicals company outsources the process development, pilot plant, and, finally, industrial-scale production of an active ingredient, or a predecessor thereof, to one, or a few, fine chemical companies. The intellectual property of the product, and generally also the manufacturing process, stay with the customer. The customer-supplier relationship is governed by an exclusive supply agreement. At the beginning of cooperation, the customer provides a “tech package,” which in its simplest version, includes a laboratory synthesis description and SHE recommendations. In this case, the whole scale up, which comprises a factor of about one million (10 gram → 10 ton quantities), {{is done by the}} fine chemical company.|$|E
5000|$|Within the {{chemical}} universe, the <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>industry</b> is positioned between the commodity, their suppliers, and specialty chemical industries, their customers. Depending on the services offered, {{there are two}} types of fine chemical companies. The Fine Chemical Companies are active in industrial scale production, both of standard and exclusive products. If the latter prevails, they are referred to as Fine Chemical / Custom Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs). The main assets of the Contract Research Organizations (CROs) are their research laboratories. CRAMS; Contract Research and Manufacturing Organizations [...] are hybrids (see section 4.2).|$|E

50|$|The growing {{complexity}} and potency of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals requiring production in multipurpose, instead of dedicated plants and, more recently, {{the advent of}} biopharmaceuticals had {{a major impact on}} the demand for fine chemicals and the evolution of the <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>industry</b> as a distinct entity. For many years, however, the life science industry continued considering captive production of the active ingredients of their drugs and agrochemicals as a core competency. Outsourcing was recurred to only in exceptional cases, such as capacity shortfalls, processes requiring hazardous chemistry or new products, where uncertainties subsisted about the chance of a successful launch.|$|E
50|$|The {{combined}} {{revenues of}} the top 20 fine chemical companies amounted to $10 billion in 2009, representing about 30% of the figure for the whole industry.

50|$|Fine {{chemicals}} {{account for}} about 4% of the universe of chemicals. The latter, valued at $2,500 billion, is dominated mainly by oil-, gas-, and mineral-derived commodities (~40%) {{on one hand and}} a large variety of specialty chemicals at the interface between industry and the public on the other hand (~55%). The global production value of fine chemicals is estimated at $85 billion, of which about 2/3, or $55 billion are produced captively and $30 billion represent the global revenues of the <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>industry.</b> The corresponding figures for the major user, the pharmaceutical industry, are $32 billion and $23 billion, respectively. For a number of reasons, such as the lack of statistical data and the somewhat equivocal definition {{it is not possible to}} exactly determine the size of the fine chemical market.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} the fate of {{persistent}} organic chemicals in the environment has revealed a large reservoir of enzymatic reactions with a large potential in preparative organic synthesis, which has already been exploited {{for a number of}} oxygenases on pilot and even on industrial scale. Novel catalysts can be obtained from metagenomic libraries and DNA sequence based approaches. Our increasing capabilities in adapting the catalysts to specific reactions and process requirements by rational and random mutagenesis broadens the scope for application in the <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>industry,</b> but also in the field of biodegradation. In many cases, these catalysts need to be exploited in whole cell bioconversions or in fermentations, calling for system-wide approaches to understanding strain physiology and metabolism and rational approaches to the engineering of whole cells as they are increasingly put forward in the area of systems biotechnology and synthetic biology.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{applications}} in eight areas, ranging from adhesives to specialty polymers, {{are listed in}} Table 8. Overall, the attractiveness for the <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>industry</b> is smaller than the life science industry. The total market, expressed in finished product sales, amounts to $150-200 billion, or about one fourth of the pharma market. The embedded fine chemicals account for an estimated $15 billion (see Table 5). Further disadvantages are the backward integration of the big players, e.g. Akzo-Nobel, Netherlands; Ajinomoto, Japan; Danone, France; Everlight Chemical Industrial Corp., Taiwan; Evonik-Degussa, Germany; Givaudan and Nestlé, Switzerland, Novozymes, Denmark, Procter & Gamble, and Unilever USA. Last but not least, innovation is rather based on new formulations of existing products, rather than {{the development of new}} fine chemicals. It is most likely to happen in application areas unrelated to human health (where NCEs are subject to very extensive testing).|$|E

30|$|Production of chiral {{compounds}} {{is an area}} {{of interest}} not only for pharmaceuticals but also in the <b>fine</b> <b>chemicals</b> <b>industry.</b> Synthesis of these compounds can be carried out either chemically or biologically. The fact that stereoisomers can differ in physical, chemical and biological properties is important and because of this, racemic mixtures have to be separated before use in industrial products and drug synthesis. However biological synthesis can have an important advantage over chemical synthesis in that only one of the stereoisomers may be produced. Additionally, chemical synthesis requires expensive catalysts, toxic solvents and harsh conditions, whereas biological synthesis of stereoisomers occurs in an aqueous environment under mild conditions.|$|R
50|$|The Koch {{reaction}} is an organic reaction for {{the synthesis of}} tertiary carboxylic acids from alcohols or alkenes. The {{reaction is}} a strongly acid-catalyzed carbonylation using carbon monoxide, and typically occurs at high pressures ranging from 50 to 5,000 kPa, often requiring temperatures several hundred degrees higher than room temperature. Generally the reaction is conducted with strong mineral acids such as sulfuric acid, HF or BF3. Large scale operations for the <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>industry</b> produce almost 150,000 tonnes of Koch acids and their derivatives annually but also generate {{a great deal of}} waste, motivating ongoing attempts to use metal, solid acid, and other novel catalysts to enable the use of milder reaction conditions. Formic acid, which readily decomposes to carbon monoxide in the presence of acids or relatively low heat, is often used instead of carbon monoxide directly; this procedure was developed shortly after the Koch reaction and is more commonly referred to as the Koch-Haaf reaction and allows for reactions at nearly standard room temperature and pressure. Some commonly industrially produced Koch acids include pivalic acid, 2,2-dimethylbutyric acid and 2,2-dimethylpentanoic acid.|$|E
5000|$|The overall {{emphasis}} of fine chemical R&D is more on development than on research. The main tasks are (1) designing, respectively duplicating and adapting {{in case of}} custom manufacture, and developing laboratory procedures for new products or processes; (2) transferring the processes from the laboratory via pilot plant to the industrial scale (the scale up factor from a 10g sample to a 1 ton batch is 100,000); and (3) to optimize existing processes. At all times during this course of action {{it has to be}} ensured that the four critical constraints, namely, economics, timing, safety, ecology and sustainability are observed [...]R&D expenditures in the <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>industry</b> are higher than in the commodities industry. They represent around 5-10% versus 2-5% of sales. On the business side, product innovation must proceed at a more rapid pace, because life cycles of fine chemicals are shorter than those of commodities. Therefore, there is an ongoing need for substitution of obsolete products. On the technical side, the higher complexity of the products and the more stringent regulatory requirements absorb more resources.Many economic and technical parameters have been proposed to enable a meaningful assessment of single projects and project portfolios. Examples are attractiveness, strategic fit, innovation, gross/net present value, expected profits, R&D expenditures, development stage, probability of success, technology fit, potential conflicts with other activities of the company and realization time. Most of these parameters cannot be determined quantitatively, at least during the early phases of a project. The best way {{to take advantage of a}} project portfolio is to develop and use it in an iterative way. By comparing the entries at regular intervals, for instance, every 3 months, the directions that the projects take can be visualized. If a negative trend persists with one particular project, the project should be put on the watch list.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>fine</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>industry</b> has {{undergone}} several {{boom and bust}} phases during its almost 30 years of existence. The biggest boom {{took place in the}} late 1990s, when high-dosage, high volume anti-AIDS drugs and COX-2 inhibitors gave a big boost to custom manufacturing. After the end of the “irrational exuberance” in 2000, the industry suffered a first bust in 2003, as a result of capacity expansions, the advent of Asian competitors and a ruinous M&A activity, several billion dollars of shareholder value were destroyed. The most recent -minor- boom is associated with stockpiling of GlaxoSmithKline’s Relenza (zanamivir) and Roche’s Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) by many countries in order to prepare for a possible avian flu epidemic. Surprisingly, the main cause for the 2009 slump had not been the general recession, but slow-downs of the growth and, even more so, inventory adjustments by the pharma industry. They resulted in postponements or cancellations of orders. The unfavorable development was {{in sharp contrast to the}} very optimistic growth forecasts, which many fine chemical companies, had announced. They had been based on equally promising sector reports from investment banks, which in turn had evolved from forward projections of the preceding boom period. In most cases, these projections have been missed by a large margin. [...] At the end of the “irrational exuberance” at the turn of the millennium and again in 2009 almost half of the industry achieved a return on sales (ROS) of more than 10%, and less than 10% an ROS below 5%. In the worst years, 2003 and 2009, almost half of the companies suffered from an ROS of less than 5%. Whereas during the period under review, 2000-2009. the average EBITDA / sales and EBIT / sales ratios of representative companies, resp. divisions were 15% and 7½%, respectively, in the period 2000-2009, the numbers were 20% and 10-13% in the boom, and 10% and 5% in the bust phases. The factor 2 between the high and low numbers reflects the volatility of the industry’s profitability. All in all, the average Western fine-chemical firms have been making a return below the cost of capital, i.e. they are not reinvestment grade.|$|E
