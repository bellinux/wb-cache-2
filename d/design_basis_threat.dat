Development of DBT is considered as one of the significant task during the work on domestic Russian regulations in the field of physical protection. Events of the last years have demonstrated that terrorist attack (with the goal of stealing nuclear materials or sabotage with catastrophic consequences) should be considered among the top threats to nuclear facilities. Moreover, possible scale of terrorist acts significantly raises requirements to physical protection systems. In particular Russian situation, recent hostage taking event in Moscow in October 2002 and subsequent statements of Chechen terrorist leaders regarding possible attacks against nuclear facilities confirmed that threat of attack by the group consisting of the large number of well-trained well-equipped terrorists should be considered as real and taken in to account during physical protection system development.

Since the DEM approach is highly sensitive {{to the details of}} the constitutive-material (and contact-interaction) models, {{a significant portion of the}} work is devoted to explaining the formulation and the physical basis for the material models used. In particular, since concrete is the key material used in the construction of a building, a critical assessment is provided of the DEM concrete material model employed. To quantify blast-survivability of the building and, in particular, its key structural components, the concept of the so-called <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>threat,</b> DBT (as quantified by the TNT-equivalent charge mass and the associated VBIED standoff distance) is utilized. To help quantify DBT, a parametric study is carried out involving the following design parameters: (a) TNT-equivalent charge mass; (b) VBIED standoff distance; and (c) the degree of concrete reinforcement with steel. The results obtained in the present work also revealed (in a qualitative fashion) the role that the phenomena such as the interaction of the VBIED-induced soil-borne shock waves with the building underground support structure as well as the interaction of the vehicle fragments and the detonation products with the structural elements of the building play in causing damage (and potential collapse) of the building...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how perturbing selected adversary capabilities in a <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>threat</b> (DBT) {{may affect the}} assessment of a facility's security system performance. We found that using a strictly defined DBT to design and analytically test facility security systems can lead to invalid assessments that security measures are meeting standards. Design Basis Threats are intended to represent the most severe yet realistic attack a facility might face. However, the static nature of the standard DBT makes it unable to test {{the performance of a}} facility security system in the case where a specialized adversary may possess different capabilities than defined in the DBT. Our analysis of security system performance for various modeled facilities revealed significant vulnerabilities to certain perturbations of adversary capabilities. These vulnerabilities went undetected when the original strictly defined graded DBT was used in the assessment procedure. By maximizing one adversary capability at the expense of others, a specialized adversary force was able to efficiently defeat each facility. To address this problem, we proposed employing a so-called "point-based" DBT {{as an alternative to the}} existing strictly defined DBT. In a point-based DBT, multiple scenarios are assessed that test different sets of adversary capabilities to better uncover and understand any security system vulnerabilities that may exist. We believe the benefit of identifying these site-specific security vulnerabilities will outweigh the additional cost of generating a point-based DBT, especially if the vulnerabilities are identified during the initial design of the security system...|$|E

In June 1999, the International Atomic Energy Agency published INFCIRC/ 225 /Rev. 4, 'The Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities. ' This guidance recommends that 'Safety specialists, in close cooperation with physical protection specialists, should evaluate the consequences of malevolent acts, considered in the context of the State's <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>threat,</b> to identify nuclear material, or the minimum complement of equipment, systems or devices {{to be protected}} against sabotage. ' This report presents a structured, transparent approach for identifying the areas that contain this minimum complement of equipment, systems, and devices to be protected against sabotage that is applicable to complex nuclear facilities. The method builds upon safety analyses to develop sabotage fault trees that reflect sabotage scenarios that could cause unacceptable radiological consequences. The sabotage actions represented in the fault trees are linked to the areas from which they can be accomplished. The fault tree is then transformed (by negation) into its dual, the protection location tree, which reflects the sabotage actions that must be prevented in order to prevent unacceptable radiological consequences. The minimum path sets of this fault tree dual yield, through the area linkage, sets of areas, each of which contains nuclear material, or a minimum complement of equipment, systems or devices that, if protected, will prevent sabotage. This method also provides guidance for the selection of the minimum path set that permits optimization of the trade-offs among physical protection effectiveness, safety impact, cost and operational impact...|$|E

Examination of the external terrorist threat considers Japanese demographics, known terrorist groups in Japan, and the international relations of Japan. Demographically, Japan has a relatively homogenous population, both ethnically and religiously. Japan is a relatively peaceful nation, but its history illustrates that it is not immune to terrorism. It has a history of domestic terrorism and the open literature points to the Red Army, Aum Shinrikyo, Chukaku-Ha, and Seikijuku. Japan supports the United States in its war on terrorism and in Iraq, which may make Japan a target for both international and domestic terrorists. Crime appears to remain low in Japan; however sources note that the foreign crime rate is increasing as the number of foreign nationals in the country increases. Antinuclear groups' recent foci have been nuclear reprocessing technology, transportation of MOX fuel, and possible related nuclear proliferation issues. The insider threat is first defined by the threat of the disgruntled employee. This threat can be determined by studying the history of Japan's employment system, where Keiretsu have provided company stability and lifetime employment.

40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{minimize}} security risks, proliferation hazards, and safety risks in the design of new nuclear facilities in a global environment of nuclear power expansion, while improving the synergy of major design features and raising operational efficiency. In 2008, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) launched the Next Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI) covering many safeguards areas. One of these, launched by NNSA with support of the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy, was a multi-laboratory project, led by the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), to develop safeguards by design. The proposed Safeguards-by-Design (SBD) process has been developed as a structured approach to ensure the timely, efficient, and cost effective integration of international safeguards and other nonproliferation barriers with national material control and accountability, physical security, and safety objectives into the overall design process for the nuclear facility lifecycle. A graded, iterative process was developed to integrate these areas throughout the project phases. It identified activities, deliverables, interfaces, and hold points covering both domestic regulatory requirements and international safeguards using the DOE regulatory environment as exemplar to provide a framework and guidance for project management and integration of safety with security during design. Further work, reported in this paper, created a generalized SBD process which could also be employed within the licensed nuclear industry and internationally for design of new facilities. Several tools for integrating safeguards, safety, and security into design are discussed here.
