5|$|Evidence {{of illegal}} {{wiretapping}} had been seized {{from the home}} of James Butler Elkins by Portland, Oregon police officers on an unrelated search warrant, and he was subsequently convicted <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court.</b> Elkins appealed, arguing that evidence found by the officers should have been inadmissible under the exclusionary rule, which forbids the introduction of most evidence gathered through Fourth Amendment violations in criminal court.|$|E

LaRouche alleges that Kronberg perjured herself and colluded with the prosecutors to frame him in order to cover up a bad check issued in 1979 by her from a New Benjamin Franklin House Publishing Company account for royalties owed him. One of the prosecutors in the 1988 case, John Markham, is representing Kronberg in the suit.|$|E

40|$|What is {{the proper}} role of rules <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> law? Some {{scholars}} associated with the Legal Process assert that rules are unimportant here. They believe that the values of principled adjudication and reasoned elaboration should take precedence over the making and application of rules. The area is, in the jargon of jurisprudence, 2 ̆ 2 antipositivist. 2 ̆ 2 Others maintain that rules do, or at any rate should, count heavily <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> 2 ̆ 7 decisionmaking. In this Article, I argue that Legal Process scholars are right to spurn formalism in most parts of <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> law. But the Legal Process model of <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> law is unsatisfactory; its logic seems to reject rules altogether, yet there are areas where rules do and should control decisions. Hence I seek a different explanation for the general antipositivism of the area. This Article argues that the weak role of rules <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> law may be accounted for and defended without embracing the tenets of the Legal Process. On the contrary, the reason there are few strong rules in this area is related to the justifications for rule-based decisionmaking in general. Those justifications vary in strength depending on context and are comparatively weak <b>in</b> the <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> context. Rather than generally embracing rules or raising a presumption against them, courts and scholars should take a pragmatic view of the role of rules <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> law. They should {{decide whether or not to}} make rules based on the costs and benefits of rules in the context before them. Supreme Court decisions on the role of rules <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> law can be understood in these pragmatic terms, though the Court itself rarely reveals its jurisprudential premises...|$|R
5|$|King next {{attempted}} {{to organize a}} march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> against the State of Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse {{so as not to}} violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement. The march finally went ahead fully on March 25, 1965.|$|E
5|$|The Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota sued <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> to {{overturn}} those regulations. The district courts agreed with them, but upon appeal, the Eighth Circuit consolidated {{the two cases}} into one and reversed the judgments, remanding the cases for entry of judgments {{in favor of the}} United States. This decision was at odds with decisions from the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, which had all previously ruled that residents may count as students for the purpose of FICA taxes. The Eighth Circuit's ruling created a circuit split, and on appeal, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|The Rialto Grain and Securities Company, whose {{principal}} {{place of}} business was in St. Louis, Missouri, was under investigation by the Postmaster for mail fraud. The Postmaster had received two complaints and forwarded them for investigation on November 7, 1902. State courts were also investigating complaints from investors against Rialto. Hugh C. Dennis, the President of Rialto, and other officers had been criminally indicted, but (at the time of Burton's indictment) none had been convicted. As of Burton's indictment, Dennis had been once acquitted <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> and four indictments were pending against him in state courts. For a time, Rialto's offices had been closed due to a judicial attachment by its creditors.|$|E

A three-judge panel of a U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia agreed that three of the laws were unconstitutional, but reserved judgment on the other two laws pending interpretation by state courts (which had not yet ruled on the laws' legality). Both the state and the NAACP appealed. In Harrison v. NAACP, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-to-3 that the district court should have withheld judgment until state courts had considered the issue first.|$|E
5|$|Trump University {{was also}} the subject of two class action {{lawsuits}} <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court.</b> The lawsuits centered around allegations that Trump University defrauded its students by using misleading marketing practices and engaging in aggressive sales tactics.
