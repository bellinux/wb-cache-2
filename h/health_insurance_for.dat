5|$|A {{number of}} {{contemporary}} national political {{issues have been}} influenced by events in Massachusetts, such as the decision in 2003 by the state Supreme Judicial Court allowing same-sex marriage and a 2006 bill which mandated <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>for</b> all Bay Staters. In 2008, Massachusetts voters passed an initiative decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana. Voters in Massachusetts also approved a ballot measure in 2012 that legalized the medical use of marijuana.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was against}} the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and {{supported}} free and accessible <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>for</b> all. He also wanted to transfer ownership of corporations to the workers. When discussing the War on Terror, Moore felt it was destroying small communities throughout the country with higher taxes and more pressure on the local governments. Moore and Vice Presidential candidate Stewart Alexander supported a 50% reduction of the United States Department of Defense spending, and using the other 50% to improve veteran benefits. Alexander proposed that retired veterans with 10–30 years of military service should receive an income of $15–30 thousand annually from the state.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 2004, Fletcher {{proposed}} changes to the health benefits of state workers and retirees. Fletcher's plan provided discounts for members who engaged in healthier behavior, which he called a transition from a sickness initiative to a wellness initiative. Acknowledging that out-of-pocket expenses would rise, Fletcher proposed a 1% salary increase to offset the additional costs. State employees, particularly public school teachers, broadly opposed Fletcher's plan, and the Kentucky Educators Association called for an indefinite strike, to begin October 27, 2004. To address the opposition, Fletcher called a special session of the legislature to begin October 5, 2004. Although the state was still operating under an executive spending plan, Fletcher did not include the budget or his tax reform proposal in the session's agenda, a move praised by both parties, allowing them to focus only on concerns over the health plan. In a fifteen-day session, the General Assembly passed a plan that allocated $190 million more to <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>for</b> state workers and restored many of the most popular benefits in the previous insurance plan. Immediately after the session adjourned, the Kentucky Educators Association voted to cancel their proposed strike.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, Medicare {{provided}} <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>for</b> over 55 million—46 {{million people}} age 65 and older and 9 million younger people. On average, Medicare covers {{about half of}} the health care charges for those enrolled. The enrollees must then cover their remaining costs either with supplemental insurance, separate insurance, or out-of-pocket. Out-of-pocket costs can vary depending on the amount of health care a Medicare enrollee needs. They might include the costs of uncovered services—such as for long-term, dental, hearing, and vision care—and supplemental insurance premiums.|$|E
25|$|Since higher {{education}} is funded by the state, the fees are very low; tuition fees vary from €150 to €700 depending on {{the university and the}} different levels of education (licence, master, doctorate). One can therefore get a master's degree (in 5 years) for about €750–3,500. The tuition fees in public engineering schools are comparable to universities, albeit a little higher (around €700). However they can reach €7000 a year for private engineering schools, while business schools, which are all private or partially private, charge up to €15000 a year. <b>Health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>for</b> students is free until the age of 20.|$|E
25|$|Many {{distinct}} organizations {{provide health}} care in the US. Facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses. <b>Health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>for</b> public sector employees is primarily provided by the government. 60–65% of healthcare provision and spending comes from programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Veterans Health Administration. Most of the population under 65 is insured by their or a family member's employer, some buy health insurance on their own, and the remainder are uninsured. On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) became law, providing for major changes in health insurance.|$|E

25|$|After Kennedy won the election, the AFL-CIO {{used the}} {{coalition}} built by Senior Citizens-for-Kennedy to push its agenda at the 1961 White House Conference on Aging. The AFL-CIO coordinated {{the work of}} these groups during the conference. It established a communications center, and mobilized witnesses and votes as needed. Whenever <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>for</b> the aged {{was brought up in}} any committee other than the Social Security committee, the proposal was voted down or declared out of order. When the Conference voted on its final report, the AMA was surprised to find a health insurance proposal part of the recommended legislative package. The AFL-CIO coalition had grown to more than 500 groups, and attempts by the AMA to strike the proposal from the report were easily defeated.|$|E
25|$|Czechoslovakia {{provided}} more job opportunities by construction of roads, regulation of rivers and building construction. These projects were stopped after annexation. Unemployment rates increased, and unlike Czechoslovakia Hungary {{did not provide}} any unemployment benefits or state <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>for</b> workers in agriculture. Retirement and disability pensions were also lower. Unemployed workers who received support under Czechoslovakian rule requested the same from Hungary. Salaries and as working conditions worsened, but taxes increased in the same time. Money conversion at exchange rates disadvantageous for local citizens (7:1) automatically decreased salaries by 20%. Hungarian soldiers profited from the exchange rate and bought up the remaining cheap Czechoslovak goods {{at the expense of}} their sellers. New goods from Hungary were 20–30% more expensive. Electricity, radio and railway tickets became also more expensive.|$|E
