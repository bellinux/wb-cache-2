5|$|En {{route to}} Isabella, Clear {{and the other}} realize {{that all of them}} are still alive due to the Flight 180 {{survivors}} having <b>gotten</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> plane. While driving to the hospital, they are involved in a car accident that leaves Eugene needing medical help and eventually leads to the deaths of Kat and Rory. Following their deaths, Clear, Kimberly and Thomas go to the hospital to save Isabella. While they do succeed in finding her in time and ensuring her infant survives, Kimberly has another premonition that reveals to her Isabella was never meant to die in the pileup, meaning they're still in danger. Understanding the situation, Clear tries to find Eugene's room. Finding him contained by an oxygenated room, she opens the door, subsequently loosening the plug of Eugene's defibrillator, creating a spark that incinerates Eugene's room, burning her and Eugene.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 29 September 1803, Jackall sighted and chased a sloop running along the shore between Nieuport and Dunkirk. The wind fell so Leaver sent 11 men in a boat to board the quarry. As the British approached, the sloop ran ashore near three field pieces and a small battery of two guns, and her crew of 10 or 12 men escaped on shore. Jackall, which had been using her sweeps, and {{with the assistance of}} a light breeze that had arisen, came up and provided support for the boat and the sloop, which the boarding party had <b>gotten</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> sloop turned out to be from Dunkirk, armed with four 2-pounder guns, and possibly serving to transport troops. Despite the fire from the sloop before she grounded, and the guns on shore, which were within 25 yards of the sloop, the British sustained no casualties. The sloop turned out to be San Façon.|$|E

500|$|The Poles' gift, {{to their}} western Allies, of Enigma decryption, five {{weeks before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, came not a moment too soon. [...] Former Bletchley Park mathematician-cryptologist Gordon Welchman has written: [...] "Ultra would never have <b>gotten</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground {{if we had not}} learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military... Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use." [...] Allied Supreme Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower, at war's end, described intelligence from Bletchley Park as having been [...] "of priceless value to me. It has simplified my task as a commander enormously." [...] Eisenhower expressed his thanks for this [...] "decisive contribution to the Allied war effort." ...|$|E
500|$|Intelligence {{gained from}} solving {{high-level}} German ciphers—intelligence codenamed Ultra by the British and Americans—came chiefly from Enigma decrypts. While the exact contribution of Ultra intelligence to Allied victory is disputed, Kozaczuk and Straszak note that [...] "it {{is widely believed}} that Ultra saved the world {{at least two years}} of war and possibly prevented Hitler from winning." [...] The English historian Sir Harry Hinsley, who worked at Bletchley Park, similarly assessed it as having [...] "shortened the war by not less than two years and probably by four years". [...] The availability of Ultra was due to the earlier Polish breaking of Enigma; Gordon Welchman, head of Bletchley Park's Hut 6 (which solved German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers), writes: [...] "Hut 6 Ultra would never have <b>gotten</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{continuing}} subplot {{with the}} tour's scheduling was E Street drummer Max Weinberg's availability vis à vis {{his job as}} The Max Weinberg 7 bandleader for Conan O'Brien, given that {{during the first half}} of 2009 Late Night with Conan O'Brien in New York was ending and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in Los Angeles was beginning. [...] The mid-January announcement that Late Night would continue until February 20 precluded any notion of starting the tour immediately following Springsteen's appearance at Super Bowl XLIII, in addition to the band feeling that they had just <b>gotten</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Magic Tour and [...] "Wait, let’s stop a minute." [...] Meanwhile, the June 1 start date of The Tonight Show posed problems for Weinberg's continued presence on the tour. [...] O'Brien told a Variety reporter at the time of the announcement that he hoped that Weinberg would follow him to Los Angeles and that he also hoped an arrangement could be worked out to let Weinberg go on the road with Springsteen as had been done for past tours. [...] At NBC, the coexistence between the drummer's two bosses was known as the Weinberg-Springsteen Rule, and was not typically extended to other talent at the network. [...] In a high-profile Rolling Stone cover story interview, Springsteen was vague about the matter: [...] "All I know is this – it's all gonna work out, one way or another. If people wanna come out and see the E Street Band, they'll be able to come out and see the E Street Band." [...] And whether Weinberg would stay with O'Brien and move or not was a subject of conflicting news reports until O'Brien confirmed on February 18 that Weinberg and the band were indeed coming with him. [...] A few days later, E Streeter Steven Van Zandt said of Weinberg's availability for the post-June 1, European leg: “We’re still figuring that out. We’ll see. I think Max will be there for most of it. ... I know he was very much trying to figure it out.” [...] Weinberg had not missed an E Street Band show since joining the outfit in 1974, and Van Zandt said that no amount of rehearsal by another drummer could replace Weinberg's intuitive understanding of Springsteen's performance gambits.|$|E

6000|$|But [...] "matters {{of state}} (it seems) are canvassed on the stage, {{and things of}} the gravest concernment there managed;" [...] and who were the aggressors, I beseech you, but a few factious, popular hirelings, that by {{tampering}} the theatres, and by poisoning the people, made a play-house more seditious than a conventicle; so that the loyal party crave only the same freedom of defending the government, which the other took beforehand of exposing and defaming it. There was no complaint of any disorders of the stage, in the bustle that was made (even to the forming of a party) to uphold a farce of theirs.[5] Upon the first day, the whole faction (in a manner) appeared; but after one sight of it, they sent their proxies of serving-men and porters, to clap in the right of their patrons; and it was impossible ever to have <b>gotten</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> nonsense of three hours for half-a-crown, but for the providence of so congruous an audience. Thus far, I presume, the reckoning is even, for bad plays on both sides, and for plays written for a party. I shall say nothing of their poets' affection to the government; unless upon an absolute and an odious necessity. But {{to return to the}} pretended Parallel.|$|E
60|$|I {{will take}} this {{opportunity}} of saying, that the newspaper accounts {{of the loss of}} the ship are throughout grossly inaccurate. The chief facts I will state, in a few words, from the deposition at the India House of one of the surviving officers. She struck at 5 P.M. Guns were fired immediately, and were continued to be fired. She was <b>gotten</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> rock at half-past seven, but had taken in so much water, in spite of constant pumping, as to be water-logged. They had, however, hope that she might still be run upon Weymouth Sands, and with this view continued pumping and baling till eleven, when she went down. The longboat could not be hoisted out, as, had that been done, {{there would have been no}} possibility of the ship being run aground. I have mentioned these things, because the newspaper accounts were such as tended to throw discredit on my brother's conduct and personal firmness, stating that the ship had struck an hour and a half before guns were fired, and that, in the agony of the moment, the boats had been forgotten to be hoisted out. We knew well this could not be; but, for the sake of the relatives of the persons lost, it distressed us much that it should have been said. A few minutes before the ship went down, my brother was seen talking with the first mate, with apparent cheerfulness; and he was standing on the hen-coop, which is the point from which he could overlook the whole ship, the moment she went down, dying, as he had lived, in the very place and point where his duty stationed him. I must beg your pardon for detaining you so long on this melancholy subject; and yet it is not altogether melancholy, for what nobler spectacle can be contemplated than that of a virtuous man, with a serene countenance, in such an overwhelming situation? I will here transcribe a passage which I met with the other day in a review; it is from Aristotle's 'Synopsis of the Virtues and Vices.'[53] 'It is,' says he, 'the property of fortitude not to be easily terrified by the dread of things pertaining to death; to possess good confidence in things terrible, and presence of mind in dangers; rather to prefer to be put to death worthily, than to be preserved basely; and to be the cause of victory. Moreover, it is the property of fortitude to labour and endure, and to make valorous exertion an object of choice. Further, presence of mind, a well-disposed soul, confidence and boldness are the attendants on fortitude; and, besides these, industry and patience.' Except in the circumstance of making valorous exertion an 'object of choice' (if the philosopher alludes to general habits of character), my brother might have sat for this picture; but he was of a meek and retired nature, loving all quiet things.|$|E
