2500|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> organizes data {{information}} into computerized software defined columns and rows. Primarily used {{for business and}} accounting purposes, the data can then be [...] "added up" [...] by a formula to give a total or sum. The spreadsheet program summarizes information from many paper sources {{in one place and}} presents the information in a format to help a decision maker see the financial [...] "big picture" [...] of a company. Spreadsheets in paper format have been used by accountants for hundreds of years. However, computerized, electronic spreadsheets are of much more recent origin. In 1961, Richard Mattessich, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, pioneered the concept of electronic spreadsheets for use in business accounting. In the autumn of 1978, Harvard Business School student, Dan Bricklin, {{came up with the idea}} for an interactive visible calculator.

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>spreadsheets</b> {{were among}} the first {{personal}} computer programs used inplanning and are widely used in planning education and practice. Several widely used books present spreadsheet models for a variety of planning applications (e. g., see Klosterman, Brail, and Bossard 1993). Nevertheless, few planners realize the tremen-dous potential of modern spreadsheets for conducting sophisticated analyses—such as the fitting of spatial interaction models—applications that until recently could be car-ried out only with customized programs or complicated <b>spreadsheet</b> models. Modern <b>electronic</b> <b>spreadsheets</b> include powerful optimizing capabilities, such as the Solver in Excel, that extend the capabilities of spreadsheets to perform new types of analysis. Planning models that previously could have been implemented only with more complex programming can now be implemented within the familiar environ-ment of the spreadsheet. This article illustrates the use of these optimization capabilities of spreadsheets to implement facility location and spatial interaction models. The article describes the use of these spreadsheet models in the teaching of planning methods, using the models as a part of an integrated project involving the determination of the location of a new public facility. While the example being used involves the location of a new public library, the spreadsheet models have broader applicability {{to a wide range of}} planning problems involving the location of many different types of public facilities, from social service centers to public safety facilities. The example provides new ideas for the use of spreadsheets in the teaching of planning methods. In addition, the example demon-strates the potential that spreadsheets provide for planning educators, students, and practitioners to develop their own sophisticated spreadsheet models.

50|$|Because of Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston's {{implementation}} of VisiCalc on the Apple II in 1979 and the IBM PC in 1981, the spreadsheet concept became widely {{known in the}} late 1970s and early 1980s. VisiCalc was the first spreadsheet that combined all essential features of modern spreadsheet applications (except for forward referencing/natural order recalculation), such as WYSIWYG interactive user interface, automatic recalculation, status and formula lines, range copying with relative and absolute references, formula building by selecting referenced cells. Unaware of LANPAR at the time PC World magazine called VisiCalc the first <b>electronic</b> <b>spreadsheet.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{a student}} at Harvard Business School, Bricklin co-developed VisiCalc in 1979, making it the first <b>electronic</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> readily {{available}} for home and office use. It ran on an Apple II computer, and was considered a fourth generation software program. VisiCalc is widely credited for fueling {{the rapid growth of}} the personal computer industry. Instead of doing financial projections with manually calculated spreadsheets, and having to recalculate with every single cell in the sheet, VisiCalc allowed the user to change any cell, and have the entire sheet automatically recalculated. This could turn 20 hours of work into 15 minutes and allowed for more creativity.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Borland Quattro <b>electronic</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> was a DOS program, {{the initial}} development {{of which was}} done by three Eastern Europeans, one of which, Lajos Frank, was later hired by Microsoft.

At the time, there was absolutely no such development being undertaken by Borland. After they both read the article, Philippe Kahn and Spencer Leyton had a casual conversation where they joked, half-way seriously, about perhaps developing a spreadsheet to compete with Lotus Development's 1-2-3.
