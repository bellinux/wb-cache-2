5|$|In July 2017, it was {{announced}} that the 38 HC4 Chinooks would be upgraded to a HC6A standard, with the replacement of the analogue flight control systems with the Boeing Digital Automatic <b>Flight</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System</b> (DAFCS).|$|E
5|$|The A320 was {{the first}} civil {{airliner}} to include a full digital fly-by-wire <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> At {{the time of the}} aircraft's introduction, the behaviour of the fly-by-wire system equipped with full flight envelope protection was a new experience for many pilots.|$|E
5|$|The US Army's next {{generation}} Chinook, the CH-47D, entered service in 1982. Improvements from the CH-47C included upgraded engines, composite rotor blades, a redesigned cockpit to reduce pilot workload, redundant and improved electrical systems, an advanced <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (FCS) and improved avionics. The RAF returned their original Mk1s to Boeing for upgrading to CH-47D standard, {{the first of}} which returned to the UK in 1993.|$|E

5|$|The F-22 {{is highly}} maneuverable at both {{supersonic}} and subsonic speeds. Computerized <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable. The Raptor's relaxed stability and powerful thrust-vectoring engines enable the aircraft to turn tightly and perform very high alpha (angle of attack) maneuvers {{such as the}} Herbst maneuver (J-turn) and Pugachev's Cobra. The aircraft is also capable of maintaining over 60° alpha while having some roll control.|$|E
5|$|The Westland WS-61 Sea King is a British licence-built {{version of}} the American Sikorsky S-61 {{helicopter}} of the same name, built by Westland Helicopters. The aircraft differs considerably from the American version, with Rolls-Royce Gnome engines (derived from the US General Electric T58), British-made anti-submarine warfare systems and a fully computerised <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The Sea King was primarily designed for performing anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions. A Sea King variant was adapted by Westland as troop transport known as the Commando.|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} of the Fleet Air Arm's Sea King fleet commenced faster than initially planned following {{the loss of a}} Sea King during a humanitarian aid mission in Indonesia in April 2005, resulting in nine deaths. Investigators uncovered serious faults in the condition of the Sea King's mechanical <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> resulting from maintenance deficiencies. In May 2007, the six remaining Sea Kings were grounded for two months following the discovery of a number of missing parts.|$|E

5|$|They {{were also}} able to {{determine}} all of the flight control surfaces, including the elevators, ailerons and rudder, were functioning properly {{at the point of}} the crash, and there were no faults in the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The flaps were extended to between 15° and 20°, the standard setting for take-off. The propeller blades of No. 4 engine on the far right side of the aircraftwere reversedminus 8°, while the blades of Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines were at 34° positive pitch (also standard for take-off).|$|E
5|$|As intended, the Comanche {{was to be}} {{equipped}} with sophisticated avionics, including navigation and detection systems, which would have to enabled operations during nighttime and within challenging weather conditions. Its primary mission was to scout around using its advanced sensors, attempting to find and designate targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike. The Comanche was furnished with a digital fly-by-wire <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Each of the two crew members were to be provided {{with a pair of}} LCD multi-functional displays which would have functioned in addition to the Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS) worn by the crew.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{original}} spacecraft was completed in August 2004. Following testing, the spacecraft was shipped to the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia during August 2005 and arrived on 1 September. The launch occurred from Site 133/3 on 8 October, however due to a missing command in the rocket's <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> the second stage engine did not shut {{down at the end}} of its planned burn, and instead the stage burned to depletion. This prevented the second stage and Briz-KM from separating, and as a result the rocket failed to achieve orbit. The spacecraft was lost when it reentered over the Arctic Ocean, north of Greenland.|$|E

5|$|Westland and IBM {{formed a}} {{consortium}} in 1991 {{to perform the}} helicopter's complex systems integration. The AW101 features a network of helicopter management and mission systems designed to reduce pilot workload and enable the helicopter to undertake {{a wide variety of}} missions. A digital automatic <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (AFCS) is employed by the AW101. The AFCS allows the operation of a four-axis (pitch, roll, yaw and collective) autopilot and the automatic stabilisation system, and is linked in with the aircraft's flight management systems. The AFCS, manufactured by Smiths Aerospace, is a dual-duplex system using two flight computers to provide redundancy and fault-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|The {{avionics}} software {{incorporates the}} concept of open architecture. Instead of the military-optimised Ada programming language, the software is written using the popular C++ programming language, enabling {{the use of the}} numerous civilian programmers available. The aircraft also includes a health and usage monitoring system, and automatic test equipment. The <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (FCS) comprises conventional controls with stability augmentation in the yaw and roll axis and a digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system in the pitch axis. The leading edge slats/flaps and trailing edge flaps are automatically adjusted during manoeuvring to increase turning performance. The FCS of serial production aircraft reportedly have a digital quadruplex (quad-redundant) FBW system in the pitch axis and a duplex (dual-redundant) FBW system in the roll and yaw axis.|$|E
5|$|With the Mirage2000 and F-18L rejected, the RAAF {{was faced}} with a choice between the F-16 and F-18A. Richardson and several other RAAF pilots tested United States Air Force (USAF) F-16Bs in 1979 and 1980, and {{reported}} that the aircraft had excellent performance but could be difficult to control at times. The evaluation team was also concerned about the reliability of the F-16's engine and regarded the aircraft as technologically immature. It was also noted that the aircraft's radar was inferior to that of the F-18A, and that F-16s could not fire the beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missiles and long-range anti-shipping missiles that the F-18A was capable of operating. In contrast, the evaluation team was impressed by the F-18A, and regarded it as being a more robust and survivable aircraft as it had been designed to operate from aircraft carriers; these features were important for operations from bare bases in northern Australia. Richardson and three other RAAF pilots test-flew F-18As, and reported that the aircraft handled well, but had some deficiencies with its <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and engines; these were not seen as major flaws by the evaluation team, however. The F-18A's twin engines were considered to be its main advantage over the single-engined F-16, as research conducted by the evaluation team found that the attrition rate for single-engined fighters was twice that for aircraft with two engines. Overall, however, the RAAF judged that both the F-16 and F-18A were too immature for a decision to be made in 1980 as had been originally planned, and recommended to the Government that this be deferred by a year.|$|E

25|$|In August 2007 it was {{announced}} that the cause of the crash was a failure of the hydraulic <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> caused by coating flaking off from servo pistons. The loosened plasma coating flakes blocked the return valves of the servos, causing the aircraft to abruptly lose its maneuverability. Copterline did not have the authority to service or even open these components. However, in the final report, Copterline was criticized for omitting a periodic leak test of the hydraulic <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> that could have revealed the problem.
