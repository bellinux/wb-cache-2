25|$|On August 24, 1939, a Cleveland {{resident}} named Frank Dolezal, 52, {{was arrested}} {{as a suspect}} in Florence Polillo's murder; he later died under suspicious circumstances in the Cuyahoga County jail. After his death {{it was discovered that}} he had suffered six broken ribs—injuries his <b>friends</b> <b>say</b> he did not have when arrested by Sheriff Martin L. O'Donnell some six weeks prior. Most researchers believe that no evidence exists that Dolezal was involved in the murders, although at one time he did admit killing Florence Polillo in self-defense. Before his death, he recanted his confession and recanted two others as well, saying he had been beaten until he confessed.|$|E

Just as she is about to say the words, however, she sees an image of Aslan snarling at her, frightening her from reading the spell (in the 2010 film, she reads the spell and turns into a version of Susan and finds her brothers have not heard of Lucy or Narnia). Aslan also reprimands her for using another spell to see what her <b>friends</b> <b>say</b> about her. She encounters a story-spell that she feels is the best story ever that disappears after she reads it, and Aslan reassures her that she will be able to read it again.|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding Manhunt reached a peak on July 28, 2004, {{when the game}} {{was linked to the}} murder of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah by his 17-year-old friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England. Initial media reports claimed that police had found a copy of the game in Leblanc's bedroom, which police had seized as evidence, and Giselle Pakeerah, the victim's mother, stated [...] "I think that I heard some of Warren's <b>friends</b> <b>say</b> that he was obsessed by this game. To quote from the website that promotes it, it calls it a psychological experience, not a game, and it encourages brutal killing. If he was obsessed by it, it could well be that the boundaries for him became quite hazy." [...] Stefan's father, Patrick, added [...] "they were playing a game called Manhunt. The way Warren committed the murder this is how the game is set out, killing people using weapons like hammers and knives. There is some connection between the game and what he has done." [...] Patrick continued [...] "The object of Manhunt is not just to go out and kill people. It's a point-scoring game where you increase your score depending on how violent the killing is. That explains why Stefan's murder was as horrific as it was. If these games influence kids to go out and kill, then we do not want them in the shops." [...] A spokesman for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers' Association (ELSPA) responded to the accusations by stating [...] "We sympathize enormously with the family and parents of Stefan Pakeerah. However, we reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of the video game Manhunt. The game in question is classified 18 by the British Board of Film Classification and therefore its copies should not be in the possession of a minor. Simply being in someone's possession does not and should not lead to the conclusion that a game is responsible for these tragic events." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{relatively}} quiet dispute, some lyrics from the single [...] "B-Boy Stance" [...] were {{interpreted as an}} insult on the Toronto-based rapper K'naan.

[...] K’naan interpreted the lyrics as being aimed at him filming the music video for the single Soobax in Kenya. <b>Friends</b> <b>say</b> that k-os was simply expressing ideas about the LoveMovement (his videproduction team) who shot the video in Kenya and ex manager Sol guy who was managing K'naan at the time. k-os has been said to believe that hip hop allows friends to express their ideas to each other via song. He was very puzzled by Knaan's personal 'public' angle on the lyrics of [...] "B-Boy Stance" [...] especially because his song Revolutionary Avacado came after Knaan's repeated efforts to collaborate with k-os.

2500|$|The {{title track}} and opening song, [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", was {{compared}} to her debut single, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), featuring a slap-and-pop bassline, synthesizer chord stabs and a mechanized beat. Lyrically, the song sees Spears warning to an overeager prospective lover: [...] "Oops, you think I'm in love/That I'm sent from above — I'm not that innocent." [...] The song also breaks down for a spoken-word interlude, involving {{a line from the}} film Titanic (1997). The second track [...] "Stronger" [...] is a synthpop and R track, which is lyrically a declaration of independence, where Spears leaves a partner who treats her like property. The line [...] "my loneliness ain't killing me no more" [...] makes reference to the verse [...] "my loneliness is killing me" [...] from her song [...] "...Baby One More Time". Another R track, which also adds a bit more funk to the mix, [...] "Don't Go Knocking on My Door" [...] finds Spears confidently forging ahead after a breakup. The fourth track, a cover of the Rolling Stones' [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", begins with mushy guitar plucking and breathy coos, until a dry, crackling lockstep is thrown down, turning the song into an urban stomp. The dance-pop version also jettisons the song's final verse and adds some new lyrics ("how white my shirts could be" [...] becomes [...] "how tight my skirt should be"). [...] " [...] was my idea [...] ", Spears said. [...] "I was just like, 'I like this song,' and I {{think it will be a}} really cool combination working with [...] Rodney [...] and doing a really funky song like that." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", was co-written by country-pop singer-songwriter Shania Twain and her then-husband, producer Robert [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, who also produced the track. The ballad, which boasts a slinky keyboard riff and Lange's characteristically lavish production, finds Spears allowing a bit of country twang into her vocals as she begs a lover to reveal his feelings: [...] "My <b>friends</b> <b>say</b> you're into me ... but I need to hear it straight from you", she sings. The sixth track [...] "What U See (Is What U Get)" [...] demands respect by rebuking a jealous partner, while the seventh track, [...] "Lucky", is a heart-rending tale of a Hollywood starlet's loneliness, proving that fame can be empty. [...] "If there's nothing missing in my life/Then why do these tears come at night?", she asks. [...] "School crush" [...] is the theme of [...] "One Kiss from You", a track that has a reggae-style beat and lyrics about the feelings of falling in love, and the quickness of it, with Spears cooing that after only one kiss she sees her entire future with her lover. The ballad [...] "Where Are You Now" [...] talks about wanting to know where a previous love is, and what that person is up to, so that she can finally let them go and find closure. Lines on [...] "Can't Make You Love Me", an Europop song, state that fancy cars and money pale in comparison to true love, with Spears singing: [...] "I'm just a girl with a crush on you." [...] The mid-tempo, synth-backed [...] "When Your Eyes Say It", written by songwriter Diane Warren, combines a string section with a loping hip hop beat, while Spears makes her own songwriting debut on the modest, keyboard-driven ballad [...] "Dear Diary", which she said is autobiographical. On the track, she sings of wanting to become [...] "so much more than friends" [...] with a boy.|$|E
