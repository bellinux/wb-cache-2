40|$|Using a corpus-based methodology, {{this thesis}} reports a study into how {{non-native}} Ghanaian academic authors of English in the disciplines of Sociology, Economics and Law deploy epistemic modality devices as rhetorical features of argumentation in their research articles (RAs) published in journals based in Ghana. The study focuses on understanding {{the ways in}} which the use of these rhetorical features by Ghanaian authors compare with their use in <b>international</b> <b>RAs</b> written by native academic authors of English. Based on the aims of the study, two sets of corpora of RAs for the Ghanaian and international authors were created and analysed to compare the use of epistemic modality features between the two groups of authors in terms of: depth of use, diversity of use, linguistic types of epistemic markers, phraseological patterns of notable epistemic markers and degrees of epistemic strength. The quantitative aspects of the comparisons relied mainly on frequency counts of epistemic markers which were supported by Log-likelihood tests to determine significant differences of epistemic use across disciplines and between the two groups of authors. The qualitative aspects (e. g., phraseological pattern analysis) focused mainly on a close inspection of concordance lines for comparisons. The findings of the study revealed that while Ghanaian writers seem to be generally aware of the most important epistemic devices used for academic writing, as they used as wide a range of epistemic devices as their international counterparts, they tended to use these devices significantly less in their RAs. A few cases of overuse and misuse of epistemic modality by Ghanaian writers were also observed. It was found also that many of the disciplinary variation patterns of epistemic use observed in the <b>international</b> <b>RAs</b> did not match with the patterns revealed in the RAs written by the Ghanaian authors. A further important finding was that whereas the international writers generally preferred medium and weak level epistemic markers over strong ones, the Ghanaian writers favoured the use of medium and strong level epistemic markers over weak ones. It also became apparent that the significant underuse of epistemic rhetorical features by the Ghanaian writers could be attributed to the way rhetorical features are represented in academic writing course materials in Ghanaian universities. The findings reported in this thesis suggest that there is the need for Ghanaian academic authors to make language adjustments to their academic writing if their writing practices are to fully adhere to international disciplinary norms and conventions...|$|E

However, RasGAP also acts as a positive effector of Ras and exerts an anti-apoptotic activity that is independent of its GAP function and that involves its SH 3 (Src homology) domain. We used a combinatorial peptide aptamer approach to select a collection of RasGAP SH 3 specific ligands. We mapped the peptide aptamer binding sites by performing yeast two-hybrid mating assays against a panel of RasGAP SH 3 mutants. We examined the biological activity of a peptide aptamer targeting a pocket delineated by residues D 295 / 7, L 313 and W 317. This aptamer shows a caspase-independent cytotoxic activity on tumor cell lines. It disrupts the interaction between RasGAP and Aurora B kinase. This work identifies the above-mentioned pocket as an interesting therapeutic target to pursue and points its cognate peptide aptamer as a promising guide to discover RasGAP small-molecule drug candidates...|$|R

In A 549 lung adenocarcinoma approximately 50 % {{of the total}} Ras population is constitutively active yet these cells display only weak activation of the effectors: ERK 1 / 2 and Akt. In order to identify key negative regulators of oncogenic Ras signalling we performed a phosphatome RNAi screen in A 549 cells and ranked their effects on phosphorylation of Ser 473 of Akt. As expected, the tumour suppressor PTEN emerged as a leading hit – knockdown elevated Akt activation to 70 % of maximal generated by acute EGF stimulation. Importantly, we identified other phosphatases with similar potencies including PTPN 2 (TC-PTP) and PTPRJ (DEP- 1 /CD 148). Potentiation of Akt phosphorylation by knockdown of PTEN or PTPRJ was contingent {{on the presence of}} oncogenic K-Ras. Our data reveal a synergy between oncogene function and the loss of a tumour suppressor within the same pathway that was necessary for full effector activation since each alone failed to elicit significant Akt phosphorylation.

The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the reporting of different aspects of that impact in publications, with a focus on differences between diseases and over time. METHODS: A systematic literature review retrieved all articles reporting on the life impact of RA or axial radiographic SpA in adults published within the last 10 years and issued from European research. The data were classified into physical impact (including pain, functional assessment and fatigue), psychological impact (including psychological distress and coping) and social impact (including relationships, family and social life). The number of articles published over time was analysed by linear regression. RESULTS: In all, 1352 abstracts were screened and 149 publications (40 056 patients) were analysed: 129 articles (86. 5 %) concerned RA and 16 (10. 7 %) concerned axial SpA. The mean number of articles reporting on the physical aspects of impact was 11. 4 (s. d. 4. 8) per 2 -year period, but increased more than 2 -fold (from 7 articles in 2001 - 3 to 15 in 2010 - 11), in particular due to recent publications on fatigue, whereas the number of articles on psychological aspects [mean 12. 4 (s. d. 4. 0) ] decreased markedly after 2006.

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceRheumatoid {{arthritis}} (<b>RA)</b> is {{a chronic}} inflammatory joint disease {{characterized by a}} distinctive pattern of bone and joint destruction. RA patients have {{an increased risk of}} death. The incidence and prevalence of RA vary across populations, statistical methods, and disease definitions. In North America and Northern Europe, the incidence of RA is estimated at 20 - 50 cases per 100, 000 population and the prevalence at 0. 5 - 1. 1 %. Lower incidences and prevalences have been reported in Southern Europe, and few data are available for developing countries. Some studies showed declining incidences and prevalences after the 1960 s. RA is a multifactorial disease that results from interactions between genetic and environmental factors. The main genetic factors are HLA-DRB 1 and the tyrosine-phosphatase gene PTPN 22. Among environmental factors implicated in the development of RA, smoking shows the strongest association with RA susceptibility and is also linked to worse outcomes.

Here, we have investigated the functions of local RA synthesis in the process of motoneuron specification and early differentiation using a conditional knockout strategy that ablates the function of the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh 2) synthesizing enzyme essentially in brachial motoneurons, and later in mesenchymal cells {{at the base of the}} forelimb. Mutant (Raldh 2 L-/-) embryos display an early embryonic loss of a subset of Lim 1 + brachial motoneurons, a mispositioning of Islet 1 + neurons and inappropriate axonal projections of one of the nerves innervating extensor limb muscles, which lead to an adult forepaw neuromuscular defect. The molecular basis of the Raldh 2 L-/- phenotype relies in part on the deregulation of Hoxc 8, which in turn regulates the RA receptor RARbeta. We further show that Hoxc 8 mutant mice, which exhibit a similar congenital forepaw defect, display at embryonic stages molecular defects that phenocopy the Raldh 2 L-/- motoneuron abnormalities. Thus, interdependent RA signaling and Hox gene functions are required for the specification of brachial motoneurons in the mouse...|$|R

All homozygous mutants (Rxra(afo)) display the ocular defects previously observed in compound Rar-null and Rxra/Rar-null mutants, thus demonstrating that a transcriptionally active RXRalpha is required during eye development. In contrast, the vast majority of Rxra(afo) fetuses do not display the Rxra-null mutant hypoplasia of the myocardium, thus demonstrating that RXRalpha can act as a transcriptionally silent heterodimerization partner. Similarly, a transcriptionally silent RXRalpha mutant can support early embryogenesis, as Rxra(afo) /Rxrb-null embryos display a normal morphology, contrasting with the severe malformations exhibited by compound Rxra/Rxrb-null embryos. Along the same line, we show that a silent RXRalpha mutant is sufficient to allow the initial formation of the placental labyrinth, whereas later steps of trophoblast cell differentiation critically requires the AF 2, but not the AF 1, function of RXRalpha...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Ras</b> GTPases mediate {{numerous}} {{biological processes}} through {{their ability to}} cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) favor {{the formation of the}} active Ras-GTP, whereas GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) promote the formation of inactive Ras-GDP. Numerous studies have established complex signaling cross-talks between Ras GTPases {{and other members of the}} superfamily of small GTPases. GEFs were thought to play a major role in these cross-talks. However, recently GAPs were also shown to play crucial roles in these processes. Among RasGAPs, Nf 1 is of special interest. Nf 1 is responsible for the genetic disease Neurofibromatosis type I, and recent data strongly suggest that this RasGAP connects different signaling pathways. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to know if the RasGAP Nf 1 might play a role in connecting Ras GTPases to other small GTPase pathways, we systematically looked for new partners of Nf 1, by performing a yeast two-hybrid screening on its SecPH domain. LIMK 2, a major kinase of the Rho/ROCK/LIMK 2 /cofilin pathway, was identified in this screening. We confirmed this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and further characterized it. We also demonstrated its specificity: the close related homolog of LIMK 2, LIMK 1, does not interact with the SecPH domain of Nf 1. We then showed that SecPH partially inhibits the kinase activity of LIMK 2 on cofilin. Our results furthermore suggest a precise mechanism for this inhibition: in fact, SecPH would specifically prevent LIMK 2 activation by ROCK, its upstream regulator. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although previous data had already connected Nf 1 to actin cytoskeleton dynamics, our study provides for the first time possible detailed molecular requirements of this involvement. Nf 1 /LIMK 2 interaction and inhibition allows to directly connect neurofibromatosis type I to actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and provides evidence that the RasGAP Nf 1 mediates a new cross-talk between Ras and Rho signaling pathways within the superfamily of small GTPases...|$|R

The genetic studies performed here enable us to present a new model to study RA action during eye development. By inactivating the three RARs, specifically in the periocular mesenchyme, we discriminate the individual contribution of each RAR during eye development and describe a new function for RARs during the formation of the optic nerve. We demonstrate that RARalpha is the only receptor that mediates RA signalling in the neurectoderm during ocular development. Surprisingly, and despite a sophisticated pattern of RA-activity in the developing retina, we observed that RA signalling is not autonomously required in this tissue for eye formation. We show that the action of RA during eye morphogenesis is occurring specifically in neural crest-derived periocular mesenchyme and is mediated by all three RARs. Furthermore, we point out that Pitx 2, which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor, is a key RA-responsive gene in neural crest cells during eye development. Interestingly, we observed that RA is required in the neural crest cells for normal position of the extraocular muscle...|$|R

Here, we used a combination of genetic, pharmacological and explant culture approaches to address this issue, and to investigate how signaling by different RA receptors (RAR) mediates the RA effects. We analyzed initiation of lung development in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase- 2 (Raldh 2) null mice, a model in which RA signaling is absent from the foregut from its earliest developmental stages. We provide evidence that RA is dispensable for specification of lung cell fate in the endoderm. By using synthetic retinoids to selectively activate RAR alpha or beta signaling in this model, we demonstrate novel and unique functions of these receptors in the early lung. We show that activation of RAR beta, but not alpha, induces expression of the fibroblast growth factor Fgf 10 and bud morphogenesis in the lung field. Similar analysis of wild type foregut shows that endogenous RAR alpha activity is required to maintain overall RA signaling, and to refine the RAR beta effects in the lung field. Our data support the idea that balanced activation of RAR alpha and beta is critical for proper lung bud initiation and endodermal differentiation...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceRetinoic acid (<b>RA),</b> {{the active}} {{derivative}} of vitamin A, {{is an important}} signaling molecule that controls various developmental processes and influence the proliferation and differentiation {{of a variety of}} cell types. RA exerts its biological functions primarily through binding to and activating nuclear RA receptors (RARs, which include the RAR alpha, beta and gamma isotypes RARA, RARB and RARC). Aberrant expression or impaired function of these nuclear receptors has been linked to diverse types of cancer. RARs are RA-dependent transcription factors that regulate gene expression through the recruitment of different co-regulators (co-activators and co-repressors). TRIM 24 (formerly known as TIF 1 alpha) was among the first co-regulators identified as interacting with RARs in a ligand-dependent fashion, and it was recently shown to function in mice as a potent liver-specific tumor suppressor by attenuating Rara-mediated transcription. The fact that Trim 24 (-/-), but not Trim 24 (-/-) Rara(+/-), mutant mice are highly predisposed to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has significant implications in cancer research. This result, along with the observation that in response to pharmacological inhibition of the RA signaling, hepatocytes lacking Trim 24 loose their ability to proliferate, strongly implicates Rara as a proto-oncogene in hepatocytes and demonstrates that overactivated RA signaling is deleterious to liver homeostasis...|$|R

RA B cells displayed a constitutively higher production of the pathogenic factors interleukin (IL) - 8 and Gro-α, while their production of several cytokines upon activation via the B cell receptor for antigen (BCR) was broadly suppressed, including a loss of {{the expression of the}} protective factor TRAIL, compared to HD B cells. These defects were partly erased after treatment with the IL- 6 -signalling inhibitor tocilizumab, indicating that abnormal IL- 6 signalling contributed to these abnormalities. Noteworthy, the clinical response of individual patients to tocilizumab therapy could be predicted using the amounts of MIP- 1 β and β-NGF produced by these patients’ B cells before treatment.

In this study, we have assessed whether minimal numbers and/or specific distributions of RA-producing cells can support normal mouse embryonic development. Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH 2) is the main RA-synthesizing enzyme acting during development. We have generated an embryonic stem (ES) cell line homozygous for an Raldh 2 gene disruption, and have analyzed chimeric embryos with various contributions of wild-type cells. Whereas embryos almost completely derived from Raldh 2 (-/-) cells phenocopy the corresponding germline null mutants, the presence of even small numbers (< 10 %) of wild-type cells can rescue most of the morphogenetic defects, including embryonic turning and axial elongation, and left-right looping of the heart tube. No consistent bias {{in the distribution of}} wild-type cells was observed in the phenotypically rescued Raldh 2 (-/-) chimeras. Analysis of an RA-sensitive transgene indicates that RA can diffuse from wild-type cells and elicit a widespread transcriptional response in Raldh 2 -deficient cells. Our results show that few wild-type RA-producing cells, even when present in apparent random distributions, can support early morphogenesis of the mouse embryo. However, the Raldh 2 (-/-) chimeric fetuses display lung abnormalities, persistent truncus arteriosus, and abnormal myocardial differentiation, showing that subsequent RA-dependent events cannot be fully rescued by the mosaic presence of wild-type cells...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceRheumatoid {{arthritis}} (<b>RA)</b> is {{a common}} autoimmune disease with a strong genetic component. Numerous aberrant immune responses have been described during {{the evolution of the}} disease. In later years, the appearance of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) has become a hallmark for the diagnosis and prognosis of RA. The post-translational transformation of arginine residues of proteins and peptides into citrulline (citrullination) is a natural process in the body, but for unknown reasons autoreactivity towards citrullinated residues may develop in disposed individuals. ACPAs are often found years before clinical manifestations. ACPAs are present in about 70 % of RA patients and constitute an important disease marker, distinguishing patient groups with different prognoses and different responses to various treatments. Inside the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, some HLA-DRB 1 alleles are strongly associated with their production. Genome-wide association studies in large patient cohorts have defined a great number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) outside of the HLA region that are associated with ACPA positive (ACPA+) RA. The SNPs are generally located close to or within genes involved in the immune response or signal transduction in immune cells. Some environmental factors such as tobacco smoking are also positively correlated with ACPA production. In this review, we will describe the genes and loci associated with ACPA+ RA or ACPA- RA and attempt to clarify their potential {{role in the development of}} the disease...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceRetinoic acid (<b>RA)</b> is an {{embryonic}} signaling molecule regulating a {{wide array}} of target genes, thereby being a master regulator of patterning and differentiation in a variety of organs. Here we show that mouse embryos deficient for the RA-synthesizing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH 2), if rescued from early lethality by maternal RA supplementation between E 7. 5 and E 8. 5, lack active RA signaling in the foregut region. The resulting mutants completely fail to develop lungs. Development of more posterior foregut derivatives (stomach and duodenum), as well as liver growth, is also severely affected. A primary lung bud is specified in the RA-deficient embryos, which fails to outgrow due to defective FGF 10 signaling and lack of activation of FGF-target genes, such as Pea 3 and Bmp 4 in the epithelium. Specific Hox and Tbx genes may mediate these RA regulatory effects. Development of foregut derivatives can be partly restored in mutants by extending the RA supplementation until at least E 10. 5, but lung growth and branching remain defective and a hypoplastic lung develops on the right side only. Such conditions poorly restore FGF 10 signaling in the lung buds. Explant culture of RALDH 2 -deficient foreguts show a capacity to undergo lung budding and early branching in the presence of RA or FGF 10. Our data implicate RA as a regulator of gene expression in the early embryonic lung and stomach region upstream of Hox, Tbx and FGF 10 signaling...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceRetinoic acid (<b>RA),</b> used as {{first-line}} {{therapy for}} acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), exerts its antileukemic activity by inducing blast differentiation and activating tumor-selective TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) signaling. To identify downstream mediators of RA signaling, we used retrovirus-mediated insertion mutagenesis in PLB 985 leukemia cells and established the RA-resistant cell line WY- 1. In PLB 985, but not WY- 1 cells, RA induced TRAIL and its DR 4 and DR 5 receptors. Knocking down TRAIL expression by RNA interference blocked RA-induced apoptosis. WY- 1 cells are defective for RA-induced differentiation, G 1 arrest and exhibit co-resistance to TRAIL. In WY- 1 cells, a single virus copy is {{integrated into a}} novel RA-regulated gene termed RAM (retinoic acid modulator). RAM is expressed in the myelomonocytic lineage and extinguished by RA in PLB 985, but not WY- 1 cells. Whereas knocking down RAM expression by RNA interference promoted RA-induced differentiation and TRAIL-triggered apoptosis of PLB 985 and WY- 1 cells, overexpression of the predicted 109 amino-acid RAM open reading frame did not alter RA signaling in PLB 985 cells. This indicates that, apart from encoding the putative RAM protein, RAM RNA may exert additional functions that are impaired by the retrovirus insertion. Our study demonstrates that RA induction of the TRAIL pathway is also operative in leukemia cells lacking an RARalpha oncofusion protein and identifies RAM as a novel RA-dependent modulator of myeloid differentiation and death...|$|R
40|$|Background: Since {{approval}} of tocilizumab (TCZ) {{for treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), interleukin 6 (IL- 6) pathway inhibition was evaluated in trials of TCZ and other agents targeting the IL- 6 receptor and ligand in various RA populations and other inflammatory diseases. This consensus document informs on interference with the IL- 6 pathway based on evidence and expert opinion. Methods: Preparation of this document involved <b>international</b> experts in <b>RA</b> treatment and RA patients. A systematic literature search was performed that focused on TCZ and other IL 6 -pathway inhibitors in RA and other diseases. Subsequently, incorporating available published evidence and expert opinion, the steering committee and a broader expert committee (both including RA patients) formulated the current consensus statement. Results: The consensus statement covers use of TCZ as combination- or monotherapy in various RA populations and includes clinical, functional and structural aspects. The statement also addresses the second approved indication in Europe JIA and non-approved indications. Also early phase trials involving additional agents that target the IL- 6 receptor or IL- 6 were evaluated. Safety concerns, including haematological, hepatic and metabolic issues as well as infections, are addressed likewise. Conclusions: The consensus statement identifies points to consider when using TCZ, regarding indications, contraindications, screening, dose, comedication, response evaluation and safety. The document is aimed at supporting clinicians and informing patients, administrators and payers on opportunities and limitations of IL- 6 pathway inhibition. </p...|$|R
