If he cooperates, McGarrett will ensure they stay in America. Sang Min reveals that Hesse is going to leave the island on a Chinese freighter. Danny and McGarrett hastily drive to the docks.

500|$|After {{discovering}} that McClure's {{could not afford}} to pay him, Crane took his war novel to Irving Bacheller of the Bacheller-Johnson Newspaper Syndicate, which agreed to publish The Red Badge of Courage in serial form. Between the third and the ninth of December 1894, The Red Badge of Courage was published in some half-dozen newspapers in the United States. Although it was greatly cut for syndication, Bacheller attested to its causing a stir, saying [...] "its quality [...] immediately felt and recognized." [...] The lead editorial in the Philadelphia Press of December 7 said that Crane [...] "is a new name now and unknown, but everybody will be talking about him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> on as he has begun".|$|E

[...] This suggested that Howe would follow Washington if he went north to assist in the defence of the Hudson. [...] Howe, however, sailed from New York on 23 July. [...] On 30 August, shortly after his arrival at Head of Elk, Howe wrote to Germain that he would be unable to assist Burgoyne, citing a lack of Loyalist support in the Philadelphia area.|$|E

Just {{three days before}} his trial with Cardiff was set to begin Ray Clemence, the Barnet manager, offered Primus a two-year contract with the club. It was later revealed that Clemence was told by his assistant, Terry Harvey, that he should sign him immediately: [...] "Get in now and sign him, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> down to Cardiff and sees their stadium he will sign for them." [...] Primus was determined to prove Charlton wrong and says he [...] "grew from a boy to a man" [...] at Barnet. This was also a time when depression was common for Primus, and he became addicted to alcohol and drugs such as ecstasy and LSD.|$|E
500|$|Ruth {{had asked}} Yankees general manager Ed Barrow for {{permission}} to barnstorm. Barrow had no objection but warned Ruth he must obtain Landis's consent. [...] Landis biographer Spink, {{who was at the}} time the editor of The Sporting News, stated, [...] "I can say that Ruth {{knew exactly what he was}} doing when he defied Landis in October, 1921. He was willing to back his own popularity and well-known drawing powers against the Judge." [...] Ruth, to the commissioner's irritation, did not contact Landis until October 15, one day before the first exhibition. When the two spoke by telephone, Landis ordered Ruth to attend a meeting with him; Ruth refused, stating that he had to leave for Buffalo for the first game. Landis angrily refused consent for Ruth to barnstorm, and after slamming down the receiver, is recorded as saying, [...] "Who the hell does that big ape think he is? [...] That blankety-blank! [...] <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> on that trip it will be one of the sorriest things he has ever done." [...] By one account, Yankees co-owner Colonel Tillinghast Huston attempted to dissuade Ruth as he departed, only to be told by the ballplayer, [...] "Aw, tell the old guy to jump in a lake." ...|$|E
500|$|For Final Fantasy XII, Balthier was {{voiced by}} Gideon Emery in English and Hiroaki Hirata in Japanese. Emery commented that while voicing the {{character}} of Balthier, he developed a [...] "small crush" [...] on Fran, Balthier's partner. He also commented that the biggest challenge of voicing Balthier was having to stay consistent, adding that he spent {{more than four hours}} in a small booth while doing the voice, which could cause him to [...] "drift away from the character" [...] <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> on for too long. He also described him as being similar to the character. Emery auditioned for Balthier, seeing him after he did this and [...] "instantly {{fell in love with the}} character". He described him as a cross between Han Solo, James Bond, and Jack Sparrow, citing suave yet cocky attitude. He was thankful that he was not aware of Balthier's popularity since his reveal, stating that he would have been [...] "crippled by the fear of not delivering on what the fans expected". He stated that he took no inspiration from anyone else for the role, wanting to ensure that he was unique. Instead, he cited the pictures and animation of the character as his inspiration. Emery cited Jack Fletcher, the voice director, as a great help in voicing the character and setting up the scene for him. To give Final Fantasy XII a Western feel, Balthier's movements were recorded by a Western motion capture actor.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Brian {{has been}} out of town {{attending}} a seminar on creating a web series and is unaware of what has transpired. On his way home, Brian stops at the Marriott, meets Ida, and starts having drinks with her. Quickly bonding, they retire to Ida's room for sex, with Ida leaving first, then Brian after telling the barman to bill the drinks to her room. The next morning, Brian shares his newfound love with Peter and Lois before showing them a picture of Ida on his cellphone. Peter and Lois go into hysterics, while Brian, unaware of Ida's operation, believes they are just jealous. After Stewie tells him that Quagmire's father has had a sex change and reveals Ida's name, Brian realizes that he has had sex with Quagmire's transgendered father and vomits for almost 30 uninterrupted seconds before the two of them panic. At the same time, Ida returns to Quagmire's home and apologizes, and Quagmire returns the favor, reconciling their relationship. Ida tells Quagmire that she met someone, and when she says it was Brian, whom Quagmire despises, he becomes furious. Brian is traumatized for no reason after finding out about Ida and, when he hears Quagmire come inside the house, he tries to hide under Peter and Lois' bed, but Quagmire finds him easily, because Brian's feet were sticking out from under the bed, and brutally beats him, thus threatening to blow his head off <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> near Quagmire's house. Brian gets the final word — [...] "Hey, I fucked your dad." [...] — and angrily slams the door shut.|$|E
500|$|... 808s & Heartbreak {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 36 reviews. Chris Richards from The Washington Post called it [...] "an information-age masterpiece", while USA Today critic Steve Jones said [...] "West deftly uses the 808 drum machine and Auto-Tune vocal effect to channel his feelings of hurt, anger and doubt through his well-crafted lyrics". Dan Cairns from The Times stated, [...] "This so should not work...Yet 808s & Heartbreak is a triumph, recklessly departing from the commercially copper-bottomed script and venturing far beyond West’s comfort zone." [...] Rolling Stones Jody Rosen commended West's {{incorporation of the}} Roland TR-808 drum machine and described the album as [...] "Kanye's would-be Here, My Dear or Blood on the Tracks, a mournful song-suite that swings violently between self-pity and self-loathing". In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot called it West's [...] "most radical yet" [...] and said while West's fans may be disappointed, [...] "this one is for him. It {{remains to be seen}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> back to making records for everybody else. For now, this is one fascinatingly perverse detour." [...] PopMatters critic Dave Heaton was impressed by West's [...] "song and album construction, and with the way he captures a particular feeling through unusual, evocative, carefully crafted music that’s both simple and complex, cold and warm, mechanical and human, melodic and harsh". Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau found it [...] "brilliant" [...] with a unique [...] "dark sound" [...] and [...] "engaging tunes", despite a second-half drop-off, and praised West's use of Auto-Tune, which he felt [...] "both undercuts his self-importance and adds physical reality to tales of alienated fame that might otherwise be pure pity parties".|$|E
