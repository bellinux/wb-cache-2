5000|$|John Serba of Allmusic {{criticized the}} band stating, [...] "Lyrically tired and musically derivative, Monstrosity remains firmly {{rooted in the}} early-1990s meat-and-potatoes death metal ethic, <b>eyes</b> not <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> the genre's future like Nile or Absu, or on memorable songwriting." [...] Serba also stated that in Rise to Power, the group [...] "still doesn't {{break out of the}} third tier of Floridian-via-New York City-style baby-eaters, {{stringing}} together a bunch of musically competent, third-generation, ripped-off Morbid Angel-via-Slayer-while-sleeping-with-Suffocation riffs, peppered with clackity-typewriter double-bass drums and vocals from Glen Benton's evil second cousin's former roommate, thrice removed." [...] He complemented, [...] "Monstrosity attempts to scorch already blackened, barren ground, with no lighter fluid or original ideas in its possession." ...|$|R

50|$|The video {{begins in}} the middle of a foggy field with Hayley Williams and a soldier. Their <b>eyes</b> are <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> each other, and then the soldier throws a hand grenade. The song starts as Williams closes her eyes just before the grenade explodes. When she's down, a {{sequence}} of action ensues with men who appear to be with Williams (including Jeremy Davis and Taylor York) fighting men on the soldier's side. As Williams makes a trek towards the soldier, men on her side continuously tackle anyone trying to reach her. Someone hands Williams a color flare she sets off, making soldiers put on gas masks. The others with flares get hit by the soldiers with batons and cause bursts of colored dust as a metaphor for blood. Williams eventually stands face-to-face with the soldier and gets hit with a baton as the song enters the bridge, causing bright blue dust to go everywhere on her. After she looks around and sees Davis and York pinned down, she charges the soldier but is seized by his men. The soldier pulls out a baton and prepares to strike her, but she breaks free and hugs him. His motions freeze, he drops his baton and hugs her back, leaving everyone on the battlefield cheering. The video closes with a shot of Williams still hugging the soldier as he closes his eyes.|$|R
