5|$|In {{individuals}} with developmental disabilities, occurrence of self-harm is often demonstrated {{to be related}} to its effects on the environment, such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands. As developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits, self-harm may be their way of obtaining these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially appropriate way (such as by asking). One approach for treating self-harm thus <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> an alternative, appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self-harm.|$|E

Members of the confraternity serve as teachers in the Sunday Schools of the parish (there are seven different Sunday Schools belonging to Mt. St. Peter's in total). These teachers send out the Catholic messages of faith and love through words, stories, examples, and prayers in order to help the children grow in their faith.

40|$|We {{report on}} survey data {{collected}} from 776 final-year student teachers from 11 higher edu-cation institutions in October 2004. The purpose of the survey <b>was</b> <b>to</b> find out how many newly qualified teachers <b>were</b> planning <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> abroad and how many <b>were</b> planning <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> in South Africa. Two issues formed {{the backdrop of the}} study: teacher migration and teacher shortages in South Africa. Key findings from the study showed that 27. 4 % of the student teachers <b>were</b> planning <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> abroad in 2005, 63. 3 % <b>were</b> planning <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> in South Africa, and the remainder (7. 2 %) <b>were</b> not planning <b>to</b> <b>teach.</b> However the vast majority of those planning <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> abroad indicated that they would <b>be</b> returning <b>to</b> South Africa within two years. Of the student teachers who <b>were</b> planning <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> in South Africa, only 33 % indicated that they already had a job secured for 2005. Three-quarters of these posts <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid by school governing bodies in ex-Model C schools. We argue that teacher shortages are not translating into available jobs for newly qualified teachers. Issues of race cannot be ignored, in that white teachers <b>are</b> more likely <b>to</b> get posts in well-resourced schools, and <b>are</b> more likely <b>to</b> go abroad <b>to</b> <b>teach...</b>|$|R

25|$|Saṅkrānti (Hindi: सङ्क्रान्ति, meaning Revolution): In {{the first}} 27 verses (first quarter) of the canto, the poet expounds on Saṅkrānti, {{the concept of}} true revolution. It {{is not to be}} {{attained}} by spilling blood, but by spreading a thought. Rarely do people want such a revolution, their egos do not allow it. The narrative then proceeds – after the Puṃsavana and Sīmantonnayana Saṃskāras of Sujātā, one day, late in the night, Kahola is practising Vedic chanting, perfecting his knowledge of what he <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> his disciples on the following day. Out of fatigue and the four defects of Bhrama, Pramāda, Vipralipsā and Karaṇāpāṭava, Kahola starts erring in all eight types of recitations – Jaṭā, Rekhā, Mālā, Śikhā, Ratha, Dhvaja, Daṇḍa, and Ghana. The child of Sujātā, while still in the womb, thinks about this for some time and then asks his father to stop practising and teaching verses incorrectly, pointing out that the sage is making eight errors in reciting each verse. Kahola is taken aback and asks the child in the womb to stay quiet, saying he is reciting as per tradition, and forgetfulness is only human. The child replies by saying that the father should throw away the old corpse of so-called tradition and again requests Kahola to learn the Vedas once more from Uddālaka. The enraged Kahola curses the child to be born with all eight limbs crooked. Kahola repents immediately after, but the child (Aṣṭāvakra) takes the curse in his stride, and asks his father not to repent.|$|E

500|$|It was {{amid the}} New Woman and burgeoning suffragist {{movements}} that, in 1908, O'Neill began {{to concentrate on}} producing original artwork, and {{it was during this}} period that she created the whimsical Kewpie characters for which she became known. Their name, [...] "Kewpie", derives from Cupid, the Roman god of love. According to O'Neill, she became obsessed with the idea of the cherubic characters, to the point that she had dreams about them: [...] "I thought about the Kewpies so much that I had a dream about them where they were all doing acrobatic pranks on the coverlet of my bed. One sat in my hand." [...] She described them as [...] "a sort of little round fairy whose one idea <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> people to be merry and kind at the same time". The Kewpie characters made their debut in comic strip form in 1909 in an issue of Ladies' Home Journal. Further publications of the Kewpie comics in Woman's Home Companion and Good Housekeeping helped the cartoon grow in popularity rapidly.|$|E
