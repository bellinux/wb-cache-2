We consider that one phase is a highly viscous thermodependent liquid (polymer phase), whereas the second one is a low viscosity low temperature fluid (water). The {{first part of this}} paper concerns capture of the interface between the water and the polymer (or determination of the phase field function). Classical VOF and Level set techniques have been implemented and were ameliorated using mesh adaptation techniques. To accurately determine the velocity field, a two-phase formulation is considered, based in the theory of mixtures, and we introduce a scalar parameter, the phase fraction quantifying the presence of each phase in each point of the computational domain. A <b>friction</b> <b>type</b> <b>coupling</b> between both phases is retained. Using the mixed finite element method within an eulerian framework, we calculate in a single system the whole kinematic variables for both liquids (velocity and pressure of each phase). Results are shown, for 2 D and 3 D part...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} an attempt to study the wear {{calculation}} method for rotating shaft in the <b>friction</b> <b>couple</b> <b>type</b> shaft-cuff in conditions of oiling in high dusty environment. The size and quantity of abrasive particles that go into the clearance between friction surfaces, definition of the pressure including the load in conjugate that is given by the cuff spring as the radial force, and the effected contact area including the micro hardness of the shaft surface (taking into account the influence of the finishing treatment as a diamond pressing) have been calculated by utilization of above mentioned method. Furthermore, the volume wear has been calculated by the energy of friction including both the factor of energy transition to heat and the latent melting heat of shaft material. In this study the experimental scheme for wear testing of steel shaft in the <b>friction</b> <b>couple</b> <b>type</b> “shaft-cuff ” and the theoretical and experimental results have been given, Fig. 4. It has proved that this method permits to choose the effective materials for parts making and the use of effective finishing treatment. Morethan, it permits to choose optimum properties of the parts surface layer. This may be attained on the stage of designing- to prognosis shaft and couple friction conjugates wear. Therefore, this method provides a maximum wear resistance and the ability to calculate parts life before damage...|$|R

40|$|In {{manufacturing}} processes, {{surfaces and}} their properties {{are as important}} as the bulk properties of the materials. Surface treatment is an important aspect of all manufacturing processes. It has been used to impart certain physical and mechanical properties, such as appearance, corrosion, friction, wear and fatigue resistance. Widely used methods of finishing treatment that create necessary parts with the given roughness usually do not provide optimum quality of the surface. Therefore, methods of surface plastic deformation (SPD) are used. One of the most effective representative is the diamond pressing. In this paper the effect of diamond pressing process with a different pressing force (50, 100, 150, 200, 250) N on the state of heat-treated alloy steel surfaces was studied and the results of the experiments are presented. Enhancements on the micro hardness of the heat treated alloy steel surfaces that have been processed by diamond pressing up to the following percentages compared to the ground surfaces: 32, 28, 31 and 43 % for D 2, O 1, H 13 and 3115 hardened alloy steel surfaces, respectively. In addition, {{it has been shown that}} there is an enhancement on the surface quality of heat-treated alloy steel surfaces. The best enhancement of the average surface roughness (Ra) was 16. 6, 45, 36 and 50 % for D 2, O 1, H 13 and 3115, respectively, which are heat-treated. For the microstructure analysis, micrograph of the processed surfaces of D 2 heat-treated alloy steel was given. It has been shown that the depth of plastic deformed layer about 200 &# 956;m.

40|$|A exotic {{class of}} {{nonlinear}} p-form nonabelian gauge theories is studied, {{arising from the}} most general allowed nontrivial deformation of linear abelian gauge theory {{for a set of}} massless 1 -form fields and 2 -form fields in four dimensions. These theories combine a Chapline-Manton <b>type</b> <b>coupling</b> of the 1 -forms and 2 -forms, along with a Yang-Mills coupling of the 1 -forms, a Freedman-Townsend coupling of the 2 -forms, and an extended Freedman-Townsend <b>type</b> <b>coupling</b> between the 1 -forms and 2 -forms. It is shown that the resulting theories have a geometrically interesting dual formulation that is equivalent to an exotic Yang-Mills dilaton theory involving a nonlinear sigma field.
