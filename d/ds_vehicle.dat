50|$|Bastien-Thiry led {{the most}} {{prominent}} of several assassination attempts on de Gaulle. His group made preparations in the Paris suburb of Petit-Clamart. On 22 August 1962, de Gaulle's car (a Citroën DS) and some nearby shops were raked with machine-gun fire. De Gaulle, his wife and entourage escaped, uninjured. After the attempt, holes from fourteen bullets were found in the president's vehicle, one of which barely missed the president's head; another twenty were found to have struck the nearby Café Trianon; and an additional 187 spent shell casings were found on the pavement. This event was fictionalized in the 1971 book The Day of the Jackal. De Gaulle credited the unusual resilience of the <b>DS</b> <b>vehicle</b> with saving his life —even though the shots had punctured two of the armoured tires, the car escaped at full speed.|$|E

30|$|For a 2 <b>D</b> <b>vehicle</b> model, {{only the}} {{longitudinal}} unevenness profile representing the deviation {{at a point}} along the road is considered. Road unevenness is measured by two general types of equipment: profilometers, which measure the unevenness in a straight-forward way, and response-type devices, which measure the unevenness in an indirect way, as the dynamic response of the measuring equipment [8]. When the road shows discrete or periodic irregularities, such as joints, potholes, or cracking zones [13], a description by a PSD is not suitable.|$|R
30|$|The rest of {{this paper}} is {{organized}} as follows. In Section 2, we present the system architecture, our design goals, and relevant preliminaries. In Sections 3 and 4, we present our proposed 3 <b>D</b> <b>vehicle</b> positioning schemes for V 2 R communications and V 2 V communications, respectively. We then evaluate both schemes using simulations. In the evaluation, we adopt the Shadowing model [38] which resembles an actual road scenario. The evaluation and the findings are presented in Section 5. In Section 6, we present our conclusion.|$|R

There was one failure when the fourth Canyon was launched on December 4, 1971. The Atlas's guidance system failed during ascent, resulting in spurious commands {{that sent the}} booster off-course leading to a Range Safety destruct. Since the failure took place behind cloud cover (the weather on December 4 was damp, foggy, and overcast), it was not visible {{from the ground and}} so the Air Force waited two days to make an announcement.|$|R
40|$|Pavements are 3 D {{in their}} shape. They can be {{captured}} {{in three dimensions}} by modern road mapping equipment which allows {{for the assessment of}} pavement evenness in a more holistic way as opposed to current practice which divides into longitudinal and transversal evenness. It makes sense to use 3 <b>D</b> <b>vehicle</b> models to simulate the effects of 3 D surface data on certain functional criteria like pavement loading, cargo loading and driving comfort. In order to evaluate the three criteria mentioned two vehicle models have been created: a passenger car used to assess driving comfort and a truck-semitrailer submodel used to assess pavement and cargo loading. The vehicle models and their application to 3 D surface data are presented. The results are well in line with existing single-track (planar) models. Their advantage over existing 1 D/ 2 D models is demonstrated by the example of driving comfort evaluation. Existing “geometric” limit values for the assessment of longitudinal evenness in terms of the power spectral density could be used to establish corresponding limit values for the dynamic response, i. e. driving comfort, pavement loading and cargo loading. The limit values are well in line with existing limit values based on planar vehicle models. They can be used as guidelines for the proposal of future limit values. The investigations show that the use of 3 <b>D</b> <b>vehicle</b> models is an appropriate and meaningful way of assessing 3 D evenness data gathered by modern road mapping systems...|$|R

Meanwhile the harmonic response analysis of engine’s single sine vibration is obtained in stimulation processing based on the modal calculation. Then the rule of influence on the auto body sheets to node load environment was explored further. Node load environment increased the resonance amplitude of harmonic response analysis. What’s more, the resonance amplitude increased as the increasing of node loads, which would increase the probability of vehicle structure failure. ...|$|R

50|$|Convair {{developed}} a specially-enhanced {{version of the}} Atlas <b>D</b> <b>vehicle</b> for mating with Centaur stages; the Atlas was equipped with an uprated propulsion system, the MA-5, which had twin turbopumps on each booster engine, and the structure reinforced for the large upper stage, along with elongated fuel tanks. Centaur development was made somewhat difficult by the insistence on modifying Atlas components rather than develop totally new ones. This was done for time and budget reasons and because it allowed the Centaur to be manufactured on the existing Atlas assembly line at Convair. The engines were manufactured by Pratt and Whitney. There were considerable difficulties integrating the two vehicles, especially because Atlas-Centaur would be almost 30% longer than an Atlas ICBM and there were doubts as to its aerodynamic stability in flight.|$|R

In the proposed framework, 2 D LIDAR aiding {{is carried out}} without imposing any assumptions on the vehicle motion (e. g. we allow full six degree-of freedom motion). To achieve this, a closed-form formula is derived to predict the line measurement in the LIDAR's frame. This makes the feature association, residual formation and GUI display possible. With this formula, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) can be employed in a straightforward manner to fuse the LIDAR and IMU data to estimate the full state of the vehicle.

The road unevenness subjects the vehicle to vertical oscillations that cause dynamic axle loads. A simple 2 <b>D</b> <b>vehicle</b> model is used for the calculation of the axle loads from the longitudinal road profile. The free field soil response is calculated with the dynamic Betti-Rayleigh reciprocity theorem, using a transfer function between the road and the receiver that accounts for dynamic road-soil interaction. The calculation of the transfer function is based on a dynamic substructure method with a boundary element method for the soil and an analytical beam model for the road. The methodology is finally illustrated by a numerical example where the free field vibrations generated by the passage of a vehicle on a traffic plateau are calculated...|$|R
