5000|$|The system {{consists}} of all vital components for monitoring and controlling the {{discharge from the}} vessel's oily water separator. The white box includes a stainless steel cage with a locked door. The bilge water from the oily water separator is pumped through the white box and analyzed by an oil <b>content</b> <b>meter.</b> A flow switch secures that there is flow through the oil <b>content</b> <b>meter</b> and a flow meter counts the accumulated discharged overboard volume. If the door is opened, the oil content exceeds the legal limit of 15 parts per million (PPM) or the flow to the oil <b>content</b> <b>meter</b> is lost the three way valve will immediately redirect the bilge water back to the bilge water holding tank. All components inside the system are connected to a digital recorder mounted in the engine control room that records the oil content, three way valve position, flow through oil <b>content</b> <b>meter,</b> accumulated discharged volume, door position together with the vessels geographical position and time. The chief engineer possesses the key and when locked, the system [...] cannot be tampered with and equally importantly provides {{the evidence that the}} vessel has been compliant. The recorder data is stored in an encrypted format and can be presented to any official body such as Port State Control, United States Coast Guard, Vetting or Classification society officials to prove that the vessel has been compliant to MARPOL 73/78 (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships) or any national regulation, and that no illegal discharge has been made.|$|R

50|$|Chlorophyll <b>content</b> <b>meters</b> are {{commonly}} used for nutrient plant stress measurement, that includes nitrogen stress, and sulfur stress. Because research has shown, that if used correctly, chlorophyll <b>content</b> <b>meters</b> are reliable for nitrogen management work, these meters are often the instruments of choice for crop fertilizer management because they are relatively inexpensive. Research has demonstrated that by comparing well fertilized plants to test plants, {{the ratio of the}} chlorophyll content index of test plants, divided by the chlorophyll content index of well fertilized plants, will provide a ratio that is an indication of when fertilization should occur, and how much should be used. It is common to use a well fertilized stand of crops in a specific field and sometimes in different areas of the same field, as the fertilization reference, due to differences from field to field and within a field. The research done to date uses either ten and thirty measurements on test and well fertilized crops, to provide average values. Studies have been done for corn and wheat. One paper suggests that when the ratio drops below 95%, it is time to fertigate. The amounts of fertilizer are also recommended.|$|R
50|$|An OWS {{needs to}} be fitted with an oil <b>content</b> <b>meter</b> (OCM) that samples the OWS {{overboard}} discharge water for oil content. If the oil content is less than 15 ppm, the OCM allows the water to be discharged overboard. If the oil content is higher than 15 ppm, the OCM will activate an alarm and move a three-way valve that, within {{a short period of}} time, will recirculate the overboard discharge water to a tank on the OWS suction side.|$|R
50|$|An OCM is a {{small part}} of what is called the oil {{discharge}} monitoring and control system. The first part is the oil <b>content</b> <b>meter.</b> The second is a flow meter which measures the flow rate of the water at the discharge pipe. Third, is a computing unit which calculates how much oil has actually been discharged along with the day and time of the discharge. And lastly is the overboard valve control system which is essentially just a valve that can stop the discharge from flowing out at the appropriate time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this study}} is to develop oil content {{measurement}} system using transmitted and scattered intensity. Two fluorescence analyses would be suggested with methods that it can use rapidly, continuously, conveniently and accurately in long-distance cruise vessels. The present paper consists of the structure of fluorescence measurement hardware and an interpretative analysis of experimental data. Proposed rule-based fuzzy concentration map offers the possibility of the conversion of fluorescence into oil content. This measurement method would be applied oil discharge monitoring control equipment in cruise vessels. Keywords—oil <b>content</b> <b>meter,</b> oil discharge monitoring system, fluorescence analysis, rule-based fuzzy concentration map. ...|$|R
50|$|The OCM {{continuously}} monitors {{how much}} oil {{is in the}} water that is pumped out the discharge line of the OWS system. The OCM will not allow the oil concentration of the exiting water to be above the Marpol standard of 15 ppm. This standard was first adopted in 1977 with Resolution A.393(X) which was published by IMO. These standards were updated various but the most current resolution is MEPC 107(49). The oil <b>content</b> <b>meter</b> will sound an alarm if the liquid leaving the system has an unsatisfactory amount {{of oil in the}} mixture. If it is still above that standard, then the bilge water will be reentered into the system until it meets the required criteria. The OCM uses light beams to determine how oily the water in the system is. The system will then gauge the oil concentration based on a light intensity <b>meter.</b> Modern oil <b>content</b> <b>meters</b> also have a data logging system that can store oil concentration measurements for more than 18 months.If the OCM determines that there is far too much of a type of oil, the OCM may be fouled and needs to be flushed out. Running clean water through the OCM sensor cell is one way it can be cleaned. Also scrubbing the sensor area with a bottle brush is another effective method. The new MEPC 107(49) regulations have set out stringent actions that require the OCM to be tamper proof and also the OCM needs to have an alarm that sounds whenever the OCM is being cleaned. When the alarm goes off, the OCM functionality will be checked by crew members.|$|R
50|$|Crop {{consultants}} {{also use}} these tools for fertilizer recommendations. However, because strict scientific protocols are more time consuming and more expensive, consultants sometimes use well-fertilized plants located in low-lying areas {{as the standard}} well-fertilized plants. They typically also use fewer measurements. The evidence for this approach involves anecdotal discussions with crop consultants.Chlorophyll <b>content</b> <b>meters</b> are sensitive to both nitrogen and sulfur stress at usable levels. Chlorophyll fluorometers require a special assay, involving a high actinic light level in combination with nitrogen stress, to measure nitrogen stress at usable levels. In addition, chlorophyll fluorometers will only detect sulfur stress at starvation levels. For best results, chlorophyll content measurements should be made when water deficits are not present. Photosynthesis systems will detect both nitrogen and sulfur stress.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{therefore}} samples {{which are not}} suitable for the absorption technique, these include small leaves, most CAM plants, conifer needles, fruit, algae on rocks, bryophytes, lichens and plant structures like stems and petioles. For these samples {{it is necessary to}} measure chlorophyll content using chlorophyll fluorescence.In his scientific paper Gitelson (1999) states, [...] "The ratio between chlorophyll fluorescence, at 735 nm and the wavelength range 700nm to 710 nm, F735/F700 was found to be linearly proportional to the chlorophyll content (with determination coefficient, r2, more than 0.95) and thus this ratio {{can be used as a}} precise indicator of chlorophyll content in plant leaves." [...] The fluorescent ratio chlorophyll <b>content</b> <b>meters</b> use this technique to measure these more difficult samples.|$|R

40|$|Summary We {{conducted}} two {{experiments to}} determine the usefulness of a chlorophyll <b>content</b> <b>meter</b> (CCM) for the mea-surement of foliar chlorophyll concentration in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) in the fall color period. In Experi-ment 1, four sugar maple trees were visually assigned to each of four fall foliage color categories in October 1998. On four dates {{in the fall of}} 1999, leaves were taken from the trees and analyzed for chlorophyll concentration by absorbance of pig-ment extracts and by determination of the chlorophyll content index (CCI) with a CCM. The two measures of chlorophyll concentration were strongly correlated (P < 0. 001, r 2 = 0. 72). In Experiment 2, the CCI of leaves from sugar maple trees subjected to one of four fertilization treatments (lime, lime + manure, lime + 10 : 10 : 10 N,P,K fertilizer and an untreated con-trol) were determined with a CCM. Treatment effects were distinguishable between all pairwise comparisons (P < 0. 001), except for the lime versus lime + NPK fertilizer treatments...|$|R

Total phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were determined using the spectrophotometer (Philip PU 8620 UV/VIS/NIR model) and Jenway flame photometer (PFP 7), respectively. Plant available N (NH 4 and NO 3) were determined according methods described by Bremmer (1965). Electrical conductivity (EC) and pH of the medium and nutrient solutions were determined following standard procedures, as described in USDA and USCC (2001). Bulk density and water holding capacity of the medium were determined according to methods described in Okalebo et al. (2002) and Vengadaramana and Jashothan (2012), respectively. Transplants were sampled (five plants/treatment rep) every 7  days and the following growth parameters measured: leaf chlorophyll content, number of leaves, plant height, root length, stem diameter, shoot dry matter (DM), root DM, and shoot/root ratio. The leaf chlorophyll content was measured using Apogee chlorophyll <b>content</b> <b>meter</b> (Model CCM- 200), plant height and root length (in cm) were measured with a rule, and stem diameter was measured 1  cm above growth medium surface {{with a pair of}} Vernier callipers.

40|$|A plant {{chlorophyll}} <b>content</b> <b>meter</b> {{is described}} which collects light reflected from a target plant and separates the collected light into two different wavelength bands. These wavelength bands, or channels, {{are described as}} having center wavelengths of 700 nm and 840 nm. The light collected in these two channels are processed using photo detectors and amplifiers. An {{analog to digital converter}} is described which provides a digital representation of the level of light collected by the lens and falling within the two channels. A controller provided in the meter device compares the level of light reflected from a target plant with a level of light detected from a light source, such as light reflected by a target having 100 % reflectance, or transmitted through a diffusion receptor. The percent of reflection in the two separate wavelength bands from a target plant are compared to provide a ratio which indicates a relative level of plant physiological stress. A method of compensating for electronic drift is described where a sample is taken when a collection lens is covered to prevent light from entering the device.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report {{was to assess the}} ability of several different devices to measure moisture content and dry density of various compacted geomaterials. The experimental research involved the testing of different subgrade soils and one base material. More than a dozen specimens, 2 ft in height and 1. 5 ft in diameter, were constructed to evaluate the Transtech SDG 200, Purdue TDR, and the Decagon 10 HS moisture content sensor. The Speedy Moisture Tester and DOT 600 Roadbed Water <b>Content</b> <b>Meter</b> were also evaluated using individual soil samples. All materials were tested at five different moisture contents, but at their corresponding maximum dry densities. ^ The Transtech SDG 200 and Purdue TDR estimate both the moisture content and dry density. Conversely, the DOT 600 Meter, Speedy Moisture Tester, and the Decagon 10 HS Sensor only estimate the moisture content. The estimated quantities of each device were compared with oven-dry moisture contents measured from samples extracted from each specimen. ^ Overall, the Purdue TDR was slightly more accurate in determining the moisture content and dry density of the materials tested, when compared to the SDG 200. The Speedy Moisture Tester was the most accurate in determining the moisture content, while the DOT 600 Meter overestimated or underestimated the moisture content for a majority of the specimens. ...|$|R
