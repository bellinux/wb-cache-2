40|$|My Senior Thesis Project is {{a visual}} effects demo reel that showcases my {{abilities}} to create realistic visual effects. The demo reel is two and half {{minutes of the}} best work I completed this semester compiled in one video. I completed seven visual effect projects {{over the course of}} this semester. I used various computer programs to complete these projects including Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Softlmage, PFTrackerX, Cameratracker, and Trapcode Particular. The intent of my demo reel is to show professional level visual effects to prospective employers and to show an audience. The seven projects I have completed {{at the end of the}} semester are a few 3 D set extensions, screen replacement, artificial heads up <b>display,</b> <b>arm</b> tracking and fire simulation, and a short replacement videos.

40|$|The arm {{structure}} of the Milky Way remains somewhat of an unknown, with observational studies hindered by our location within the Galactic disc. In the work presented here we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and radiative transfer to create synthetic longitude-velocity observations. Our aim is to reverse-engineer a top down map of the Galaxy by comparing synthetic longitude-velocity maps to those observed. We {{set up a system}} of N-body particles to represent the disc and bulge, allowing for dynamic creation of spiral features. Interstellar gas, and the molecular content, is evolved alongside the stellar system. A 3 D-radiative transfer code is then used to compare the models to observational data. The resulting models <b>display</b> <b>arm</b> features that are a good reproduction of many of the observed emission structures of the Milky Way. These arms however are dynamic and transient, allowing {{for a wide range of}} morphologies not possible with standard density wave theory. The best fitting models are a much better match than previous work using fixed potentials. They favour a 4 -armed model with a pitch angle of approximately 20 degrees, though with a pattern speed that decreases with increasing Galactic radius. Inner bars are lacking however, which appear required to fully reproduce the central molecular zone. Comment: 16 pages, 15 figures, accepted by MNRA...|$|E
