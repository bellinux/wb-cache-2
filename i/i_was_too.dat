Attalus' mother, Antiochis, {{was related to the}} Seleucid royal family (being a granddaughter of Seleucus I Nicator) with her marriage to Attalus' father likely arranged by Philetaerus to solidify his power. This would be consistent with the conjecture that Attalus' father had been Philetaerus' heir designate, but was succeeded by Eumenes, since Attalus <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> young when his father died.|$|E
25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon {{the heart and soul of}} innocence.|$|E

500|$|As Pei, {{neared the}} end of his {{secondary}} education, he decided to study at a university. He was accepted to a number of schools, but decided to enroll at the University of Pennsylvania. Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him. The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of Bing Crosby, which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. [...] "College life in the U.S. {{seemed to me to be}} mostly fun and games", he said in 2000. [...] "Since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it...

I decided that was the country for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Stefani {{initially}} did {{not intend}} to tour to support the album, responding [...] "What tour?" [...] to a question from MTV News in December 2004 regarding a possible tour. She later mentioned several times that she had not originally intended to tour in support of the album, referring to her [...] "illegal tour" [...] and apologizing for her breaking her promise not to tour on stage at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota on November 14 and admitting [...] "I just wanted to make a record. I didn't want to tour, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> tired, then you guys kept buying the record, and I had to come out and see you guys" [...] on stage at Winnipeg on November 16. In a September interview with MTV News, Stefani said of the tour: [...] "I'm looking forward to it, it's going to be unbelievable.

500|$|Both Surfer Rosa and Steve Albini's {{production}} of the album have been influential on alternative rock, and on grunge in particular. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa {{as the basis for}} Neverminds songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1993 that he [...] "heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw out because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> afraid to play them for anybody." [...] Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as [...] "the one that made me go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame." [...] Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa [...] "blew my mind," [...] and that she [...] "immediately went to track down Steve Albini." [...] Cobain listed Surfer Rosa as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Erlewine—the website's senior editor—claimed that New York Dolls {{was a more}} quintessential proto-punk album {{than any of the}} Stooges' releases because of how it [...] "plunders history while celebrating it, creating a sleazy urban mythology along the way". David Fricke argued that it was a more definitive glam rock album than David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust (1972) or anything by Marc Bolan because of how the band [...] "captured both the glory and sorrow of glam, the high jinx and wasted youth, with electric photorealism". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Joe Gross called it an [...] "absolutely essential" [...] record and [...] "epic sleaze, the sound of five young men shaping the big city in their own scuzzy image". Sylvain attributed its influence on punk rock to how Rundgren recorded his guitar through the left speaker and Thunders' guitar on the right side, an orientation which he said younger bands such as the Ramones and the Sex Pistols adopted. Rundgren was amused by how the record became considered a precursor to the punk movement: [...] "The irony is that I wound up producing the seminal punk album, but I was never really thought of as a punk producer, and I never got called by punk acts. They probably thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> expensive for what they were going for. But the Dolls didn't really consider themselves punk." ...|$|E
500|$|It is an R {{song with}} {{elements}} of electro. Lyrically, Carey is recounting a past relationship which fell into [...] "violent times", {{and how she}} still deals {{with the effects of}} what she experienced. Carey begins with the line [...] "I was a girl/ You were ‘the man'/ <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> young to understand/ I was naïve /Believing everything you told me." [...] Although Carey never mentions Mottola's name, many critics believed that she was addressing him directly in the lines [...] "Shining like a chandelier/ That decorated every room inside/ The private hell we built", [...] "Sleeping with the enemy, aware that he was smothering every last part of me" [...] and [...] "Said you were strong/ Protecting me/ Then I found out that you were weak/ Keepin' me there, under your thumb/ Cause you were scared that I'd become much/ More than you could handle." [...] After confessing that she would [...] " [...] up scared some nights, still dreaming about the violent times," [...] Carey decides {{to walk away from the}} relationship, and declares [...] "but I still live with the side effects". J. Freedom De Luc of The Washington Post likened the [...] "echoing" [...] repetition of [...] "Side effects" [...] to that of Rihanna's on her 2007 single [...] "Umbrella". In an interview with Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, Carey explained why she felt compelled to write the song: ...|$|E
500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] he said. As for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there was nothing to do except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E

When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then.

500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, and let me tell you why: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> young and too stupid to realize that I was in a lot of danger." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... to cover my cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, {{for the first time in}} my life, I couldn’t dance strong. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> busy trying to hide my breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says that, over the next year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral part of who I am as a dancer, not something I needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. And I think I changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is supposed to look like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were standing in the way of her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E

500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E
