[...] Charles Holden described Pick's management of meetings: [...] "Here his decisions were those of a benevolent dictator, and the members left the meeting with a clear sense of a task to be performed, difficult, perhaps, and sometimes impossible, as might subsequently prove to be, but usually well worth exploring if only in producing convincing proof of obstacles. Out of these exploratory methods there often emerged new and most interesting solutions, which Pick was quick to appreciate, and to adopt in substitution for his own proposals." ...|$|R
5000|$|After a {{long and}} intense period of study (he took up lessons on the trombone, harmony, and {{counterpoint}} at the Academy of Music in Nice), at 14, in a search to expand his ideas on the accordion, he began listening to jazz and heard records by the trumpet player Clifford Brown. [...] "I copied all the choruses of Clifford Brown, impressed by his tone and <b>his</b> <b>drive,</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of phrasing over the thunderous playing of Max Roach". Fascinated by this new world, Richard was amazed that the accordion had never been part of this musical adventure.In this period, Galliano won twice the first prize in the [...] "world accordion cap competition" [...] {{which took place in}} Spain (1966) and France (1967). In the Spanish competition, the participants' duty work was [...] "Chaconne" [...] by the Israeli accordionist Yehuda Oppenheimer. Galliano and Oppenheimer kept up their musical collaboration and personal friendship until Oppenheimer's death in 2012.|$|R

60|$|He crept {{out of the}} {{shrubbery}} {{and staggered}} down the <b>drive,</b> making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> homeward across the hills as swiftly as his uncertain footsteps would take him. It was dusk now, and he met no one. Yet his heart beat at every sound--the clanking of a chain, attached to the fetlock of a wandering horse, the still, mournful cry of an owl which floated out from the plantation, the clatter of the small stones which his own feet dislodged as he feverishly climbed the rocks. Above him, {{on the other side}} of the road, towered the hill where he had sat and dreamed as a boy, where Rochester had come and encouraged him to prate of his ambitions.|$|R
25|$|In {{a charity}} match at Lord's, Brian Lara came to regret the {{decision}} to bowl first, although the match was hardly to be taken seriously. Andy Flower, the old Zimbabwe stalwart, made a quickfire 55 {{near the end of}} the innings, Stephen Fleming smashed some lovely cover <b>drives</b> on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to a 46-ball fifty before edging Makhaya Ntini to third man for 62, and Jacques Kallis also made 62 as he paired up well with VVS Laxman. The deep batting order, aided by Lara's willingness to utilise his bowlers – the pick of the International XI, Chaminda Vaas, who utilised the English conditions as he took two for 19, only got to bowl seven overs, while Lara himself bowled two and the International XI used all their available bowlers – and the MCC made 327 for 7.|$|R

Francis tries to help her but he fails. Eventually, Francis forces Vijay to not give her false hopes and gift her a sum of money and let her go back to India. Merin refuses the amount of money gifted and asks him to show her around London before she leaves. Then Merin goes back to India. The next day, her aunt Gracy (Lena) calls Vijay to tell that Merin has not reached her home yet. Gracy's husband Thai Kutty (Sunil), tells them that he will go to India to enquire about Merin but Vijay says that he will go instead because {{he is the one who}} is supposed to go. Francis tries to force him to stay, but Vijay says that he really likes Merin and he will go to India, no matter what. Pavitra helps him to go to India by convincing her dad to not stop him and personally dropping him at the airport. Vijay reaches India. While in a taxi, Francis calls Vijay and directs him to go to Merin's home. Vijay reaches Merin's home to find her house being seized to debt. He finds out that Merin has reached home safely. The movie ends by Vijay revealing to Pavitra that Merin had reached home safely, but lied to make Vijay realize his love for her.|$|R
