[...] The dam was built to increase the storage capacity of the lake, {{which would have been}} limited due to the lower ridge in this area.

500|$|The cleared, {{underlying}} rock {{foundation of}} the dam site was reinforced with grout, called a <b>grout</b> <b>curtain.</b> Holes were driven into the walls and base of the canyon, as deep as [...] into the rock, and any cavities encountered were {{to be filled with}} grout. This was done to stabilize the rock, to prevent water from seeping past the dam through the canyon rock, and to limit [...] "uplift"—upward pressure from water seeping under the dam. The workers were under severe time constraints due {{to the beginning of the}} concrete pour, and when they encountered hot springs or cavities too large to readily fill, they moved on without resolving the problem. A total of 58 of the 393 holes were incompletely filled. After the dam was completed and the lake began to fill, large numbers of significant leaks into the dam caused the Bureau of Reclamation to look into the situation. It found that the work had been incompletely done, and was based on less than a full understanding of the canyon's geology. New holes were drilled from inspection galleries inside the dam into the surrounding bedrock. It took nine years (1938–47) under relative secrecy to complete the supplemental <b>grout</b> <b>curtain.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the article}} the authors {{considered}} {{the technique of}} evaluating {{the performance of a}} <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain</b> basing on the analysis of mathematical forecasting and regular measurements of water temperature in the reservoir and in the rock mass behind the dam. The initial data for the solution of heat transfer problem are the rate of filtration, obtained from the solution of the stationary problem of filtration, and the experimental factor, generalizing thermophysical properties of rocks. For calculating the period of time from to the change of the water temperature in the reservoir till the change of water temperature at the reference point of the rock mass a computer program was designed, which allows defining the path and time of filtration from the reservoir to the reference point in the rock mass {{with the help of the}} reverse conversion on flow lines. The calculation was carried out from the point in question in the rock mass till the crossing paths of filtration with the bottom boundary of the reservoir. As an example, we present the results of computational studies of filtration and temperature regimes in the rock foundation of a concrete dam at the design work of the <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain</b> and in case of the presence of pervious area. The calculations were performed with a time step dt = 2 days. At each time step, with account of water motion along the lines of the current through the rock mass, the previous position of the reference points in space has been determined, for which the value of the velocity vector of filtration field was corrected. In the first case, the motion of water from the reservoir was carried out in the circumvention of the <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain.</b> In the second case, the motion of water took place from the reservoir through the permeable portion of the <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain.</b> The change of the water temperature during its seepage from the water reservoir through permeable area of <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain</b> because of conductive heat transmission in all the checkpoints in permeable area of <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain</b> is 0. 5 - 1. 0 °C at measurement accuracy of water temperature 0. 1 °C. Thereby, by measuring the changes of water temperature in the reservoir and in the rock mass behind the <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain</b> as a result of alternative calculations using the developed method we can calculate the position and size of a possible permeable area...|$|R

500|$|Before {{and during}} construction, workers and {{engineers}} experienced problems. Contracts {{for companies to}} construct the {{various parts of the}} dam were difficult to award as few companies were sizable enough to fill them. This forced companies to consolidate. In addition, Native American graves had to be relocated and temporary fish ladders had to be constructed. During construction additional problems included landslides and the need to protect newly poured concrete from freezing. Construction on the downstream Grand Coulee Bridge began in [...] and more considerable earth-moving began in August. Excavation for the dam's foundation required the removal of [...] of dirt and stone. To reduce the amount of trucking required in the excavation, a conveyor belt nearly [...] long was built. To further secure the foundation, workers drilled [...] holes into the granite and filled any fissures with grout, creating a <b>grout</b> <b>curtain.</b> At times, excavated areas collapsed from overburden. In order to secure these areas from further movement and continue excavation, 3-inch (76mm) diameter pipes were inserted into the mass and chilled with cold liquid from a refrigeration plant. This froze the earth and secured it so construction could continue.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to assess the {{availability}} of technologies to seal underground openings. The technologies are needed to seal the potential high-level radioactive waste repository at Yucca Mountain. Technologies are evaluated for three basic categories of seal components: backfill (general fill and graded fill), bulkheads, and <b>grout</b> <b>curtains.</b> Not only is placement of seal components assessed, but also preconditioning of the placement area and seal component durability. The approach taken was: First, review selected sealing case histories (literature searches and site visits) from the mining, civil, and defense industries; second, determine whether reasonably available technologies to seal the potential repository exist; and finally, identify deficiencies in existing technologies. It is concluded that reasonably available technologies do exist to place backfill, bulkheads, and <b>grout</b> <b>curtains.</b> Technologies also exist to precondition areas where seal components are to be placed. However, if final performance requirements are stringent for these engineered structures, some existing technologies {{may need to be}} developed. Deficiencies currently do exist in technologies that demonstrate the long-term durability and performance of seal components. Case histories do not currently exist that demonstrate the placement of seal components in greatly elevated thermal and high-radiation environments and in areas where ground support (rock bolts and concrete liners) has been removed.

In addition to the single layer <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain</b> a double layer drainage system was implemented to avoid an increase of the water pressure inside the hanging wall resp. cave roof above the machinery platform.

Recent experiences when attempting to build concrete cut-offs through hard and highly permeable rock masses have led the authors to develop the concept of “composite cut-offs “ for seepage control. A campaign of high quality drilling, permeability testing and grouting is first conducted to pretreat the very permeable and/or clay-filled zones, to seal the clean fissures, and to provide an extremely detailed geological basis upon which to design the location and extent of the subsequent concrete wall (if in fact needed).

Values of Rd range from 0. 94 to 3 kg/(m 2 • day) for v values from 0. 05 to 0. 20 m/s. Such high rates can account both for the rapid evolution of the existing cavities and for the creation of new caves within the gypsum mass subsequent to the impounding of the reservoir, and for the ineffectiveness of the <b>grout</b> <b>curtains</b> and of the waterproof facing of the outcropping front of the gypsum layer intended to prevent reservoir water from entering the gypum mass...|$|R
