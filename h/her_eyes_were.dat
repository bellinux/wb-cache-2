They analysed her for over a year and reported that Jeanne Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to have a routine operation to restore her vision; she had a moderately weak heart and a chronic cough ("caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco") and bouts of rheumatism. On the other hand, she always had good digestion, slept well and had no problems with incontinence.

500|$|On 30 April, the Soviets {{were less}} than [...] from the bunker. That afternoon, Hitler and Eva Braun {{committed}} suicide fewer than 40 hours after they were married. Misch witnessed {{the discovery of the}} bodies of Hitler and Braun. He followed Otto Günsche and Hitler's chief valet Heinz Linge to the door of Hitler's private room. After the door was opened, Misch only took a quick [...] "glance". He saw Eva, with her legs drawn up, to Hitler's left on the sofa. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> open and she was dead. Hitler was also dead. He was either sitting on the sofa or in the armchair by it; his head [...] "had fallen forward slightly". Misch started to leave to report the events to Schädle, but then stopped and returned to the door of Hitler's study. By then Misch observed that Hitler's corpse had been removed from inside the study and wrapped in a blanket. Several men then picked it up and carried it past him. Misch left and reported the events to Schädle, who instructed him to return to his duty station. After returning to the telephone exchange, Misch later recalled Unterscharführer Retzbach proclaiming [...] "So they're burning the boss now!" [...] Retzbach asked Misch if he was going upstairs to watch the events, but Misch declined to go. Thereafter, Günsche came down and told Misch that the corpses of Hitler and Braun had been burned in the garden of the Reich Chancellery.|$|E

2500|$|The victim {{appeared}} to be between 14 and 16 years old, but may have been as young as 11 or as old as 20. Her wavy hair was auburn and shoulder-length. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> noted as a unique shade of blue. She had noticeably short fingernails, {{which is consistent with}} nail biting.

She had strong feelings for an old man named Joel Garland, but denied that they were in love as love would meant his inevitable death. Unfortunately, her presence was already killing him unintentionally at a slow rate. After learning this, Chise created a remedy that allowed them to see each other one last time (chapter twenty two). After Joel's passing, she tells Chise she will be living in Joel’s garden and will not look for more lovers anymore.

2500|$|Aspects of Lois' {{personality}} {{have varied}} over the years, {{depending on the}} comic book writers handling of the character and American social attitudes toward women at the time.

2500|$|Catherine also {{received}} Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun (formerly court painter to Marie Antoinette) at her Tsarskoye Selo residence in St Petersburg, by {{whom she was}} painted shortly before her death. Madame Vigée Le Brun vividly describes the empress in her memoirs: [...] "the sight of this famous woman so impressed me that I {{found it impossible to}} think of anything: I could only stare at her. Firstly I was very surprised at her small stature; I had imagined her to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, but her face was still beautiful, and she wore her white hair up, framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: [...] "I am delighted to welcome you here, Madame, your reputation runs before you.

2500|$|Among {{her last}} radio {{appearances}} {{was in an}} episode of the BBC's Desert Island Discs with Roy Plomley. Bankhead, at 62 and audibly suffering from breathing difficulties from emphysema in the interview show, frankly spoke of how hopeless she would be on a desert island, admitting that she [...] "couldn’t put a key in the door, dahling. I can't do a thing for myself." [...] In the interview, host Plomley spoke of Bankhead's glory days as the most celebrated actress of 1920s London. Later he recalled of their interview, [...] "She was a very frail and ailing old lady, and I {{was shocked to see}} how old and ill she looked as I helped her out of a taxi. She had come from her hotel wearing a mink coat slung over a pair of lounging pyjamas, and she leaned heavily on my arm as I supported her to the lift. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> still fine, and there was still beauty in the bone structure of her face beneath the wrinkles and ravages of hard living. Her hands shook, and when she wished to go to the loo she had to ask Monica Chapman to accompany her to help her with her clothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Minnie was {{designed}} in the fashion of a [...] "flapper" [...] girl. Her main outfit consisted of a short flapper girl dress that often revealed her distinctive patched knickers. [...] In the 1929 cartoon The Karnival Kid, it was also revealed that she wears black stockings which were also fashionable among flapper girls. Her shoes are probably her most distinctive article of clothing. For comedic effect, she wears oversized high heeled pumps that are too big for her feet. Her heels often slip out of her shoes, and she even loses her shoes completely in The Gallopin' Gaucho. When she walked or danced, the clip clop of her large pumps was usually heard clearly and often went with {{the rhythm of the}} music that was played in the background. Along with Mickey, she was redesigned in 1940. Her hat was replaced with a large bow, and bows were added to her shoes as well. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> also given more detail. Throughout the forties and fifties, her look and personality became more conservative. [...] Minnie almost always wears red or pink, but in her early appearances, she could be seen wearing a combination of blue, black or green (when not depicted in black and white).|$|E

2500|$|The {{body of a}} {{woman who}} had died by {{suffocation}} was found in a white Admiral refrigerator in Gray, Knox County, Kentucky on April 1, 1985, alongside Route 25. The refrigerator had a decal of the words [...] "Super Woman" [...] on the front. The victim had been dead for a few days, and was nude except for two distinctive necklace pendants, one of a heart and the other of a gold-colored eagle, and two pairs of socks; one white, and the other white with green and yellow stripes. There were reports that the victim may have been soliciting a ride to North Carolina over CB radio. Five hundred people attended her funeral, which was also televised. The case was a local sensation in Gray, as the town was a [...] "quiet" [...] and [...] "sleepy" [...] place where little out of the ordinary usually happened. Distinguishing features of the body included a number of moles (on the right side of her neck, near one ankle, and below each breast), a yellow-stained upper incisor, and a scar and other marks on her abdomen, indicating that she had borne a child. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> [...] light brown and her hair was red and nearly a foot long, which fit the pattern of the redhead killer. After her autopsy, she was determined to be between 24 and 35 years old and [...] approximately 4 feet 9 to 4 feet 11 inches tall. [...] It is also possible that she owned a pair of boots found near the refrigerator. Several missing persons have been eliminated as possible matches for the victim. After the case was publicized in January 2013, the police received some tips, but it is unknown if they became solid leads.|$|E
2500|$|Felix, being bisexual, was {{not certain}} {{if he was}} [...] "fit for marriage." [...] Still, {{he was drawn to}} Irina and her icon-like beauty when he first {{encountered}} her. [...] "One day when I was out riding I met a very beautiful girl accompanied by an elderly lady. Our eyes met and she made such an impression on me that I reined in my horse to gaze at her as she walked on," [...] he wrote in his memoirs. One day in 1910, he was paid a visit by Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna and was happy to discover the girl he had seen on the riding trail was their only daughter, Irina. [...] "This time I {{had plenty of time to}} admire the wondrous beauty of the girl who was eventually to become my wife and lifelong companion. She had beautiful features, clear-cut as a cameo, and looked very like her father." [...] He renewed his acquaintance with Irina in 1913 and was even more drawn to her. [...] "She was very shy and reserved, which added a certain mystery to her charm.... Little by little, Irina became less timid. At first <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> more eloquent than her conversation but, as she became more expansive, I learned to admire the keenness of her intelligence and her sound judgment. I concealed nothing in my past life from her, and, far from being perturbed by what I told her, she showed great tolerance and comprehension." [...] Yusupov wrote that Irina, perhaps because she had grown up with so many brothers, showed none of the artifice or lack of honesty that had put him off relations with other women.|$|E
2500|$|The {{body of a}} {{white female}} was found naked {{alongside}} Route 250 near Littleton, Wetzel County, West Virginia on February 13, 1983. A pair of senior citizens reported that they thought the remains were a mannequin before discovering it was a human corpse.

She had not been an apparent victim of sexual assault, although foul play may have been involved in her death. This woman's cause of death was not officially determined, but she is a possible victim, as she may have been suffocated or strangled.

Her height was estimated to be approximately [...] and weight as [...] <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> presumed to be brown, although decomposition made it difficult to accurately determine eye color. She had two distinct scars, including one found on her abdomen from a Caesarean section, indicating she had at least one child and another found on one of the index fingers. The woman's legs and underarms were shaven, indicating an attention to grooming not characteristic of a transient or hitchhiker. A person of interest has emerged in this case, believed to be a middle-aged white male at the height of approximately [...] and weighing [...] The man was seen near the area where the body was found and could have been involved with disposing of her body.
