Wiśniowiecki was one of the chief participants in this debate, successfully defending the old titles, including that of his own family, and succeeding in abolishing the new titles, which gained him the enmity of another powerful magnate, Jerzy Ossoliński.

40|$|T cell {{signaling}} {{is required for}} activation of both natural and therapeutic T cells including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Identification of novel factors and pathways regulating T {{cell signaling}} may aid in development of effective T cell therapies. <b>In</b> <b>resting</b> human T cells, the majority of Src-family of tyrosine kinases (SFKs) are inactive due to phosphorylation of a conserved carboxy-terminal tyrosine residue. Recently, a pool of enzymatically active SFKs has been identified <b>in</b> <b>resting</b> T cells; however, {{the significance of these}} is incompletely understood. Here, we characterized the role of active SFKs <b>in</b> <b>resting</b> human T cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of active SFKs enhanced distal TCR signaling as measured by IL- 2 release and CD 25 surface expression following TCR-independent activation. Mechanistically, inhibition of the active pool of SFKs induced nuclear translocation of NFAT 1, and enhanced NFAT 1 -dependent signaling <b>in</b> <b>resting</b> T cells. The negative regulation of NFAT 1 signaling was in part mediated by the Src-kinase Lck as human T cells lacking Lck had increased levels of nuclear NFAT 1 and demonstrated enhanced NFAT 1 -dependent gene expression. Inhibition of active SFKs <b>in</b> <b>resting</b> primary human T cells also increased nuclear NFAT 1 and enhanced NFAT 1 -dependent signaling. Finally, the calcineurin inhibitor FK 506 and Cyclosporin A reversed the effect of SFKs inhibition on NFAT 1.

40|$|HIV- 1 latency <b>in</b> <b>resting</b> CD 4 + T cells {{represents}} a major barrier to virus eradication in patients on {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART). We describe here a novel post-transcriptional block in HIV- 1 gene expression <b>in</b> <b>resting</b> CD 4 + T cells from patients on HAART. This block involves the aberrant localization of multiply spliced (MS) HIV- 1 RNAs encoding the critical positive regulators Tat and Rev. Although these RNAs had no previously described export defect, {{we show that}} they exhibit strict nuclear localization <b>in</b> <b>resting</b> CD 4 + T cells from patients on HAART. Overexpression of the transcriptional activator Tat from non-HIV vectors allowed virus production in these cells. Thus, the nuclear retention of MS HIV- 1 RNA interrupts a positive feedback loop and contributes to the non-productive nature of infection of resting CD 4 + T cells. To define the mechanism of nuclear retention, proteomic analysis was used to identify proteins that bind MS HIV- 1 RNA. Polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) was identified as an HIV- 1 RNA-binding protein differentially expressed <b>in</b> <b>resting</b> and activated CD 4 + T cells. Overexpression of PTB <b>in</b> <b>resting</b> CD 4 + T cells from patients on HAART allowed cytoplasmic accumulation of HIV- 1 RNAs.

Virus culture experiments showed that overexpression of PTB <b>in</b> <b>resting</b> CD 4 + T cells from patients on HAART allowed release of replication-competent virus, while preserving a resting cellular phenotype.
