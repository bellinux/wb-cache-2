25|$|HD DVD-RAM was the {{proposed}} successor to DVD-RAM for random access on optical media using phase-change principals. It would hold 20 <b>gigabytes</b> per layer instead of 15 <b>gigabytes</b> for HD DVD-R, due {{to differences in}} recording methods used, yielding a higher density disc.|$|E

50|$|A study {{performed}} by Home Media Magazine (August 5, 2007) concluded that HD DVDs and Blu-ray discs are essentially equal in production cost. Quotes from several disc manufacturers for 25,000 units of HD DVDs and Blu-rays revealed a price differential of only 5-10 cents. (Lowest price: 90 cents versus 100 cents. Highest price: $1.45 versus $1.50.) Another study {{performed by}} Wesley Tech (February 9, 2007) {{arrived at a}} similar conclusion. Quotes for 10,000 discs show that a 15 <b>gigabyte</b> HD DVD costs $11,500 total, and 25 <b>gigabyte</b> Blu-ray or a 30 <b>gigabyte</b> HD DVD costs $13,000 total. For larger quantities of 100,000 units, the 30 <b>gigabyte</b> HD DVD was {{more expensive than the}} 25 <b>gigabyte</b> Blu-ray ($1.55 versus $1.49).|$|R
50|$|An {{innovative}} {{method to}} charge the iPad and iPhone on the computer was introduced by <b>Gigabyte</b> in April 2010. <b>Gigabyte</b> launched the world’s first Z68 motherboard on 31 May 2011, with an on-board mSATA connection for Intel SSD and Smart Response Technology.

50|$|Bandwidth {{consumption}} {{over the}} last several years has shifted from a per megabit usage model to a per <b>gigabyte</b> usage model. Bandwidth was traditionally measured in line speed access that included the ability to purchase needed megabits at a given monthly cost. As the shared hosting model developed, the trend towards <b>gigabyte</b> or total bytes transferred, replaced the megabit line speed model so dedicated server providers started offering per <b>gigabyte.</b>|$|R
