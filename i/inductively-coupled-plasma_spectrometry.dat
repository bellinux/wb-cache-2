The Rietfontein {{kimberlite}} is an off-craton kimberlite pipe, located {{west of the}} Kaapvaal Craton at 26. 75 °, 20. 04 °E and hosts a {{range of}} xenocryst lithologies, including peridotite, eclogite and a suite of megacryst minerals. This study focuses on a suite of eclogite xenoliths, which were subject to a detailed petrographical and geochemical study, aimed at their characterisation and comparison to eclogites from on-craton and other off-craton localities. Garnet, clinopyroxene, accessory and secondary minerals were analysed for major element compositions using electron microprobe techniques and garnet and clinopyroxene trace element compositions were determined by Laser Ablation <b>Inductively-Coupled-Plasma</b> Mass <b>Spectrometry</b> (LA-ICP-MS) techniques. Oxygen isotopic compositions of five garnet samples were obtained using laser flourination techniques, followed by analysis by gas source mass spectrometry...|$|R

The codoping enhances the {{refractive index contrast}} between the active layer and the undoped KY(WO 4) 2 substrate to ~ 7. 5 × 10 - 3. A K 2 W 2 O 7 solvent was employed {{for the growth of}} layers onto undoped (010) -oriented KYW substrates. Single crystalline layers of thickness 5 - 10 µm were grown at low level of supersaturation and growth temperatures of 920 - 923 °C. The layer quality was studied by X-ray diffraction. The composition of the grown layers was determined by laser-ablation <b>inductively-coupled-plasma</b> mass <b>spectrometry</b> (LA-ICP-MS). Planar waveguide lasers with low laser threshold of 18 mW, record-high slope efficiency of 82. 3 %, and maximum output power of 195 mW have been achieved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{review the}} {{emerging}} potential of femtosecond laser-ablation <b>inductively-coupled-plasma</b> mass <b>spectrometry</b> (fs-LA-ICP-MS) for the direct analysis of solid materials. Although LA-ICP-MS {{has been widely}} explored and is highly accepted for the determination of major and trace elements, {{as well as for}} the measurement of isotope ratios, it still suffers from several limitations that restrain its development as a potential alternative to other, more established techniques. The occurrence of non-stoichiometric effects in the transient signals, defined as elemental fractionation, together with the lack of reference materials for the wide variety of samples of interest often restricts the quantitative analysis to a few elements of identical fractionation behavior. In this sense, significant improvements in the processes responsible for fractionation effects have been recently observed with the use of ultra-short laser pulses. The confinement of pulse energy guarantees better performances in spatial resolution and improves the analytical figures of merit. This review aims to summarize the main differences between the LA mechanisms of short (> 1 ps) and ultra-short (< 1 ps) laser pulses based on fundamental understanding of the LA process and the most relevant parameters governing the quality of analysis. In order to show the state of the art in fs-LA-ICP-MS, we present a variety of examples for elemental and depth-profiling analysis of solid samples in biological, geological, and materials applications. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Lead and Tl isotope intensities and ratios were {{measured}} in radial and axial plasma profiles using multi-collector <b>inductively-coupled-plasma</b> mass <b>spectrometry</b> (MC-ICP-MS). Signal profiles for 204 Pb, 206 Pb, 207 Pb and 208 Pb display mass dependent radial and axial distributions in the plasma. In radial profiles lighter isotopes exhibit greater dispersal from the plasma axis than heavier isotopes, {{in agreement with}} ICP-MS elemental observations. However, signal maxima (I max) for heavier Pb isotopes occur closer to the load coil than I max for lighter Pb isotopes, the reverse of ICP-MS elemental observations. These mass dependent distributions predict that the radial dispersion and axial I max locations for 203 Tl and 205 Tl isotopes should occur interspersed with the values for simultaneously measured Pb isotopes. Instead however, their values are appropriate for masses greater that 208 Pb, indicating that the observed profiles are not {{the product of a}} single stage mass dependent process and that other element properties also effect the distributions. Isotope ratio (and thus mass bias) variation with sampling depth reflects both the mass dependent separation of the numerator and denominator isotope I max along the axis of the plasma and the distance along the axis of the plasma over which the isotope signals are distributed. Addition of matrix to the plasma significantly reduces the variability of these two characteristics suggesting that more accurate correction of instrumental mass bias and more accurate normalization of sample ratios to standard values could be achieved by addition of a common matrix to samples and standards. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} the tectonic {{evolution}} in central Dronning Maud Land (cDML), East Antarctica can be inferred from various zircon grains for U-Pb zircon age determination with the Laser-Ablation <b>Inductively-Coupled-Plasma</b> Mass <b>Spectrometry</b> (LA-ICP-MS) technique. The zircons grain of the different rocks collected from different geographic location in cDML include the Shcherbakova area, the Holtedahlfjella and Zwiesel area. New zircon U-Pb ages {{have been used to}} establish relationships between ancient rocks, to obtain new insights into the Early Paleozoic orogenic collapse and contemporaneous voluminous late-tectonic intrusions in central Dronning Maud Land. Most of these results agree reasonably well with the supercontinent assemblage chronology of Gondwana within the cDML. The oldest ages of 1100 Ma to 910 Ma correspond to the final construction of the Rodinia. The ages of 900 Ma to 620 Ma are likely to represent a number of rifting events that are associated with the destruction of Rodinia. The U-Pb zircon ages of 610 Ma to 535 Ma corresponds with the re-assemblage of parts of E and W- Gondwana during the East-African orogeny. The youngest ages of 530 Ma to 458 Ma correspond to the Pan-African orogeny and thus the final amalgamation of Gondwana. Grenville-age rocks of ~ 1100 Ma represent the oldest basement yet found in cDML that was during large-scale delamination intruded by the late-tectonic granitoids. A detrital zircon age of 950 - 680 Ma found in one sample of the cDML is reported from this area outside of the Schirmacher Oasis {{for the first time in}} this study...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a one-year, Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Glow-discharge mass {{spectrometry}} (GD-MS), laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), dc-arc atomic-emission spectroscopy (DC-ARC-AES), laser-ablation <b>inductively-coupled-plasma</b> mass <b>spectrometry</b> (LA-ICP-MS), and energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) were identified as potential solid-sample analytical techniques for mobile characterization of TRU waste. Each technology developers was provided with surrogate TRU waste samples {{in order to develop}} an analytical method. Following successful development of the analytical method, five performance evaluation samples were distributed to each of the researchers in a blind round-robin format. Results of the round robin were compared to known values and Transuranic Waste Characterization Program (TWCP) data quality objectives. Only two techniques, DC-ARC-AES and EDXRF, were able to complete the entire project. Methods development for GD-MS and LA-ICP-MS was halted due to the stand-down at the CMR facility. Results of the round-robin analysis are given for the EDXRF and DCARC-AES techniques. While DC-ARC-AES met several of the data quality objectives, the performance of the EDXRF technique by far surpassed the DC-ARC-AES technique. EDXRF is a simple, rugged, field portable instrument that appears to hold great promise for mobile characterization of TRU waste. The performance of this technique needs to be tested on real TRU samples in order to assess interferences from actinide constituents. In addition, mercury and beryllium analysis will require another analytical technique because the EDXRF method failed to meet the TWCP data quality objectives. Mercury analysis is easily accomplished on solid samples by cold vapor atomic fluorescence (CVAFS). Beryllium can be analyzed by any of a variety of emission techniques...|$|R
40|$|Considering {{the extreme}} {{variability}} of the goldsmith’s product in commerce, {{in many countries}} it is the law that establishes, rigorously, what finenesses are permitted for marketing, the criteria to be adopted to discover the fineness itself and any criteria for its checking. The official methods of analysis for ascertaining the fineness of the raw materials and of works in precious metals are indicated by the laws. The method of cupellation, {{one of the oldest}} for recognizing the amount of gold in alloys, was standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (standard ISO 11426 / 1993). It currently represents the reference method of analysis for determining the fineness in gold of all types of materials. However, other official analysis methods may also be considered: all those envisaged by the standards issued by national or international standardization commissions that present a degree of uncertainty equal to or less than those dictated by the law itself, such as <b>Inductively-Coupled-Plasma</b> Atomic Emission <b>Spectrometry</b> (ICP-AES), Laser-Induced Plasma Spectroscopy (LIPS), Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), and X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry...|$|R
40|$|Genomic and {{physiological}} responses in Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) {{in the northern}} Gulf of Mexico have confirmed oil exposure of resident marsh fish following the Macondo blowout in 2010. Using these same fish, we evaluated otolith microchemistry as a method for assessing oil exposure history. Laser-ablation <b>inductively-coupled-plasma</b> mass <b>spectrometry</b> was {{used to analyze the}} chemical composition of sagittal otoliths to assess whether a trace metal signature could be detected in the otoliths of F. grandis collected from a Macondo-oil impacted site in 2010, post-spill relative to pre-spill, as well as versus fish from areas not impacted by the spill. We found no evidence of increased concentrations of two elements associated with oil contamination (nickel and vanadium) in F. grandis otoliths regardless of Macondo oil exposure history. One potential explanation for this is that Macondo oil is relatively depleted of those metals compared to other crude oils globally. During and after the spill, however, elevated levels of barium, lead, and to a lesser degree, copper were detected in killifish otoliths at the oil-impacted collection site in coastal Louisiana. This may reflect oil contact or other environmental perturbations that occurred concomitant with oiling. For example, increases in barium in otoliths from oil-exposed fish followed (temporally) freshwater diversions in Louisiana in 2010. This implicates (but does not conclusively demonstrate) freshwater diversions from the Mississippi River (with previously recorded higher concentrations of lead and copper), designed to halt the ingress of oil, as a mechanism for elevated elemental uptake in otoliths of Louisiana marsh fishes. These results highlight the potentially complex and indirect effects of the Macondo oil spill and human responses to it on Gulf of Mexico ecosystems, and emphasize the need to consider the multiple stressors acting simultaneously on inshore fish communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} detect and isotopically {{characterize}} uranium and plutonium in environmental samples is of primary importance {{in the search for}} nuclear proliferation. The utility of isotope ratio measurements for environmental monitoring is limited by sample preparation costs, measurement precision, and sensitivity. This is particularly true for wide-area monitoring where the number of samples required varies inversely with obtainable precision and sensitivity. This report summarizes an initial evaluation of the applicability of a new technique, magnetic-sector, multicollector, <b>inductively-coupled-plasma</b> mass <b>spectrometry,</b> to environmental sample analysis. This technique is embodied at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory {{in the form of a}} commercially available instrument, the IsoProbe, manufactured by micromass, LTD. (United Kingdom). This is the second of the current generation of such instruments installed in the United States and the first within the Department of Energy complex. Inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) using quadrupole mass filters has existed for roughly 15 years. Magnet sector instruments have also existed for about half that time and multicollector instruments have existed for nearly as long. Among the things that make the new generation of instruments, and the IsoProbe in particular, unique are (1) the use of a gas-collision cell to reduce the energy spread of the ions and to remove ions associated with the plasma gas and (2) the introduction of multiple electron-multiplier detection systems. The net effect of these features is to increase sensitivity and precision. Historically uranium and plutonium isotopic compositions have been determined by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). While requiring extensive sample preparation, no other technique matched its precision and sensitivity for such measurements. The purposes of this project are to evaluate whether the IsoProbe can replace TIMS for environmental monitoring analyses, whether it can extend the state-of-the-art to higher precision, and whether costs savings can be achieved at the same time...|$|R
40|$|Silicon isotopic {{data from}} a range of lunar samples are {{presented}} to assess the degree of heterogeneity of the lunar mantle and its similarity to bulk silicate Earth (BSE). Multi-collector <b>inductively-coupled-plasma</b> mass <b>spectrometry</b> (MC-ICPMS) was used to analyse 24 samples, including both high and low-Ti basalts, as well as Highland anorthosites and picritic glasses, covering all the Apollo sample return missions. No systematic δ 30 Si differences are found between any of the bulk sample lithologies (± 2 σ SD) (δ 30 Si Low-Ti basalt=- 0. 29 ± 0. 06, δ 30 Si High-Ti basalt=- 0. 32 ± 0. 09, δ 30 Si lunar glass=- 0. 29 ± 0. 05 and δ 30 Si Highland rocks=- 0. 27 ± 0. 10). The average of the lunar samples is δ 30 Si=- 0. 29 ± 0. 08 (2 σ SD), which is identical to the composition of BSE, δ 30 Si=- 0. 29 ± 0. 08 (2 σ SD), from Savage et al. (2010). The BSE Si isotope composition is thought {{to be the result of}} Si partitioning between metal and silicate, and consequent isotopic fractionation during core formation. The Moon-forming impactor would not be expected to share that composition, because it is thought to have been relatively small (~ 0. 1 Earth masses) like Mars and formed under relatively low temperatures and pressures that are insufficient for Si to partition into the core. Therefore, the identical lunar and BSE Si isotope data show that Si isotopes, like those of oxygen, must have homogenised in the aftermath of the Moon-forming impact, if smooth particle hydrodynamic simulations of the Giant Impact are correct in showing that most lunar material should have originated from the impactor rather than the Earth. The data presented here are in agreement with other isotope systems and experimental studies that indicate that the majority of core formation happened early and before the Giant Impact. It has been predicted (Pahlevan et al., 2011) that the Moon and the BSE should show a ~ 0. 14 ‰ offset in δ 30 Si for the Moon to have an Fe/(Fe+Mg) ratio twice that of BSE. The current resolution and sample population size of the Si data for the Moon and Earth would allow such an offset to be detected. The fact that is it not observed can put constraints on the element ratios and lunar budgets as modelled by Pahlevan et al. (2011); in particular, it constrains the Fe/(Fe+Mg) ratio of the Moon to be only 1 - 1. 3 BSE. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Processing {{of lunar}} {{regolith}} into a plant growth medium {{is crucial in}} the development of a regenerative life support system for a lunar base. Plants, which are the core of such a system, produce food and oxygen for humans and, at the same time, consume carbon dioxide. Because of the scarcity of lunar regolith, simulants must be used to infer its properties and to develop procedures for weathering and chemical analyses. The Minnesota Lunar Simulant (MLS) has been identified to date as the best available simulant for lunar regolith. Results of the dissolution studies reveal that appropriately fertilized MLS can be a suitable medium for plant growth. The techniques used in conducting these studies can be extended to investigate the suitability of actual lunar regolith as a plant growth medium. Dissolution experiments were conducted using the MLS to determine its nutritional and toxicity characteristics for plant growth and to develop weathering and chemical analysis techniques. Two weathering regimes, one with water and one with dilute organic acids simulating the root rhizosphere microenvironment, were investigated. Elemental concentrations were measured using <b>inductively-coupled-plasma</b> (ICP) emission <b>spectrometry</b> and ion chromatography (IC). The geochemical speciation model, MINTEQA 2, was used to determine the major solution species and the minerals controlling them. Acidification was found to be a useful method for increasing cation concentrations to meaningful levels. Initial results indicate that MLS weathers to give neutral to slightly basic solutions which contain acceptable amounts of the essential elements required for plant nutrition (i. e., potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, zinc, sodium, silicon, manganese, copper, chlorine, boron, molybdenum, and cobalt). Elements that need to be supplemented include carbon, nitrogen, and perhaps phosphorus and iron. Trace metals in solution were present at nontoxic levels...|$|R
