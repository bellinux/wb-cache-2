25|$|In {{major cities}} he held Food Waste Fiascos {{in which the}} edible food he found in dumpsters, was {{displayed}} in one spot to show {{how much of it}} there is. Greenfield said, “The stats are enormous—$165 billion worth of food thrown out each year, or about half of all the food we produce—but it’s <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> wrap their head around numbers. Seeing a beautiful display of a couple thousand dollars’ worth of perfectly good food pulled from dumpsters near them does the trick, though".|$|E

Though it is often <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> understand why she acts wayward, she also has the vulnerability factor. Halfpenny said she likes Amy's mischievous side and hoped she would not learn to be sensible. Halfpenny also {{felt it was important}} that Amy remained youthful because she disliked portrayals of teenagers growing up too quickly. She found it easy to portray a character younger than herself as she could base aspects of Amy's story on her own teenage experience. At times she is scared she puts on a [...] "hard exterior". Amy has a distinct style, Halfpenny described it as being quite [...] "out there" [...] in her choice of clothing and make-up. Halfpenny said that viewers would not be getting used to Amy's [...] "nice side" [...] and reminded them that she is good at [...] "lying and scheming". She concluded that Amy's bad side was due to resurface.|$|E

He explained the title saying, [...] "My Own Lane is my struggle, because I came from a producer background and I listen to all kinds of different music and don’t really limit myself to what I do. It’s <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> categorize me in a specific lane, and be like, He’s this kind of artist. There’s so many different areas I’m pulling from, I have to just create my own lane, in a sense." ...|$|E

You have to look out for the future, and you can best do so by resolving that Paul Montague shall be forgotten at once.' ...|$|E

Some of the sculptures are of funny characters such as Anpanman, but other sculptures can depict fantastic mythical figures.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} water {{pollution}} further worsens this problem for Pakistan. The sources for water pollution include the overuse of chemical fertilizers, the dumping of industrial wastes into lakes and rivers, untreated sewage being {{dumped into the}} ocean, and contaminated pipelines being used to transport water. The contamination of fresh drinking water makes it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> find clean water supplies and increases the prevalence of waterborne diseases. Consequently, most of the reported health problems in Pakistan are either a direct or indirect result of polluted water. 45% of infant deaths are due to diarrhea and 60% to overall waterborne diseases.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the grain}} has become {{increasingly}} popular in countries where it is not typically grown, namely the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, China and Japan, the crop value has increased. Between 2006 and 2013, quinoa crop prices tripled. In 2011, the average price was US$3,115 per ton with some varieties selling as high as $8,000 per ton. This compares with wheat prices of $9 per bushel (about US$340 per ton), making wheat about 1/10 the value. Since the 1970s, producers’ associations and cooperatives have worked toward greater producer control of the market. The higher prices make it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> purchase, but also provide a livable income for farmers and enable many urban refugees to return to working the land.|$|R

50|$|Before {{the rise}} of discothèques and DJ-based dancefloors with {{recorded}} music (prior to the 1950s); live bands were the ubiquitous means of serving the dancefloor. Along with that, slow-dancing was the primary method of dancing at the time. However; {{the rise of}} Rock and Roll music initially made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> dance when it was popularized in the early 1950s, however people quickly adapted to it and started dancing at higher speeds almost coinciding the rise of DJ-based dancefloors. Live bands have quickly been displaced by DJ-based dancefloors as the DJ stands took up less space than bandstands and that it played recorded music.|$|E
50|$|Nash {{presents}} America's anthropocentric view as {{the main}} enemy to all wilderness preservation. He argues that an ecocentric view is ideal and may work in the long run, but perhaps the preservation of nature and wilderness {{for the sake of}} holding resources out for the preservation of our own species would be more salient. Yet, even this strategy is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> grasp, because it requires us to reach outside the present and look to the future. Still, Nash suggests that maybe the simple preservation of the environment {{for the sake of our}} own generation's recreation and health (oxygen sinks, etc.) could provide the impetus to slow some profiteering.|$|E
50|$|Valence TGV {{has some}} unique station architecture. Built {{primarily}} of reinforced concrete, {{one of the}} main features is the glass on all walls of the station building. The station is built on a slight incline, which makes it slightly <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> handicapped <b>people</b> <b>to</b> move around the building.|$|R
2500|$|Rent {{controlled}} apartments {{contribute to}} shelter and street populations (around [...]04%). Apartments that are rent controlled encourage <b>people</b> <b>to</b> not move out or pass apartments along between families, {{this leads to}} the price of apartments being higher for new renters and, consequently, it is <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> afford their rents. About 10% of housing in the United States is under the control of price control laws. Most laws were enacted to deal with the high inflation rates experienced during the 1970s and 80s. These laws can motivate apartment owners to convert the property to a more profitable enterprise, which can reduce the amount of housing available to potential tenants. A black market can also develop, with tenants leasing rent controlled premises at prices above the legal maximum. This can price out low income individuals and families.|$|R
50|$|Lukacs {{recounted in}} 1967 that:It is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> most <b>people</b> <b>to</b> imagine how {{paradoxical}} this sounded then.
