40|$|Headwaters in <b>extended</b> <b>temperate</b> {{regions of}} the world, {{including}} Central Europe, {{are going to be}} exposed to more frequent and longer lasting periods of drought, which can be attributed to global climate change and enhanced human withdrawal of water. The effects of desiccation on bacterial community composition and on microbial extracellular enzyme activities, a key process in the carbon flow of lotic environments, were investigated in the Breitenbach, a typical temperate stream located in Central Europe. Sandy sediment, a most important habitat of temperate streams, was sampled and exposed at 20 °C in the laboratory to different types of desiccation (fast and slow) over 8 weeks. Bacterial community composition was determined via CARD-FISH (catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in-situ hybridization) and extracellular enzyme activities by means of fluorogenic model substrates. The structure of the bacterial community changed during the desiccation process. It developed from a typical temperate streambed community towards a composition similar to that of terrestrial soils. Proportions of Betaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes decreased, whereas the occurrence of Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria increased. Extracellular enzyme multifunctionality (an important component of ecosystem functionality) was reduced during desiccation, particularly with fast desiccation. Aminopeptidases were most affected with their activity reduced to 10 % of the initial value, whereas activities of β-glucosidases were reduced less markedly. After 8 weeks of desiccation, even the most affected enzymes remained remarkably active. This ensures that upon rewetting the complete ecosystem functions delivered by extracellular enzymes can start recovering without delay...|$|E
40|$|Droughts {{are among}} the most {{important}} disturbance events for stream ecosystems; they not only affect stream hydrology but also the stream biota. Although desiccation of streams is common in Mediterranean regions, phases of dryness in headwaters have been observed more often and for longer periods in <b>extended</b> <b>temperate</b> regions, including Central Europe, reflecting global climate change and enhanced water withdrawal. The effects of desiccation and rewetting on the bacterial community composition and extracellular enzyme activity, a key process in the carbon flow of streams and rivers, were investigated in a typical Central European stream, the Breitenbach (Hesse, Germany). Wet streambed sediment is an important habitat in streams. It was sampled and exposed in the laboratory to different drying scenarios (fast, intermediate, slow) for 13 weeks, followed by rewetting of the sediment from the fast drying scenario via a sediment core perfusion technique for 2 weeks. Bacterial community structure was analyzed using CARD-FISH and TGGE, and extracellular enzyme activity was assessed using fluorogenic model substrates. During desiccation the bacterial community composition shifted toward composition in soil, exhibiting increasing proportions of Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria and decreasing proportions of Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria. Simultaneously the activities of extracellular enzymes decreased, most pronounced with aminopeptidases and less pronounced with enzymes involved in the degradation of polymeric carbohydrates. After rewetting, the general ecosystem functioning, with respect to extracellular enzyme activity, recovered after 10 to 14 days. However, the bacterial community composition had not yet achieved its original composition as in unaffected sediments within this time. Thus, whether the bacterial community eventually recovers completely after these events remains unknown. Perhaps this community undergoes permanent changes, especially after harsh desiccation, followed by loss of the specialized functions of specific groups of bacteria...|$|E

50|$|Diplazium is a genus of ferns that {{specifically}} includes the approximately 400 known species of twinsorus ferns. The Greek root is diplazein meaning double: the indusia in this genus lie {{on both sides}} of the vein. These ferns were earlier considered part of either the Athyriaceae, Dryopteridaceae, Aspleniaceae, or Polypodiaceae families but are often recognized as belonging to their own taxonomic family.

They like some undergrowth and recolonize restored habitat, but are rarely found in dense growth like mature mallee. Though they prefer some tree cover, yellow-throated miners will venture further into open areas like pastures than noisy miners will.|$|R

The lizards belong to two genera, Lygosoma, which has a wide range in all the tropics as well as in Australia; and Naultinus, a genus peculiar to New Zealand, but belonging to a family--Geckonidæ--spread over the whole of the warmer parts of the world. Australia, with New Guinea, on the other hand, has a peculiar family, and no less than twenty-one peculiar genera of lizards, many of which are confined to its temperate regions, but no one of them <b>extends</b> to <b>temperate</b> New Zealand.[126] The extraordinary lizard-like Hatteria punctata of New Zealand forms of itself a distinct order of reptiles, in some respects intermediate between lizards and crocodiles, and having therefore no affinity with any living animal.|$|R
