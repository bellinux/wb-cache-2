40|$|The {{speed of}} the {{single-phase}} induction motor can be controlled by various types of speed control method. In this paper, a system to control the speed of induction motor sing frequency method has been developed and tested. The system was included the PWM control circuit, driver circuit and H- Bridge inverter. The proposed of PWM control circuit is by using LM 741 Operational Amplifier, 74 AC 08 AND logic and SN 7404 <b>Hex</b> <b>Inverter.</b> IRF 740 MOSFETS was used as switching elements to provide the alternating current to the motor. In this drive, the 12 VDC power supply was used for frequency control circuit and driver circuit. While, the 240 VDC power supply was used to feed the H-Bridge inverter. The frequency range of the constructed variable speed drive is 16 Hz to 56 Hz at the constant voltage.

40|$|AFIT/GNE/ENP/ 11 -M 03 This {{research}} {{examines the}} measurement methodology {{and the results}} of the combined effects of electron and radio frequency (500 kHz) irradiation on a CMOS <b>Hex</b> <b>Inverter,</b> CD 4069 UB. There have been many studies in recent years on the effects of electron radiation and electromagnetic interference on integrated circuits however the combined effects have not been measured. A major obstacle for in-situ electron irradiation experiments is the over-current hazard that exists to measurement equipment that comes from taking real-time, in-situ measurements. To overcome this, a test circuit was designed and built to allow for real-time in-situ measurement of the output voltage, current and the inverter power. This test circuit provides real–time measurement of the inverter’s threshold voltage with respect to electron dose. During this research, pre- and post-irradiation measurements were obtained from an inverter coupled with electron irradiation (1 MeV electrons with fluences up to 8 × 1015 [e-/cm- 2] at various fluxes) and a 500 kHz RF signal. The data provided insight into the total dose effect as opposed to...|$|E
