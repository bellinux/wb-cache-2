40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the perceptions of high school freshmen regarding the image of agriculture and the barriers to <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> agricultural class. Results indicated that non-minority students had significantly higher overall mean scores than minority students for reasons for <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> agricultural education class. The findings also indicated that non-minority students had a more positive perception of <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> agricultural education course. Both groups of students indicated that no individual would have any influence on their reasons for enrolling or not <b>enrolling</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> agricultural education class; however, findings revealed that both groups of students indicated that they were <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> agricultural education class or probably would <b>enroll</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> class because of reasons other than the intended purposes of the class...|$|R

He supported Ganguly's dream to be a cricketer and asked their father to get Ganguly <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cricket coaching camp during his summer holidays.

After he received his PhD in 1923, Urey was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, where he met Werner Heisenberg, Hans Kramers, Wolfgang Pauli, Georg von Hevesy, and John Slater.
