50|$|Since the {{formation}} of the <b>French</b> Fifth <b>Republic</b> in 1958, France has had a semi-presidential system. Historically France has not had a semi-presidential system.

5|$|Despite the longed-for peace, {{tensions}} grew between France {{and most}} of the First Coalition allies, either separately or jointly. Ferdinand IV of Naples refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the Parthenopaean Republic. A republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by the <b>French</b> <b>Republic</b> which offered military support, led to the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation and the establishment of the Helvetic Republic. On his way to Egypt in Spring 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and removed the Hospitallers from their possessions. This angered Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. The ongoing French occupation of Malta angered the British, who dedicated themselves to ejecting the French garrison at Valletta. The French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the <b>French</b> <b>Republic</b> seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the British actually discussed this possibility.|$|E
5|$|The Courbet-class {{ships were}} {{completed}} {{less than a}} year before the start of World War I and nothing is known of their activities during this time except that France, escorted by Jean Bart, carried the President of the <b>French</b> <b>Republic,</b> Raymond Poincaré, on a state visit to Saint Petersburg, Russia in July 1914. They were returning from Russia when World War I began, but made it to France without encountering German ships.|$|E
5|$|As {{the capital}} of France, Paris is the seat of France's {{national}} government. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The President of the <b>French</b> <b>Republic</b> resides at the Élysée Palace in the 8th arrondissement, while the Prime Minister's seat is at the Hôtel Matignon in the 7th arrondissement. Government ministries are located {{in various parts of}} the city; many are located in the 7th arrondissement, near the Matignon.|$|E

5|$|Candolle's {{initiation}} to botany {{happened in}} 1794 thanks to Pierre Etienne Vaucher in Geneva. He spent then {{four years at}} the Geneva Academy, studying science and law according to his father's wishes. In 1798, he moved to Paris after Geneva had been annexed to the <b>French</b> <b>Republic.</b> His botanical career began {{with the help of}} René Louiche Desfontaines, who recommended de Candolle for work in the herbarium of Charles Louis L'Héritier de Brutelle during the summer of 1798. The position elevated de Candolle's reputation and also led to valuable instruction from Desfontaines himself. de Candolle established his first genus, Senebiera, in 1799.|$|E
5|$|Dermide {{was born}} on 20 April 1798, in Milan, which was then part of the Cisalpine Republic, a puppet state of the First <b>French</b> <b>Republic.</b> He {{was the first and}} only child of his parents, Maria Paola di Buonaparte (known as Pauline) and Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc, a general in the French Army. Dermide's birth was a {{difficult}} one, and its effects would be visible in Pauline's health for many years. He was christened Dermide Louis Napoléon, after a character in the epic Gaelic poems of Ossian, at the request of his uncle, general Napoleon Bonaparte, who greatly admired Ossian's works.|$|E
5|$|Europe {{had been}} in turmoil {{since the start of}} the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792. In 1797, after five years of war, the <b>French</b> <b>Republic</b> subdued the First Coalition, an {{alliance}} of Austria, Prussia, Great Britain, Spain, and various Italian states. A Second Coalition, led by Britain, Austria and Russia, and including the Ottoman Empire, Portugal and Naples, was formed in 1798, but by 1801, this too had been defeated, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For the first time in ten years, all of Europe was at peace.|$|E

5|$|Forster was {{not present}} in Mainz during the siege. As representatives of the Mainz National Convention, he and Adam Lux {{had been sent to}} Paris to apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an {{independent}} state – {{to become a part of}} the <b>French</b> <b>Republic.</b> The application was accepted, but had no effect, since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and the old order was restored. Forster lost his library and collections and decided to remain in Paris.|$|E
5|$|France, {{together}} with her sister ship , was ordered on 1 August 1911 {{as part of the}} 1911 Naval Programme. She was built by the Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire in Saint-Nazaire. Her keel was laid down on 30 November 1911 and she was launched on 7 November 1912. She was commissioned as part of the Bastille Day celebrations in 1914. Almost immediately after being commissioned, she, escorted by Jean Bart, carried the President of the <b>French</b> <b>Republic,</b> Raymond Poincaré, on a state visit to Saint Petersburg, Russia in July 1914. They returned from Russia shortly before World War I began.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793, amid rising {{political}} tension, the <b>French</b> <b>Republic</b> {{declared war}} on Great Britain, drawing Britain into the French Revolutionary Wars. At sea, the Bay of Biscay, the Western Approaches and the English Channel all became areas of significant naval activity as French privateers sailed on raiding cruises against British merchant shipping. To augment these attacks, the French naval authorities dispatched squadrons of frigates to attack British trade routes. To counter these operations, the Royal Navy sent their own frigates to sea, sometimes in squadrons and sometimes on single patrols.|$|E

25|$|In March 1793, France also {{declared}} war on Spain, the Vendée rebels won some victories against Paris, and the French army was defeated in Belgium by Austria with the French general Dumouriez defecting to the Austrians: the <b>French</b> <b>Republic's</b> survival was now in real danger.|$|R
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1794 {{the army of the}} <b>French</b> <b>Republic</b> overran the Dutch Republic. The French National Convention {{reformed}} the Dutch Republic into a revolutionary client state named the Batavian Republic. This event alarmed the government of Great Britain, erstwhile allies of the Dutch, as the Dutch Empire controlled a number of strategically important colonies in the East Indies. The key to controlling European access to the region was the Dutch Cape Colony on the tip of Southern Africa; a naval force based there could dominate the trade routes between Europe and the East Indies, in particular the economically vital links between Britain and British India.|$|E
5|$|Jean Bart {{was built}} by the Arsenal de Brest at Brest. Her keel was laid down on 15 October 1910 and was {{launched}} on 22 September 1911. She was completed on 19 November 1913 and finished her trials before World War I began the following year. Jean Bart escorted France, which was carrying the President of the <b>French</b> <b>Republic,</b> Raymond Poincaré, on a state visit to Saint Petersburg, Russia in July 1914. They were returning from Russia when World War I began, but made it to France without encountering German ships.|$|E

Affiliating with the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), Aubame later worked most closely with the Indépendants d'Outre-Mer, an African parliamentary group whose leaders were Senegalese Léopold Sédar Senghor and Cameroonian Louis-Paul Aujoulat. While a deputy he lived in Paris and toured Gabon regularly.|$|E
