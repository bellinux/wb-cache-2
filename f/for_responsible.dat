5|$|By 1922, {{the display}} of unity by white farmers against {{chartered}} rule at the 1920 elections fell apart. The majority of them, mostly ranchers and tobacco planters, who relied on the southern market, voted for Union. On the other hand, Mashonaland maize growers, wanting to retain full share of the local produce markets, wanted responsible government. The 1922 referendum results were 8,774 <b>for</b> <b>responsible</b> government and 5,989 for joining South Africa. The {{role of women in}} the defeat of the Unionists was substantial, with approximately 75% of them voting <b>for</b> <b>responsible</b> government, even when their husbands voted for Union. In a letter to the South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts, the Company Administrator Sir Francis Drummond Chaplin cited anti-Afrikaner sentiments, particularly amongst women, as {{a major factor in the}} result.|$|E
5|$|The desire <b>for</b> <b>responsible</b> {{government}} {{resulted in}} the abortive Rebellions of 1837. The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture. The Act of Union merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America by 1849. The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This {{paved the way for}} British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858). In 1867, the same year as Canadian Confederation, Britain declined to purchase for Canada the Alaska territory that was to that point tenuously held by Russia. With the United States purchasing Alaska instead, clearly demarcated borders for Canada, although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarkation of the Alaska-Yukon and Alaska-BC border for years to come.|$|E
25|$|The first {{referendum}} {{took place}} on June 3, 1948; 44.6% of people voted <b>for</b> <b>responsible</b> government, 41.1% voted for confederation with Canada, while 14.3% voted for Commission of Government. Since none of the choices had gained over 50%, a second referendum with only the two more popular choices was held on July 22, 1948. The official outcome of that referendum was 52.3% for confederation with Canada and 47.7% <b>for</b> <b>responsible</b> (independent) government.|$|E

25|$|Convict {{transportation}} to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) was to last exactly 50 years.

By 1853 {{transportation to}} Van Diemen's Land was abolished, but many of the convicts already there still had lengthy sentences to complete. The success of the Anti-Transportation League led to locals calling <b>for</b> <b>responsible</b> self-government for the colony of Van Diemen's Land, which was granted in 1856, with Hobart Town remaining as the colonial capital.|$|E

25|$|The secular {{history of}} Canada depicts Bishop Strachan {{as an ally}} of the landed gentry of the {{so-called}} Family Compact of Upper Canada, opposed to the political aspirations of farmers and bourgeoisie <b>for</b> <b>responsible</b> government. Nonetheless, Strachan played considerable part in promoting education, as founder of Kings College (now the University of Toronto) and Trinity College. The Clergy reserves, land which had been reserved {{for use by the}} non-Roman Catholic clergy, became a major issue in the mid-19th century. Anglicans argued that the land was meant for their exclusive use, while other denominations demanded that it be divided among them.|$|E

50|$|Leopard geckos {{range in}} color from a yellow to brownish-orange base with spots {{covering}} all or mostly {{half of the}} dorsal region of the body. Their color is derived from pigment-containing cells known as chromatophores. These cells are <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> an array of coloration seen in all reptiles, amphibians, birds and some species of insects. Chromatophores {{come in a variety}} of types based on the color they correspond to. Chromatophore types include xanthophores (<b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> yellow coloration), erythrophores (<b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> red coloration), iridophores (<b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> iridescence), leucophores (<b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> white coloration), melanophores (<b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> black coloration), and cyanophores (<b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> blue coloration). The skin of wild leopard geckos contains xanthophores (yellow) and melanophores (black spots). Designer leopard geckos may possess erythrophores and leucophores since commercial breeding and artificial selection have allowed novel coloration to arise.|$|R
