The electric field intensity of DC cables is distributed {{in direct proportion to}} the resistance coefficients of insulation which will change along with the temperature. If the load increases, the electric field intensity on the <b>insulation</b> <b>surface</b> will gradually increase. Therefore, the maximum load allowed by the DC cables should not make the electric field intensity on the <b>insulation</b> <b>surface</b> exceed its permissible value, i.e. not only the maximum working temperature of the cables shall be considered but also the temperature distribution of the insulating layer.|$|E

40|$|Fourteen foam {{insulation}} specimens were tested. Some were plain foam while others contained flame retardants, chopped fiberglass reinforcement and/or vapor barriers. The thermal {{performance of the}} insulation was determined by measuring {{the rate at which}} LH 2 boiled from an aluminum tank insulated with the test material. The test specimens were approximately 50 mm (2 in.) thick. They were structurally scaled so that the test cycle would duplicate the maximum thermal stresses predicted for the thicker insulation of an aircraft liquid hydrogen fuel tank during a typical subsonic flight. The simulated flight cycle of approximately 10 minutes duration heated the other <b>insulation</b> <b>surface</b> to 316 K (110 F) and cooled it to 226 K (20 F) while the inner <b>insulation</b> <b>surface</b> remained at liquid hydrogen temperature of 20 K (- 423 F).

30|$|Light {{timber frame}} {{construction}} are typically encapsulated within non-combustible gypsum plasterboard to offer sound <b>insulation,</b> <b>surface</b> finishes and protection from fire. Given the section size of typical 2 ”[*]×[*] 4 ” [50  mm[*]×[*] 100  mm] and 2 ”[*]×[*] 6 ” [50  mm[*]×[*] 150  mm] stud framing members, the inherent fire resistance of the studs alone is effectively negligible, as the members are small. Hence, unprotected, or exposed, light timber frames provide little structural fire resistance. Fire resistance is achieved by providing protection to the light timber assembly to delay the onset of heating and combustion. Light timber framing is not discussed further within this paper {{as it is a}} construction method primarily for low-rise buildings.|$|E

50|$|Construction of {{oil-filled}} transformers {{requires that}} the insulation covering the windings be thoroughly dried of residual moisture before the oil is introduced. Drying is carried out at the factory, and may also be required as a field service. Drying may be done by circulating hot air around the core, by circulating externally heated transformer oil, or by vapor-phase drying (VPD) where an evaporated solvent transfers heat by condensation on the coil and core. The VPD process most often uses kerosene as the heat exchanging fluid. In addition to decreasing the moisture content in the insulation, the kerosene acts as a cleaning solvent which takes out any dust and dirt from the <b>insulation</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Compared to a conventional hot air drying process, the vapor-phase drying process decreases the drying time by 40% to 50%.|$|R

The characteristic of insulation such as polarization and depolarization current (PDC), polarization index (PI) and dielectric loss tangent (tan δ) were measured according to the IEEE standard 43 - 2013. After cleaning with dry ice blasting, the insulation of generator has improved remarkably. The charging current is decreased due to removal of conductive layers from the <b>insulation</b> <b>surface.</b> For other parameters, polarization index and loss tangent are increased 52. 03 % and decreased 11. 66 % respectively. Furthermore, the operation time of dry ice method is very short when compared with traditional cleaning methods, resulting in reduced maintenance downtime and increased more productivity...|$|E

40|$|A {{full-scale}} experimental {{test was}} conducted to analyze the composite behavior of insulated concrete sandwich wall panels (ICSWPs) subjected to wind pressure and suction. The experimental program was composed of three groups of ICSWP specimens, each with {{a different type of}} insulation and number of glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) shear grids. The degree of composite action of each specimen was analyzed according to the load direction, type of the insulation, and number of GFRP shear grids by comparing the theoretical and experimental values. The failure modes of the ICSWPs were compared to investigate the effect of bonds according to the load direction and type of insulation. Bonds based on insulation absorptiveness were effective to result in the composite behavior of ICSWP under positive loading tests only, while bonds based on <b>insulation</b> <b>surface</b> roughness were effective under both positive and negative loading tests. Therefore, the composite behavior based on surface roughness {{can be applied to the}} calculation of the design strength of ICSWPs with continuous GFRP shear connectors...|$|E
40|$|An {{instrument}} (eroding potentionmeter) {{has been}} designed to measure real-time case wall and inhibitor insulation char depth within a rocket motor during firing. Thus measurement can be close to the real-time recession of the <b>insulation</b> <b>surface.</b> The eroding potentionmeter consists of two small (3 mils 9 in diameter) twisted resistive wires that are polyimide insulated. The wire pair form an electrical circuit and will recede with the erosion of the rocket motor internal insulation. A constant current applied along the wires will detect the resistance change via a voltage drop across the wires as the wire pair recedes with the decomposition fo the insulation. The eroding potentionmeter, as presently designed, can be an effective tool for real time measurement of internal insulation recession of a solid rocket motor. This tool will provide a way to accurately measure inhibitor performance or to measure flight effects of insulation erosion on a flight test. The eroding potentiometer has been verified on a plasma torch test and two static tests of a small solid rocket motor. There are some irregularities in the measured date, but the data remains useful in determining the real-time performance of internal insulation during a motor firing...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new modelling approach to analyse the fire structural response of fibreglass-polymer composites protected with an <b>insulation</b> <b>surface</b> layer consisting of thermally passive or active (intumescent) material. The model {{is designed to}} predict the temperature, decomposition, softening and failure of fibreglass composites protected from fire with either a passive or active surface coating. The modelling involves a multi-stage analytical approach: (i) thermal analysis of the surface coating (including decomposition and expansion {{in the case of}} the intumescent material), (ii) thermal-chemical analysis of heat transfer through the composite substrate (beneath the surface coating), including decomposition of the polymer matrix and softening of the fibreglass reinforcement, and (iii) thermal-mechanical analysis of the failure of the composite under tension or compression loading. Fire structural tests were performed on a woven glass/vinyl ester composite protected with either a thermally passive insulation (ceramic fibre) or an organic intumescent coating to validate the modelling approach. It is shown the model can approximate the thermal insulation provided to the composite substrate by the surface coatings. The model can also approximate the temperature, softening and failure of the fibreglass composite substrate with a passive or intumescent surface coating...|$|E
40|$|Asbestos {{has been}} used for many years as an {{ablation}} inhibitor in insulating materials. It has been a constituent of the AS/NBR insulation used to protect the steel case of the RSRM (Reusable Solid Rocket Motor) since its inception. This paper discusses the development of a potential replacement RSRM insulation design, several of the numerous design issues that were worked and processing problems that were resolved. The earlier design demonstration on FSM- 5 (Flight Support Motor) of the selected 7 % and 11 % Kevlar(registered) filled EPDM (KF/EPDM) candidate materials was expanded. Full-scale process simulation articles were built and FSM- 8 was manufactured using multiple Asbestos Free (AF) components and materials. Two major problems had to be overcome in developing the AF design. First, bondline corrosion, which occurred in the double-cured region of the aft dome, had to be eliminated. Second, KF/EPDM creates high levels of electrostatic energy (ESE), which does not readily dissipate from the <b>insulation</b> <b>surface.</b> An uncontrolled electrostatic discharge (ESD) of this surface energy during many phases of production could create serious safety hazards. Numerous processing changes were implemented and a conductive paint was developed to prevent exposed external insulation surfaces from generating ESE/ESD. Additionally, special internal instrumentation was incorporated into FSM- 8 to record real-time internal motor environment data. These data included inhibitor insulation erosion rates and internal thermal environments. The FSM- 8 static test was successfully conducted in February 2000 and much valuable data were obtained to characterize the AF insulation design...|$|E
40|$|Cable {{manufacturing}} in {{a developing country}} like Nigeria today is faced {{with a number of}} problems that affect the quality of cables produced from extrusion to insulation of conductors. The main cause of the problems is the low and variable output rate from extruder causing non-uniform conductor diameter which results in <b>insulation</b> <b>surface</b> appearance defects. These defects manifest in form of pimples, dimples, cracking, air cavity, voids and porosity within the plastics which are insulation. The conductor insulation normally used is the Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) which is normally sourced locally or imported. The locally produced PVC is cheaper in cost than the imported one but at the expense of quality due to inconsistency in the percentage combination of plasticizers, fillers, stabilizers, lubricants, and other additives required for producing quality PVC resin for cable applications. If the local manufacturers of PVC are not patronized, it will lead to employees losing their jobs and most likely their family income with other attending societal ills. The work in this paper takes a close to look at what should be done {{to improve the quality of}} locally produced PVC at little or no increase in cost. It has been discussed while working with one of the manufacturers that the required additives to produce an acceptable level of quality PVC resins for cable application are not optimally combined proportionately.
