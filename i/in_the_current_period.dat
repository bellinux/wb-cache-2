500|$|The {{official}} Congress communique set 2020 as a date {{on which}} Vietnam would reach {{the status of}} a modern, industrial society. To reach this goal, the targeted growth for gross domestic product (GDP) was set at 7.5–8 percent for 2006–2011. The congress promised to renew the socialist-oriented market economy, and step up its fight against political corruption. The communique emphasized the party's goal of a future society without exploitation, based on the ideology of Marxism–Leninism. The Political Report, the Eighth Five-Year Plan (2006–2010)officially titled the Five Year Socio-economic Development Plan, the report on Party building and the amendment and revision to the Party's charter, were approved.

2500|$|In contrast, the {{development}} of Cockburn's position on global warming seemed more consistent with views usually held by those on the Right. He believed the phenomenon has not been proven {{to be caused by}} humans. In 2008 Cockburn wrote A Short History of Fear in which he went after the subject of anthropogenic global warming and later writing in Spiked that [...] "you can account for the current warming by a number of well-known factors - to do with the elliptical course of the Earth in its relationship to the sun, the axis of the Earth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>period,</b> and possibly the influence of solar flares." [...] He cited the statements of Martin Hertzberg that rising CO2 levels are a symptom, not a cause, of global warming, which Hertzberg asserts is the result of natural, predictable changes in the Earth's elliptic orbit. Hertzberg is a semi-retired explosives expert who does not claim to be a climatologist. The arguments given by Hertzberg and Cockburn are the famous Milankovitch cycles.|$|E

So where have the benefits of technology-driven productivity cycle gone? Almost exclusively to corporations and their very top executives." [...] In addition to the technological side of it, the affected functionality emanates from the perceived unfairness and the reduced trust of people towards the state. The study by Kristal and Cohen showed that rising wage inequality has brought about an unhealthy competition between institutions and technology. [...] The technological changes, with computerization of the workplace, seem to give an upper hand to the high-skilled workers as the primary cause of inequality in America. The qualified will always be considered to be in a better position as compared to those dealing with hand work leading to replacements and unequal distribution of resources.|$|E

Accordingly, individuals will not be able to insure against some bad state of the economy in the future. They anticipate that if this bad state is realized, they will earn lower income. To avoid adverse effects of future income fluctuations and retain a smooth path of consumption, they set aside a precautionary reserve, called precautionary savings, by consuming less <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>period,</b> and resort to it in case the bad state is realized in the future.|$|E
