The reconstruction algorithm was implemented on each robot. In the foam properties section, we focused on the curing mechanism of each type of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam.</b> One-part type <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> needed 1 h to cure before the robot could traverse it. Moreover, the foam expanded in a horizontal direction (and not a vertical direction). Conversely, the two-part type <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> cured within 2 min, and the foam expanded approximately 2 times in a vertical direction (and not a horizontal direction). To consider these different properties of one- and two-part <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam,</b> we implemented different algorithms for modifying the environment. The main difference in the algorithms is the waiting time before the robot evaluates the environment after ejection; the two-part foam type robot waits 10 s between evaluations. In the actual experiments, both types of robot could autonomously detect a ditch or step in front, and ejected <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> with a head sweeping motion. After each ejection, the robot moved backward and re-evaluated the environment. The robot looped through this sequence of actions until the environment was suitable for traversal.

Although it has many properties that are desirable, there are also serious problems associated with <b>foam’s</b> ubiquity. <b>Polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> is highly flammable, and therefore flame retardants must be added to the material to lessen its potential danger.

40|$|The {{field of}} flame retardancy of {{polymeric}} materials (i. e. plastics, foams {{and in particular}} textiles) is currently facing several changes and challenges, {{as some of the}} current halogenated or phosphorus-based flame retardants (FRs) have proven to be persistent, bioaccumulative, carcinogenic and/or toxic for animals and humans. Thus, the seeking for highly efficient green flame retardant products, exploitable by using simple and environmentally-friendly techniques (i. e. impregnation/exhaustion, layer-by-layer), is driving the research towards the development of worthy alternatives.

40|$|The authors, in an {{interesting}} and valuable paper, describe {{the failure of the}} brick-masonry veneer façade of a multiuse public hall in Gondomar, Portugal. Damage occurred within 2 years of construction. The veneer was a single leaf of continuous brick masonry tied to a RC structural wall, forming a cavity of nominal width 0. 07 m that was partly filled with <b>foamed</b> <b>polyurethane.</b> The veneer wall was 242 m in length and 15 m in height, without movement joints, and extended around most of the elliptical perimeter of the building with portions facing north, east, and south. From their site investigations and technical analysis, the authors attributed the failure primarily to effects of “the irreversible expansion of clay brick,” apparent both from cracking and from extensive out-of-plane deformation of the wall, which had widened the cavity to as much as 0. 13 m. Effects were greater on parts of the wall facing south. The failure analysis made use of a power law proposed by Wilson et al. (2003) to describe how expansive strain develops in fired-clay ceramics with time. Here, the discussers comment on recent fundamental work on moisture expansion in brick, and in particular on its temperature dependence, matters of direct relevance to the paper under discussion. The discussers’ comments support and extend the conclusions of the authors, with which the discussers broadly agree. Irreversible moisture expansion occurs as a result of slow chemical reactions between components of the fired-clay ceramic and environmental moisture (Hamilton and Hall 2012). The magnitude of the expansion varies strongly with brick mineralogy and kiln firing history, but a predictive model for expansion based on these factors does not yet exist. However, in general, highly crystalline engineering ceramics produced at high kiln temperatures expand less than low-fired ceramics with a higher amorphous content. The penalty is that high-fired ceramics tend to be more brittle and prone to cracking. It is now established that the expansive reaction continues indefinitely, although at a diminishing rate over all timescales; therefore, there is no well-defined time at which it ceases. Recent reanalysis of published data (Hall et al. 2011; Hall and Hoff 2012) shows that the equation e=at 1 / 4 accurately describes expansion strain e over periods of time t as long as 65 years. It follows from this equation that expansive strain at 16 years is double the value at 1 year and three times the 1 -year value at 81 years. The persistence of the expansion reaction, albeit at a diminishing rate, emphasizes the need to incorporate appropriate movement joints in masonry design. The authors mention the possibility of using a “poor mortar” to accommodate some of the expansive strain. The use of weak mortars undoubtedly explains the absence of expansion damage in some much-older buildings with thick brick walls. However, the discussers consider that in thin brick veneers, such as those used in Gondomar, a weak mortar is potentially dangerous. It is unfortunate both for design and for failure analysis that the test procedures generally used to characterize clay brick do not provide values of the expansivity a that are needed to apply the equation e=at 1 / 4. Accelerated steam tests, such as EN 772 - 19 cited by the authors, are at best semiquantitative. In our view, it is essential to determine the expansivity from measurements of expansion strain made over an appropriate period of time under controlled conditions (Hall and Hoff 2012). The discussers also draw attention to the important practical matter of the temperature dependence of the moisture expansivity (Hall et al. 2013). The fact that moisture expansion is the direct consequence of a chemical rehydroxylation reaction (Hamilton and Hall 2012) ensures that the expansivity increases notably with temperature. Available data indicate that the activation energy (which controls the temperature dependence) is about 70 [*]kJ/mol. This means, for example, that the expansivity a of any brick material is about 60 % greater at a temperature of 30 °C than it is at 10 °C. Thus, if a limit expansion strain (say, 1 × 10 − 3) is reached in a particular material in 50 years at 10 °C, the same strain is attained in the same material in only 7 years at 30 °C. It seems likely that its strong temperature dependence explains why moisture expansion is perceived differently in different geographical regions [e. g., McNeilly (1985) ] and generally receives more attention in regions with warmer climates, such as Australia, southern Asia, and Brazil. However, in any particular region, the magnitude of expansion and the associated damage within individual buildings are influenced by local temperature variations, in particular variations due to solar heat gain. In the Gondomar structure, deformation and cavity expansion were greatest in parts of the structure with a southern aspect, where the summer temperatures of the veneer are highest. The influence of aspect here is presumably exacerbated by the open situation of the building and by the insulation of the cavity where large temperature gradients might be expected. The discussers believe this large gradient acting over a thin veneer may partly explain such dramatic damage over a short period of time. A thicker brick cladding would probably fare better. Undoubtedly, there are also seasonal modulations of the expansion. The discussers have shown elsewhere how related thermal effects in the rehydroxylation of archaeological ceramics may be calculated (Hall et al. 2013) ...|$|E

Other fire retardants such as melamine are reported to significantly increase the HCN yield of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams.</b> The presence of Cu 2 O drastically decreased the yield of HCN in <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> at lower temperatures, but had little effect at high temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Experiments with captive bats need {{a flight}} room that is acoustically neutral, {{especially}} when recording and analysing bat calls or {{the response of}} bats to certain sound stimuli. Our aim was to identify an isolation material with the best quality–price relationship to acoustically coat such a flight room. For this, we built a flight room divided into two compartments that were to be acoustically isolated from one another. Audible and infrasonic waves are difficult to attenuate with low-cost materials but the attenuation of ultrasounds is rather straightforward. We evaluated the absorbing capacities of different low-cost materials – felt fabric, polystyrene, egg boxes, egg boxes coated with felt fabric, absorbing pyramidal <b>foams,</b> <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> and cork. The material that showed the best quality–price relationship was the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foam</b> of open cells (5 cm thickness), which was able to attenuate approximately 20 dB at ultrasonic frequencies...|$|R
30|$|Usually, <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> are {{prepared}} by the reaction between polyols and diisosyanates {{with the addition of}} a surfactant and water. Petroleum-based polyols can be replaced with lignins. Pan and Saddler used hardwood ethanol organosolv lignin and hardwood kraft lignin to replace almost 30  % commercial polyols with the lignins [12]. Addition of another biomass polyol to lignin was investigated. Lignin-based <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> could be prepared using kraft lignin or lignosulfonate, molasses, PEG with poly(phenylene methylene), or polyisocyanate in the presence of surfactants and a small amount of water [167]. The apparent density, compression strength, and elastic modulus of the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> increased with increasing lignin contents. The obtained <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> exhibited thermal stability up to 300  °C. The <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> prepared using polyols derived from lignins and molasses displayed water absorbent properties. By adding microcrystalline cellulose, the water absorption rate increased initially and kept larger amount of water over long periods of time [168]. Polyols, except lignin, can affect the mechanical and thermal properties of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams.</b> Hatakeyama et al. [169, 170] investigated the mechanical and thermal properties of lignin-based <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> derived from sodium lignosulfonate mixed with diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, and PEG. The glass transition temperatures and thermal stability increased with decreasing oxyethylene chain lengths, and the compression strength and compression modulus increased with increasing oxyethylene chain lengths.|$|R

30|$|As {{the global}} usage of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> is {{expected}} to continue to increase yearly, {{it is important that the}} fire community have a clear understanding of the fire toxicity of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams</b> and the reasons why they produce significant amounts of toxic gases during combustion. Since HCN is a major contributor to the fire toxicity of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>foams,</b> the mechanisms by which they decompose are vital in understanding why they produce large-quantities of HCN during under-ventilated burning.|$|R
