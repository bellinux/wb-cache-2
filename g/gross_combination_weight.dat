40|$|Increasing {{volumes of}} road freight {{transport}} necessitate the {{development and use of}} fuel-ecient and economic transport vehicles and solutions. The transition from standard tractor-semitrailer combinations to truck and trailer <b>combinations</b> of <b>gross</b> <b>combination</b> <b>weights</b> upto 74 tons and extending upto 34 metres in length is in eect {{at the time of this}} research. Also, there is growing impetus for hybridisation and complete electrication of medium and heavy duty long haul trucks. Yet, the pertinent problem is the study of the economic and technical feasibility of such hybridisation for longer combinations where there can be several potential axles that can be electrically propelled. The problem is further compounded by the challenges and costs faced in using currently-expensive and heavy batteries and a variety of electric motors. In this thesis, a generic physical modelling of long truck trailer combinations coupled with an energy management algorithm is developed. The energy management is made predictive in nature with prior knowledge of the mission route in order to optimise the use of the electric batteries. The propulsion is 'distributed' so as to allow each trailing unit to be independent, complete with its own battery and axle power distribution management. Thereafter, an object-oriented programming architecture is constructed to implement the vehicle model. The A-Double combination is instantiated and validated against a physical test vehicle performing transport missions along Malmo and Goteborg in south-western Sweden. Independently, a genetic algorithm is implemented on the same platform as the vehicle model. The genotype structures corresponding to each long vehicle combination to be evaluated are developed and custom cross-over and mutation schemes are described and implemented. The algorithm is validated for standard benchmarking functions in two variables and for simple arithmetic functions involving the categorical variables representing the truck-trailer combinations. Several objective functions for the long vehicle combinations are evaluated and a prot maximisation objective is chosen and mathematically formulated. The function parameters are varied to evaluate function sensitivity to each. The genetic algorithm is then used to derive the optimal axle propulsion conguration, battery size and motor rating for the mission specied above, with varying <b>gross</b> <b>combination</b> <b>weights</b> so as to maximise the chosen objective function. Trends in vehicle productivity are calculated over 15 following years from 2015 to 2030 and optimal long combination congurations are derived in intervals of 5 years. Principal contributing factors in each optimal conguration are identied and discussed...|$|R

State exemptions, however, are only applicable in intrastate commerce; stipulations of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) may be applied in interstate commerce. Also a person under the age of 21 cannot operate a commercial vehicle outside the state where the commercial license was issued. This restriction may also be mirrored by certain states in their intrastate regulations. A person must be at least 18 in order to be issued a commercial license.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal was}} to extract {{knowledge}} from data that is logged by the electronic system of every Volvo truck. This allowed the evaluation of large populations of trucks without requiring additional measuring devices and facilities. An evaluation cycle, similar to the knowledge discovery from databases model, was developed and applied to extract knowledge from data. The focus was on extracting information in the logged data that {{is related to the}} class labels of different populations, but also supported knowledge extraction inherent from the given classes. The methods used come from the field of unsupervised learning, a sub-field of machine learning and include the methods self-organizing maps, multi-dimensional scaling and fuzzy c-means clustering. The developed evaluation cycle was exemplied by the evaluation of three data-sets. Two data-sets were arranged from populations of trucks differing by their operating environment regarding road condition or <b>gross</b> <b>combination</b> <b>weight.</b> The results showed that there is relevant information in the logged data that describes these differences in the operating environment. A third data-set consisted of populations with different engine configurations, causing the two groups of trucks being unequally powerful.

Information in the logged data that describes the vehicle's operating environment, allows to detect trucks that are operated differently of their intended use.

40|$|Existing {{multiple}} kernel learning (MKL) algorithms indiscriminately apply a {{same set}} of kernel <b>combination</b> <b>weights</b> to all samples. However, the utility of base kernels could vary across samples and a base kernel useful for one sample could become noisy for another.

To improve this situation, we propose a sample-adaptive MKL algorithm, in which base kernels are allowed to be adaptively switched on/off with respect to each sample. We achieve this goal by assigning a latent binary variable to each base kernel when it is applied to a sample. The kernel <b>combination</b> <b>weights</b> and the latent variables are jointly optimized via margin maximization principle.

40|$|Abstract—An {{ensemble}} is a {{group of}} learners that work together as a committee to solve a problem. The existing ensemble learning algorithms often generate unnecessarily large ensembles, which consume extra computational resource and may degrade the generalization performance. Ensemble pruning algorithms aim to find a good subset of ensemble members to constitute a small ensemble, which saves the computational resource and performs as well as, or better than, the unpruned ensemble. This paper introduces a probabilistic ensemble pruning algorithm by choosing a set of “sparse ” <b>combination</b> <b>weights,</b> most of which are zeros, to prune the ensemble. In order to obtain the set of sparse <b>combination</b> <b>weights</b> and satisfy the non-negative constraint of the <b>combination</b> <b>weights,</b> a left-truncated, non-negative, Gaussian prior is adopted over every <b>combination</b> <b>weight.</b> Expectation propagation (EP) algorithm is employed to approximate the posterior estimation of the weight vector. The leave-one-out (LOO) error can be obtained as a byproduct in the training of EP without extra computation and is a good indication for the generalization error. Therefore, the LOO error is used together with the Bayesian evidence for model selection in this algorithm. An empirical study on several regression and classification benchmark data sets shows that our algorithm utilizes far less component learners but performs as well as, or better than, the unpruned ensemble. Our results are very competitive compared with other ensemble pruning algorithms. Index Terms—Machine learning, Probabilistic algorithms. ...|$|R
