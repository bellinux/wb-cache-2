The strains were isolated in Norway, except for three strains isolated from periodontitis patients in Brazil. The {{genetic diversity}} of these strains {{was compared to}} that of 30 isolates <b>from</b> <b>dairies</b> in Norway and Finland. Allelic variation in 13 structural gene loci encoding metabolic enzymes was analyzed. Twelve of the 13 loci were polymorphic, and 48 unique electrophoretic types (ETs) were identified, representing multilocus genotypes. The mean genetic diversity among the 48 genotypes was 0. 508. The genetic diversity of each source group of isolates varied from 0. 241 (periodontal infection) to 0. 534 (dairy). Cluster analysis revealed two major groups separated at a genetic distance of greater than 0. 6. One cluster, ETs 1 to 13, included solely isolates <b>from</b> <b>dairies,</b> while the other cluster, ETs 14 to 49, included all of the human isolates as well as isolates <b>from</b> <b>dairies</b> in Norway and Finland. The isolates were serotyped using antiflagellar antiserum. A total of 14 distinct serotypes were observed. However, little association between serotyping and genotyping was seen. Most of the strains were also analyzed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, showing the presence of extrachromosomal DNA in the size range of 15 to 600 kb. Our results indicate a high degree of heterogeneity among dairy strains. In contrast, strains isolated from humans had their genotypes in one cluster. Most strains from patients with periodontitis belonged to a single lineage, suggesting that specific clones of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis are associated with oral infections...|$|E

40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) {{are commonly}} used in food industries，especially {{for the production of}} fermented dairy products. During fermentation process，some dairy LAB produce exopolysaccharide(EPS) ，providing good mouthfeel properties to the products by modifying their textures. In general， EPS is divided into two groups based on their monosaccharide composition; homo-EPS and hetero-EPS. It is believed that the major physiological function of EPS is the first line of biological defense against phagocytosis，phage attack， antibiotics，toxic metal ions，and physical stresses such as desiccation and osmotic stress.

40|$|Sodium {{discharge}} <b>from</b> <b>dairies</b> in California {{has been}} identified as an important contributor to soil and water pollution. The Waste Discharge Requirements General Order For Existing Milk Cow Dairies (2007) aims to minimize the amount of fixed solids, including Na, that are discharged <b>from</b> <b>dairies,</b> aiming to maximise the useable lifespan of water resources. As sodium bicarbonate (SB) contains 270 g/kg Na, SB supplementation can substantially increase Na discharge <b>from</b> <b>dairies.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of SB and a potentially alternative buffer that does not contribute to Na discharge and related negative impacts on soil and water quality, (i. e., calcium magnesium carbonate (CMC)), on the performance of high producing California dairy cows. This could help establish if CMC could substitute for SB while maintaining potential benefits of SB. It is well known that SB is a rumen buffer, but research indicates that its benefits are limited mainly to corn silage-based diets. Californian dairies use a wide range of forages, and tend not to base their diets solely or mainly on corn silage. Therefore, typical Californian lactation diets do not always conform to those reported in research publications involving SB. In addition, research parameters such as milk yield, DM intake and dietary ADF often differ substantially between reported studies and conditions present on commercial California dairies, and results are therefore not always practically applicable. Apart from its rumen buffering capacity, SB also has an influence on dietary cation anion difference (DCAD), and can therefore elicit a response via a change in blood acid base balance of cows. The experiment was a Latin square design with 3 treatments (i. e., control (C), SB and CMC), 3 pens of ~ 310 early lactation cows each, and 3 periods of 28 d. Sodium bicarbonate supplemented cows had elevated milk fat proportion, but a reduced milk yield, resulting in similar milk fat yield between SB supplemented and C cows. Based on a tendency for elevated faecal and in vitro rumen fluid pH, SB had a buffering effect on the gastrointestinal tract GIT, most likely in the rumen. However, it is likely that the difference in DCAD between the C and SB diets played a role in affecting milk yield and milk fat proportion, and a high intake of Na may have been the cause for a reduction in milk yield resulting in passive increase in milk fat proportion. There were no differences between C and CMC treatments, except for an elevated faecal pH of CMC cows. As CMC is not generally soluble at normal rumen pH, buffering likely occurred in the abomasum and small and large intestines. However, a lack of difference in productivity indicates that the buffering effect on the hindgut was not physiologically required. While there were no productive benefits of SB use, it likely substantially increased Na discharge, resulting in an increase in soil and water sodicity and the associated deterioration in soil and water quality. While CMC did not improve productivity or efficiency of cows, it also did not increase Na discharge from the dairy and therefore did not contribute to soil or water sodicity. It can be concluded that SB or CMC supplementation is not advisable for diets and conditions comparable to those present in this study, i. e., high producing dairy cows fed a diet with ‘normal’ aNDF levels and relatively low proportions of corn silage and starch (334. 0, 104. 0 and 160. 3 g/kg DM, respectively, in our study).

ABSTRACT: Discharges <b>from</b> <b>dairies</b> are very rich in organic matter. 900 m 3 /d of liquid waste is discharged daily by the milk processing unit of the City Rabat / Salè. They are a formidable source of pollution because they contain microorganisms, lactose, protein, vitamins and mineral, in addition the management of these effluents concerned producers and actors of the environment. This work is primarily concerned to the biodegradation of dairy effluent by treatment with fungi. A reactor in batch culture was used in order to study the growth of fungi and removal organic matter. The inoculation is carried out by amplified fungi of the effluent and with unamplified fungi. And to improve the treatment efficiency, the biodegradation was coupled by a buffer reagent LDC 7. The results show that using amplified fungi in presence of LDC 7 reagent induces a high decrease of COD with a percentage of 85 %. In conclusion, the biodegradation of the effluent from the dairy industry using fungi coupled to LDC 7 is a very promising biotechnological process, which is simple, economical and environmentally friendly and {{can contribute to the}} treatment of liquid waste and reduce polluting factors...|$|E
