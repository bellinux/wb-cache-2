40|$|The {{development}} and provision of high-quality e-learning courses is expensive and hardly manageable for single institutions. Our {{approach is to}} re-use and share existing resources: Each partner of a consortium develops one e-learning course, which bases on an existing regular course and teaching materials. Each partner provides this course – including teachers –to the students of the partner institutions. In return, each partner receives courses on a non-fee basis. This paper describes the results of applying this business model in the two EC projects eduGI (www. eduGI. net/eduGI) and eduGI. LA 2 (www. eduGI. net/eduGI. LA 2). The major key result was the validation of the business model: After {{the end of the}} project eduGI, the partners will go with the exchange of courses {{for at least three years}} – without any further funding required. We were able to develop and exchange e-Learning courses with limited resources – however there are weaknesses and challenges for improvements. An exemplary cost-benefit calculation of one of the e-Learning courses shows a positive return of investment, additional intangible benefits, and promising perspectives for further exploitation. Although both projects were in the topic of geographic information, we developed an <b>inter-institutional</b> model for <b>cooperation,</b> which is applicable in all domains of Higher Education...|$|R

The National Progress Programme for 2014 – 2020 highlights the necessity to enhance the inclusion of the disabled and other socially vulnerable groups in the education process. Thus, in response to the current challenges and changing public needs, and in order to create conditions for all children to gain education appropriate to their age and needs, school as the main child‘s socialisation institution shall ensure provision of high quality and comprehensive social pedagogical assistance. Only joint efforts of various specialists equipped with relevant knowledge/information and a wide range of abilities can ensure effective organisation and provision of social pedagogical assistance. One of the main conditions in providing social pedagogical assistance is teamwork providing for coordination of the activity of individual specialists, better identification of social assistance needs and development of <b>inter-institutional</b> and cross-section <b>cooperation.</b> The Article provides a draft model of integrated assistance to the child and a peer review.

40|$|The {{context of}} public {{policies}} {{undergoes a process}} of rapid change due {{to the emergence of}} the dynamic knowledge-based economy and society. Public administration institutions need to adapt their material and human resources to the dynamic developments of the knowledge and information society in order to maintain efficiency and effectiveness of their scopes. One of the most fragile fields is public order and the need for improved <b>inter-institutional</b> <b>cooperation</b> at national, regional, and EU-level for achieving the objectives of ensuring citizens’ safety while safeguarding rights and liberties. The social and economic efficiency of public order policies and measures need to be reassessed and improved based on overhauled and updated inter-institutional and organisational concepts, on diversified methods of cooperation at national, regional, EU- and international level. A recent project developed in the field of public order with respect to juvenile delinquency has shown that major questions still need to be approached with respect to efficiency and effectiveness of <b>inter-institutional</b> <b>cooperation</b> with both public and private bodies, and with representatives of the non-governmental organizations. The outcomes of the project have shown that juvenile delinquency must be approached as phenomenon in the wider framework of public order, of urban and rural safety, of crime prevention and combating. One major conclusion of the project is that a new integrated model is required with respect to the intra-, and <b>inter-institutional</b> <b>cooperation</b> and dialogue, but also with respect to the skills required to work efficiently considering the challenges posed by the overall developments of a society changing towards increased knowledge and information awareness.

Given the need to select cases where the type of interaction, which was the object of study, were taking place, we took as basis the Notice of Financial Assistance released by the Visiting Scholar Foundation Araucaria Support Scientific and Technological Development of Paraná. It was observed that the predominant mechanism for cooperation was formalized with a defined goal, and there were several motivations for cooperation and highlighted for selection of the visiting researcher. Likewise, many facilitators were appointed and hindering, {{and most of these}} were related to factors external to the research, for example, issues and problems of bureaucratic infrastructure of recipient institutions. The activities of visiting researchers involved both research and development, such as teaching and writing reports and articles. The observed contributions, we can highlight the expansion of the contact network of teachers: the new perspectives of teaching the students had contact, the establishment of formal agreements for cooperation, a schedule of upcoming exchanges of teachers and students, the spread the knowledge generated in research through publications, the consolidation of post-graduate programs are less than the potential possibilities of patenting arising from some projects and, contributions to local communities where some projects have been developed.

Results show that specific communicative patterns are aroused from the various institutions, the EU <b>inter-institutional</b> <b>cooperation</b> is negatively evaluated, and non-official information channels are a key asset for communicating in Brussels.

However, since 2005, the relations of cooperation and collaboration between state institutions, regional and local authorities in the field of security have been institutionalized through the signing of new agreements (Calaresu 2012, 2013), designed to overcome the weaknesses of the previous <b>inter-institutional</b> <b>cooperation</b> model as tested during the so-called “first contractual season” (1998 – 2005)d.
