40|$|Among many {{seawater}} desalination processes, the multistage flash (MSF) desalination {{process is}} {{a major source of}} fresh water around the world. The most costly design and operation problem in seawater desalination is due to scale formation and corrosion problems. Fouling factor {{is one of the many}} important parameters that affect the operation of MSF processes. This thesis therefore focuses on determining the optimal design and operation strategy of MSF desalinations processes under fouling which will meet variable demand of freshwater. First, a steady state model of MSF is developed based on the basic laws of mass balance, energy balance, and heat transfer equations with supporting correlations for physical properties. gPROMS software is used to develop the model which is validated against the results reported in the literature. The model is then used in further investigations. Based on actual plant data, a simple dynamic fouling factor profile is developed which allows calculation of fouling factor at different time (season of the year). The role of changing brine heater fouling factor with varying seawater temperatures (during the year) on the plant performance and the monthly operating costs for fixed water demand and fixed top brine temperature are then studied. The total monthly operation cost of the process are minimised while the operating parameters such as make up, brine recycle flow rate and steam temperature are optimised. It was found that the seasonal variation in seawater temperature and brine heater fouling factor results in significant variations in the operating parameters and operating costs. The design and operation of the MSF process are optimized in order to meet variable demands of freshwater with changing seawater temperature throughout the day and throughout the year. On the basis of actual data, the neural network (NN) technique has been used to develop a correlation for calculating dynamic freshwater demand/consumption profiles at different times of the day and season. Also, a simple polynomial based dynamic seawater temperature correlation is developed based on actual data. An <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> between the plant and the client is considered. The MSF process model developed earlier is coupled with the dynamic model for the storage tank and is incorporated into the optimization framework within gPROMS. Four main seasons are considered in a year and for each season, with variable freshwater demand and seawater temperature, the operating parameters are optimized at discrete time intervals, while minimizing the total daily costs. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> adds flexible scheduling and maintenance opportunity of individual flash stages and makes it possible to meet variable freshwater demand with varying seawater temperatures without interrupting or fully shutting down the plant at any-time during the day and for any season. Finally, the purity of freshwater coming from MSF desalination plants is very important when the water is used for industrial services such as feed of boiler to produce steam. In this work, for fixed water demand and top brine temperature, the effect of separation efficiency of demister with seasonal variation of seawater temperatures on the final purity of freshwater for both cleaned and fouled demister conditions is studied. It was found that the purity of freshwater is affected by the total number of stages. Also to maintain the purity of freshwater product, comparatively large number of flash stage is required for fouled demister...|$|E
40|$|Desalination is a {{technique}} of producing fresh water from the saline water. Industrial desalination of sea water is becoming an essential part in providing sustainable source of fresh water for {{a large number of}} countries around the world. Thermal process being the oldest and most dominating for large scale production of freshwater in todayÂ¿s world. Multi-Stage Flash (MSF) distillation process has been used for many years and is now the largest sector in the desalination industry. In this work, a steady state mathematical model of Multistage Flash (MSF) desalination process is developed and validated against the results reported in the literature using gPROMS software. The model is then used for further investigation. First, a steady state calcium carbonate fouling resistance model has been developed and implemented in the full MSF mathematical model developed above using gPROMS modeling tool. This model takes into consideration the effect of stage temperature on the calcium carbonate fouling resistance in the flashing chambers in the heat recovery section, heat rejection section, and brine heaters of MSF desalination plants. The effect of seasonal variation of seawater temperature and top brine temperature on the calcium carbonate fouling resistance has been studied throughout the flashing stage. In addition, the total annual operating cost of the MSF process is selected to minimise, while optimising the operating parameters such as seawater rejected flow rate, brine recycle flow rate and steam temperature at different seawater temperature and fouling resistance. Secondly, an intermediate storage between the plant and the client is considered to provide additional flexibility in design and operation of the MSF process throughout the day. A simple polynomial based dynamic seawater temperature and different freshwater demand correlations are developed based on actual data. For different number of flash stages, operating parameters such as seawater rejected flow rate and brine recycle flow rate are optimised, while the total annual operating cost of the MSF process is selected to minimise. The results clearly show that the advantage of using the <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> adds flexible scheduling in the MSF plant design and operation parameters to meet the variation in freshwater demand with varying seawater temperatures without interrupting or fully shutting down the plant {{at any time during the}} day by adjusting the number of stages. Furthermore, the effect of non-condensable gases (NCG) on the steady state mathematical model of MSF process is developed and implemented in the MSF model developed earlier. Then the model is used to study effect of NCG on the overall heat transfer coefficient. The simulation results showed a decrease in the overall heat transfer coefficient values as NCG concentrations increased. The model is then used to study the effect of NCG on the design and operation parameters of MSF process for fixed water demand. For a given plant configuration (fixed design) and at different seawater and steam temperatures, a 0. 015 wt. ...|$|E

A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is introduced which is nonconvex due to the presence of bilinear, polynomial, and fractional power terms. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) relaxation of the extended pooling problem is proposed and we introduce several test cases from small to medium to large scale and solve them to global optimality.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} optimal design of batch plants. It consists of a master optimization algorithm, i. e., a genetic algorithm (GA) coupled to a discrete-event simulation (DES). The innovative aspect of this work {{is the use of}} âshortcutâ models included in the DES for describing the unit operations. The example of a protein production process serves as an illustration to show the effectiveness of the approach. The major interest is that the use of local models for unit operations allows the computation of an environmental index in combination with an economic indicator. The optimization framework determines the plant structure (parallel units, allocation of <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks),</b> the batch plant decision variables (equipment sizes, batch sizes) and the process decision variables (e. g., final concentration at selected stages, volumetric ratio of phases at the liquidâliquid extraction, [...] .).

The study presented in this Article focuses on the scheduling of the loading and unloading of crude oil in <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> between ports and crude distillation units. Analysis of this activity gives rise to better use of a systemâs resources, as well as improved total visibility and control of production units and the entire supply chain.

The aim of the present Article is to develop an exact solution approach based on a generic mixed integer model, which provides not only the optimal schedule of loading and unloading of crude oil minimizing the setup cost, but also the optimal type of mixture preparation. Comparison between the approach applied in a real refinery and the developed exact approach is presented to justify the advantage of optimization tools. A series of valid inequalities are developed to speed up the convergence of the resolution approach of the model.

40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{design of a}} thermo-electric energy storage (TEES) system for large scale electricity storage is discussed in this work by showing {{the results of the}} thermoeconomic optimization of three different system configurations that were identified in previous works. The system is based on transcritical CO 2 cycles, water storage and salt-water ice storage and is designed for a capacity of 2 h discharge and equal charge and discharge power of 50 MW. A two-step optimization procedure is used. The system intensive design parameters are optimized at the master level through a genetic algorithm. The optimal cycle mass flow rates are calculated in a nested linear programming step where the heat integration between the cycles is optimized subject to the heat transfer feasibility imposed through Pinch Analysis cascade calculations. The synthesis of the heat exchanger network and of the <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> systems was solved through a set of heuristic rules. Equipment purchasing costs were estimated by means of cost functions that were built upon vendors quotations. The results are discussed by showing the Pareto fronts of the three optimization cases and the trends of the decision variables along each optimal front. Nine solutions are discussed in more detail by showing the values of the design parameters and the process flow diagrams including storage and heat exchanger layouts. Design guidelines are then formulated which can be used in future works for detail plant design. The topological features that are found to maximize the system performance at the minimum costs are: superheating before the CO 2 heat pump, two independent systems of hot water <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> above and below the ambient temperature, and air cooling at the heat pump side. The design parameters that affect significantly the costs and performances are the cycle pressures. These are in fact directly associated with temperature differences both at the cold and hot storage sides which should be carefully optimized to obtain the best trade-off between exergy losses and costs for heat exchangers. Due to the change in specific heat of the supercritical CO 2 along the temperature range of hot water storage, a system of multiple <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> was used. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> help reduce significantly the temperature differences at the hot storage side and therefore their number represent another critical design parameter that must be optimized to achieve the best trade-off between costs and performances...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFrom June 2008 to August 2013, {{slightly}} more than 67 kt of CO 2 were injected at the Ketzin pilot site (Brandenburg, Germany). The CO 2 reservoir is a saline aquifer {{at a depth of}} 630 â 650 m with initial pressure and temperature conditions of about 33 Â°C/ 62 bar. These reservoir conditions are near the critical point of pure CO 2 (31. 0 Â°C/ 73. 8 bar) and the CO 2 liquid-vapour equilibrium. In order to avoid phase transitions and near-critical phenomena throughout the injection process the CO 2, which was delivered by road tankers and stored in <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> on site at â¼ - 18 Â°C/ 21 bar, was pre-conditioned at site and pressurised to â¼ 65 bar and heated to â¼ 40 Â°C during regular operation. This injection process design worked exceptionally well. However, such a pre-conditioning and heating of the injected CO 2 to elevated temperature is unrealistic for an industrial sized CO 2 storage setting as the energy need is high and costly and the CO 2 will be delivered by pipeline already at ambient temperature. To study the effects of lower pre-conditioning temperature and effects of potential two-phase flow on the injection process, a âcold injectionâ experiment was carried out between March and July 2013. The injection wellhead temperature was decreased stepwise from 40 Â°C down to 10 Â°C. Below 20 Â°C two-phase flow developed in the surface installations and in the injection well down to the reservoir and a mixture of gaseous and liquid CO 2 has been injected. This two-phase CO 2 injection ran smoothly for eight weeks without any operational issues...|$|R

The methods and approaches presented are illustrated and have been applied using real-life pilot demonstrations based on the drinking-water network in Barcelona, Spain. The proposed approaches and tools cover: - decision-making support for real-time optimal control of water transport networks, explaining how stochastic model predictive control algorithms that take explicit account of uncertainties associated with energy prices and real demand allow the main flow andpressure actuatorsâpumping stations and pressure regulation valvesâand <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> to be operated to meet demand using the most sustainable types of source and with minimum electricity costs; - decision-making support for monitoring water balance and distribution network quality in real time, implementing fault detection anddiagnosis techniques and using information from hundreds of flow,pressure, and water-quality sensors together with hydraulic and quality-parameter-evolution models to detect and locate leaks in the network, possible breaches in water quality, and failures in sensors and/or actuators; - consumer-demand prediction, based on smart metering techniques, producing detailed analyses and forecasts of consumption patterns,providing a customer communications service, and suggesting economic measures intended to promote more efficient use of water at the household level.

The solar thermal energy is transferred to the kitchen by means of a circulating fluid like oil. The transfer of solar heat is a two fold process wherein the energy from the collector is transferred first to an <b>intermediate</b> energy <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> and then the energy is subsequently transferred from the tank to the cooking load. There are three parameters that are controlled in order to maximize the energy transfer from the collector to the load viz. the fluid flow rate from collector to tank, fluid flow rate from tank to load and the diameter of the pipes.

Continuous injection of CO 2 started on June 30 th, 2008, {{and a total of}} 61, 396 t of CO 2 have been injected by September 2012.

The injection is accompanied by a comprehensive operational monitoring program. The program includes continuous measurements of flow rate, fill levels of <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> 1 and 2, outlet pressure and temperature for the injection plant, wellhead pressures (WHP) and casing pressures 1 and 2 for all wells, bottom hole pressure (BHP), bottom hole temperature (BHT) and distributed temperature sensing (DTS) along the injection tubing for the injection well Ktzi 201, BHP for the two observation wells Ktzi 202 (from March 2010 to October 2011) and Ktzi 200 (since October 2011), and above-zone pressure monitoring in shallow observation well P 300. This operational pressureâtemperature monitoring successfully ensured and proved a safe, smooth and reliable injection operation. A vital part of the operational PâT data comes from the downhole PâT measurements, which are recommended for any CO 2 storage site. Without this downhole information, {{it would not have been}} possible to provide the complete picture of CO 2 injection. The recommended downhole installation design of PâT tools distinguishes CO 2 storage from the operational engineering of underground storage of natural gas, where BHP monitoring can be done via WHP recording. The DTS safety monitoring along the injection tubing supported typical operational processes as conditioning of the CO 2 and improvement of injection rate and injection temperature and will be beneficial to any CO 2 storage project.

The application is the design of a single leg of a water distribution network that is fed by one reservoir (the âsourceâ). There are many references for this type of design (The Blue Book). The present work is not intended to be a thorough, comprehensive treatment of the subject matter. It is, however, an attempt to provide a link between the subject of fluid mechanics learned in a typical undergraduate mechanical engineering curriculum, with which the students should already be familiar, and the more-comprehensive coverage of this topic in a book such as The Blue Book.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to get a}} better {{understanding}} of how optimal weight savings of the cylindrical shell plates in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> can be reached using higher strength duplex material. The design criteria will be based on the requirements given by the American Petroleum Institute standards API 650 for welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and API 12 B for bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The expected result is that use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel can reduce the weight of the material needed to build a <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> A comparison between welded and bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will also be included in the work to find which joining method that is preferable. Additionally, an evaluation of the software TANKTM by Intergraph will be performed. MatlabÂ® will be used in order to perform the evaluation to compare the results. The main difference between the standards API 650 and API 12 B is that there are already given standard sizes of bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> API 12 B. Therefore, only <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> up to 1 Â  625 m 3 could be compared. When comparing <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> sizes up to 1 Â  625 m 3 the result is that bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> require a smaller mean thickness of the cylindrical shell than welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and therefore less material and total weight of the shell. If the trend continues also for larger <b>tank</b> sizes, bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will be preferable to reduce the total weight of the <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> By use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> the minimum required thickness can be reduced because of the higher strength of duplex stainless steel. This leads to a smaller mean shell thickness and therefore a reduced weight compared to <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> made of austenitic stainless steel. For most dimensions of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> duplex stainless steel is cheaper than austenitic stainless steel, but for some smaller dimensions, grade 1. 4307 (austenitic) is cheaper than LDX 2101 Â® (duplex).
