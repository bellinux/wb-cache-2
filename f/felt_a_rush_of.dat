2500|$|Since World War II, rumours {{circulated}} of {{a secret}} room in the Rock of Gibraltar. For years, people explored the Rock's cliffs, tunnels, and caves, but to no avail. However, in late 1997, after searching {{for more than two}} years as a team, the Gibraltar Caving Group unearthed a secret complex in close proximity to Lord Airey's Battery at the Upper Ridge of the southern end of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve. The group had evaluated potential locations of the complex, and come to the conclusion that it had to be located high up on the Rock in order to command good views of both the Mediterranean and the Bay of Gibraltar. Their suspicions were raised when members of the group <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> wind in a tunnel they had been exploring. After further exploration, the group broke through a wall into a series of chambers. It was quickly recognised that the secret complex was likely the long-sought-after site of Operation Tracer. The hidden chamber had been dubbed [...] "Stay Behind Cave" [...] by locals years ago, before official details were known.|$|E
60|$|They moved on, {{and after}} a long time had passed Giant found a slit between two rocks. They made an {{examination}} and found one of the rocks loose. They rolled it away and <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> pure, wet air.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her face. Her eyes were bright with unshed tears. He <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> emotion. For a moment he forgot this city, he forgot the race, and all those vague remote voices, in the {{immediate}} humanity of her beauty.|$|E
60|$|Tito, who had roused {{himself from}} his abstraction, and was {{listening}} to the dialogue, <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> new <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> the vague half-formed ideas about Tessa, which had passed through his mind the evening before: if Monna Ghita were really taken out of the way, it would be easier for him to see Tessa again--whenever he wanted to see her.|$|R
6000|$|Allie <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> emotion. Her {{opportunity}} had come. [...] "I am Allie Lee. My mother ran {{off with}} Durade--to California. He used her as a lure to draw men to his gambling-hells--as he uses me now... Two years ago we escaped--started east with a caravan. The Indians attacked us. I crawled under a rock--escaped the massacre. I--" ...|$|R
60|$|It was dusk, and {{the candles}} were lighted before Mr. Tryan knocked at Mrs. Pettifer's door. Her {{messenger}} had brought back {{word that he}} was not at home, and all afternoon Janet had been agitated by the fear that he would not come; but as soon as that anxiety was removed by the knock at the door, she <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> doubt and timidity: she trembled and turned cold.|$|R
60|$|Helen <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> gladness {{that she}} had yielded to Bo's wild importunities to take her West. The spirit which had made Bo incorrigible at home {{probably}} would make her react happily to life out in this free country. Yet Helen, with all her warmth and gratefulness, had to laugh at her sister.|$|E
6000|$|I {{sat down}} with a faint feeling in my heart. It was not that I cared for the money for its own sake; but I thought of Lady Desborough, and I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> coming trouble sweep round me. However, after a moment, I drove back the feeling, and asked, in as cheerful a voice as I could,-- ...|$|E
60|$|The tender unspoken sympathy {{of women}} who loved her proved comforting in that trying hour. With the {{confession}} ruthlessly made the hard compression in Carley's breast subsided, and her eyes cleared of a hateful dimness. When they reached the taxi stand outside the station Carley <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> hot devitalized air from the street. She seemed {{not to be able}} to get air into her lungs.|$|E
60|$|Barely {{had they}} shoved Breck's boat {{out from the}} bank and caught the first rough water, when the waves began to lap aboard. They were small waves, {{but it was an}} earnest of what was to come. Shorty cast back a quizzical glance as he gnawed at his {{inevitable}} plug, and Kit <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> strange <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> warmth at his heart for this man who couldn't swim and who couldn't back out.|$|R
5000|$|The {{play was}} mostly well received. Ben Brantley of The New York Times criticized some script elements, but praised Rickman's acting: [...] "This mélange of feelings, magnificently orchestrated by Mr. Rickman, is arrived at after Leonard has only {{glanced at the}} first couple of pages of a vast manuscript. But ... I <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> {{authentic}} <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> pleasure and the exhilaration of being reminded that in theater, art comes less from landing lines than from finding what lies between them." ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> wild <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> loneliness. She had {{a sudden}} {{realization}} of how dear that gaunt old figure was, with its grizzled face and ready smile. Her breath came quick and quicker, and {{she was at the}} point of bursting into a wild cry to Tewksbury when she heard a strange noise. It came from the barn, a creaking noise. She looked that way and saw in the shadowed side a deeper shadow moving to and fro. A revulsion to astonishment and anger took place in her.|$|R
6000|$|Dan <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> {{tenderness}} in {{his heart}} {{at the sound of}} the kind, humbugging little voice. [...] "No, thank you, Mrs. Pasmer, I couldn't stay, thank you. I--I thank you very much. I--good-bye, Mrs. Pasmer." [...] He wrung her hand, and found his way out of the apartment door, leaving her to clear up the mystery of his flight and his broken words as she could.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> gladness, and he {{clasped her}} hand and clung to it {{as if he were}} not going to let it go again, {{bubbling}} out incoherencies of pleasure at meeting her. [...] "Why, Miss Anderson! You here? What a piece of luck! Of course I couldn't see you against the window--make you out! But something looked familiar--and the way you turned! And when you started toward me! I'm awfully glad! When--where are you--that is--" ...|$|E
6000|$|A huge yellow form shot {{over the}} trail and hit {{the top of the}} slide with a crash. The lasso {{streaked}} out with arrowy swiftness, circled, and snapped viciously close to Old Tom's head. [...] "Kill him! Kill him!" [...] roared Jones. Then the lion leaped, seemingly into the air above me. Instinctively I raised my little automatic rifle. I seemed to hear a million bellowing reports. The tawny body, with its grim, snarling face, blurred in my sight. I heard a roar of sliding stones at my feet. I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> wind. I caught a confused glimpse of a whirling wheel of fur, rolling down the slide.|$|E
6000|$|... "I never pretended," [...] he said, [...] "that I did {{not enjoy}} life, that I was not fond of its pleasures. It was only while my work was {{insecure}} that I made a recluse of myself. You, too," [...] he said, [...] "it is time that you slackened a little. Come, take an evening off and we will dine somewhere {{and go to the}} theatre." [...] How delightful it sounded. She <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> warm <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> pleasure at the thought. They would want her badly at Stepney, but [...] "This evening?" [...] she asked.|$|R
60|$|Then {{followed}} confusion for me. The {{pound of}} hoofs, the snorts, a screaming neigh that was frightful, the mad stampede of the mustangs with a whirling cloud of dust, bewildered and frightened {{me so that}} I lost sight of Jones. Danger threatened and passed me almost before I was aware of it. Out of the dust a mass of tossing manes, foam-flecked black horses, wild eyes and lifting hoofs rushed at me. Satan, with a presence of mind that shamed mine, leaped back and hugged the wall. My eyes were blinded by dust; the smell of dust choked me. I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> wind and <b>a</b> mustang grazed my stirrup. Then they had passed, {{on the wings of}} the dust-laden breeze.|$|R
5000|$|Solzhenitsyn {{was arrested}} soon afterwards, in early February, {{three weeks after}} the {{offensive}} had started. His arrest was partly due to his critique of the treatment of civilians. In the poem he recalls the pillages, rapes and murders committed by the Soviet troops taking their revenge on German civilians, the events which later resulted {{in the first part of}} the German exodus from Eastern Europe, Solzhenitsyn composed the poem—about twelve thousand lines and over fifty pages long—while he was serving a sentence of hard labor in Gulag camps. He is rumored to have written a few lines of the poem each day on a bar of soap and memorized them while using it. He also wrote about how composing this poem helped him to survive his imprisonment: [...] "I needed a clear head, because for two years I had been writing a poem—a most rewarding poem that helped me not to notice what was being done to my body. Sometimes, while standing in a column of dejected prisoners, amidst the shouts of guards with machine guns, I <b>felt</b> such <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> rhymes and images that I seemed to be wafted overhead [...] [...] [...] At such moments I was both free and happy [...] [...] [...] Some prisoners tried to escape by smashing a car through the barbed wire. For me there was no barbed wire. The head count of prisoners remained unchanged, but I was actually away on a distant flight." ...|$|R
60|$|Still he squatted on his heels, rubbing {{dirt from}} gold and debating in just what manner he should rise up. He might rise {{up with a}} rush and claw {{his way out of}} the hole to meet {{whatever}} threatened on the even footing above ground. Or he might rise up slowly and carelessly, and feign casually to discover the thing that breathed at his back. His instinct and every fighting fibre of his body favored the mad, clawing rush to the surface. His intellect, and the craft thereof, favored the slow and cautious meeting with the thing that menaced and which he could not see. And while he debated, a loud, crashing noise burst on his ear. At the same instant he received a stunning blow on the left side of the back, and from the point of impact <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> flame through his flesh. He sprang up in the air, but halfway to his feet collapsed. His body crumpled in like a leaf withered in sudden heat, and he came down, his chest across his pan of gold, his face in the dirt and rock, his legs tangled and twisted because of the restricted space at the bottom of the hole. His legs twitched convulsively several times. His body was shaken as with a mighty ague. There was a slow expansion of the lungs, accompanied by a deep sigh. Then the air was slowly, very slowly, exhaled, and his body as slowly flattened itself down into inertness.|$|E
60|$|We {{all stood}} awed at {{the beauty of}} the figure which, save for the face cloth, now lay {{completely}} nude before us. Mr. Trelawny bent over, and with hands that trembled slightly, raised this linen cloth which was of the same fineness as the robe. As he stood back and the whole glorious beauty of the Queen was revealed, I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> shame sweep over me. It was not right that we should be there, gazing with irreverent eyes on such unclad beauty: it was indecent; it was almost sacrilegious! And yet the white wonder of that beautiful form was something to dream of. It was not like death at all; it was like a statue carven in ivory by the hand of a Praxiteles. There was nothing of that horrible shrinkage which death seems to effect in a moment. There was none of the wrinkled toughness which seems to be a leading characteristic of most mummies. There was not the shrunken attenuation of a body dried in the sand, as I had seen before in museums. All the pores of the body seemed to have been preserved in some wonderful way. The flesh was full and round, as in a living person; and the skin was as smooth as satin. The colour seemed extraordinary. It was like ivory, new ivory; except where the right arm, with shattered, bloodstained wrist and missing hand had lain bare to exposure in the sarcophagus for so many tens of centuries.|$|E
6000|$|About {{this time}} an {{incident}} happened {{which seemed to}} open a possibility of some fellowship with his neighbours. One day, taking {{a pair of shoes}} to be mended, he saw the cobbler's wife seated by the fire, suffering from the terrible symptoms of heart-disease and dropsy, which he had witnessed as the precursors of his mother's death. He <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> pity at the mingled sight and remembrance, and, recalling the relief his mother had found from a simple preparation of foxglove, he promised Sally Oates to bring her something that would ease her, since the doctor did her no good. In this office of charity, Silas felt, {{for the first time since}} he had come to Raveloe, a sense of unity between his past and present life, which might have been the beginning of his rescue from the insect-like existence into which his nature had shrunk. But Sally Oates's disease had raised her into a personage of much interest and importance among the neighbours, and the fact of her having found relief from drinking Silas Marner's [...] "stuff" [...] became a matter of general discourse. When Doctor Kimble gave physic, it was natural that it should have an effect; but when a weaver, who came from nobody knew where, worked wonders with a bottle of brown waters, the occult character of the process was evident. Such a sort of thing had not been known since the Wise Woman at Tarley died; and she had charms as well as [...] "stuff": everybody went to her when their children had fits. Silas Marner must be a person of the same sort, for how did he know what would bring back Sally Oates's breath, if he didn't know a fine sight more than that? The Wise Woman had words that she muttered to herself, so that you couldn't hear what they were, and if she tied a bit of red thread round the child's toe the while, it would keep off the water in the head. There were women in Raveloe, at that present time, who had worn one of the Wise Woman's little bags round their necks, and, in consequence, had never had an idiot child, as Ann Coulter had. Silas Marner could very likely do as much, and more; and now it was all clear how he should have come from unknown parts, and be so [...] "comical-looking". But Sally Oates must mind and not tell the doctor, for he would be sure to set his face against Marner: he was always angry about the Wise Woman, and used to threaten those who went to her that they should have none of his help any more.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{suddenly}} and deeply moved with altogether a new feeling towards her--one of responsibility. She {{was alone in}} the world, and it was his father's hand which had rendered her so. How empty and barren had been his conception of the burden which that deed had laid upon him! Like a flash he seemed to see the whole situation in a new light. If, indeed, she had drifted into ruin, the sin lay at his door. He should have found her a mother; it should have been his care to have watched her continually, and to have assured himself that she was contented and happy. In those few moments the whole situation seemed to change, and he even <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> hot flush of shame at his own coldness towards her. He forgot the dancer, the woman of strange fascinations, the idol of the jeunesse dorée of West London clubdom, and he remembered only {{the fact that she was}} a lonely orphan with a most womanly light in her soft, dark eyes, and that he had failed in his duty towards her. Paul was essentially a [...] "manly" [...] man, self-contained, and with all his feelings very much at his control; but at that moment he <b>felt</b> something like <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> tenderness towards this strange, dark-eyed girl who lay coiled up at his feet. Involuntarily he stretched out his hand and laid it, with an almost caressing gesture, upon her hair.|$|R

The throw {{was good enough to}} win the competition by more than 5 in.|$|R
