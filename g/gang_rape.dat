After finishing The Songlines in August 1986, Chatwin went to Switzerland, where he collapsed on the street. At a clinic there, he was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Chatwin provided different reasons to his doctors as to how he might have contracted HIV, including from a <b>gang</b> <b>rape</b> in Dahomey or possibly from Sam Wagstaff, the patron and lover of Robert Mapplethorpe.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{presents}} evidence that Deng {{was convicted of}} prostitution two years ago. Deng denies the charge and says she had been gang-raped by the soldiers who killed her husband. Deng's credibility weakens further when the defense presents a surprise witness, Daniel Achok, who testifies that he had advised her to fabricate the <b>gang</b> <b>rape</b> on her application for political asylum. The jury reached verdicts {{on two of the}} three charges, finding DiStasio guilty of unlawful imprisonment and not guilty of assault but deadlocks on the rape charge, and Benson says that he will likely serve a year in prison.|$|E

After other journalists investigated the article's claims and found significant discrepancies, Rolling Stone issued multiple apologies for the story. Further investigation concluded that Jackie had fabricated the incident.

Later, Jackie herself said that she believed her story at the time.|$|E

Taso is charged with the deaths of two policemen in the JNA attack on the Dalj police station, nine prisoners of war captured in Dalj, eleven captured in Vukovar, and 90 non-Serb civilians. In May 2012, Croatian authorities in Osijek started a trial of two Croatian Serbs charged with war crimes against Croatian civilians, including the <b>gang</b> <b>rape</b> of a 20-year-old woman and forcing her parents and siblings to watch the rape. Both of them were convicted in September 2013 and sentenced to 12 years in prison.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the <b>gang</b> <b>rape</b> and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

40|$|Through an {{analysis}} of two highly mediatised recent events in Australia this article seeks to interrogate the intersections of gender, ethnicity and culture {{in the construction of}} Australian national identity. A series of <b>gang</b> <b>rapes</b> in the early 2000 s attracted widespread public outrage and the harshest ever condemnation of acts of sexual violence in Australian history. Linked to these events, in December 2005 a series of riots at the Sydney beachside suburb of Cronulla led to further questioning of ethnic relations and the state of Australian multiculturalism within media and political discourses. While many of the responses to the <b>gang</b> <b>rapes</b> and the Cronulla riots have drawn on the language of ‘women’s rights’, {{a closer look at the}} discourses suggests a different story. Responses to the <b>gang</b> <b>rapes</b> have often characterised the attacks as being against the Australian community, rather than against individual women. It is also interesting to contrast the outrage surrounding the <b>gang</b> <b>rapes</b> with the general silence regarding the increased racist violence committed against Muslim women in recent times. Furthermore, the linking of the <b>gang</b> <b>rapes</b> with a particular religious/ethnic community can be contrasted with the discourses on the alleged <b>gang</b> <b>rapes</b> involving Australian sporting teams, such as the Bulldogs and more recently the Wests Tigers. Finally the manner in which the events of Cronulla have been recast and linked back to the ‘threat’ posed by young Muslim/Lebanese/Middle Eastern men to Australian women suggests that ethnicity and gender both play an important and mutually reinforcing role in the construction of Australian national identity...|$|R

25|$|Some {{forms of}} sexual violence, such as <b>gang</b> <b>rape,</b> are {{predominantly}} committed by young men. Sexual aggression {{is often a}} defining characteristic of manhood in the group and is {{significantly related to the}} wish to be held in high esteem. Sexually aggressive behavior among young men has been linked with gang membership and having delinquent peers. Research also suggests that men with sexually aggressive peers are also much more likely to report coercive or enforced intercourse outside the gang context than men lacking sexually aggressive peers. <b>Gang</b> <b>rape</b> is often viewed by the men involved, and sometimes by others too, as legitimate, in that it is seen to discourage or punish perceived immoral behavior among women, such as wearing short skirts or frequenting bars.|$|E
