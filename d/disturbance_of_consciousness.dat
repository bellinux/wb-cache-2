25|$|The {{presentation}} of TTP is variable. The initial symptoms, which force {{the patient to}} medical care, are often the consequence of lower platelet counts like purpura (present in 90% of patients), ecchymosis and hematoma.

40|$|Introduction. Acute viral {{encephalitis}} is {{an infectious}} disease, which {{is characterized by}} sudden onset, serious clinical picture and with an uncertain outcome. <b>Disturbances</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> are common {{in the course of}} acute viral encephalitis. Consciousness is the highest form of psychic life and consciousness disturbances may include quantitative (somnolentia, sopor, coma) and qualitative symptoms (convulsions, twilight state). Material and methods. We investigated 63 patients with acute viral encephalitis. The youngest patient was 15, and the oldest one 69 years of age. We examined the state <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> in all patients. Results Of all examined patients, 54 (85. 72 %) patients had <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> 9 (14. 25 %) patients had no consciousness disturbances, 11 (17. 46 %) patients had sopor and 24 (38. 09 %) patients were in coma. The highest percentage of lethal outcomes was recorded in coma patients (12. 5 %). The longer the duration <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> <b>disturbances,</b> the higher the mortality among these patients. Discussion Subjective and objective factors cause different grades and duration <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The highest percentage of patients who recovered without consequences was established in the group of patients (81. 82 %) with somnolence. The highest percentage of patients who recovered with consequences (20. 8 %) and patients (12. 5 %) with lethal outcome was recorded in the group of patients in coma. These findings are in correlation with literature data. ...|$|R

30|$|Citrin {{deficiency}} is an autosomal disorder, {{and symptoms}} present during the childhood of most patients.

The symptoms of CTLN 2 are often provoked by triggers such as alcohol, sugar intake, and surgery [1].

30|$|While no circumscript {{brain area}} is {{responsible}} for consciousness, the neurotopical localization {{can be found in}} the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS). Whenever this system is functionally impaired bilaterally, one must anticipate <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> ultimately attaining the degree of coma. The ARAS connects the thalamic and subthalamic nuclei with the reticular intermediary grey substance of the spinal cord. Here, the etiology and exact localization of the functional neuronal disturbance in the ARAS are not especially important: reversible metabolic CNS disease in the context of metabolic derangement is just as well possible as structural lesions along the thalamic loop structures.|$|R

50|$|Harry Stack Sullivan, {{the pioneer}} of {{interpersonal}} psychoanalysis, defined sublimation as the unwitting substitution of a partial satisfaction with social {{approval for the}} pursuit of a direct satisfaction which would be contrary to one's ideals or to the judgment of social censors and other important people who surround one. The substitution might not be quite what we want, but {{it is the only way}} that we can get part of our satisfaction and feel secure, too. Sullivan documented that all sublimatory things are more complicated than the direct satisfaction of the needs to which they apply. They entail no <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> no stopping to think why they must be done or what the expense connected with direct satisfaction would be. In successful sublimation, Sullivan observed extraordinarily efficient handling of a conflict between the need for a satisfaction and the need for security without perturbation of awareness.|$|E
5000|$|According to a {{doctoral}} thesis in 1991, van Gogh {{used in his}} impasto technique lead pigments in an abusive and careless way, and some months later he suffered the key symptoms of lead poisoning (anemia, stomatitis, abdominal pain, signs of radial neuropathy, etc.) and other characteristics of saturnine encephalopathy in Arles with states of delirium and probable epileptic crises, which were diagnosed in life. Regardless of the premorbid personality of Vincent (impulsive and emotionally unstable), these crises with <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> or psychotic symptoms coincided with his prolific artistic activity, and never in the North; as the Dutch painter says in a letter (Letter 607) [...] Other painters exposed to toxic colors suffered lead poisoning. However, this thesis could be confirmed only by a forensic examination of the bones of Van Gogh, as Caravaggio's remains were. Recent chemical research on toxic lead pigments used recklessly by van Gogh reinforces the diagnosis of saturnism.|$|E

Hypertensive encephalopathy occurs in eclampsia, acute nephritis and crises in essential hypertension. Symptoms of hypertensive encephalopathy include headache, restlessness, nausea, <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> seizures, bleeding in the retina, and papilledema.

40|$|Delirium is {{a common}} neuropsychiatric syn-drome with a {{prevalence}} of 10 % to 20 % among hospi-talized patients in medical and surgical wards(1).

30|$|Psychogenic <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> {{are usually}} dissociative {{in nature and}} only rarely {{factitious}} disease. They can mimic any coma-like situation and often also present with focal neurological signs such as speech arrest or sensory-motor hemisyndromes. The verification of the psychogenic nature of these signs {{is very difficult to}} achieve, and often evolves over time, after all neurophysiological tests have failed to detect any functional disturbance. Imaging tests invariably demonstrate normal findings or may detect older premorbid conditions that are irrelevant to the presented condition <b>of</b> disturbed <b>consciousness.</b> These patients often demonstrate marked fluctuations of the neurological findings, especially dependent on the attention of the examiner, and often one finds a psychiatric history or a special emotional burden.

40|$|PurposeThe {{diagnostic}} classification <b>of</b> disorders <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> {{is often}} challenging, particularly {{the distinction between}} epileptic and non-epileptic seizures. The aim {{of the study was}} to examine serum lactate as a diagnostic marker of transient loss <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> MethodSerum lactate levels in blood samples drawn within 2 h of the event were compared retrospectively between patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (n = 195) and patients with other seizures (syncopes [n = 52], psychogenic non-epileptic seizures [n = 17], and complex focal seizures [n = 37]), respectively. ResultsSerum lactate in patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures was significantly (p < 0. 001, Mann–Whitney-U test) increased in comparison to other forms of seizure incidences. The area under the ROC-curve was 0. 94 (95 % CI 0. 91 – 0. 96). For a cut-off concentration of 2. 45 mmol/l, the sensitivity was 0. 88 and the specificity 0. 87.
