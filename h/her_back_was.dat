After making Mikels' The Doll Squad in 1973, Satana was shot by a former lover. She later found employment in a hospital, a position she kept for four years. She had studied nursing at Firmin Desloge Hospital. She was then briefly employed as a dispatcher for the Los Angeles Police Department. In 1981, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>was</b> broken in a car accident. She {{spent the next two}} years in and out of hospitals, having two major operations and approximately fifteen others.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>was</b> still painful, more so {{when she}} ran shorter distances, so {{she decided to go}} for the 800 metres at the 1969 European Athletics Championships in Athens that September. Still inexperienced at the longer event and ranked only 8th in Europe on her {{performances}} that season, she was not strongly fancied for 800 m gold. She won her heat comfortably (2:04.2) and then, two days later, produced a superb performance in the final on 18 September sprinting away from her rivals on the final bend and winning by eight metres in a personal best time of 2:01.4, a new championship record. She was the first British woman to win this European title, the second being Lynsey Sharp in 2012.|$|E
25|$|In Epilogue, {{optional}} downloadable content (DLC), it {{is shown}} that the Prince and Elika survive, and retreat to an underground palace. Elika leaves the Prince. However, they both end up battling Elika's father once again. They escape, and attempt to leave the palace alive. While on their way, Elika shows her frustration with the Prince multiple times, believing bringing <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>was</b> not {{worth the price of}} the evil it unleashed. The Prince counters that by freeing her, they 'stand a chance' against Ahriman. In a final battle against Elika's father, the Prince defeats him by impaling him on spikes, a visual reference to the original Prince of Persia game. In the end, Elika leaves the Prince to search for her people, and the Prince is left alone with a bloodthirsty Ahriman seeking revenge.|$|E

2500|$|Lauren Barwick {{was born}} on 12 September 1977 in Langley, British Columbia. She worked at a place that {{supplied}} horses to movie shoots. She now lives in Reddick, Florida. She is classified as Grade II which means she is paralysed from the waist down. Before she was paraplegic, she also enjoyed cross country running and skiing. She says she dreamed of working with horses in the movies. Barwick became paralysed {{as a result of}} a ranch accident. [...] In 2000, a 75kg hay stack fell on her as she worked in the barn.

2500|$|.....the virgin {{knelt down}} with great veneration in an {{attitude}} of prayer, and <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>was</b> turned to the manger.... And while she was standing thus in prayer, I saw the child in her womb move and suddenly in a moment {{she gave birth to}} her son, from whom radiated such an ineffable light and splendour, that the sun was not comparable to it, nor did the candle that St. Joseph had put there, give any light at all, the divine light totally annihilating the material light of the candle.... I saw the glorious infant lying on the ground naked and shining. His body was pure from any kind of soil and impurity. Then I heard also the singing of the angels, which was of miraculous sweetness and great beauty... After this the Virgin kneels to pray to her child, to be joined by Saint Joseph, and this (technically known as the [...] "Adoration of Christ" [...] or [...] "of the Child") becomes one of the commonest depictions in the 15th century, largely replacing the reclining Virgin in the West. Versions of this depiction occur as early as 1300, well before Bridget's vision, and have a Franciscan origin.|$|E
2500|$|The twelfth {{flotilla}} {{commanded by}} Captain Stirling on the destroyer leader Faulknor was following behind the First Battle Squadron. This had fallen behind the main fleet because damage to Marlborough had reduced her speed, so the destroyers were now some 10 miles behind Jellicoe. The flotilla had thirteen 'M' class destroyers plus Faulknor and another destroyer leader, Marksman. At 0143 Obedient sighted ships steering ESE in the slowly lightening dawn. The unidentified ships gave the incorrect challenge signal and an attack was begun in near ideal conditions on German dreadnought and pre-dreadnought battleships. The pre-dreadnought Pommern {{was struck by}} a torpedo. One of Obedient's officers reported: [...] "Right amidship in the Pommern appeared a dull red ball of fire. It spread fore and aft and flared up the masts in big red tongues of flame, uniting in a black cloud of smoke and sparks. Then one saw the ends of the ship come up as though <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>was</b> broken before the mist shut her out of view". Six destroyers fired seventeen torpedoes [...] at the German ships, the other destroyers being driven away by gunfire. Stirling attempted to report the engagement, making three reports, but none was received by Jellicoe, either because of damage to his radio aerials or because of German jamming. Had the signals been received, it would still have been possible for Jellicoe to turn his fleet and intercept the German ships before they reached the safety of their own minefields at 0330.|$|E
