25|$|The {{purpose of}} the fourteen-day time limit {{is to ensure that}} {{creditors}} have sufficient opportunity to peruse the statement of affairs and {{to decide whether or not}} to oppose the application. The legislature’s objective in imposing the thirty-day limit was to ensure that debtors would not be able to give long notice, months beforehand, and in that way to keep creditors from levying execution and in the meantime dissipate all their assets. Failure to adhere strictly to the third-day time period has mostly been taken to be fatal to the application. In Ex parte Harmse, the court held that the failure is a <b>formal</b> <b>defect</b> or irregularity, as envisaged by section 157(1), and therefore does not invalidate the application unless it has caused a substantial injustice which cannot be remedied by a court order.|$|E

60|$|But {{are we to}} {{say that}} nothing is {{knowledge}} except what is validly deduced from true premisses? Obviously we cannot say this. Such a definition is at once too wide and too narrow. In the first place, it is too wide, {{because it is not}} enough that our premisses should be true, they must also be known. The man who believes that Mr. Balfour was the late Prime Minister may proceed to draw valid deductions from the true premiss that the late Prime Minister's name began with a B, but he cannot be said to know the conclusions reached by these deductions. Thus we shall have to amend our definition by saying that knowledge is what is validly deduced from known premisses. This, however, is a circular definition: it assumes that we already know what is meant by 'known premisses'. It can, therefore, at best define one sort of knowledge, the sort we call derivative, as opposed to intuitive knowledge. We may say: 'Derivative knowledge is what is validly deduced from premisses known intuitively'. In this statement there is no <b>formal</b> <b>defect,</b> but it leaves the definition of intuitive knowledge still to seek.|$|E

Furthermore, according to Russell, a predicate of a predicate can be a predicate of the original subject, which blurs the distinction between names and predicates with disastrous consequences; for example, a class with only one member is erroneously identified with that one member, making impossible to have a correct theory of the number one.|$|R

40|$|Italian {{administrative}} {{law has been}} undergoing an evolution aimed at progressively eliminating the relevance that merely <b>formal</b> <b>defects</b> have traditionally held, an evolution which has nonetheless struggled to gain prominence {{in the case of}} the procedures for obtaining public commissions. In this regard, the aim of safeguarding the fundamental right to equality of treatment has been pursued by means of merely formal rules, whose strict compliance has always been regarded as indispensable for the accomplishment of the afore mentioned aim. The necessity of going beyond the former legal set-up in order to fully guarantee the principle of “favor partecipationis” has gained prominence with some difficulty and solely recently. This doctoral thesis, by analyzing the field of exclusions from public tenders, aims to illustrate how the evolution of national tender law has been taking place at the material level, and to show to what extent the phenomenon of the so-called hybridization of the Italian legal system under the influence of European law has actually affected this very evolution itself...|$|R
40|$|At {{the start}} of the Seven Years War in 1756, there {{occurred}} an unexpected increase in the demand by impressed soldiers and sailors for habeas corpus. This increased usage occurred {{in spite of the fact}} that habeas corpus was a deficient mechanism of judicial review: the scope of review was limited to <b>formal</b> <b>defects</b> appearing on the face of the return; it was unclear whether there was jurisdiction to issue the writ during the extensive times that the court was out of term; and there was no power to issue process of contempt in vacation for disobedience of the writ. Notwithstanding these defects (and the rejection by the House of Lords in 1758 of a habeas corpus bill drafted in order to remedy those faults) the custom of using habeas corpus as an anti-impressment remedy flourished within the navy (and, during the short periods of statutory military conscription, within the army); in the late eighteenth century it was impressed sailors who made up the largest constituency using the writ.

It is precisely this comprehension impetus that drove Italian writer and first-generation survivor Primo Levi to write his award-winning books beginning with the very early Se questa e un uomo (If This is a Man, 1947) and continuing with La Tregua (The Truce, 1963), Storie naturali (Natural Histories, 1966), Viz io di forma (<b>Formal</b> <b>Defect,</b> 1971) and the much-appreciated II sistema periodico (The Periodic Table, 1975). 1 The aspect that distinguishes The Periodic Table from the bther works is the summative and intrinsically humanist intent of combining in narrative form the author's technical skills as a chemist with his experience as a camp inmate and Holocaust survivor...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{written for}} Berkeley’s {{symposium}} on the 300 th birthday of the Statute of Anne, I explore {{the history of}} the common law public performance right in dramatic works. Eaton Drone dubbed the dramatic public performance right “playright” in his 1879 treatise, arguing that just as “copyright” conferred a right to make and sell copies, “playright” conferred a right to perform or “play” a script. I examine case law and customary theatrical practice in England, and find no trace of a common law play right before 1833, when Parliament established a statutory public performance right for plays. Similarly, in the United States, the first claims of a common law right to control public performances appeared only after Congress enacted a statutory dramatic public performance right in 1856. Courts and lawyers developed a common law literary property right to control public performances in order to permit the proprietors of dramatic works to recover even though there were <b>formal</b> <b>defects</b> in their U. S. copyright registrations. Eaton Drone then used those cases as a basis for embroidering a full-blown common law literary property right purportedly based in natural law. Courts adopted Drone’s version of common law play right and followed it for the next thirty years. (The breadth of the common law claim, however, made little difference to actual playwrights, who were deemed to have assigned their common law rights to the producers of their plays.) This history suggests that the rights that we perceive as inherent or natural are fundamentally contingent on what rights already have names and a path to enforcement...|$|R
5000|$|In 1768 Aston was {{a member}} of the court presided over by Lord Mansfield, which {{unanimously}} decided that the writ of outlawry issued against John Wilkes upon his conviction for publishing two seditious libels in No. 45 of the 'North Briton' and in the 'Essay on Woman', was bad by reason of two <b>formal</b> <b>defects.</b> Wilkes, who had kept out of the country until the writ was issued, voluntarily surrendered himself to the sheriff of Middlesex before the execution of it, and then appeared before the court upon a writ of error, claiming to have the writ of outlawry declared invalid upon certain technical grounds. The judges disallowed all the objections urged by the counsel for Wilkes, but the result of a careful examination of precedents conducted by the junior members of the court (Yates, Aston, and Willes) was to show that in the days when the writ of outlawry (capias utlagatum) was in common use 'a series of judgments required that … after the words [...] "at my county court" [...] should be added the name of the county, and after the word [...] "held" [...] should be added [...] "for the county of —" [...] (naming it).' The writ being faulty in these respects, the court held that it was invalid. A decision based upon a ground so purely technical, overlooked by the counsel for the applicant, and only discovered by the judges after careful research, excited in the minds of those hostile to Wilkes suspicions of corrupt motives, and a report was circulated to the effect that the judges, or at any rate Willes and Aston, had been bribed by a gift of lottery tickets, that Aston had been seen selling them on 'Change, and had remarked that he had as good a right to sell his tickets as his brother Willes.|$|R

Particular attention {{is given to}} how specific {{issues such as the}} adoption of computerized administrative documents and/or, more generally, the adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for administrative activities may affect the validity of computerized administrative documents by the Administration Judge. This study briefly examines the complex and multifaceted legal and regulatory framework concerning administrative procedures and digital administration, Law no. 241 / 1990 as amended in the following years, the Code of Digital Administration (Law Decree no. 82 / 2005) and the recently introduced legal provisions which have considerably encouraged the long-awaited creation of a “Digital Italy” (Law Decree no. 5 / 2012; Law Decree no. 83 / 2012 and Law Decree no. 179 / 2012). This paper analyzes the fundamental models for the implementation of administrative actions (ex parte and ex officio applications) and the specific features of their different steps (start of procedure, taking of evidence, participation of an individual to the electronic procedure, decision-making stage) in light of the use of information technologies. Particular attention is paid to the decision-making stage of an electronic proceeding, also to the purpose of investigating defects and jurisdictional validity of an electronic proceeding. In this respect the two methods for using the ICT were briefly examined, the one whereby the ICT role concerns the many operations and formalities aimed at the adoption of the final document, subject to the officer’s will to accept the administrative decision, and the one whereby the final document is adopted by means of a software program. The limits of the possibility to elaborate the content of administrative documents are also examined. Illegality aspects of electronic administrative proceedings and pathologies of automated administrative documents are specially investigated. Special attention is paid to <b>formal</b> <b>defects</b> and to those defects concerning the signature of electronic administrative documents: signature of an electronic document printed on paper; lack and disavowal of a signature. This research also examines the possibility to apply traditional legal defects (lack of jurisdiction, abuse of power, infringement of the law) to the specific area of computerized administrative documents...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA new {{general theory}} of defects in {{continuous}} media is introduced. The general mechanisms of generation and healing of defects are established. The kinematic description of continuum media with defects is presented. The definition of defects of different levels is given, and the classification of continuous media with defects is introduced. The hierarchic structure {{of the theory of}} defects is established and discussed. It is shown that all the known types of defects are naturally included in the presented classification of defects. A new broad class of defects of new types is established and interpreted. It is shown that the existence of new classes of defects is directly connected with some known theoretical and experimental data on the possibility of generation of such defects as dislocations and disclinations. In particular, it is shown that the generation of dislocations is necessarily connected with the existence of disclinations. The <b>formal</b> class of <b>defects</b> being a source of disclinations is specified. A formal generalization of classification of defects is developed to include the defects of arbitrary finite level.
