50|$|When {{it comes}} to animal and human food, type A trichothecenes (e.g. T-2 <b>toxin,</b> HT-2 <b>toxin,</b> <b>diacetoxyscirpenol)</b> are of special {{interest}} {{because they are more}} toxic than the other foodborne trichothecenes i.e. type B group (e.g. deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, 3- and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol). However, deoxynivalenol is of concern as it is the most prevalent trichothecene in Europe. The major effects of trichothecenes - related to their concentration in the commodity - are reduced feed uptake, vomiting and immuno-suppression.A relatively few countries, primarily in the European Union, have recommended maximum limits for these mycotoxins in food and animal feed. However, trichothecenes are often tested for elsewhere, in order to prevent them from entering the food chain and to prevent losses in animal production.|$|R

Aflatoxin at concentrations above 800 ppb resulted in decreased growth and feed efficiency after 4 weeks.

The mycotoxins were incubated with intact rumen fluid or fractions of rumen protozoa and bacteria from sheep and cattle in {{the presence or absence}} of milled feed. Rumen fluid had no effect on aflatoxin B 1 and deoxynivalenol. The remaining four mycotoxins were all metabolized, and protozoa were more active than bacteria. Metabolism of ochratoxin A, zearalenone, and diacetoxyscirpenol was moderately or slightly inhibited by addition of milled feed in vitro. The capacity of rumen fluid to degrade ochratoxin A decreased after feeding, but this activity was gradually restored by the next feeding time. Ochratoxin A was cleaved to ochratoxin alpha and phenylalanine; zearalenone was reduced to alpha-zearalenol and to a lesser degree to beta-zearalenol; diacetoxyscirpenol and T- 2 toxin were deacetylated to monoacetoxyscirpenol and HT- 2 toxin, respectively. Feeding of 5 ppm (5 mg/kg) of ochratoxin A to sheep revealed 14 ppb (14 ng/ml) of ochratoxin A and ochratoxin alpha in rumen fluid after 1 h, but neither was detected in the blood.

Antibodies against HT- 2 toxin and T- 2 4 Ac were obtained from rabbits 5 to 10 weeks after immunizing the animals with CMO-HT- 2 -BSA and CMO-T- 2 4 Ac-BSA conjugates. Immunization with CMO-T- 2 4 ol-BSA resulted in no antibody against T- 2 4 ol.

Sweet pepper was extracted with ethyl acetate/formic acid (99 : 1, v/v). After splitting up the extract, two-thirds of the extract was cleaned up using an aminopropyl column followed by an octadecyl column. The remaining part was cleaned up using a strong anion-exchange column. After recombination of both cleaned parts of the sample extract, the combined solvents were evaporated and the residue was dissolved in mobile phase; 20 mu L was injected into the chromatographic system, so only one run was used to separate and detect the mycotoxins in positive electrospray ionization using selected reaction monitoring. The samples were analyzed with a Micromass Quattro Micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase consisted of variable mixtures of water and methanol, 1 % acetic acid and 5 mM ammonium acetate. The limits of detection of the multi-mycotoxin method varied from 0. 32 mu g. kg(- 1) to 42. 48 mu g. kg(- 1). The multi-mycotoxin liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method fulfilled the method performance criteria required by the Commission Regulation (EC) No 401 / 2006.
