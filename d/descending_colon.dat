The alimentary tract in the abdomen consists of the lower esophagus, the stomach, the duodenum, the jejunum, ileum, the cecum and the appendix, the ascending, transverse and <b>descending</b> <b>colons,</b> the sigmoid colon and the rectum.

25|$|The {{parts of}} the colon are either {{intraperitoneal}} or behind it in the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal organs in general {{do not have a}} complete covering of peritoneum, so they are fixed in location. Intraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. Of the colon, the ascending colon, <b>descending</b> <b>colon</b> and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, transverse colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal. This is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.|$|E
25|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} {{from the}} ascending colon and proximal {{two-thirds of the}} transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. The lymph from the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the <b>descending</b> <b>colon,</b> the sigmoid colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph nodes. The lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain to the internal iliac nodes. The anal canal below the pectinate line drains into the superficial inguinal nodes. The pectinate line only roughly marks this transition.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the chyme has reached this tube, most {{nutrients}} and 90% of the water have been absorbed by the body. At this point some electrolytes like sodium, magnesium, and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of ingested food (e.g., {{a large part of}} ingested amylose, starch which has been shielded from digestion heretofore, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). As the chyme moves through the large intestine, most of the remaining water is removed, while the chyme is mixed with mucus and bacteria (known as gut flora), and becomes feces. The ascending colon receives fecal material as a liquid. The muscles of the colon then move the watery waste material forward and slowly absorb all the excess water, causing the stools to gradually solidify as they move along into the <b>descending</b> <b>colon.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{primitive}} gut {{is suspended}} from the posterior abdominal wall by the dorsal mesentery. The gastrointestinal tract and associated dorsal mesentery are subdivided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut regions based on the respective blood supply. The foregut is supplied by the celiac trunk, the midgut is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and the hindgut is supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). This division is established by the fourth week of development. After this, the midgut undergoes a period of rapid elongation, forcing it to herniate through the navel. During herniation, the midgut rotates 90° anti-clockwise around the axis of the SMA and forms the midgut loop. The cranial portion of the loop moves {{to the right and}} the caudal portion of the loop moves toward the left. This rotation occurs at about the eighth week of development. The cranial portion of the loop will develop into the jejunum, while most of the ileum and the caudal part of the loop eventually form the terminal portion of the ileum, the ascending colon and the initial two-thirds of the transverse colon. As the foetus grows larger, the mid-gut loop is drawn back through the umbilicus and undergoes a further 180° rotation, completing a total of 270° rotation. At this point, about 10 weeks, the caecum lies close to the liver. From here it moves in a cranial to caudal direction to eventually lie in the lower right portion of the abdominal cavity. This process brings the ascending colon to lie vertically in the lateral right portion of the abdominal cavity apposed to the posterior abdominal wall. The <b>descending</b> <b>colon</b> occupies a similar position on the left side.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} histopathologically the radioprotective {{effect of}} L-carnitine on the colonic mucosa in rats undergoing abdominopelvic irradiation. METHODS: Thirty-two rats {{were randomly assigned}} to four experimental groups: intraperitoneal administration of normal saline (group 1) or L-carnitine (300 mL/kg; group 2), followed in groups 3 and 4, respectively, by one dose of abdominopelvic radiation (20 Gy) 30 min later. Rats were sacrificed 5 days after radiation, and their <b>descending</b> <b>colons</b> were resected for histopathological evaluation of the presence and severity of damage. RESULTS: Average damage scores did not differ significantly between groups 1 and 2 (0. 13 ± 0. 35 and 0. 25 ± 0. 46, respectively); the group 3 score was highest (10. 25 ± 0. 71), and the group 4 score (3. 63 ± 1. 41) was significantly lower than that of group 3 (both p = 0. 0001). Pre-radiation L-carnitine administration significantly reduced mucosal thinning, crypt distortion, reactive atypia, inflammation, cryptitis, and reactive lymph-node hyperplasia (all p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: L-carnitine had a radioprotective effect on rat colonic mucosa. L-carnitine use should be explored for patients with gastrointestinal cancer, who have reduced serum L-carnitine levels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{subpopulation}} of the pig inferior mesenteric ganglia (IMG) neurons projecting to {{the colon}} exhibit calbindin-like immunoreactivity. It {{is not known}} {{if there are any}} changes in the chemical coding patterns of these neurons during porcine proliferative enteropathy (PE). To answer this question, juvenile Large White Polish pigs with clinically diagnosed Lawsonia intracellularis infection (PE; n 03) and a group of uninfected controls (C; n 03) were compared. The retrograde tracer fast blue (FB) was injected into the <b>descending</b> <b>colons</b> of all animals and then tissue comprising IMGs from both groups was processed for double-labeling immunofluorescence with calbindin-D 28 k (CB) in combination with either tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), neuropeptide Y (NPY), somatostatin (SOM), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), nitric oxide synthase, Leu-enkephalin, substance P, vesicular acetylcholine transporter, galanin, or pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypep-tide. Immunohistochemistry revealed changes in the chem-ical coding pattern of calbindin-immunoreactive neurons in the inferior mesenteric ganglia of the pig. In control animals, FB/CB-positive neurons were immunoreactive to TH, NPY, SOM, and VIP. In the experimental group, TH-expressing neurons were unaffected, NPY-expressing neurons were increased, whereas the number of neurons immunoreactive to SOM or VIP was reduced.

2500|$|The {{sigmoid colon}} {{is the part}} of the large {{intestine}} after the <b>descending</b> <b>colon</b> and before the rectum. The name sigmoid means S-shaped (see cf. sigmoid sinus).

2500|$|During these {{topographic}} changes, the dorsal mesentery undergoes corresponding changes. Most anatomical and embryological textbooks {{say that}} after adopting a final position, the ascending and descending mesocolons disappear during embryogenesis. Embryology—An Illustrated Colour Text says, [...] "most of the mid-gut retains the original dorsal mesentery, though parts of the duodenum derived from the mid-gut do not. The mesentery associated with the ascending colon and <b>descending</b> <b>colon</b> is resorbed, bringing these parts of the colon into close contact with the body wall." [...] In The Developing Human, the author states, [...] "the mesentery of the ascending colon fuses with the parietal peritoneum on this wall and disappears; consequently the ascending colon also becomes retroperitoneal". To reconcile these differences, several theories of embryologic mesenteric development—including the [...] "regression" [...] and [...] "sliding" [...] theories—have been proposed, but none has been widely accepted.|$|E
40|$|The human {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) tract harbors {{a complex}} community of bacterial {{cells in the}} mucosa, lumen, and feces. Since most attention {{has been focused on}} bacteria present in feces, knowledge about the mucosa-associated bacterial communities {{in different parts of the}} colon is limited. In this study, the bacterial communities in feces and biopsy samples from the ascending, transverse, and <b>descending</b> <b>colons</b> of 10 individuals were analyzed by using a 16 S rRNA approach. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that 105 to 106 bacteria were present in the biopsy samples. To visualize the diversity of the predominant and the Lactobacillus group community, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons was performed. DGGE analysis and similarity index comparisons demonstrated that the predominant mucosa-associated bacterial community was host specific and uniformly distributed along the colon but significantly different from the fecal community (P < 0. 01). The Lactobacillus group-specific profiles were less complex than the profiles reflecting the predominant community. For 6 of the 10 individuals the community of Lactobacillus-like bacteria in the biopsy samples was similar to that in the feces. Amplicons having 99 ␜equence similarity to the 16 S ribosomal DNA of Lactobacillus gasseri were detected in the biopsy samples of nine individuals. No significant differences were observed between healthy and diseased individuals. The observed host-specific DGGE profiles of the mucosa-associated bacterial community in the colon support the hypothesis that host-related factors are involved in the determination of the GI tract microbial community...|$|R

2500|$|Duodenography and colonography are {{performed}} like a standard abdominal examination using B-mode and color flow Doppler ultrasonography using a low frequency transducer — for example a 2.5MHz — {{and a high}} frequency transducer, for example a 7.5MHz probe.

All ultrasound examinations {{are performed}} after overnight fasting (for at least 16 hours) using standard scanning procedure. Subjects are examined with and without water contrast. Water contrast imaging is performed by having adult subjects take at least one liter of water prior to examination. Patients are examined in the supine, left posterior oblique, and left lateral decubitus positions using the intercostal and subcostal approaches. The liver, gall bladder, spleen, pancreas, duodenum, colon, and kidneys are routinely evaluated in all patients. With patient lying supine, {{the examination of the}} duodenum with high frequency ultrasound duodenography is performed with 7.5MHz probe placed in the right upper abdomen, and central epigastric successively; for high frequency ultrasound colonography, the ascending colon, is examined with starting point usually midway of an imaginary line running from the iliac crest to the umbilicus and proceeding cephalid through the right mid abdomen; for the <b>descending</b> <b>colon,</b> the examination begins from the left upper abdomen proceeding caudally and traversing the left mid abdomen and left lower abdomen, terminating at the sigmoid colon in the lower pelvic region.
