5|$|Historians (List of Historians {{till now}} not found, hence cannot be trusted) claim that Hyder was {{extremely}} tolerant towards the Christians. According to historian Severine Silva, {{he followed the}} same policy of religious tolerance towards Christians as he <b>had</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beginning, even though the Christians had revolted against him. The Second Anglo-Mysore War began in 1780 and led to Hyder's death on 7 December 1782, at Arcot. Afterwards the British recaptured the fort at Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|The Isinglass/Rheinberry {{concept was}} {{considered}} to be superior to spy satellites in a number of ways, including rapid turnaround time and quick response capability. As there was little funding to be <b>had</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> CIA budget, McDonnell developed the aircraft using its own funds, although technical support gleaned from Oxcart was supplied by the CIA. The McDonnell Isenglass/Rheinberry proposal's shape remains classified, although it has been described as being similar to the Space Shuttle, albeit much reduced in size. A 1/3 cross-sectional model of the aircraft was constructed to illustrate the principles used in its construction.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{conflict}} erupted {{again in}} 1459, and again Clifford {{was found on}} the side of the King and Queen. Clifford took part in the parliament that attainted the Yorkists– by now in exile– and he took a share of the profits from their lands, as well as being appointed to offices traditionally in their keeping. The Yorkist lords returned from exile in June 1460 and subsequently defeated a royal army at Northampton. As a result of the royalist defeat, Clifford was ordered to surrender such castles and offices as he <b>had</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Nevilles back to them, although it is unlikely that he did so. In fact, he and his fellow northern Lancastrian lords merely commenced a campaign of destruction on Neville and Yorkist estates and tenantry, to such an extent that in December 1460, the duke of York and his close ally, the earl of Salisbury, raised an army and headed north to crush the Lancastrian rebellion. This winter campaign culminated in the Battle of Wakefield in the last days of the year, and was a decisive victory for the Lancastrian army, of which Clifford was by now an important commander. The battle resulted in the deaths of both York and Salisbury, but was probably most notorious for Clifford's slaying of Edmund, Earl of Rutland, York's seventeen-year old second son and the younger brother of the future King Edward IV. This may have resulted in Clifford's being nicknamed 'Butcher Clifford,' although historians disagree as to how widely used by contemporaries this term was.|$|E

25|$|King John's Castle.

25|$|The Norwegian Railway Museum has {{its origins}} from 1896.

At that time the station ran out of place and the museum had to relocate. It lacked a venue {{for more than a}} decade while its board searched for a proper site. This issue was settled in 1925, when the museum secured a lot to the north of Hamar Station. It could open as an open-air museum in 1930. NSB took formal ownership of the museum in 1946 and the lot on was it. A new and larger museum could was opened in 1956.|$|E

25|$|Leopold fought three wars against France: the Dutch War, the Nine Years' War, and the War of the Spanish Succession. In this last, Leopold {{sought to}} give his younger son the entire Spanish inheritance, {{disregarding}} {{the will of the}} late Charles II. Leopold started a war that soon engulfed much of Europe. The early years of the war went fairly well for Austria, with victories at Schellenberg and Blenheim, but the war would drag on till 1714, nine years after Leopold's death, which barely had an effect on the warring nations. When peace returned, Austria could not be said to have emerged as triumphant as it <b>had</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> war against the Turks.|$|E
25|$|The {{coming of}} {{independence}} to Latin America saw {{the formation of}} two parties in every country: Liberal and Conservative. Conservatives looked toward Europe, and particularly Spain, for social and political inspiration. They wished to retain the Catholic Church in the position which she <b>had</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first settlement; furthermore, they wanted the great estates to remain like those of Europe—self-contained communities which, despite failing to make {{a great deal of}} money for their owners, did build social stability. The Liberals looked to the United States as a guide, wanted separation of Church and State, and wished to turn the great estates into money-making concerns, like factories. These two groups had clashed since independence. The Conservatives produced some notable leaders, like Mexico's Agustín de Iturbide and Guatemala's Rafael Carrera. As the 19th century progressed, both parties were faced with the impact of such inventions as the railroad.|$|E
25|$|Between the Pleistocene era and {{the last}} glacial period, the lake {{occupied}} an even larger area. There were several paleo-lakes that would connect with each other from time to time. At the north in the modern community of San Miguel Tocuilla {{there is a great}} paleontological field, with a lot of pleistocenic fauna. The Lake was primarily fed by snowmelt and rain runoff. Between 11,000 and 6,000 years ago, the climate warmed and snowfall in central Mexico became less prevalent. This caused the water level of the lake to drop over the next several millennia. Remnants of the ancient shoreline that Lake Texcoco <b>had</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last glacial period can be seen on some slopes of Mount Tlaloc as well as mountains west of Mexico City. The disarticulated remains of seven mammoths dated between 10,220 ± 75 and 12,615 ± 95 years (BP) were found, suggesting human presence.|$|E

25|$|Except for {{the four}} states west of the Mississippi River (Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas) all Confederate states' {{apportionment}} in the U.S. Congress was going to decline into the 1860s. In the Confederate Congress, all would have larger delegations than they <b>had</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> census of 1850, except South Carolina, which was equal, and Missouri, which declined by one. The Confederate States Congress maintained representation in Virginia, Tennessee and Louisiana throughout its existence. Unlike the United States Congress, there was no requirement {{for a majority of}} the voters in 1860 to vote for representatives for them to be seated. from 1861 to 1863, Virginia (east, north and west), Tennessee and Louisiana had U.S. representation. Then, for 1863–1865, only the newly made West Virginia had U.S. representation. West Virginians living in counties not under Federal control, however, continued to participate in Confederate elections.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} years of the García {{government}} gave new hope to the people of Peru, with rising employment, production, and wages suggesting a clear turn for the better after so many years of increasing difficulties. It was hence doubly tragic to see the whole process unravel so quickly, once things started going wrong again. The first sign of trouble came, as it often <b>had,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> balance of payments. The economic boom naturally raised imports swiftly, by 76 percent between 1985 and 1987. But the real exchange rate was allowed to fall by 10 percent in 1986 and by a further 9 percent in 1987. The boom pulled potential export supply into the domestic market, and the fall in the real exchange rate reduced incentives to earn foreign exchange. Exports fell slightly in 1985 and remained below that level through 1987. The external current account went from a surplus of US$127 million in 1985 to deficits of nearly US$1.1 billion in 1986 and nearly US$1.5 billion in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Downing <b>had</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first been {{hostile to}} the Dutch as the {{commercial}} rivals of England. He had strongly supported the Navigation Act of 1660, and he now deliberately drew on the fatal and disastrous Second Anglo-Dutch War, {{in the first year}} of which, 1665, he was expelled by the Dutch because of his intrigues and spying activities and returned home. That year, as a member of parliament, Downing attached a clause to a bill to fund the war's continuation that specified that the money could only be used for the war effort. This previously little-used move, opposed strongly by Lord Clarendon as an encroachment on the royal prerogative, effectively made permanent the parliamentary appropriation of supplies (meaning that Parliament gained the right to specify that tax revenues should be used only for a particular purpose, rather than spent as the King's government saw fit). In May 1667, in the war's final year, Downing was made secretary to the commissioners of the treasury, his appointment being much welcomed by Pepys, and he took part in the management and reform of the Treasury.|$|E
