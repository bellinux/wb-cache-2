Tarantino also {{said he would have}} set it in the 1960s and would have only made it with Pierce Brosnan as Bond. In February 2005, Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director. Later in 2005, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with the film.|$|E

Kichijiro later is caught with a pouch <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> have won while {{gambling}} containing a religious amulet which he disclaims as being his own. He is taken away and never heard from again. Many years later, Rodrigues dies. He is placed in a large round wooden casket, and his body is cremated. In his hand is the tiny crudely-made crucifix that was given to him when he first came to Japan.|$|E

5000|$|In handbills, {{newspaper}} {{advertisements and}} announcements Phylidor sometimes claimed the {{praise of the}} royalty of several European courts. In 1786 <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> have a privilege of the Menus-Plaisirs of the King of France. From Catherine the Great and her court members he reportedly received 1.000 rubels, a gold tobacco box and a brilliant ring as appreciation for his performance of physics experiments in January 1787. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> have gotten praise of the Dresden court for his new show in 1789.

5|$|Dan Ferreira {{is a fan}} of Elvis Presley, {{portrayed as}} a womaniser and a bully. <b>He</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> be a widower, talking about his wife as being dead, both to the {{neighbours}} and his children, but they have merely separated after she had an affair with his best friend, with whom she moved in. Ash is portrayed as the intelligent member of the family, the standard of his education being much higher than his siblings, so much so that he is a lecturer. He has an on/off problem with gambling, something that presumably led to the breakup of his first marriage, before he is seen on screen. Kareena is in a relationship with Tariq, though it is not a sexual one. Ronny works as a DJ under the name DJ Ronny Flawless, and Tariq is his best friend and promoter.|$|E

Instead she finds eerie statues and {{a message from the}} Doctor behind peeling wallpaper addressed to her, warning her about the Weeping Angels. Sally returns the next day with her friend Kathy Nightingale to explore further but Kathy disappears {{at the same time a}} young man knocks at the door. <b>He</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> be Kathy's grandson and delivers a letter to Sally. The letter, written by Kathy, explains that she suddenly found herself in the 1920s in Hull. She settled down with a husband and led a peaceful life and requests that Sally tell Kathy's brother Larry of her disappearance. Sally sees a Yale key hanging from the hand of one of the statues and takes it before leaving.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Copeland {{became a}} key figure in an alleged steroid ring and drug investigation. On March 19, Sports Illustrated posted an article on its website in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Copeland, who was alleged to have obtained HGH. Copeland has previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 after neck surgery as an experiment on TSN's Off The Record with Michael Landsberg in January 2005. He said, he felt it slowed him down, so he quickly got off the substance. According to Copeland, he took HGH after returning from a spinal fusion neck surgery. He was told by doctors that it would help the bones grow back around the screws and plate that were inserted into his neck. <b>He</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> have taken blood tests, consulted doctors, studied the drug, and got prescriptions before deciding to take them.|$|E

5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
5|$|Kill the Irishman {{had been}} in {{development}} since 1997. Producer Tommy Reid heard that Rick Porrello, an Ohio policeman, was about to publish a book about Greene called To Kill the Irishman. Reid flew to Ohio and met with Porrello, who told Reid his grandfather was a high-ranking Mafia figure in Cleveland during the prohibition era. The meeting went well, and on March 17, 1998, they signed a deal for the film rights to the book. Getting Kill the Irishman produced was difficult. Reid frequently left deals unconcluded, and discovered that the script he’d commissioned was attached to a cover with another screenwriter and producer’s name listed. According to Reid, this was a common occurrence in Hollywood, and <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> have spent over $1 million to ensure the film was made.|$|E
5|$|On New Year's Eve, Carol and Therese kiss for {{the first}} time and have sex. The next morning, they {{discover}} that Tucker is actually a private investigator hired by Harge to obtain evidence against Carol. Carol confronts Tucker, threatening him at gunpoint, but <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> have already sent secret tape recordings to Harge. Carol and Therese turn back. The following day, in Chicago, Therese learns that Carol has flown home to fight for custody of her daughter, having asked Abby to drive Therese home. Abby gives her a letter from Carol. Back at home, Therese telephones Carol, but knowing that she risks losing custody of Rindy if she continues her relationship with Therese, Carol remains silent and hangs up.|$|E

5|$|On {{the last}} day of O.W.L tests, Harry has a vision of Sirius being {{tortured}} by Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries. He tries again to illegally use Umbridge's office fire to communicate with the Order of the Phoenix's headquarters to make sure the vision was genuine, and is told by Kreacher the house-elf that Sirius is indeed at the Ministry, before Umbridge catches Harry and his friends in the act. Snape is summoned to provide Veritaserum in order to question Harry, but <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> have no further stocks of the potion left. Remembering that Snape {{is also a member of}} the Order of the Phoenix, Harry gives him a cryptic warning about Sirius's fate, but Snape claims to have not understood it.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{debate whether}} Macbeth's vision of Banquo is real or a {{hallucination}}. Macbeth {{had already seen}} a hallucination before murdering Duncan: a knife hovering in the air. Several performances of the play have even ignored the stage direction to have the Ghost of Banquo enter at all, heightening the sense that Macbeth is growing mad, since the audience cannot see what <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> see. Scholars opposing this view claim that while the dagger is unusual, ghosts of murdered victims are more believable, having a basis in the audience's superstitions. Spirits in other Shakespeare plays—notably Hamlet and Midsummer Night's Dream—exist in ambiguous forms, occasionally even calling into question their own presence.|$|E
5|$|Soule {{was born}} in Keokuk, Iowa to a public school music teacher father and a graphic {{designer}} mother. He became interested in music and symphony orchestras {{at the age of}} five. Soule began taking piano lessons at an early age and became entranced with music, even writing music notation in the margins of his math homework; after his teachers and his father realized his talent, he began taking private lessons with professors from Western Illinois University when he was in sixth grade. <b>He</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> have earned the equivalent of a master's degree in composition before completing high school, though, as he never enrolled in the school, he did not earn a degree. He was split between trying to become a concert pianist and a composer when he grew up; he ended up deciding to become a composer once he realized how difficult it would be to do both.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{was born}} in 1916 in Annandale, an inner suburb of Sydney. However, in his autobiography, <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> have been born in 1918 or 1919 in Queensland, and his {{military}} service record has his date of birth as 5 June 1917. He was the third child of Alfred Percival Barnes and Hilda May Barnes (née Jeffery), both from farming families near Tamworth in northern New South Wales. After marrying, the couple left Tamworth {{to take up a}} lease on a remote sheep station near Hughenden in North Queensland. Before Sid was born, Alfred died from typhoid fever, caused by drinking contaminated water on the family property. After his death, Hilda, widowed and pregnant with her latest child, moved to Sydney with her children and stayed with her sister, where Sid was born. From her husband's estate, Hilda Barnes mother was able to purchase and renovate real estate in Stanmore and Leichhardt,New South Wales, to let or sell. Later in life, Barnes would recount how, as a child, he used to collect the rents for his mother.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Moore {{joined the}} Home Guard in East Grinstead {{where his father}} had been elected platoon commander. Despite recounting in his {{autobiography}} that he had lied about his age to join the Royal Air Force in 1940 at age 16, records show that he enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in December 1941 at age 18 and was not called up for service until July 1942 as an Aircraftman, 2nd Class. After basic training at various RAF bases in England, he went to Canada under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan and completed training at RAF Moncton in New Brunswick as a navigator and pilot. In his biography, <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> have met Albert Einstein and Orville Wright while on leave in New York. Returning to England in June 1944, he was commissioned as a Pilot officer and was posted to RAF Millom in Cumbria, where he was a navigator in the crew of a Vickers Wellington bomber, engaged in maritime patrolling and bombing missions to mainland Europe. After the end of hostilities, Moore became an adjutant and then an Area Meteorological Officer, finally demobilised in October 1945 with the rank of Flying officer.|$|E
5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: <b>he</b> <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E
50|$|Mohammed Marwana is {{a member}} of the Boko Haram {{terrorist}} sect. In August 2013, <b>he</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> have taken leadership of the sect from Abubakar Shekau, contradicting reports from Boko Haram's spiritual leader, Imam Liman Ibrahim that Shekau had been killed and Abu Zamira appointed to lead the militant organization. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>to</b> have been responsible for initiating peace talks between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram.|$|R
