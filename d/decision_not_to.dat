40|$|In Canada, Crown {{prosecutors}} and the Attorney General {{are not always}} as fair as we expect when making charging decisions, and therefore victims could be personally aggrieved by unfair and unjust <b>decisions</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> prosecute. When this happens, victims have limited remedy to redress the unfairness and unjustness in order to uphold their interests in a criminal proceeding. Conversely, the European Union, United Kingdom, and the United State have taken steps to let victims challenge <b>decisions</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> prosecute to some extent. Drawing on experiences of the abovementioned jurisdictions, I propose a two-level process of review for <b>decisions</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> prosecute [...] Internal Review and Judicial Review [...] in Canada {{in order to provide}} victims a way to have problematic decisions reversed.
