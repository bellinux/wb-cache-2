5|$|The {{precursors}} for systemin and AtPEP1 are both processed to yield one active peptide from the C-terminus of the precursor. It {{has been speculated}} that ProAtPEP1 <b>is</b> <b>processed</b> by CONSTITUTIVE DISEASE RESISTANCE 1, an apoplastic aspartic protease. The precursors to HypSys are processed into more than one active peptide. In tobacco, it <b>is</b> <b>processed</b> into two peptides, in petunia into three, and in sweet potato, possibly into six. At 291 amino acids long, the precursor to HypSys in sweet potato is the longest precursor described. The production of multiple signalling peptides from one precursor is a common feature found in animals.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{prevailing}} questions in current metaphor research has been whether {{and to what extent}} conventionality of a metaphor influences its processing. The career of metaphor hypothesis (Bowdle & Gentner, 2005; Gentner & Bowdle, 2001) suggests that conventional metaphors <b>are</b> <b>processed</b> through categorization whereas novel ones <b>are</b> <b>processed</b> through comparison. The dual reference theory (Glucksberg & Haught, 2006 a, 2006 b), on the other hand, proposes that it is the grammatical form of a figurative statement that determines how it will <b>be</b> <b>processed.</b> More specifically, metaphors which share the grammatical form of literal categorizations <b>are</b> <b>processed</b> through categorization and similes which share the grammatical form of literal comparisons <b>are</b> <b>processed</b> through comparison. The present study investigated the claims of these theories and found support for the career of metaphor hypothesis by showing that conventional figurative statements appeared to <b>be</b> <b>processed</b> through categorization whereas novel statements appeared to <b>be</b> <b>processed</b> through comparison. Key Words: Metaphor; conventionality; categorization; comparison...|$|R

5|$|Yellow tea: This tea <b>is</b> <b>processed</b> in {{a similar}} manner to green tea, but instead of {{immediate}} drying after fixation, it is stacked, covered, and gently heated in a humid environment. This initiates oxidation in the chlorophyll of the leaves through non-enzymatic and non-microbial means, which results in a yellowish or greenish-yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides <b>is</b> <b>processed</b> with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted {{using one of}} the procedures described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment.|$|E

The city is also the location of headquarters for the Texas Cattle Feeders Association. Petroleum extraction is also a major industry. The helium industry has decreased in significance since the federal government privatized local operations in the late 1990s.

5|$|Harmless to humans, the winghead shark {{is caught}} {{throughout}} its range using gillnets, seines, stake nets, longlines, and hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh, the fins are exported to Asia for shark fin soup, the liver {{is a source}} of vitamin oil, and the offal <b>is</b> <b>processed</b> into fishmeal. This species is taken in large numbers in some areas, such as in the Gulf of Thailand and off India and Indonesia, and anecdotal evidence indicates its population has suffered as a result. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the winghead shark as Endangered. This species is only infrequently caught in Australian waters, where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN.|$|E

5|$|Isopods have {{a simple}} gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are caeca {{connected}} {{to the back of}} the stomach in which absorption takes place. Food is sucked into the esophagus, a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by peristalsis into the stomach, where the material <b>is</b> <b>processed</b> and filtered. The structure of the stomach varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes on through the hindgut and is eliminated through the anus, which is on the pleotelson.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup is a syrup {{usually made}} from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, {{although}} {{it can also be}} made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which <b>is</b> <b>processed</b> by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.|$|E

5|$|The common {{thresher}} {{is widely}} caught by offshore longline and pelagic gillnet fisheries, {{especially in the}} northwestern Indian Ocean, the western, central, and eastern Pacific, and the North Atlantic. Participating countries include the former USSR, Japan, Taiwan, Spain, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, and Mexico. The meat is highly prized for human consumption cooked, dried and salted, or smoked. In addition, their skin is made into leather, their liver oil <b>is</b> <b>processed</b> for vitamins, and their fins are used for shark fin soup. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) reported a worldwide common thresher take of 411 metric tons in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The sicklefin weasel shark is not {{dangerous}} to humans. It is caught by artisanal fishers throughout its range, mostly in drifting and bottom gillnets {{but also in}} bottom trawls and on longlines. The meat is eaten, the fins are used in shark fin soup, and the offal <b>is</b> <b>processed</b> into fishmeal. However, {{the small size of}} this shark limits its economic value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the sicklefin weasel shark as Vulnerable, noting that it is naturally uncommon and resides in heavily fished regions. In addition, compared to the related Australian weasel shark it is less productive and thus less resilient to withstand fishing pressure.|$|E

At her hotel, Cayce is intercepted and drugged by Dorotea and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses as Parkaboy, who upon Cayce's request was flown to Moscow, retrieves her and brings her to the prison where the film <b>is</b> <b>processed.</b> There Hubertus, Stella and Nora's uncle Andrei, and the latter's security employees are waiting for her.

5|$|Dromedary {{slaughter}} is {{more difficult}} than the slaughter of other domestic livestock such as cattle, {{because of the size}} of the animal and the significant manual work involved. More males than females are slaughtered. Though less affected by mishandling than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the dromedary plays a crucial role in determining the quality of meat obtained; mishandling can often disfigure the hump. The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and slaughtered. The dressing percentage the percentage of the mass of the animal that forms the carcass is 55–70%, more than the 45–50% of cattle. Camel meat is rarely consumed by African camel herders, who use it only during severe food scarcity or for rituals. Camel meat <b>is</b> <b>processed</b> into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma. Dromedaries can be slaughtered between four and ten years of age. As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality.|$|E
5|$|Green tea: This tea has {{undergone}} {{the least amount}} of oxidation. The oxidation process is halted by the quick application of heat after tea picking, either with steam, the method preferred in Japan, or by dry roasting and cooking in hot pans, preferred in Chinese tea processing. Tea leaves may be left to dry as separate leaves or they may be rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder tea. This process is time consuming and is typically done with pekoes of higher quality. The tea <b>is</b> <b>processed</b> within one to two days of harvesting, and if done correctly retains most of the chemical composition of the fresh leaves from which it was produced. Variation in steaming time for fixation or processing from additional stages of rolling and drying are sometimes used to improve or altering the flavour for types of green tea. Green tea leaves undergo fixation by either roasting (panning) or steaming. Generally, roasted varieties are richer in flavor, while steamed varieties are more vivid in color.|$|E
5|$|Human {{language}} has {{the properties of}} productivity and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication. Language {{is thought to have}} originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality. This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language <b>is</b> <b>processed</b> in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment.|$|E
