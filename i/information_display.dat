5|$|A Passenger <b>Information</b> <b>Display</b> System (PIDS) was {{installed}} in all Metrorail stations in 2000. Displays are located on all track platforms and at the mezzanine entrances of stations, and provide real-time information on next train arrivals, delayed trains, emergency announcements, and related information. WMATA also provides current train and related information to customers with conventional web browsers, as well as users of smartphones and other mobile devices. In 2010 Metro began sharing its PIDS data with outside software developers, for use in creating additional real-time applications for mobile devices. Free apps are {{available to the public}} on major mobile device software platforms (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Palm). WMATA also began providing real-time train information by phone in 2010.|$|E

Flight <b>information</b> <b>display</b> screens for airline passengers are provided at the Heathrow Express ticket office near these platforms. Baggage check-in facilities for airline passengers were provided in 1999 in the Lawn but progressively replaced by retail units. An integrated timetable is offered between Paddington and Rosslare Europort in Ireland via the Stena Line ferry from Fishguard Harbour railway station with through ticketing to stations and a daily morning and evening service in both directions, changing at Newport, Cardiff or Swansea. This route has been in existence since 1906.|$|E

PHR development should be guided by ample patient-oriented research in future.|$|E
25|$|On April 23, 2003, the {{ownership}} of the airport was transferred from Jat Airways to Airports of Montenegro Public Company, owned by Government of Montenegro. Since then, the airport was once again modernized and refurbished, with reconstructed passenger terminal opening on June 3, 2006. In October 2007, South Korea made a government donation valued at $1 million for a new airport equipment ranging from cargo-loaders to flight <b>information</b> <b>display</b> system. Further reforms came in 2008 when several old types of passenger aircraft such as the Ilyushin Il-86 were permanently banned from flying to Tivat and subsequently redirected to Podgorica Airport due to noise abatement.|$|E
25|$|The {{versatility}} of SGML for dynamic <b>information</b> <b>display</b> {{was understood}} by early digital media publishers {{in the late}} 1980s prior {{to the rise of}} the Internet. By the mid-1990s some practitioners of SGML had gained experience with the then-new World Wide Web, and believed that SGML offered solutions to some of the problems the Web was likely to face as it grew. Dan Connolly added SGML to the list of W3C's activities when he joined the staff in 1995; work began in mid-1996 when Sun Microsystems engineer Jon Bosak developed a charter and recruited collaborators. Bosak was well connected in the small community of people who had experience both in SGML and the Web.|$|E

Different exterior colors were offered. In 2007, Hybrid badging was added to the rear side doors. The RX 400h interior {{featured a}} hybrid <b>information</b> <b>display</b> on the navigation screen showing electrical motor, gasoline engine, and regenerative braking activation in real time. Some RX 400h models without navigation screens displayed the information on a small monochrome display on the instrument panel. When launched in 2005, the RX 400h came exclusively with brushed aluminum interior accents, {{in place of the}} wood trim offered in the standard RX. This changed in 2006, when the RX 400h became available with Bird's Eye Maple wood trim.|$|E
25|$|For the 2010 model year, the CR-V {{received}} style, powertrain, {{and equipment}} changes. The exterior changes included a redesigned front fascia {{with a new}} horizontal-slat chrome grille and honeycomb-designed lower front grille, new front bumper, and revised taillights. The rear bumper was redesigned, {{as well as new}} five split-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels for EX and EX-L models. The interior received minor changes, including seat fabrics, as well as wider driver and front-passenger armrests. The audio head unit controls were altered and the <b>information</b> <b>display</b> backlighting in the gauges was changed to blue, instead of the previous black. A USB audio input became standard in the EX-L trim while hands-free Bluetooth connectivity was exclusive to the EX-L trim equipped with navigation system. In 2011, a mid-level SE trim debuted with a 6-disc CD changer and 17-inch 7-spoke alloy wheels that came from the pre-facelift EX and EX-L trims.|$|E
25|$|Terminal 3 {{uses the}} Jetway system. The overall layout {{is similar to}} that of {{airports}} in Europe and North America, with multiple levels and considerable distances to walk after disembarking from the aircraft. The walk is assisted by escalators and moving walkways. The upper level departures hall, with an area of over , is equipped with 110 check-in counters and as well as flight <b>information</b> <b>display</b> systems. A small shopping mall, known as Buy & Bye, is open to both travellers and the general public. The mall, which includes shops, restaurants and a post office, was planned to be a draw for non-flyers too. On the same level as the mall, passengers enter passport control and the security check. Planes taking off and landing can be viewed from a distinctive tilted glass wall. The arrivals hall is located on the ground floor where there are also 20 additional check-in counters (serving Star Alliance airlines). Car rental counters are located in an intermediate level situated between the departing and arriving passenger halls. Terminal 3 has two synagogues.|$|E

The park also serves as a tourist attraction, especially due to its location, since Hanford is the resting place of spent reactor cores from several Navy ships. Planning called for the sail to be cut up for transport and reassembled at the park site. Ground-breaking was initially scheduled to take place on 3 April 2008, with the dedication ceremony set for 19 August 2008 and a Fall 2009 start-date for construction. [...] On 23 October 2009, the Port of Benton encased Tritons conning tower in concrete at its new USS Triton Submarine Memorial Park in north Richland, Washington. [...] In mid-December 2009, the final pieces of Tritons sail were welded together at the park's site. During the 11 August 2010 Port of Benton commission meeting, it was reported that bids for the first phase, which includes the park's electrical lighting system and the pouring the concrete around Tritons sail, would be announced shortly by the port authority. [...] The second phase would involve the park's landscaping, and the third phase would be the installation of a parking lot. [...] The park is part of the Richland Riverfront Trail, a marked hiking trail that focuses on the state of Washington's contribution to the nuclear history of the United States, and it connects to the Sacagawea Heritage Trail.
