5|$|Despite its popularization {{in later}} times, the phrase is not {{recorded}} elsewhere in Roman history. Historians question {{whether it was}} <b>ever</b> <b>used</b> as a customary salute. It was more likely an isolated appeal by desperate captives and criminals condemned to die, and noted by Roman historians in part for the unusual mass reprieve granted by Claudius to the survivors.|$|E
5|$|Tetrarchs {{did not see}} {{any further}} combat and were deemed {{obsolete}} by 1946; the last was retired in 1950. There were several variations on the Tetrarch design, including the Alecto self-propelled gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII, {{but none of these}} were <b>ever</b> <b>used</b> in active service with the British Army.|$|E
5|$|The Berkshire No. 7 has {{historical}} importance {{because of}} its design, which reflects the construction of 19th-century canal boats. However, {{there is no record}} that the barge was <b>ever</b> <b>used</b> on a canal. The barge is one of two surviving wooden-hulled canal boats in existence. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978. Its nomination and listing is unusual because the Berkshire No. 7 was not yet 50 {{years old at the time}} of its nomination, and it sank in 1974. It and the other two barges that sank with it are the only shipwrecks in Connecticut listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

5|$|The division's {{identification}} symbol was the Albanian double-headed eagle. Despite its short existence, a collar patch depicting a goat-crested helmet was manufactured for the division {{but there is}} no evidence that it was <b>ever</b> <b>used.</b> Photographs exist of a machined-woven cuff band with the title Skanderbeg, but this was awarded to the 14th SS Volunteer Gebirgsjäger Regiment of the 7th SS Division in autumn 1944, and not to this division. Members of the cadre staff were photographed wearing an Albanian arm shield depicting a black Albanian double-headed eagle on a red field. Many of the division's Muslim members wore traditional grey-coloured skull caps instead of the standard SS field cap. Others wore the traditional Albanian highlander hat, the Qeleshe.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{documentary evidence}} of building work at Halton Castle shows {{that during the}} 15thcentury and into the 16thcentury it was regularly maintained. Between 1450 and 1457 a new gate tower was built. There {{is no evidence that}} the castle featured in the Wars of the Roses; this would have been unlikely because of its relatively obscure position. However a survey of the Royal Palaces in 1609 suggests that by then the castle had fallen into disrepair. During the Tudor period it was used less as a fortress and more as a prison, an administrative centre, and a court of law. In 1580–81 the castle was designated as a prison for Catholic recusants, but there is no evidence that it was <b>ever</b> <b>used</b> for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{chosen for}} nest holes have soft {{heartwood}} and tough sapwood, the former often due to parasites or diseases that weaken the tree's core. It {{is not certain}} how suitable trees are selected, {{although it may be}} by drumming, since woods with differing elastic modulus and density may transmit sound at different speeds. A Japanese study found nests in trees from many families; these included grey alder, Japanese white birch, Japanese hop-hornbeam, Japanese tree lilac, willows, Japanese larch and Sargent's cherry. The Mongolian oak and prickly castor-oil tree were rarely if <b>ever</b> <b>used.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Return of the Jedi, Jabba {{is portrayed}} by a one-ton puppet that took {{three months and}} {{half a million dollars}} to construct. While filming the movie, the puppet had its own makeup artist. The puppet {{required}} three puppeteers to operate, {{making it one of the}} largest <b>ever</b> <b>used</b> in a motion picture. Stuart Freeborn designed the puppet, while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. Puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and Mike Edmonds, who were members of Jim Henson's Muppet group. Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character's English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue. Edmonds, the shortest of the three men (he also played the Ewok Logray in later scenes) was responsible for the movement of Jabba's tail. Tony Cox, who also played an Ewok, would assist as well. The eyes and facial expressions were operated by radio control.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires <b>ever</b> <b>used</b> in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A ram air turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} term Borders Railway to describe the reopened line was in a paper by the Corus Rail Consultancy in January 2004, entitled Delivering an innovative Borders Railway, which had been commissioned by the Waverley Route Trust. Previously, the Edinburgh–Tweedbank line had been variously described as the Waverley Railway and the Borders Rail Link. In mid-2014, Transport Scotland considered launching a competition for the public to submit their ideas for a name but the Scottish Borders Council was strongly opposed on the basis that Borders Railway had developed a strong brand identity. The use of Waverley Line or Waverley Route for the line was considered historically inaccurate by the Council and the Campaign for Borders Rail since these names were only <b>ever</b> <b>used</b> for the whole of the original line as far as Carlisle.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the regular}} Sharingan, which appears {{identical}} from user to user, the Mangekyō Sharingan's tomoe seal differs between individuals. Its abilities were usually derived from Japanese mythology, hence giving the interpretation {{that they are}} one of the divine and most powerful ninja techniques <b>ever</b> <b>used.</b> Also, the Mangekyō seems to grant different kinds of abilities to each of its users, though some might share the same jutsu, as Sasuke and Itachi share the ability to perform Amaterasu, while all members have the potential to construct a Susanoo. Features of the Mangekyō Sharingan include Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu. When the user has mastered the full power of both of their eyes, regardless of what kind of Mangekyō abilities they have, the user gains the ability to create a construct of chakra called a Susanoo. Other Mangekyō abilities include Kamui and , awakened in Shisui's Mangekyō Sharingan, which granted him the ability to control other people's minds without them knowing.|$|E
5|$|While {{most of the}} LNC's {{business}} was now operated by road, an agreement on 13 May 1946 allowed the LNC {{to make use of}} SR services from Waterloo to Brookwood station for funerals, subject to the condition that should the service be heavily used the SR (British Railways after 1948) reserved the right to restrict the number of funeral parties on any given train. Although one of the LNC's hearse carriages had survived the bombing it is unlikely that this was <b>ever</b> <b>used,</b> and coffins were carried in the luggage space of the SR's coaches. Coffins would either be shipped to Brookwood ahead of the funeral party and transported by road to one of the mortuaries at the disused cemetery stations, or travel on the same SR train as the funeral party to Brookwood and be transported from Brookwood station to the burial site or chapel by road.|$|E

For both genders, perceived ease of access to contraceptives is associated with increased odds of <b>ever</b> <b>using</b> contraception and using contraception con-sistently. For males, greater perceived condom knowledge is associated with increased odds of <b>ever</b> <b>using</b> contraception.

40|$|Objective: This study {{assessed}} {{changes in}} levels of <b>ever</b> <b>use,</b> perceptions of harm from e-cigarettes and socio-demographic correlates of use among EU adults during 2012 - 2014, as well as determinants of current use in 2014. Methods: We analysed data from the 2012 (n= 26, 751) and 2014 (n= 26, 792) waves of the adult Special Eurobarometer for Tobacco survey. Point prevalence of current and <b>ever</b> <b>use</b> were calculated and logistic regression assessed correlates of current use and changes in <b>ever</b> <b>use</b> and perception of harm. Correlates examined included age, gender, tobacco smoking, education, area of residence, difficulties in paying bills and reasons for trying an e-cigarette. Results: The prevalence of <b>ever</b> <b>use</b> of e-cigarettes increased from 7. 2 % in 2012 to 11. 6 % in 2014 (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]= 1. 91). EU-wide coefficient of variation in <b>ever</b> e-cigarette <b>use</b> was 42. 1 % in 2012 and 33. 4 % in 2014. The perception that e-cigarettes are harmful increased from 27. 1 % in 2012 to 51. 6 % in 2014 (aOR= 2. 99), but there were major differences in prevalence and trends between member states. Among those who {{reported that they had}} ever tried an e-cigarette in the 2014 survey, 15. 3 % defined themselves as current users.
