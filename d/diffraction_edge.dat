50|$|Apodization {{is used in}} {{telescope}} optics {{in order}} to improve the dynamic range of the image. For example, stars with low intensity in the close vicinity of very bright stars can be made visible using this technique, and even images of planets can be obtained when otherwise obscured by the bright atmosphere of the star they orbit. Generally, apodization reduces the resolution of an optical image; however, because it reduces <b>diffraction</b> <b>edge</b> effects, it can actually enhance certain small details. In fact the notion of resolution, as it is commonly defined with the Rayleigh criterion, is in this case partially irrelevant. One has to understand that the image formed in the focal plane of a lens (or a mirror) is modelled through the Fresnel diffraction formalism. The classical diffraction pattern, the Airy disk, is connected to a circular pupil, without any obstruction and with a uniform transmission. Any change {{in the shape of the}} pupil (for example a square instead of a circle), or in its transmission, results in an alteration in the associated diffraction pattern.|$|E

Least-squares fitting of the effect of a velocity perturbation to this image-warping perturbation produces a tomographic velocity update. We evaluated a warping scheme based on the radial image derivative in the subsurface offset. We found that the corresponding gradient was free of the <b>diffraction</b> <b>edge</b> effect.

The Fabry-Perot cavities are space-coiled in order to shift the resonant modes under the <b>diffraction</b> <b>edge,</b> which guaranty the opacity band for all incident angles. Indeed, the deep subwavelength feature of the cavities leads to avoid diffraction that have been {{proved to be the}} main limitation of omnidirectional capabilities of locally resonant perforated plates. We experimentally reach an attenuation of few tens of dB at low frequency, with a metamaterial thickness fifteen times smaller than the wavelength (lambda / 15).

Several decades ago, the effect of changing the edge profile of loudspeaker boxes was investigated {{with the goal of}} producing a smoother frequency response. By rounding the edges of loudspeaker boxes, the edge diffraction could be decreased noticeably [H. F. Olson, J. Aud. Eng. Soc. 17 (1), 22 - 29 (1969) ].

40|$|When a {{listener}} {{is put in}} a shadow zone and "does not see" directly the source, the sound however reaches him. We can say waves reach the listener by four different ways: 1) scattering from {{the edges of the}} windows called diffraction; 2) scattering from the turbulence in the air above the window and near the external source; 3) refraction by atmospheric wind; 4) reflections in the room. If we put the listener quite close the window (1 m) and assume the room be constructed by adsorbent materials, edges diffraction has a dominant effect on the pressure in the shadow region. Most of the original work of diffraction theory has been reported for light diffraction; nevertheless there is no difference between the computation for light and for sound waves, as long as both are based on the assumption of a scalar potential. One of the most valuable theorems in acoustics is the Huyghens principle that permits the forecasting of sound pressure levels by assuming every point on a vibrating plane surface may be considered as the centre of an outgoing wave. Based on this principle the <b>diffraction</b> <b>edge</b> can be regarded to be consisting of many point sources (secondary sources) which are the centres of outgoing wave whose intensity is proportional to the primary incident wave and to the path length from the source to the secondary point source same.

The objectives of this study were to explore the behaviour of the free vortex in three dimensions, with a particular focus on the distortions caused to the vortex by the presence of a solid boundary, or wall. Threedimensional numerical simulations and experimentally obtained schlieren photographs reveal significant distortion and bending of the free vortex in regions near the boundary of the flow domain, so as to meet it at a right angle. Experimentation was performed in a shock tube for incident shock Mach numbers of 1. 32, 1. 42, and 1. 65, with four test models, two incorporating straight <b>diffraction</b> <b>edges,</b> and two incorporating curved diffracting edges.

The effects of bending on the structure of the vortex and on the flow properties with the vortex are examined.
