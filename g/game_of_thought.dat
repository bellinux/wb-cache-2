The reason, dressed in modern science, is also building an imaginary world (which is often denied as such) where the universe has its specific form.

But, by recapturing Europe’s fictional history through the lens of Basel and Munich, it can also be read as a strategy proposal of how to overcome our materialistic dependencies for the coming times of scarcity.

On the strategic aspect of coaching, Lippi {{emphasizes the importance of}} the mutual relations between players. Players must all follow the same plan and play for each other, [...] "not" [...] for themselves. Lippi argues that [...] "a group of the best players do not necessarily make for the best team." [...] What is more important, he argues, is that the tactical plan or formation is one that allows each player to maximize (1) his utility for his teammates and (2) the expression of his full potential. Lippi also notes that the choice of tactical formation is constrained by the qualities of the players available. Thus, selecting the best possible team not only requires finding the right combination of players for the chosen formation, but also finding the right formation for the chosen players.|$|R

40|$|<b>GAME</b> THEORY—usually <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as the {{framework}} par excellence for analysing strategic interactions—has also been characterised {{as a means}} of analysing the meaning of “rational ” behaviour. One source of interest in rational behaviour flows from such games as the Prisoner’s Dilemma, in which the Nash equilibrium is not Pareto-optimal, in the one-shot game. Can the efficient, Pareto-optimal equilibrium be supported if the game is played repeatedly? The Folk Theorem (Aumann 1981) asserts that in the repeated game, the individually rational outcome may support the Pareto-optimal outcome of mutual coöperation instead of costly mutual defection. A second source of interest in rational behaviour is as a datum against which “irrational ” behaviour can be measured, and as a description of ways in which irrational behaviour is to be avoided. But irrational behaviour is important in game theory, too. How robust is an equilibrium to apparently irrational behaviour? To what extent is apparently irrational behaviour the rational response to a coarse information partition, t...|$|R

40|$|Philosophical and {{physiological}} investigations define {{thought to be}} the result of thinking. psychological Inquiry has mainly focused on discovery of the mechanisms and topology <b>of</b> <b>thought.</b> Philosophical Inquiry either has explored the mind-body problem or has analyzed the linguistics of the expression <b>of</b> a <b>thought.</b> However, neither has Investigated adequately phenomenal characteristics <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> Itself, the Intermediary between the production and the expression <b>of</b> a <b>thought.</b> The use <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> to analyze phenomenal characteristics <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> engenders a paradox. If the expression <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> requires finite series of linked words with rules governing syntax, then analysis <b>of</b> both the <b>thought</b> and the expression <b>of</b> the <b>thought</b> must necessarily transcend the linguistic level. During the last century many examples of logical paradoxes In linguistics <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> have been given. The culminating difficulty of dealing with a finite structure, a characteristic of any language, Is Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, which says in essence that in order to render all decisions about a finite system requires the use of material outside the system. Thus, a potentially complete interpretation <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> must use some technique which is basically non-linguistic. Wittgenstein proposed such a method with his "Picture theory. " This technique solves the major paradoxical problem generated by investigation of a reflective system using the system itself, but leaves unsolved the question of ultimate resolution.
