40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a fine-scale habitat selection study of Heaviside <b>s</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii) at two sites in Namibia; Walvis Bay and Lüderitz. Walvis Bay and Lüderitz are the two largest embayments along the Namibian Coast, and therefore the two industrial ports in Namibia are located there. These bays are also inhabited year-round by Heaviside <b>s</b> <b>dolphins,</b> and, at Walvis Bay, a resident population of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Heaviside <b>s</b> <b>dolphins</b> are endemic to the western coast of southern Africa ranging within the Benguela current ecosystem from Table Bay, South Africa, to southern Angola. They are not well-studied in the northern half of their range to date, and little is known about geographical variation in the ecology of this species. Furthermore, their coastal distribution and year-round residency near developing industrial ports could potentially put them at risk from human impacts, as industrial use of these areas increases. This study was conducted in order to obtain baseline information on fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns of distribution and important habitat parameters for this species in the northern half of its range in order to inform future management of commercial and industrial activities in these areas. Two complementary methods were used to obtain data on dolphin presence: visual surveys from a small boat were conducted at both study sites over multiple years, and continuous acoustic monitoring was done at Lüderitz over a short period concurrent with one year s surveys. Visual surveys provided the flexibility to cover a wider area and to obtain presence and absence data, including positons of groups, while acoustic monitoring allowed for a continuous observational presence even during nighttime hours, allowing for the ability to detect diel patterns in area use. The Namibian Dolphin Project has been conducting small boat surveys for cetaceans in Walvis Bay since 2008 and in Lüderitz since 2010, with a focus on Heaviside <b>s</b> <b>dolphins</b> and common bottlenose dolphins. Surveys were conducted in a non-systematic way, with the aim of covering the entire study area while maximizing opportunities for data collection from groups of animals, and was thus rather more focused on high-density areas for these two species. Effort-corrected encounter data from these surveys were mapped and linked spatially to habitat parameters using ArcGIS in order to identify areas of frequent dolphin presence for both species. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were used to discover the parameters relevant to habitat selection at each site for Heaviside <b>s</b> <b>dolphins</b> and at Walvis Bay for bottlenose dolphins. Habitat selection at Lüderitz was not examined for bottlenose dolphins, because there were too few encounters there. Acoustic monitoring for dolphins at Lüderitz was conducted continuously over a two-month period in 2014 using five click-logging instruments called C-PODS moored at different sites from the harbour mouth westward across a series of small bays towards the open ocean, which make up the core study area for visual surveys at this study site. The data obtained give information on relative presence, both spatially between the deployment sites, and also temporally. Another aspect of the acoustic data which was examined was the prevalence of very rapid series of echolocation clicks used when an echolocating animal acoustically investigates a specific target, oftentimes a potential prey item. Spatial and temporal variation in the prevalence of these rapid click trains, hereafter referred to as potential feeding buzzes, has implications regarding patterns of foraging. Strong habitat preferences over a fine scale were found at both study sites, with areas of near-constant presence close to areas with very little presence. There are similarities between the most frequented areas at each study site: Pelican Point, in Walvis Bay, and Diaz Point, in Lüderitz. Animals in Lüderitz, however, made use of sheltered inshore waters, and were found much closer to the coastline, and in shallower waters, than animals in Walvis Bay. This {{may be due to the}} presence to bottlenose dolphins close inshore in Walvis Bay as the two species showed remarkably little overlap in distributions given the small scale of the study site. Patterns of acoustic detections between C-POD deployment locations closely matched encounter rates from the small boat surveys around those locations, though with lower detections at night on all C-PODS, implying a diel movement offshore. Highest detections overall were at midday, except at Guano Bay (the most westerly site) where early morning detections were highest. Analysis of inter-click intervals showed a similar diurnal pattern in the proportion of potential feeding buzzes to overall acoustic activity. The continuous presence close to shore and strong habitat preferences of dolphins within both of these industrial ports put them at risk from anthropogenic activities that occur there. Continued monitoring of these populations in the future will help to identify and mitigate these risks. Identification of areas with the most frequent occurrence of dolphins at each study site should be used to inform management decisions in the future.

50|$|In late 2013, {{researchers}} from the Wildlife Conservation Society and the American Natural History museum proposed classification of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin into three species based on morphological and genetic analysis. Their research indicates that at least four species make up the genus Sousa: the Atlantic humpback <b>dolphin</b> (<b>S.</b> teuszii), two species of Indo-Pacific humpback <b>dolphin</b> (<b>S.</b> plumbea and S. chinesis), and a fourth, new species of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin found off northern Australia, a distinction with potential to guide conservation efforts for the species.|$|R
5000|$|Another equally {{important}} contributing influence is deindividuation, a psychological state characterized by partial or complete loss of self-awareness, diffused responsibility, and decreased concern {{about our own}} behavior resulting in the abandonment of norms, restraints and inhibitions due to the involvement in a group.( [...] Diener, E., <b>Fraser,</b> <b>S.</b> C., Beaman, A. L., & Kelem, R. T. (1976)) The individual loses their sense of self as they participate in the group's activities and choices. Deindividuation involves a loss of self-awareness which is essentially {{the degree to which}} one's attention is focused on the self, resulting in comparisons against meaningful standards. When spectators become deindividuated, their self-awareness decreases and they cease to compare their behavior against these social norms. The group's norms become their only focus, and therefore the social norms. Consequentially, situational forces are more influential. Without the comparison process of self-awareness, behavior {{is more likely to be}} inconsistent with attitude.|$|R

30|$|There is {{uncertainty}} {{about the number of}} species within the genus Sousa (see review by Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014). Until recently, the most widely accepted view was of two species: Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, and Atlantic humpback dolphin, Sousa teuszii (see Jefferson and Van Waerebeek 2004). However, mounting molecular and morphological evidence suggested that taxonomic revision was needed (see Frère et al. 2008, 2011; Mendez et al. 2013) and led to a new proposed arrangement that included four species within the genus (Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014). Sousa teuszii remained unchanged while what previously comprised Sousa chinensis was divided into the Indo-Pacific humpback <b>dolphin</b> (<b>S.</b> chinensis), the Indian Ocean humpback <b>dolphin</b> (<b>S.</b> plumbea), and a newly described species, the Australian humpback <b>dolphin</b> (<b>S.</b> sahulensis). Due to concerns about poor sampling from important areas in these studies, this new four-species arrangement was accepted only conditionally by the Taxonomy Committee of the Society for Marine Mammalogy (2014). Although several subspecies were also suggested, none were formally described.|$|R

40|$|The recent {{description}} of a prion disease (PD) case in a free-ranging bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) prompted us to carry out an extensive search for the disease-associated isoform (PrPSc) of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) {{in the brain and}} in a range of lymphoid tissues from 23 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), 5 bottlenose dolphins and 2 Risso <b>s</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Grampus griseus) found stranded between 2007 and 2012 along the Italian coastline. Three striped dolphins and one bottlenose dolphin showed microscopic lesions of encephalitis, with no evidence of spongiform brain lesions being detected in any of the 30 free-ranging cetaceans investigated herein. Nevertheless, we could still observe a prominent PrPC immunoreactivity in the brain as well as in lymphoid tissues from these dolphins. Although immunohistochemical and Western blot investigations yielded negative results for PrPSc deposition in all tissues from the dolphins under study, the reported occurrence of a spontaneous PD case in a wild dolphin is an intriguing issue and a matter of concern for both prion biology and intra/inter-species transmissibility, as well as for cetacean conservation medicine...|$|R
