5|$|Bowfin reach sexually {{maturity}} at two {{to three}} years of age. They can live ten to twelve years in the wild, and 30 years in captivity. <b>Females</b> <b>are</b> longer-lived than males.|$|E
5|$|Many {{butterflies}} {{are sexually}} dimorphic. Most butterflies have the ZW sex-determination system where <b>females</b> <b>are</b> the heterogametic sex (ZW) and males homogametic (ZZ).|$|E
5|$|According to arachnologist B. J. Kaston, adult <b>females</b> <b>are</b> 3.5 to 4.5mm in body length, while {{males are}} 3 to 3.5mm. The Peckhams' earlier description, however, gives {{a length of}} 3mm for females and 3 to 4.5mm for males.|$|E
50|$|Of those {{remaining}} in the hospital {{at the close of}} the year, 124 males, 85 <b>females,</b> <b>were</b> epileptic; 37 males, 6 <b>females,</b> <b>were</b> paralytic; 26 males, 5 <b>females,</b> <b>were</b> homicidal; 34 males, 224 <b>females,</b> <b>were</b> suicidal; 57 males, 6 <b>females,</b> <b>were</b> insane convicts; 43 males, 8 <b>females,</b> <b>were</b> of the criminal insane; 215 males, 260 <b>females,</b> <b>were</b> uncleanly in person and habits, and about 109 patients were estimated to be probably curable cases.|$|R
50|$|According to {{government}} data, {{a total of}} 636,245 (268,080 male and 368,165 <b>female)</b> students <b>were</b> enrolled in higher education in 2006. Among them, 528,146 students (187,489 male and 340,657 <b>female)</b> <b>were</b> in Bachelor programs, 9,768 students (5,551 male and 4,217 <b>female)</b> <b>were</b> in Master programs, and 2,410 students (1,293 male and 1,117 <b>female)</b> <b>were</b> in Ph.D. programs. Another 93,968 students (72,199 male and 21,769 <b>female)</b> <b>were</b> in Intermediate Diploma courses and 1,953 students (1,548 male and 405 <b>female)</b> <b>were</b> in Higher Diploma course. According to the World Bank, in 2006 the gross enrollment ratio for <b>females</b> <b>was</b> 36.1 percent, the gross enrollment ratio for males was 24.7 percent, and the total gross enrollment ratio was 30.2 percent.|$|R
50|$|At {{the close}} of the year 84 {{patients}} were absent on parole at their homes. Of these present, 168 male, 247 <b>female</b> patients, <b>were</b> taking medicine regularly' 241 males, 226 <b>females,</b> <b>were</b> on extra or sick diet; 68 males, 51 <b>females,</b> <b>were</b> sick in bed; 15 males, 22 <b>females,</b> <b>were</b> fed with spoon; 1 <b>female,</b> 1 male, <b>were</b> fed with nasal tube.|$|R
5|$|Although no {{distinguishing}} structural features {{have been}} found to separate the workers and queens, the male is easily identified by its bulging eyes, subquadrate clypeus, and slender antennae. P. exclamans males are also more variable in external morphology compared to females. This is possible given the male’s hemizygosity (<b>females</b> <b>are</b> homozygous).|$|E
5|$|Another {{significant}} human {{impact is}} roadkill—dead turtles, especially <b>females,</b> <b>are</b> commonly seen on summer roads. In addition to direct killing, roads genetically isolate some populations. Localities {{have tried to}} limit roadkill by constructing underpasses, highway barriers, and crossing signs. Oregon has introduced public education on turtle awareness, safe swerving, and safely assisting turtles across the road.|$|E
5|$|Cuban iguanas reach sexual {{maturity}} {{at an age}} of two to three years. Males are gregarious when immature, but become more aggressive as they age, vigorously defending territories in competition for females. <b>Females</b> <b>are</b> more tolerant of each other, except after laying their eggs.|$|E
30|$|Behaviours {{for females}} {{in the absence of}} {{competitors}} (solo <b>females)</b> <b>were</b> defined from a pilot study (Table  1). For the observation of intraspecific competition, the behaviours used for solo <b>females</b> <b>were</b> augmented with additional defence behaviours from a second pilot study (Table  1). When two <b>females</b> <b>were</b> observed simultaneously, the first female to make contact with the egg batch was designated the ‘owner’ and the second <b>female</b> <b>was</b> designated the ‘intruder’.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} of the <b>female</b> <b>is</b> 26-40 mm. The <b>female</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to}} the male, but usually with much less prominently streaked forewings with red color.|$|R
50|$|As {{usual in}} spider morphology, the <b>female</b> <b>is</b> {{much larger than}} male, where the <b>female</b> <b>is</b> about 8-9mm in total length and the male is 7-9mm in length.|$|R
5|$|<b>Females</b> <b>are</b> not territorial, {{and live}} {{alone or with}} their offspring. Juveniles form mixed-sex groups after weaning, {{but most of the}} young females stay back with their mother, with whom they do not show any {{significant}} interaction. Males eventually mature and try to acquire territories.|$|E
5|$|<b>Females</b> <b>are</b> {{still in}} {{reproductive}} diapause when they colonize the field once crops reach flowering stage and day temperature reach 20°C. They become sexually mature {{in a few}} days, {{as a result of}} both an increased duration of photophase and the ingestion of faba bean pollen and nectar (Tran and Huignard 1993).|$|E
5|$|Fishers are {{generally}} crepuscular, being most active {{at dawn and}} dusk. They are active year-round. Fishers are solitary, associating with other fishers only for mating purposes. Males become more active during mating season. <b>Females</b> <b>are</b> least active during pregnancy and gradually increase activity after birth of their kits.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, 15% of {{children}} from 6 to 12 years of age were overweight; by gender, 15.5% of males and 14.4% of <b>females</b> <b>were</b> overweight. In the same age range, 12% {{of children}} were obese; by gender, 14.7% of males and 9.1% of <b>females</b> <b>were</b> categorized as obese. In 2005, 14.9% children from 6 to 12 years of age were overweight; by gender, 15.85% of males and 14.02% of <b>females</b> <b>were</b> overweight. 10.3% were categorized as obese; by gender, 10.92% of males and 9.73% of <b>females</b> <b>were</b> categorized as obese.|$|R
5000|$|... 1994: The site of Sidrón Cave, Spain, is {{discovered}} where {{the remains of}} 12 males and <b>females</b> <b>were</b> to be found. Mitochondrial DNA studies would show that the adult males were genetically related, but the adult <b>females</b> <b>were</b> not, suggesting <b>female</b> exogamy.|$|R
50|$|According to Census 2001, Desuri has a {{population}} of 5,787, where male <b>are</b> 3,050 and <b>female</b> <b>are</b> 2,737. While Rohat tehsil population is 102,599, where male <b>are</b> 52,215 and <b>female</b> <b>are</b> 50,384.|$|R
5|$|Greek life at The University of Central Florida {{involves}} more than 3,000 students in over 45 chapters. Approximately 11% of current undergraduate males and 9% of undergraduate <b>females</b> <b>are</b> members of either a sorority or fraternity.|$|E
5|$|In wasps, as {{in other}} Hymenoptera, sex is {{determined}} by a haplodiploid system, which means that <b>females</b> <b>are</b> unusually closely related to their sisters, enabling kin selection to favour the evolution of eusocial behaviour. <b>Females</b> <b>are</b> diploid, meaning that they have 2n chromosomes and develop from fertilized eggs. Males have a haploid (n) number of chromosomes and develop from an unfertilized egg. Wasps store sperm inside their body and control its release for each individual egg as it is laid; if a female wishes to produce a male egg, she simply lays the egg without fertilizing it. Therefore, under most conditions in most species, wasps have complete voluntary control over the sex of their offspring. Experimental infection of Muscidifurax uniraptor with the bacterium Wolbachia induced thelytokous reproduction and an inability to produce fertile, viable male offspring.|$|E
5|$|Male and <b>females</b> <b>are</b> {{involved}} in the process of provisioning at similar rates throughout most nest stages, with the males providing slightly more in the nestling stages. Both sexes increase their provision rates as the nestlings grow in age.|$|E

50|$|Characteristics of {{offenders}} {{vary from}} the average for specific types of crimes and specific crimes. In terms of violent crime by gender, in 2011, 80.4% of arrested persons were male and 19.6% <b>were</b> <b>female.</b> Males <b>were</b> 88.2% of those arrested for homicide, while <b>females</b> <b>were</b> 11.8%. Among those arrested for rape in 2011, males <b>were</b> 98.8% and <b>females</b> <b>were</b> 1.2%. For property crime in 2011, 62.9% of arrested persons were male and 37.1% <b>were</b> <b>female.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Female</b> <b>is</b> {{a binary}} variable, coded 1 if the responded <b>is</b> <b>female</b> and 0 otherwise.|$|R
5|$|Males and <b>females</b> <b>are</b> {{similar in}} appearance. Juvenile birds are {{slightly}} browner than the adults, with buff or brown edges to the feathers of {{the wings and}} back. Juveniles have a duller, less streaked appearance than adults. Juveniles moult into adult plumage at around one year old. There is no seasonal difference in the plumage of breeding birds.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves {{are light}} grey and brown and {{generally}} muted in color. Males and <b>females</b> <b>are</b> similar in appearance. The species is generally monogamous, with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents incubate {{and care for}} the young. Mourning doves eat almost exclusively seeds, but the young are fed crop milk by their parents.|$|E
5|$|Other mating systems, {{including}} polygyny, polyandry, polygamy, polygynandry, and promiscuity, also occur. Polygamous breeding systems {{arise when}} <b>females</b> <b>are</b> {{able to raise}} broods {{without the help of}} males. Some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{identified}} the entering and exiting sites for Lutzomyia longiflocosa in rural {{houses of the}} sub-Andean region in Colombia. Entering sites were identified with sticky traps set up outside the bedrooms, around the eave openings, and with cage traps enclosing the slits in {{the doors and windows}} inside the bedrooms. Exiting sites were identified by releasing groups of females indoors. These <b>females</b> <b>were</b> blood fed and marked with fluorescent powders. <b>Females</b> <b>were</b> recaptured with the trap placement described above but set up on the opposite sides of the openings. In the entering experiment, a significantly higher number of <b>females</b> <b>were</b> captured in the sticky traps at the zone nearest the eave openings (n = 142) than those captured in the other zones of the trap (n = 52); similarly, a higher number of <b>females</b> <b>were</b> captured on the front side of the house (n = 105) than at the rear side (n = 37). Only two <b>females</b> <b>were</b> collected in the cage trap. In the exiting experiment, at the ceiling, the highest percentage (86. 2 %) of <b>females</b> <b>was</b> recaptured with sticky traps nearest the eave openings and on the front side of the house (70. 0 %). Seven <b>females</b> <b>were</b> collected in the cage trap. Lu. longiflocosa entered and exited houses primarily through the eave openings in a non-random pattern in relation to the sides of the house...|$|R

50|$|N. tripepii has a tibial spur, {{and when}} this is flexed, the retrolateral branch touches the first metatarsus. The <b>female</b> <b>is</b> {{distinguished}} by its long spermathecae and solid colouration. The type male is 5 cm, and the <b>female</b> <b>is</b> 8 cm.|$|R
5|$|Springbok mate year-round, though <b>females</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely}} to enter oestrus during the rainy season, when food is more plentiful. <b>Females</b> <b>are</b> able to {{conceive}} at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{an adult}} bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is {{moderately}} long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and <b>females</b> <b>are</b> identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism {{is evident in the}} species, in that <b>females</b> <b>are</b> 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African fish eagle (H. vocifer) (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's disease {{occurs in}} about 1 in 30,000 people. Symptoms usually begin {{between the ages}} of 5 and 35 years. Males and <b>females</b> <b>are</b> equally affected. It was first {{described}} in 1854 by Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs and is named after Samuel Wilson.|$|E
50|$|The red-chested {{buttonquail}} {{is a small}} reddish brown, {{ground running}} bird, which avoids flying. The <b>female</b> <b>is</b> brighter and slightly larger in size and weight. The <b>female</b> <b>is</b> polyandrous, initiating courtship among several males and expelling rival females from her territory.|$|R
50|$|The <b>female</b> <b>is</b> {{larger than}} the male. The total length of a <b>female</b> <b>is</b> 28 cm, and the total for a male <b>is</b> 25 cm. <b>Females</b> lay between 11 and 14 eggs, {{although}} a clutch of 37 was once found.|$|R
40|$|Pregnant, nonpregnant (but mated) and virgin <b>females</b> <b>were</b> {{individually}} housed or {{lived with}} a pregnant or nonpregnant cagemate. They were subjected {{to a series of}} successive daily encounters with a male intruder, the cagemate being excluded. The most aggressive subjects <b>were</b> pregnant <b>females</b> living with a pregnant cagemate. Isolated pregnant <b>females</b> <b>were</b> as aggressive as pregnant females with a nonpregnant cagemate. Nonpregnant and virgin <b>females</b> <b>were</b> the least aggressive. Nevertheless nonpregnant subjects living with a pregnant cagemate generated higher aggressive scores than nonpregnant females living alone. The way in which a pregnant cagemate influences the aggressive behaviour of another pregnant or nonpregnant <b>female</b> <b>is</b> discussed. Copyright © 1981 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
