5|$|Cheney {{worked closely}} with Pete Williams, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, and Paul Wolfowitz, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, from the {{beginning}} of his tenure.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{negotiations}} {{continued with}} the Americans. Oliver Franks, the British Ambassador to the United States, lodged a formal request on 2 August 1951 {{for use of}} the Nevada Test Site. This was looked upon favourably by the United States Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, {{and the chairman of the}} United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, but opposed by the Robert A. Lovett, the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Defense and Robert LeBaron, the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Defence for Atomic Energy Affairs. The British government had announced on 7 June 1951 that Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, had been a Soviet spy. In view of security concerns, Lovett and LeBaron wanted the tests to be conducted by Americans, with British participation limited to Penney and a few selected British scientists. Truman endorsed this counterproposal on 24 September 1951.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1982, <b>Deputy</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Defense Frank Carlucci sent a {{memorandum}} to the Air Force and Navy, encouraging them to seek out potential foreign customers to procure FX aircraft. However, four months later Carlucci sent a classified memo to the same services to abandon the FX, and green-lighting the exporting of front-line fighters overseas. In December, after prompting from the White House, Carlucci reversed his position again, and directed the Air Force to fund {{a small number of}} F-20s in the fiscal year 1984 budget.|$|E
5|$|The {{memory of}} Hispanic American heroes has been honored in various ways: {{some of their}} names {{can be found on}} ships, in parks and inscribed on monuments.

5|$|As {{the coal}} boom began to wane, Patton sold {{most of his}} coal {{interests}} in 1978. After a meeting with allies of his friend, First District Congressman Carroll Hubbard, in Madisonville on September 20, 1978, Patton considered running for governor in 1979. However, he subsequently decided that he lacked the time to organize a campaign before the May primary election; a letter leaked to the Paducah Sun showed that he believed he was losing Hubbard's support. He joined Terry McBrayer's campaign during the primary, and after McBrayer lost, he worked to elect John Y. Brown, Jr., the Democratic nominee. Brown won the election, and Patton was appointed <b>deputy</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> transportation. He served only three months before resigning to protest Brown's proposal for a coal severance tax.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{returned}} to the United States where he assumed command of the 3525th Pilot Training Wing at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, on 6 June 1953. He entered the National War College in August 1956. It {{was the first and}} only service school he attended after graduating from West Point. After graduation in June 1957, he served as executive to the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Thomas D. White. Brown was promoted to brigadier general in August 1959. He was selected to be military assistant to the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Defense, Thomas S. Gates Jr., and then to the new Secretary of Defense, Robert MacNamara, with the rank of major general.|$|E
5|$|In August 1947 {{he entered}} the Air War College at Maxwell Field and {{graduated}} the following June.

In September 1954 he became Air Deputy to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Defense College, which was then located in Paris, France. On September 1, 1956, he became deputy director, Military Assistance Division, United States European Command, also in Paris.

5|$|Another {{meeting on}} the issue was called on 6 December 1966, {{attended}} by Johnson, McNamara, the <b>deputy</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Defense Cyrus Vance, Walt Rostow of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took {{the side of the}} JCS and it appeared that development would start. However, McNamara once again outlined the problems and stated that the simplest way to close the ABM gap was to simply build more ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system impotent and a great waste of money. He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate an arms limitation treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State Dean Rusk to open negotiations with the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Edward N. Hall was {{responsible}} for making the arrangements for the deployment. Two alternative plans were presented to Quarles, now the United States <b>Deputy</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Defense. One was for the United States to shoulder the cost, which would facilitate the fastest possible deployment. The other was for an {{agreement to be reached}} on sharing costs with the British, which would take longer. Quarles shared the plans with Eisenhower and Macmillan in Bermuda, and directed Hall to proceed with the deployment as fast as the first plan, but with the costs of the second. The result was a slower, more costly deployment. A formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The deployment of Thor missiles was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the Air Ministry, the British {{government}} {{department responsible for}} the Royal Air Force, believed that {{in the event of}} war enemy aerial bombing of London would cause up to 200,000 casualties per week. British government commissions under Warren Fisher and Sir James Rae in 1937 and 1938 considered that key government offices should be dispersed from central London to the suburbs, and non-essential offices to the Midlands or North West. Pending this dispersal, in May 1938 Sir Hastings Ismay, then <b>Deputy</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Committee of Imperial Defence, ordered an Office of Works survey of Whitehall to identify a suitable site for a temporary emergency government centre. The Office concluded the most suitable site was the basement of the New Public Offices, a government building located on the corner of Horse Guards Road and Great George Street, near Parliament Square. The building now accommodates HM Treasury.|$|E
