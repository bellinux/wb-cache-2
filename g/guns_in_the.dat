5|$|The Ingeborg, {{built in}} 1776, had an eight-12-pounder {{centerline}} armament which {{was open to}} the elements, but two heavy 18-pounders in the bow and two 6-pounder chase <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stern. The rowing benches with room for three men per bench were {{on either side of}} the centerline battery, but had to swing forwards and outwards to allow the guns to pivot to either side.|$|E
5|$|The guns on {{the forward}} turret roof were removed in 1911–1912 and the upper forward pair of <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{superstructure}} were removed in 1913–1914. In addition, gun shields were fitted to all <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> superstructure and the bridge structure was enlarged {{around the base of}} the forward tripod mast. During the first year of the war, a fire-control director was installed high on the forward tripod mast. Around the same time, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house 4 four-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns. In addition a pair of three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{plan was}} to arm every fifth T-26 with <b>the</b> 37mm <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right turret, but the final {{proportion}} was somewhat higher. About 450 twin-turreted T-26 mod. 1931 tanks mounting <b>the</b> 37mm <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right turret were produced in 1931–1933 (including only 20–30 tanks with the B-3 gun). There were 392 T-26 mod. 1931 tanks with gun plus machine <b>gun</b> armament <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Red Army on 1 April 1933.|$|R

5|$|The {{wreckage}} of the aircraft was salvaged by 63 Maintenance Unit between 11 and 16 May 1941 and was taken to Oxford to be stored. The aeroplane was armed with four machine <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nose but carried no ammunition. Several pieces of the plane still exist, including the two engines {{and a piece of}} the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|Variants of the M3 {{should not}} be {{confused}} with other 37mm <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. service. Those other pieces included the M1916 infantry gun of French design (these were later used extensively as subcaliber devices for heavy artillery.), M1 antiaircraft autocannon, M4/M9/M10 aircraft-mounted autocannons, M12/M13/M14/M15 subcaliber guns.|$|E

She had her boilers replaced in 1878. In February 1879, her armament was reinforced by a 9 in rifled, muzzle-loading pivot <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bow and a 150-pounder Parrott <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stern, also on a pivoting mount.|$|R
5|$|During the First World War, Paris {{sometimes}} {{found itself}} on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range <b>guns.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> years after the war, known as Les Années Folles, Paris {{continued to be a}} mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Sidney Bechet and the surrealist Salvador Dalí.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{concerns}} about France {{rose in the}} 1880s and an electrically-operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. Additional contact mines were added, forcing incoming vessels to sail into a channel alongside St Mawes, illuminated with electric search lights. As part of this transformation, the castle's 64-pounder guns were partially replaced with light, quick-firing <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1890s, able to engage any torpedo boats or mine sweepers attempting {{to break through the}} defences. The batteries for these were found to be poorly sited, and an additional battery was therefore built above the Henrician castle between 1900 and 1901, again for housing quick-firing guns.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937, the Ordnance Committee {{recommended}} {{development of}} such a weapon; two PaK 36 guns were acquired for study. As the projected main user of the weapon, the Infantry Branch was chosen to oversee the work. They wanted a lightweight gun that could be moved around by the crew, so any ideas of using a larger caliber {{than that of the}} German gun were discarded. The 37mm was a popular caliber of anti-tank <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s; other anti-tank guns of the same caliber included Swedish Bofors gun, Czechoslovakian vz. 34 and vz. 37, Japanese Type 94 and Type 1.|$|E

5|$|Rochambeau {{completed}} her refit on 18 May 1868 and was briefly {{under the command}} of Captain (Capitaine de vaisseau) Jules-François-Émile Krantz (a future Minister of Marine) before being decommissioned on 1 August and placed in reserve. She was refitted from August to December and had her forward hull armor plates replaced by a one-piece cast iron ram. Still in reserve in 1869, Rochambeau was modified with an additional 240 mm pivot gun mounted over the forward end of the casemate and the pine planking underneath the <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> casemate was replaced by oak.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Fourth Army {{consisting}} of 6,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry supported by 74 guns was commanded by General Mohammed Jemal Pasha. The army was headquartered at Amman. This army {{was composed of}} the VIII Corps' 48th Infantry Division, the Composite Division of a German battalion group, the Caucasus Cavalry Brigade, the division-sized Serstal Group, the 24th and 62nd Infantry Divisions, with the 3rd Cavalry Division in reserve. There were 6,000 Ottoman soldiers with 30 <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> II Corps, known as the Seria Group or Jordan Group, which garrisoned the Hejaz railway along the line from Ma'an southwards towards Mecca.|$|E
5|$|The <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{back of the}} {{forecastle}} have defied explanation, but {{one theory}} {{is that they were}} included to compensate for the guns that were positioned in the aftcastle, aiming forwards, but which would have been obscured due to the angle from which the ship was depicted. The list of ammunition, small firearms, longbows, arrows, pikes, and bills closely matches the archaeological evidence. As the source that is closest in time to the sinking of the Mary Rose, it has been of central importance for the archaeological project, especially in estimating the size of the crew.|$|E

5|$|The guns on {{the forward}} turret roof were {{transferred}} to the superstructure in 1914 and the guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure in 1914–1915; all of the four-inch <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, the {{guns on the}} aft turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun {{was added to the}} aft turret roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of ten 28 cm SK L/50 guns in five twin gun turrets. Her {{secondary}} armament consisted of twelve 15cm SK L/45 guns in casemates in the central portion {{of the ship and}} twelve 8.8cm SK L/45 <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bow, in the stern, and around the forward conning tower. She was also equipped with four 50cm (20in) submerged torpedo tubes.|$|E
5|$|The two ships, which rapidly became {{obsolescent}} due to {{the development}} of central battery ironclads and later turret ships, remained in service until the 1880s, having been modernized with new boilers and <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1870s. Neither ship {{played a role in the}} attack on Civitavecchia in 1870the last stage of the Italian wars of unificationowing to the very poor state of the Regia Marina in the aftermath of Lissa. Formidable served as a gunnery training ship from 1887 to 1903, when she was discarded. Terribile also served as a training ship, beginning in 1885; she was sold for scrap in 1904 and broken up thereafter.|$|E

5|$|The two-storied north-west bastion {{protected}} the castle against attack along the spit from the mainland, and housed the castle's original portcullis {{as well as}} providing accommodation for the garrison. It had three levels of gun positions on its ground floor, first floor and roof, which were adapted in the 19th century to house heavier weapons and shelter riflemen. The bastion links to an external caponier, a covered walkway with rifle loops for close defence, built in 1852. The north-east and south-east bastions are only one storey tall, originally holding two levels of gun positions on the ground floor and roofs, again both adapted to support heavier <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century.|$|E
5|$|A {{detachment}} of the British landing force then {{separated from the}} main body and seized a third battery named laNeuf, routing a force of local militia that attempted to block their advance with artillery assistance from the British squadron in the bay. The militia had come down from their garrisons in the surrounding hills and been joined by 110 French soldiers who had disembarked from Caroline, but the small French force was easily brushed aside by the British landing party. Keating and Willoughby then destroyed the <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first two captured batteries and stormed the remaining two fortifications, once again capturing them and using their own cannon to fire on the shipping in the harbour.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} Mark 2 {{was tested}} and proven on 8 April 1918, {{and the gun}} was scheduled to go into naval service in 1923. However, with the cancellation of both the Lexington and the South Dakota classes, no guns were installed on any ships even though 71 had been built and 44 were under construction. In 1922–24, twenty of the guns {{were given to the}} Army for use as coastal defense guns along with the Army's 16"/50 caliber M1919 guns. Later planning called for the use of these <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> s, but miscommunication between design bureaus led to the 16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun being used instead. As a result, all but three of the Navy's remaining Mark 2 and 3 guns were sent to the Army to also be used as coastal defense guns.|$|E
