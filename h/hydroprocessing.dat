Some of the applications of thermal conversion are combined heat and power (CHP) and co-firing. In a typical dedicated biomass power plant, efficiencies range from 20-27% (higher heating value basis). Biomass cofiring with coal, by contrast, typically occurs at efficiencies near those of the coal combustor (30-40%, higher heating value basis).|$|E
50|$|The {{existence}} in Alberta of {{large quantities of}} surface bitumen (oil) mixed with sand {{has been known for}} many years. In the late 1970s the commercial production of synthetic crude oil from this bitumen began near Fort McMurray. Construction at this site, by a company known as Syncrude, began in 1973 and the first crude oil was produced there in 1978. The complex and costly production process involves scraping the sticky bitumen-laden sand from the surface, transporting it to a processing facility, removing the sand from the bitumen and upgrading the bitumen to a product known as light sweet crude. The technical scale of the operation is very large. Initially the sandy tar-like bitumen was scrapped from the ground using gigantic powered rotating mechanical wheels equipped with scraping buckets and the oil sand was placed on conveyor belts for transport to the processing plant. However, the severely cold Albert winters caused the continuous breakdown of the machinery and a new technique was developed. This involves the use of gigantic power shovels and dumptrucks to deliver the bitumen laden sand to the processing plant. Once at the plant the bitumen is removed from the sand with a process that involves the use of hot water. The bitumen is then subjected to fluid coking, <b>hydroprocessing,</b> hydrotreating and reblending. Syncrude is the largest producer of synthetic crude oil from bitumen sand {{in the world and the}} largest producer of oil from a single site in Canada.|$|E

40|$|A {{previous}} Iowa State University (ISU) analysis {{published in}} 2010 investigated {{the technical and}} economic feasibility of the fast pyrolysis and <b>hydroprocessing</b> of biomass, {{and concluded that the}} pathway could produce cellulosic biofuels for a minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $ 2. 11 /gal. The 2010 ISU study was largely theoretical in that no commercial-scale fast pyrolysis facilities were being constructed at the time of publication. The present analysis expands upon the 2010 ISU study by performing an updated techno-economic analysis of the fast pyrolysis and <b>hydroprocessing</b> pathway. Recent advances in pathway technology and commercialization and new parameters suggested by the recent literature are accounted for. The MFSP for a 2000 MTPD facility employing fast pyrolysis and <b>hydroprocessing</b> to convert corn stover to gasoline and diesel fuel is calculated to quantify the economic feasibility of the pathway. The present analysis determines the MFSP of gasoline and diesel fuel produced via fast pyrolysis and <b>hydroprocessing</b> to be $ 2. 57 /gal.

Both the hydrogen production scenario (i. e. oil <b>hydroprocessing</b> using the hydrogen derived from bio-oil reforming) and the hydrogen purchase scenario (i. e. oil <b>hydroprocessing</b> using the hydrogen purchased from market) in three regions of China (Northeast China Plain (NECP), North China Plain (NCP) and Shaanxi Province (SXP)) have been investigated. The results have shown that maize production, and fast pyrolysis and <b>hydroprocessing</b> are the two biggest emergy input stages of the biofuel production system. The comparison of the emergy indices {{of all of the}} six cases investigated indicates that the hydrogen purchase scenario in NCP is the best biofuel production case due to its second best sustainability and the second highest production efficiency. In comparison to bioethanol from cassava chips and wheat and biodiesel from jatropha curcas L, the hydrogen purchase scenario in NCP is also the most sustainable plan for a biofuel production plant in China.

Waste cooking oil was hydroprocessed in a small scale <b>hydroprocessing</b> unit of CPERI/CERTH, using a commercial <b>hydroprocessing</b> catalyst. The total liquid product, after being separated from the gas product, was analyzed as per basic properties (density, viscosity) and simulated distillation curve according ASTM D 7213 procedure.

The cuts from this fractionating distillation were used in order to produce a fuel with properties that could be used as automotive diesel fuel. Depending on the final boiling point, the yield of this synthetic biodiesel ranged from 69. 5 % to 77. 9 % m/m. The cetane index of these fuels was very high (higher than 70).

40|$|We {{investigated}} the structural evolution of molybdenum carbides subjected to hot aqueous environments and their catalytic performance in low-temperature <b>hydroprocessing</b> of acetic acid. While bulk structures of Mo carbides were maintained after aging in hot liquid water, {{a portion of}} carbidic Mo sites were converted to oxidic sites. Water aging also induced changes to the non-carbidic carbon deposited during carbide synthesis and increased surface roughness, which in turn affected carbide pore volume and surface area. The extent of these structural changes was sensitive to the initial carbide structure and was lower under actual <b>hydroprocessing</b> conditions indicating the possibility of further improving the hydrothermal stability of Mo carbides by optimizing catalyst structure and operating conditions. Mo carbides were active in acetic acid conversion {{in the presence of}} liquid water, their activity being comparable to that of Ru/C.

The economic feasibility of a 2000 metric ton per day fast pyrolysis and <b>hydroprocessing</b> biorefinery is quantified based on 30 different state-specific facility locations within the United States. We calculate the 20 -year internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) for each location scenario as a function of state- and region-specific factors. This analysis demonstrates that biorefinery IRR and NPV are very sensitive to bio-oil yield, feedstock cost, location capital cost factor, and transportation fuel market value. The IRRs and NPVs generated for each scenario vary widely as a result, ranging from a low of 7. 4 % and -$ 79. 5 million in Illinois to a high of 17. 2 % and $ 165. 5 million in Georgia.

40|$|Biofuels {{have been}} {{identified}} as one of several GHG emission strategies to reduce the use of fossil fuels in the transport sector. Fast pyrolysis of biomass is one approach to producing second generation biofuels. The bio-oil product of fast pyrolysis can be upgraded into essential gasoline and diesel range products with conventional refinery technologies. Thus, it is important to assess their techno- economic and environmental performance at an early stage prior to commercialisation. This research was conducted with the goal of evaluating and comparing the techno-economic and environmental viability of the production of biofuels from fast pyrolysis of biomass and upgrading of bio-oil via two refinery technologies, viz. <b>hydroprocessing</b> and zeolite cracking. In order to achieve this aim, process models of fast pyrolysis of biomass and bio-oil upgrading via <b>hydroprocessing</b> and zeolite cracking were developed. The fast pyrolysis model was based on multi-step kinetic models. In addition, lumped kinetic models of the hydrodeoxygenation reactions of bio-oil were implemented. The models were verified against experimental measurements with good prediction and formed the foundation {{for the development of a}} 72 t/day fast pyrolysis plant model in Aspen Plus®. Several strategies were proposed for the two pathways to enhance energy efficiency and profitability. All in all, the results revealed that the <b>hydroprocessing</b> route is 16 % more efficient than the zeolite cracking pathway. Moreover, the <b>hydroprocessing</b> route resulted in a minimum fuel selling price of 15 % lower than that from the zeolite cracking pathway. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the techno-economic and environmental performance of the both pathways depends on several process, economic and environmental parameters. In particular, biofuel yield, operating cost and income tax were identified as the most sensitive techno-economic parameters, while changes in nitrogen feed gas to the pyrolysis reactor and fuel yield had the most environmental impact.

Experimental results obtained in pilot plant and semi-commercial scales for <b>hydroprocessing</b> of heavy oils are reported in this work. Mexican heavy crude oils (10, 13 and 16 °API) with high amount of impurities were used for all tests. <b>Hydroprocessing</b> was conducted at moderate reaction severity in two fixed-bed reactors in series. Removals of sulfur, metals and asphaltenes, as well as changes of API gravity and viscosity were monitored at different reaction conditions with time-on-stream.
