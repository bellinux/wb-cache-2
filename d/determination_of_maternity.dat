40|$|Determination of Parenthood Determination of {{parenthood}} is very actual topic due to {{the constant}} changes of the traditional understanding {{of the family and}} family relationships. It is primarily the development of modern medical science, biology or genetics that has brought new concepts into the issue of determination of parenthood. For example surrogacy, assisted reproduction or baby boxes. The legislation must responds to these changes in order to stabilized family relationships and to ensure their protection. The aim of this thesis is to describe and to analyze Czech legal regulation of determination of parenthood and to compare it with not only European but also global legislation. The analyse of valid legal regulation highlights questionable passages that may cause difficulties in its interpretation or practical application. The thesis is composed of nine chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of determination of parenthood. Opening chapter introduces the historical development of relationships between parents and children in Roman and European law.

Parenthood affects {{all of us}} and it's an important aspect of human life. That's why there should be legal assurance in relationship between parent and child. Development in the field of medicine is still ahead (mainly thanks to methods of assisted reproduction and DNA analysis) and the rules of law should respond and deal with it. The aim of this thesis is describe and become acquainted with problematics of determination of parenthood, valorize how legislation responds to modern development and to propose possible changes. Thesis is prepared on the basis of existing legislation on the date of submission of the thesis. Thesis is divided into seven main chapters, which are divided to further subsections.

40|$|DNA {{variation}} from randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (1, 2) {{has recently}} been helpful in addressing {{a wide range of}} evolutionary problems including the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> paternity and <b>maternity</b> (3). It has been greeted with particular enthusiasm because it is fast, technically easy and requires little material (4). By using single 10 base primers of arbitrary sequences to amplify DNA with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fingerprint-like bands are generated. Recently, however, concerns have been raised over the suitability of this method for determining parentage because non-parental bands often appear in offspring of known pedigrees (5). Here we report on the low occurrence of non-parental bands in two studies of parents and offspring using RAPD and make some suggestions on its application to avoid false interpretations from non-parental bands.

40|$|Parenthood - basic {{questions}} {{in the light of}} Czech and French law The purpose of the thesis is to analyse some {{basic questions}} of parenthood in the framework of Czech and French law. The author tries to compare chosen Czech juridical institutes with the same institutes of French law and to point out their common roman-law bases. On the one hand the family is an institute relatively stable, {{but on the other hand}} much influenced by the development of society. Some particular juridical institutes of family law which are dealt here are very ancient. But even they are confronted with sociological, cultural and scientific changes being under way in society. The thesis is composed of six chapters, each of them dealing in detail with different aspects of parenthood. Chapter One is introductory and defines the general notion of family and its historical and social development. Chapter Two compares two great historical civil-law codifications of 19 th century - Austrian ABGB (starting point of future Czech family law) and French Code civil. Third Chapter is very extensive; it deals with the question of parenthood and its <b>determination,</b> including presumptions <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> and paternity in both systems of law. Fourth and Fifth Chapter concerns legal consequences of parenthood from the point of view of private [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{parentage}} determination. At present, {{this issue is}} becoming more and more topical due to current diversion from traditional values, the traditional model of family in particular. The thesis concerns not only with the determination of paternity, but also with maternity determination, which is mentioned with regard to assisted reproduction and surrogacy. Emphasis is placed on both, current legislation and the new Civil Code coming into effect on 1 January 2014. The thesis is divided into eight chapters. The introduction discusses possible views on the concept of parenthood. Furthermore, it introduces the issue of parentage determination, especially in connection with the increasing number of children born outside marriage. The following chapter is devoted to legislative regulation of parentage determination itself. Firstly, it elaborates the history of such regulations with focus on Roman law and the Austrian Civil Code. Subsequently, it describes the current legislation and briefly comments on the new Civil Code, which is further discussed in the corresponding chapters. The third chapter examines the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>maternity.</b> Included are the issues of assisted reproduction and surrogacy, as well as anonymous and concealed births, which have become an important topic rather recently [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{paternity}} {{as one of}} the types of parenthood, specifically with the determination and denial of paternity. Main topics are analytically examined and described from the historical and comparative perspective. It systematically discusses the legal sources, the development of the concept, the general arrangements for parenthood, the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>maternity,</b> the determination of paternity and its three legal assumptions, the denial of paternity. In its final chapter, the thesis provides a comparative study on law in selected European countries and on the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights related to this issue. The thesis structure reflects that of the Family Act as amended, i. e. the chapter that deals with the determination of motherhood is followed by the chapeter on the determination and denial of paternity. The chapters that deal with the determination and denial of paternity respect the legal division of the issue regulated by the system of legal assumptions related to the determination of paternity. Given the extent of the concept of the determination and denial of paternity, the thesis deals with procedural issues, in particular with different types of evidence and the evolution of their use as a result of scientific developments in the field of biology, [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Abstract The aim of {{my thesis}} {{is to find}} and {{describe}} the problematic aspects of the determination of parenthood. I chose four areas of the determination of parenthood, {{which can lead to}} various complications - assisted reproduction, surrogacy, secret childbirths and anonymous births. In the first chapter of the thesis I deal with the legal aspects of the determination of parenthood. I examine mandatory <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> and various assumptions of paternity. With the development of relations in the society and of the reproductive medicine, there emerge possibilities doubting the traditional legal principles of the determination of parenthood. Mother is not always certain anymore and there are five presumptions of paternity in the Czech legal order nowadays, compared to the traditional three. The second chapter is devoted to the issue of assisted reproduction. Assisted reproduction is a modern and rapidly developing area of medicine that allows infertile couples to have their own child. It is a medical specialty that requires a broad legal framework to prevent its abuse. At the end of a successful medical procedure a new life is coming into existence and such area must be regulated. The third chapter, entitled Surrogacy, builds on the previous chapter. Surrogacy is often discussed area of [...] ...|$|E

Kristeva. The author studies the possibility of considering the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>maternity,</b> addressing gender’s theories and concepts of feminist’s thought, and their interpretations through the «active» nature <b>of</b> <b>maternity.</b> The problem <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> was addressed both by the ancient Greek’s thinkers as Plato of modern and postmodern scientists using philosophical approaches and attitudes. Among the various theories and concepts which are related to the study <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> as a phenomenon the attention is attracted the views of by J.

In philosophical understanding <b>of</b> <b>maternity,</b> Kristeva uses psychoanalysis, semiotics, linguistics, etc., in which Kristeva skillfully integrates her own theoretical developments. The article is focused on the author’s judgment that the relevance of studying the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> is due to those social challenges of the beginning of the XXI century, which {{led to the formation of}} new institutional currents in the studies <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> and new processes of reflective thinking, which are based on studying discourses and narratives in the parent’s relationships...|$|R

40|$|The {{reason why}} I chose {{the issue of}} {{determination}} of paternity as a topic of my thesis {{is the fact that}} most of us will meet with this institute during our lifetime. The aim of this thesis is to analyze and describe the institute of determination of paternity, especially in the view of the applicable legislation. The thesis is composed of eight chapters. Chapter One deals with family and parenthood and defines the basic terms, sucha as the biological, social and legal parenthood. Chapter Two is subdivided into two parts and focuses on the legislation of paternity. Part One describes the historical development of parenthood, part Two briefly describes the source of law witch contains the current legislation. The next chapter concerns the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>maternity,</b> which is closely connected to the institute of paternity. Chapter Three, apart from the applicable legislation, also includes a subchapter about hidden birth and a subchapter that documents surrogacy. The following chapter already concentrates on the current Czech legislation of determination of paternity, which is included in the civil code. This chapter consists of six parts that closely describe various possibilities of determination of paternity in the Czech republic.

40|$|In Nolan v. LaBree, {{a husband}} and wife filed a {{complaint}} seeking a judgment declaring their legal parentage of a newborn child born via gestational surrogacy. All parties surrounding the birth of this child entered into a surrogacy contract and are in agreement that the genetic mother and father bringing this suit should be declared as the legal parents. When the child was born, however, the birth certificate did not reflect the intentions of the contract, listing the parents as the surrogate mother and the surrogate mother’s spouse. The trial court, following an uncontested hearing, declared the requested paternity determination but held there was no statutory authority permitting a similar <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> and, therefore, declined to make such a declaration. The plaintiffs appealed to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, sitting as the Law Court, contending that the trial court erred in its aforementioned denial of maternity declaration based on lack of statutory authority. This case brought an important issue to the Law Court regarding parentage in artificial reproductive technique births. The issue invited the Law Court to determine the judicial remedy with respect to parentage when a child is born via gestational surrogacy, where the legislature has avoided such controversial topics, creating uncertainty for both courts and families in Maine. The Law court in Nolan interprets the sparse statutory language in a way that ultimately provides for a declaration of parental in the case at hand, but the question becomes: is it enough? This Note considers whether the Law Court’s rationale and narrow holding, interpreting statutory language as providing power to the courts to determine and declare both paternity and maternity following a birth via surrogacy, is adequate, or whether the legislature should take further action to provide concrete guidance to both families and courts involving surrogacy arrangements where all parties are in accord as to the identity of the intended parents. This Note next reviews the development of surrogacy agreements and private ordering in family law within the jurisdictions that have addressed the issue. It moves on to reveal and contrast the multifarious approaches taken by different states. This Note then discusses the treatment of such agreements in Maine, ultimately revealing the lack of attention given to the area surrounding artificial reproductive techniques. This Note recognizes the unwillingness to adopt comprehensive legislation on the topic but suggest that the issues, once deemed controversial, are less controversial today and a course of action must be embarked upon to keep pace with societal changes and scientific developments. The ultimate recommendation proffered by this Note is to take the first step down this path of modernizing Maine law by minimal legislative action permitting courts to validate certain gestational surrogacy agreements, which would in turn have the effect of automatically terminating the parental rights of the surrogate and her husband, if any, upon the child’s birth...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the {{implementation}} <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance at district health office in Buol regency in 2012. This study was a qualitative study using case study approach. The samples {{in this study were}} the parties involved in the implementation <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance at district health office in Buol regency and at the health center. The sampling was conducted by purposive sampling technique with a sample size of 23 people. The results showed that during the phase of funding: the distribution of funds were lately paid i. e. at the end of 2012; the amount of service rates was 25 % deductions for service providers; and for fund management, {{it was found that the}} process of verification of the claimed file was very difficult. During the phase of care benefits package in terms of availability of health care, providers became an obstacle in the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>maternity</b> insurance. During the phase of indicator of success in terms of supervision, there was a lack of supervision from the program manager <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance that opened some problems in the implementation <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance in Buol district. From this study it can be concluded that the phase of funding, benefits package services, and indicators of success still need attention. This study suggests the District Government of Buol to re-visit the policy decisions regarding the amount of fees that had been set for the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>maternity</b> insurance. To make maternity insurance to be implemented optimally, the midwives need to perform additional services that can be implemented well. Buols district health offices is expected to optimize the implementation <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance by improving the mechanism of disbursement of verification process and increasing the supervision by the program manager <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance. And for service providers in order to implement the procedures <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> insurance proccess, they should take into account the condition of the community served.

Within each pair, the applicants' characteristics are similar except for their gender. We find significant discrimination against women with a high probability <b>of</b> <b>maternity</b> for highly qualified administrative jobs. In the other cases, unequal treatment between genders is not significant. So, controlling for female probability <b>of</b> <b>maternity,</b> we find no significant unequal treatment between genders.
