Across from the exhibit is a large pond for Chilean flamingos and coscoroba swans.|$|E
25|$|The trachea {{is an area}} of dead space: the oxygen-poor air it {{contains}} at the end of exhalation is the first air to re-enter the posterior air sacs and lungs. In comparison to the mammalian respiratory tract, the dead space volume in a bird is, on average, 4.5times greater than it is in mammals of the same size. Birds with long necks will inevitably have long tracheae, and must therefore take deeper breaths than mammals do to make allowances for their greater dead space volumes. In some birds (e.g. the whooper swan, Cygnus cygnus, the white spoonbill, Platalea leucorodia, the whooping crane, Grus americana, and the <b>helmeted</b> <b>curassow,</b> Pauxi pauxi) the trachea, which some cranes can be 1.5m long, is coiled back and forth within the body, drastically increasing the dead space ventilation. The purpose of this extraordinary feature is unknown.|$|E
50|$|The genus Pauxi {{consists}} of the three species of <b>helmeted</b> <b>curassows,</b> terrestrial black fowl with ornamental casque on their heads. All are found in South America.|$|R
50|$|Their {{evolutionary}} {{history is not}} well researched compared to other <b>curassows.</b> The <b>helmeted</b> <b>curassows</b> probably are a lineage of Late Miocene (Tortonian - Messinian, about 8-7 million years ago) origin. This species' present-day distribution suggests that it became isolated some 6 million years ago as its mountain range uplifted. It is not known when gene flow between the subspecies ceased.|$|R
50|$|As {{indicated}} by analysis of mt and nDNA sequences and calibrated with geological data, this genus' ancestors probably diverged {{from those of}} Mitu, their closest living relatives, in the Tortonian (early Late Miocene), some 8-7.4 mya. How the present distribution in 4 small areas quite distant from each other came to be is not known. Given that <b>helmeted</b> <b>curassows</b> are birds of the foothills and uplands, {{it might be that}} the ancestral Pauxi population became fragmented by the uplift of the Andes, which in their area of distribution took place during the Late Miocene, around the Pauxi-Mitu divergence and some time after.(Pereira & Baker 2002, Pereira et al. 2002).|$|R

50|$|The {{only member}} in {{monotypic}} genus Oreophasis, the horned guan is distributed in humid mountain forests of southeast Mexico-(Chiapas) and Guatemala of Central America. It {{is found in}} altitude up to 3,350 metres. Its diet consists mainly of fruits, green leaves and invertebrates. The female usually lays up to two eggs.The horned guan is not a true guan, but merely resembles these birds most in overall shape and color, whereas the horn is more reminiscent of the <b>helmeted</b> <b>curassows.</b> In fact, this species is the only survivor of a very ancient lineage of cracids that has been evolving independently from all other living members of this family for at least 20, possibly as much as 40 million years.|$|R

50|$|The {{horned curassow}} {{is among the}} largest cracid species. It {{measures}} 85 to 95 cm in length. Body mass in large males is up to 3.7 to 3.9 kg and only the great curassow is heavier amongst the cracids, although the black curassow and the closely related <b>helmeted</b> <b>curassow</b> are around the same length. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 38.1 to 40.2 cm, the tail is 31 to 34.8 cm and the tarsus is 10 to 10.8 cm. It has a distinctive horn or casque on the forehead which projects for over 6 cm. The plumage is generally black, but lacks a blue sheen in primary feathers, and has a white belly, thigh tufts and under-tail coverts. The tail also has white tips.|$|E

5000|$|The {{horned curassow}} or {{southern}} <b>helmeted</b> <b>curassow</b> (Pauxi unicornis) is {{a species of}} bird in the Cracidae family found in humid tropical and subtropical forests. It was first described by James Bond and Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee in 1939 from a specimen collected in Bolivia, and further birds that were described by Weske & Terborgh from Peru in 1971 {{were thought to be}} a subspecies. However, the taxonomical position of this 1971 species or subspecies is unclear and {{further research is needed to}} clarify the position. The horned curassow as originally described is endemic to Bolivia. It is a large, predominantly black bird with a distinctive casque on its forehead. It is an uncommon bird with a limited range and is suffering from habitat loss, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being [...] "critically endangered".|$|E
50|$|Pereira & Baker (2002) {{reported}} an interesting find: in the mtDNA phylogeny, Pauxi was paraphyletic, with P. unicornis being resolved as the sister species of Mitu tuberosa. This, of course, {{does not automatically}} imply that they are closely related or that the genera are invalid. Rather, the authors point out, given the distinct and peculiar morphology of the two genera, incomplete lineage sorting or hybridization between ancestral individuals of the two species is a more likely explanation. According to their data, {{there must have been}} some extent of gene flow between Mitu tuberosa and P. unicornis around 2 mya. Unfortunately, the authors do not provide subspecific identification of their single P. unicornis specimen. In any case, they took care to exclude captive hybridization in their choice of samples, as it is frequently known to occur in curassows and would have confounded the analysis. Altogether, what can be said with certainty is that there seems to have been some extent of hybridization between at least one population of the southern <b>helmeted</b> <b>curassow</b> and female razor-billed curassows {{at the end of the}} Pliocene.|$|E
40|$|We {{estimated}} the population {{density of the}} <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Curassow</b> (Pauxi pauxi) in Tama National Park (TNP) Colombia, using visual counts between December 2006 and December 2008. We used six line transects (1 km each) equitably distributed in a natural forest between 800 and 1, 200 m asl {{in the southern part}} of the park. The sampling effort was 588 hrs with a total distance of 490 km, a detection rate of 0. 06 records/hr, and an encounter rate of 0. 08 individuals/km. Only solitary individuals were recorded (n = 40); the estimated density was 4. 8 individuals/km(2). Most detections occurred in the lower strata of the forest (floor and sub-canopy) where hunters take advantage of curassows in the lower strata for successful harvest. The southern sector of TNP becomes important in the dry season. Our study suggests a large population is in TNP, but harvesting activities including removal of eggs, chicks, and juveniles, and hunting adults are affecting the reproductive rate and population of the species.
