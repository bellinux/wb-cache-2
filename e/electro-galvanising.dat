50|$|Applications include use as anodes in {{electrolytic}} {{cells for}} producing free chlorine from saltwater in swimming pools, in electrowinning of metals, in {{printed circuit board}} manufacture, electrotinning and zinc <b>electro-galvanising</b> of steel, as anodes for cathodic protection of buried or submerged structures.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Electro-galvanised</b> (EG) {{coated steel}} {{consists}} of a cold reduced substrate onto which a layer of zinc is coated by an electrolytic process.|$|R
40|$|Based on PVD (physical vapour deposition) of thin {{additional}} metallic layers on already <b>electro-galvanised</b> {{steel strip}} novel approaches to highly corrosion resistant zinc alloy coatings have been developed. In particular promising {{is the system}} Zn-Mg. Through the successful up-scaling of this approach from a laboratory scale to a continuous pilot line with line speed up to 60 m/min and strip width of 300 mm such novel pre-coated materials have been made available for application oriented investigations on a larger scale. In this paper, first results of an extensive study on application properties of Zn-Mg alloy coated steel sheet are reported. The properties of this prototype product are {{described in terms of}} corrosion, forming and welding characteristics. The advantages compared to conventional up to date products are presented...|$|R
