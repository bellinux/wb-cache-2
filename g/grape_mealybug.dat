50|$|Pseudococcus viburni (formerly Pseudococcus affinis (Maskell), and {{commonly}} known as the obscure mealybug and tuber mealybug) is a close relative of the <b>grape</b> <b>mealybug</b> (P. maritimus) and a pest of the vineyards of New Zealand, the Central Coast of California, and the tea gardens of northern Iran. Unlike the <b>grape</b> <b>mealybug,</b> the obscure mealybug is not native to California, having most likely been introduced to the region from either Australia or South America {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century.|$|E
40|$|In the 1930 s and 1940 s, {{little was}} known about viruses, and {{information}} on plant diseases caused by viruses {{was just beginning to}} appear in the scientific literature. Problems with grapevines in California, first referred to as “red leaf,” were initially attributed to inexperience in viticultural techniques and poor growing conditions. However, the problem was later identified as leafroll disease, which causes red leaves, and poor yields and fruit quality. We evaluated its rate of spread for 5 years in a Napa Valley vineyard, and found an average rate of more than 10 % per year. Leafroll disease can be vectored by low-level populations of <b>grape</b> <b>mealybugs,</b> and is now spreading rapidly in at least one Napa Valley vineyard for unknown reasons. Using stock for planting vines that is certified as virus-free is a key strategy in preventing the spread of grapevine leafroll disease...|$|R
50|$|The Maconellicoccus hirsutus, (also {{known as}} the pink, <b>grape</b> or {{hibiscus}} <b>mealybug)</b> is a pest of many plants, trees, and shrubs. It infests hibiscus, citrus, coffee, sugar cane, annonas, plums, guava, mango (although, mango mealybug is more problematic), okra, sorrel, teak, mora, pigeon pea, peanut, grapevine, maize, asparagus, chrysanthemum, beans, cotton, soybean, cocoa, and many other plants. The pest forms colonies on the host plant, and if left undisturbed, the colonies will grow into large masses of white waxy coverings on branches, fruiting structures, leaves, and even whole plants, including large trees.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{important}} for vintners {{to distinguish between the}} obscure mealybug and its close relatives, the <b>grape</b> and vine <b>mealybug.</b> The obscure mealybug has longer, thinner, and more crooked filaments than does the vine mealybug, making the obscure mealybug look comparatively untidy. The most distinctive feature of the obscure mealybug is the set of two to four exceptionally long caudal filaments growing from the posterior of large nymphs and adult females. The insect's waxy secretion accumulates heavily on these filaments, making it appear to have several long [...] "tails".|$|R
50|$|Pseudococcus maritimus, the <b>grape</b> <b>mealybug,</b> is a {{scale insect}} {{species in the}} genus Pseudococcus infecting grapevines. It is also a vector of little cherry disease.|$|E
50|$|The obscure {{mealybug}} more closely resembles the <b>grape</b> <b>mealybug</b> {{than it does}} the vine mealybug, but the two can be distinguished {{by the color of}} the defensive fluid they secrete when disturbed; grape mealybugs secrete reddish-orange fluid, while {{obscure mealybug}}s secrete clear fluid. When crushed, the obscure mealybug's body contents (guts) are pinkish-grey.|$|E
50|$|The obscure {{mealybug}} {{is thought to}} have evolved in Australia or South America. Its history in North America is not clear; from 1900 (when P. maritimus, the <b>grape</b> <b>mealybug,</b> was first described) to 1960, the {{obscure mealybug}} was variably misidentified as or synonymized with P. maritimus, P. longispinus, P. obscurus Essig, P. capensis Brian, P. malacearum Ferris, and P. affinis (Maskell). This taxonomic confusion has hampered attempts to trace the exact origin of the species, but its presence in both Australia and South America strongly suggests that it is of Gondwanan origin.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Washington State UniversityA graft-transmissible disease showing red veins, red blotches and {{reddening}} of leaves, {{designated as}} grapevine redleaf disease (GRD), {{was observed in}} wine grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), three distinct viruses (a geminivirus, Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus [GRSPaV] and Grapevine fanleaf virus [GFLV]) and four viroids (Hop stunt viroid, Grapevine yellow speckle viroid 1, Citrus exocortis viroid and Citrus exocortis Yucatan viroid) were identified in grapevines showing GRD symptoms and GRSPaV and all four viroids in non-symptomatic grapevines. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the geminivirus, tentatively named as Grapevine redleaf-associated virus (GRLaV), represents an evolutionarily distinct member in the family Geminiviridae. GRLaV was transmitted by Virginia creeper leafhopper (Erythroneura ziczac Walsh) under greenhouse conditions. Fruit yield and berry quality parameters were significantly affected in Merlot and Cabernet Franc grapevines showing GRD symptoms compared to non-symptomatic vines. Biochemical analysis showed higher quantities of carbohydrates in symptomatic leaves suggesting their possible role in symptom expression. A SYBR Green-based reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) combined with melting curve analysis (MCA) was developed for specific and sensitive detection of Grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (GLRaV- 1, - 2, - 3, and - 4), GRLaV, Grapevine virus A, Grapevine virus B, GFLV and Tomato ringspot virus in grapevines. The assay was also used successfully for detection of GLRaV- 3 in <b>grape</b> <b>mealybugs</b> and GRLaV in Virginia creeper leafhoppers. This method {{has the potential for}} practical applications to study epidemiology of grapevine viruses. The complete genome of a naturally occurring GLRaV- 2 strain causing asymptomatic infections in the wine grape cultivar Sangiovese (GLRaV- 2 -SG) was determined to be 16, 474 nucleotide (nt) long. In pairwise comparisons, the genome of GLRaV- 2 -SG was closely related to GLRaV- 2 -OR 1 from USA, and GLRaV- 2 - 93 / 9555 from South Africa, and distantly related to GLRaV- 2 -BD from Italy and GLRaV- 2 -RG from USA. GLRaV- 2 -SG had little impact on fruit yield and berry soluble solids and pH, but significantly affected berry anthocyanins when compared to grapevines not infected with the virus. The occurrence of asymptomatic strains of GLRaV- 2 highlights limitations to symptom-based disease surveys and underscores the need for accurate diagnosis of asymptomatic infections.

40|$|Mealybugs, {{a family}} of soft, oval-bodied pests (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae), are known vectors (carriers) of the grapevine leafroll {{associated}} viruses (GLRaVs) of <b>grape.</b> Very often <b>mealybug</b> infestations can exist in vineyards without detection by growers for one or more years after initial infestation. It is difficult to visually see infestations of mealybugs because of their cryptic lifestyle where they often remain hidden within vine trunks, clusters, canopy, and roots. Growers should use pheromone-baited traps to help follow possible infestation of mealybugs in their vineyard. This document gives details on how pheromone traps {{should be used to}} ensure optimal catches and early detection.

40|$|UC Davis's Foundation Plant Materials Service (FPMS) {{maintains}} the disease-tested, professionally identified collection of grape scion and rootstock varieties, {{which is the}} core of the California Grapevine Registration and Certification Program. In 1992, newly developed serological testing techniques revealed the presence of grapevine leafroll­associated viruses (GLRaVs) in previously healthy vines in an older foundation propagating block, indicating active and recent virus spread. FPMS responded by increasing isolation distances and implementing a comprehensive virus screening program using the new methodology. The critical problem was the lack of information on leafroll virus epidemiology. When the distribution of infected plants in the old vineyard was mapped, new infections were frequently adjacent to known diseased grapevines. This study examined the ability of mealybugs, a putative leafroll vector, to transmit this group of viruses. We were able to confirm that four species found in California obscure, longtailed, citrus and <b>grape</b> <b>mealybug</b> can transmit GLRaV- 3 isolates. This is the first experimental evidence of grapevine leafroll virus trans-mission by obscure and <b>grape</b> <b>mealybug.</b> In addition, we report {{for the first time that}} GLRaV- 5 can be transmitted by longtailed mealybug...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{arthropods}} on {{pome fruits}} can cause export problems and disrupt commercial markets. Eliminating {{insects and mites}} on the packing line {{would be the last}} opportunity to provide for pest-free produce. In this study, an experimental packing line was used to evaluate techniques using different surfactant baths, pressurized water sprays, and styles of rotating brushes to remove field-collected and laboratory-reared <b>grape</b> <b>mealybug,</b> Pseudococcus maritimus (Ehrhorn) (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae), the diapausing two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) and the woolly apple aphid, Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausman) (Homoptera: Aphididae). The organosilicone Silwet L- 77 was no more effective than a silicone-based food grade defoamer in aiding removal. Mechanical methods, such as the style of rotating brushes and pressurized sprays, were significantly effective in removing surface arthropods. No improvement in removal occurred when pressure was increased beyond 420 kPa. These techniques can be easily adapted to commercial facilities and will reduce the incidence of surface arthropods on marketed fresh fruits...|$|E
40|$|Vineyard {{blocks in}} which we {{released}} Pseudaphycus angelicus, an important <b>grape</b> <b>mealybug</b> parasitoid, in 2000 were monitored in the 2001 season. In the Tulare County table grape block, lowered levels of mealybug damage and elevated levels of parasitism (compared to 2000) were found throughout the release and control plots, suggesting that overwintered parasitoid had moved from the initial release location. Releases planned for the 2001 season were less successful because of low insectary production of P. angelicus. Mid-season releases with {{a small number of}} parasitoids did not show any affect on mealybug density or damage ratings. Similarly, releases of green lacewing eggs did not show a reduction of mealybugs or economic damage. Studies testing alternative bait-control for the Argentine ant were tested. A 25 % sugar solution and small amounts (0. 001 - 0. 0001 %) of either imidacloprid, fipronil or thiomethoxam were placed in bait traps throughout a heavily infested Napa Valley wine grape vineyard. Results show a significant late-season reduction of ant activity at the fipronil and thiomethoxam treatments. However, there was no reduction in mealybug density or increase in parasitoid activity. While results showed no economic reduction of Argentine ants, we are encouraged by new information gained and will make the needed adjustments for study in the 2002 season...|$|E
