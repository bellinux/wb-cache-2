David Bowie (portraying himself) sees the video and sends an e-mail to Will, explaining that he is starting an indie music label and is interested in having the band {{as one of their}} first artists. Will is so excited and overwhelmed that he falls <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the school hallway (close to the same position as the front cover of Bowie's Lodger album).

5|$|Controversy {{continued}} to flare in Britain {{and other countries}} regarding sporting links with South Africa. The South Africa rugby team's 1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London to hijack the South African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where people {{tried to stop the}} South Africans from reaching the match venue by lying <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the street. The South Africa cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards, and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before the South Africans were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government. Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during the South Africa rugby team's 1971 tour led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and barbed wire, and a state of emergency in Queensland, all of which prompted the Australian Cricket Board to cancel the tour by the South Africa cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Test at Adelaide, both Lindwall and Miller broke <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> match, leaving Australia two bowlers short. In their absence, Johnston took 5/110 and 2/67 but Australia {{were unable}} to force a win. He sent down 587 balls for the entire match. Lindwall and Miller {{were unable to}} play in the Fifth Test, and in their absence, the South Africans were able to score heavily. Johnston had a large workload, taking 6/152 and 1/114 as the {{tourists}} won by six wickets to level the series 2–2. On this occasion, Johnston sent down 662 balls for the match. In the last two Tests, Johnston conceded more than 100 runs in three of the four innings with the increased burden in his colleagues' absence; the only previous occasion when he had conceded a century of runs in an innings was in the First Test against England in 1948 when Lindwall broke down mid-match. Johnston was again Australia's leading wicket-taker with 21 wickets, but his average of 35.10 was substantially higher than in previous seasons, as Australia struggled to a 2–2 series result. It was the first time Australia had not won a Test series since the 1938 Ashes tour. Yet, he remained the top ranked ICC Test Bowler for three consecutive years from 1950. His best effort against the South Africans was in the second tour match between Victoria and the tourists, in which he totalled 7/122. Aided by his two ten-wicket match hauls against Queensland, Johnston totalled 59 wickets at 26.47 for the season.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of each round each player is dealt ten cards, with the two remaining cards (the so-called Skat) being put face <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the table. Dealing follows this pattern: deal three cards each, then deal the Skat, then four cards each, then three cards again (“three–Skat–four–three”). In four-player rounds, the dealer does not receive any cards and skips actual play of the round. He or she may peek into the hand of one other player (if allowed to do so) but never into the Skat.|$|E
25|$|After an {{exchange}} of punts to begin the second half, Maroney saw his first carries of the game on a drive that appeared to end in a 4-yard Moss touchdown pass before the catch was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty. The next three plays were incomplete passes by Brady, and on fourth down, Gostkowski missed a 32-yard field goal to keep the score at 24–21 {{in favor of the}} Patriots. The Eagles responded with a 10-play, 78-yard drive, retaking the lead on an 8-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Brown. After an unsuccessful fourth down conversion attempt from the Eagles' 33-yard line, the Patriots defense held the Eagles to a three-and-out, forcing a punt. On a third <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the Patriots' next drive, Welker, who finished with 13 catches on the night, caught a 16-yard pass that moved the ball into the Eagles' red zone. With 7:24 left in the game, Maroney put the Patriots ahead 31–28 with a 4-yard touchdown run. The Eagles moved the ball to the Patriots' 29-yard line on their next drive, but on 2nd and 4, Feeley was intercepted by Samuel in the end zone with 2:49 remaining in the game. The Patriots, unable to run out the clock, punted, giving the Eagles the ball back with 18seconds remaining. Feeley's last pass attempt was intercepted by Sanders to seal the Patriots' eleventh win of the season as they improved to 11–0.|$|E

25|$|His {{first task}} was {{a tour of}} Pakistan in 1994, where Australia had not won a Test since the 1959. To make matters worse, Australia's first-choice pace pairing of Craig McDermott and Merv Hughes missed the tour due to injury. The First Test at Karachi was a {{personal}} disaster for Taylor as he scored a pair, the first player in Test history to do so on his captaincy debut. Paceman Glenn McGrath then broke <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the match. Australia was in the box seat with Pakistan needing 56 runs with one wicket in hand, but lost by one wicket after Ian Healy missed a stumping opportunity and the ball went for the winning runs. Recovering to score 69 in the Second Test at Rawalpindi, Taylor forced Pakistan to follow on after taking a 261-run lead. However, he dropped Pakistan captain Salim Malik {{when he was on}} 20. Malik went on to make 237 as Pakistan made 537 and saved the Test. Australia again took a first innings lead in the Third Test, but could not force a result, as Malik scored another second innings century to ensure safety and a 1–0 series win. Taylor ended the series with 106 runs at 26.50. Australia fared better in the ODI triangular tournament, winning five of their six matches. Taylor scored 56 in the final as Australia beat Pakistan by 64 runs to end the tournament with 193 runs at 32.16.|$|E
25|$|A {{fortress}} {{was built}} {{during the reign}} of Henry II as the ancestral home of the Fitzhugh family, who purchased the land from the nuns of Marrick Priory. The fortress would have offered protection to the local population during Scottish raids from north of the border. King John was entertained there in 1201. The Fitzhughs were appointed barons on 15 May 1321. Ralph de Greystoke, 3rd Baron Greystoke, was born in the castle, home of his uncle Henry, Lord Fitzhugh, on 18 October 1353. Henry FitzHugh, 3rd Baron FitzHugh was appointed Lord Chamberlain of the Household by Henry V. Henry Fitzhugh built the now Grade I listed Ravensworth Castle in 1391 on the site of a previous fortress from the 11th century, and also received licence to enclose 200 acres of land around the castle to make a park. Robert FitzHugh became Bishop of London in 1431. After the end of the Fitzhugh male line in 1513, ownership of the castle and estate was passed through the female line to Sir Thomas Parr. Following his death, it passed to his son, a minor, William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton by which time it was ruined, {{largely as a result of}} being quarried for local building materials. It passed to the Crown Estate in 1571 after Parr died without issue. The castle began to be pulled <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 16th century, shortly after the visitation by the antiquarian John Leland, however almost the entirety of the gatehouse remains intact. In 1629 the estate was conferred from the Crown to Edward Ditchfield. In 1633 it was sold to the Robinson family, who later sold it to Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton in 1676. It then passed to Wharton's son Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton, before passing through his sister to Robert Byerley. By 1779 the estate belonged to the Legard Baronets.|$|E
500|$|Although the Pittston strike {{involved}} coal miners, many of {{the supporters}} of the strike were not miners at all. A majority of the support that the union members received was from women, who were a pivotal aspect of the strike. Many of these women were either wives or daughters of miners who worked for Pittston, but some women supporters had no affiliation with Pittston Coal Company or mining at all. The women would sit <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> roads causing blockages while others would drive slowly in front of coal trucks to cause delays. Two famous groups of women supporters arose during this time; [...] "The Daughters of Mother Jones" [...] and [...] "The Freedom Fighters". At {{the peak of the}} strike around 500 women were involved in supporting the miners, most of them housewives.|$|E

500|$|Although {{a number}} of franchisees bought the Collectramatic, which {{had the support of}} Colonel Sanders from 1970 onwards, John Y.

I was mostly afraid these new fryers would break <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> business." [...] Brown warned franchisees that they were in violation of their contract if they used the Collectramatic. Brown held his ground on the issue until he learned that his father, John Y. Brown Sr., who owned multiple KFC franchises, was successfully using the Collectramatic in every franchise he owned. [...] The issue was eventually resolved after Heublein purchased KFC, acquired Hartzog and nullified the contract. The Collectramatic has been an approved pressure fryer for KFC from 1972 onwards.|$|E
500|$|The entire {{company of}} musicians {{traveled}} {{together in one}} bus, although the buses used for the tour were wholly inadequate, breaking down and being replaced with astounding frequency. [...] Griggs estimates that five separate buses {{were used in the}} first 11 days of the tour -- [...] "reconditioned school buses, not good enough for school kids." [...] The artists themselves were responsible for loading and unloading equipment at each stop, as no road crew assisted them. Adding to the disarray, the buses were not equipped for the weather which consisted of waist-deep snow in several areas and varying temperatures from the 20s to as low as -36°F. [...] One bus had a heating system that broke down shortly after the tour began, in Appleton, Wisconsin. [...] Later, Richardson and Valens began experiencing flu-like symptoms and drummer Bunch was hospitalized for severely frostbitten feet, after the tour bus simply broke <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the highway in subzero temperatures near Ironwood, Michigan. The musicians replaced that bus with another school bus and kept traveling. After Bunch was hospitalized, Carlo Mastrangelo of The Belmonts took over the drumming duties. When Dion and The Belmonts were performing, the drum seat was taken by either Valens or Holly. As Holly's group had been the backing band for all of the acts, Holly, Valens, and DiMucci took turns playing drums for each other at the performances in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Clear Lake, Iowa.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after his}} return in February 2000, at Bash at the Beach on July 9, Hogan was {{involved}} in a controversial work with Vince Russo. Hogan was scheduled to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Before the match, there was a backstage dispute between Hogan and Russo; Hogan wanted to take the title, but Russo was going to have Jarrett win, and lose it to Booker T. Russo told Hogan {{that he was going to}} have Jarrett lie down for him, simulating a real conflict, although Jarrett was not told it was a work. When the bell rang, Jarrett lay <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the ring while Russo threw the WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt in the ring and yelled at Hogan from ringside to pin Jarrett. A visibly confused Hogan complied with a foot on Jarrett's chest after getting on the microphone and telling Russo, [...] "Is this your idea, Russo? That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in, because of bullshit like this!" [...] After winning and being announced as the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Hogan immediately took the WCW title belt. Moments later, Russo returned to the ring, angrily proclaiming, [...] "I can guarantee you that this is the last time you will ever see that piece of shit in a WCW stadium!" [...] This is also when the public discovered, through Russo, the [...] "creative control" [...] clause that Hogan had, which meant that Hogan was able to control what would happen with his own character and be able to do so without anyone else being able to tell him no. In his Bash at the Beach shoot promo, Russo said that he was arguing with Hogan all day prior to the event in the back because he wanted to use the clause in the Jarrett match, saying, [...] "That means that, in the middle of this ring, when [...] knew it was bullshit, he beats Jeff Jarrett!". Since Hogan refused to job to Jarrett, a new WCW World Heavyweight Championship was created, setting the stage for a title match between Booker T and Jarrett later that night.|$|E
