5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1907, SDSU (then South Dakota State College) played Dakota Wesleyan at home in Brookings, South Dakota. The students, hungry for a win, participated in a [...] "Nightshirt Parade" [...] to stir up enthusiasm for the {{upcoming}} game. The men dressed in their nightshirts and women <b>dressed</b> in <b>sheets.</b> The students continued the tradition every homecoming day until in 1911, when the college administration deemed it undignified and un-ladylike for women to <b>dress</b> up in <b>sheets</b> and wander the streets. As a result, the homecoming tradition was ended and a new one needed to form.|$|R

It's known specially for its most notable craftsmanship: the ao po'i, a fine cloth made in cotton {{that could be seen}} in shirts, <b>dresses,</b> blouses, <b>sheets</b> and others. Hundreds of artisans of Yataity get ready for the [...] "Typical Vestments Market" [...] made in the central square every November.|$|R

This was evidenced by the eyewitness accounts of girls who lived in East Hall. From there, Isabella's spirit moved to the Music Hall and resided there until 1948 then that building was also torn down. Just before the Music Hall was dismantled, {{a group of young}} men, <b>dressed</b> in <b>sheets,</b> coaxed Isabella from the doomed building.|$|R
60|$|Now {{there was}} a great excitement, not only {{on the part of the}} believers, but among the spirits themselves; and Rogers, who had enlisted two new men in his scheme, made his ghosts work hard to keep up the {{delusion}} among his followers. All four of them, <b>dressed</b> in <b>sheets,</b> went about making communications whenever they had a chance, and assuring the members of the band of treasure hunters that everything would soon be all right, and that they must not allow their faith to be shaken by gossipers and scandalmongers.|$|R

She is dressed in a light-coloured, short sleeved, floor-length <b>dress,</b> holding a <b>sheet</b> of paper in front of her. Zorka Todosić (1864 – 1936) was considered the grande dame of the Royal Serbian National Theatre in Belgrade...|$|R

5000|$|The {{molecular}} {{and packing}} structures of collagen have eluded scientists over decades of research. The first {{evidence that it}} possesses a regular structure {{at the molecular level}} was presented in the mid-1930s. Since that time, many prominent scholars, including Nobel laureates Crick, Pauling, Rich and Yonath, and others, including Brodsky, Berman, and Ramachandran, concentrated on the conformation of the collagen monomer. Several competing models, although correctly dealing with the conformation of each individual peptide chain, gave way to the triple-helical [...] "Madras" [...] model of Ramachandran, which provided an essentially correct model of the molecule's quaternary structure although this model still required some refinement. [...] The packing structure of collagen has not been defined to the same degree outside of the fibrillar collagen types, although it has been long known to be hexagonal or quasi-hexagonal. As with its monomeric structure, several conflicting models alleged that either the packing arrangement of collagen molecules is 'sheet-like' or microfibrillar. The microfibrillar structure of collagen fibrils in tendon, cornea and cartilage has been directly imaged by electron microscopy. The microfibrillar structure of tail tendon, as described by Fraser, Miller, and Wess (amongst others), was modeled as being closest to the observed structure, although it oversimplified the topological progression of neighboring collagen molecules, and hence did not predict the correct conformation of the discontinuous D-periodic pentameric arrangement termed simply: the microfibril. Various cross linking agents like L-Dopaquinone, embeline, potassium embelate and 5-O-methyl embelin could be developed as potentialcross-linking/stabilization agents of collagen preparation and its application as wound <b>dressing</b> <b>sheet</b> in clinical applications is enhanced.|$|R
5000|$|Stan Pollard {{commenced}} {{working at}} Daking-Smith & Co.'s store in 1912 {{at the age}} of sixteen, however, in 1925 Daking-Smith's business was wound up and the store stood empty for a number of years. In 1928 a ten-year lease of the building was taken by the ACB company, who conducted a mail order service for a short period before becoming insolvent. During this period Stan Pollard opened his own small menswear business alongside the Daking-Smith store in Gill Street, and by 1934 was able to purchase the Daking-Smith building in partnership with John Hall.Stan Pollard had the store remodelled, removing the floor-to-ceiling plate glass windows and using them to construct [...] "island" [...] display windows. This remodelling saw most of the second level removed, and the cashier's station moved {{to the back of the}} store, then later relocated to a central position. The Lamson Paragon Central Money Exchange System (a cash carrier system) was installed when Mr Pollard bought the department store in 1934 and was removed only after Fossey's moved into the premises in 1993. Stan Pollard & Company issued two catalogues a year, which not only circulated in Charters Towers, but were sent to the increasingly wealthy, outlying pastoral regions. In the early days of the store large amounts of stock were purchased, usually to last for six months at a time. Hats, <b>dresses,</b> <b>sheets</b> and all types of manchester were made on the premises, therefore huge quantities of materials were stocked upstairs. Twelve women worked in the millinery room and a similar number in the dress-making room. These women, who provided a quality service to the community, trained in the upstairs workrooms of the store where the latest styles in clothing were interpreted quickly and usually only with the aid of illustrations. The store also sold glassware, gifts and toys.|$|R

"You {{are indeed}} sinners, you two," [...] he said, [...] "so great, that surely you should stand <b>dressed</b> in white <b>sheets,</b> one {{on either side}} of the altar, with the crushed flower in the middle. Ah! that is what I regret, this flower, for it is very rare. Only once have I found it in all my life, and then, as there was no lady present, I left it where it grew. Hearken, all this is a pack of nonsense.|$|R
50|$|Wallace {{may have}} been a local leader of a group known as the Whiteboys. They <b>dressed</b> up in <b>sheets</b> at night and rooted up the hedges with which landlords had {{enclosed}} land formerly held in common by the community. This was a change designed to benefit the wealthy {{at the expense of the}} poor. The change was also seen as a further insult to traditional Irish culture perpetrated by those loyal to the British empire. The Society of United Irishmen and the Whiteboys were efforts by Roman Catholics and Irish nationalists to gain independence from the English.|$|R
500|$|The remixed {{version of}} [...] "Adore You" [...] {{substitutes}} the original [...] "amorphous rhythms" [...] with prominent elements of dance music, which incorporates a [...] "thumping beat" [...] and progresses into a [...] "dazzling drop" [...] during the chorus. The production maintains the [...] "emotional {{center of the}} song" [...] while adding [...] "a cascading signal boost." [...] An accompanying music video for the Cedric Gervais remix of [...] "Adore You" [...] was premiered through Spinnin' Records on February 13, 2014; it is a re-edited version of the original music video, primarily using scenes where Cyrus is seen lying under a bed <b>sheet</b> <b>dressed</b> in her bra and underwear. Mike Wass from Idolator felt that the remix [...] "works quite well with the existing visual".|$|R
25|$|Each {{year the}} first years are {{encouraged}} to attend the toga parade and party <b>dressed</b> in white <b>sheets</b> wrapped as togas. Retailers {{called for an end}} of the parade after property damage and disorder during the 2009 event. However, the OUSA took it upon themselves to reintroduce this tradition, with a festival like event taking place at the stadium. 2012 Toga Party saw an unofficial world record, with rumours suggesting 2013 will see an official attempt. A clocktower race also occurs, in the style of Chariots of Fire. Students must race round the tower and attached building, beginning on the first chime of the clock at noon and completing before the chimes cease. Unlike Chariots of Fire, the task is possible with a couple of students completing each year.|$|R
50|$|When Edward dies, {{and after}} a very brief {{succession}} by his 12-year-old son, Edward V, his brother, Richard III, becomes king and turns against the friends of Edward, including Jane Shore. He forces her to do public penance in Lombard Street, where thousands of people see her <b>dressed</b> in a <b>sheet.</b> He takes all of her clothes and money and vows that nobody {{will be able to}} help her. She turns to Mrs. Blague for help, but Mrs. Blague refuses to give her back her diamonds, and throws her out. When a man she had helped out once offers her food, Richard sentences him to death. She becomes a beggar and dies naked in a ditch {{by the side of the}} road. She warns other maidens not to become like her.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{creative}} project {{was to create a}} dress that instills confidence in women who have been afflicted with and have survived heart disease. The inspiration for the project came from the American Heart Association's organization, Go Red for Women, and its courageous members. The project contents encompass the skills gained during the undergraduate apparel design program including design development as illustrated by: a customer profile, a graphic inspiration board, original illustration, flat line illustrations, original pattern pieces, an original red <b>dress,</b> and costing <b>sheet.</b> The original design was created after speaking with various members and hearing their input on what styles make them feel most confident and what the iconic Go Red for Women red dress should ultimately represent.

25|$|The Kushan Empire era {{statues of}} Kartikeya, dated to 1st and 2nd-century CE, {{have been found}} at various sites in the Indian subcontinent, {{particularly}} at Mathura and Gandhara. They show him as a warrior <b>dressed</b> in dhoti (<b>sheet</b> wrapped at waist, covering the legs), armour like a warrior, spear {{in his right hand}} and a bird (rooster) in his left. There is some difference between his ancient iconography in Mathura and Gandhara artwork. The Gandhara arts show him in more a Scythian dress, likely reflecting the local dress culture prevalent in those times. Further, it is in the oldest Gandharan statues where he is shown with a bird that looks like a chicken or cock. According to Richard Mann, the bird may symbolize Kartikeya's agility and maneuverability as a warrior god, and may be a Parthian influence. His iconography symbolizes his attributes as a hunter, warrior and philosopher.|$|R
5000|$|William Gettle was held, tied up and gagged, in {{the bedroom}} of a rented house at 4256 Rosemont Street in La Crescenta, California. He later told police that his kidnappers <b>dressed</b> in bed <b>sheets</b> when talking to him {{so as not to}} reveal to him their identities. He also told his rescuers that he [...] "'was not mistreated in any way' by his kidnappers." [...] A ransom of $60,000 was demanded for Gettle's safe release in a note sent to his lawyer; another letter was sent to Fleta Gettle, asking for an {{additional}} $40,000. Two police officers, Chester Burris and H.P. Gearhardt, were credited with breaking the case after installing a dictograph in the house of a bank robbery suspect. Overhearing a conversation about Gettle's kidnapping, they were able to trace his whereabouts to the house on Rosemount. A raid was conducted on the house on the night of May 15, 1934. Gettle was recovered the same day as the victim of another high-profile kidnapping case, six-year-old June Robles.|$|R
40|$|Uneasily Along the Sand {{evokes the}} state of mind of the great Mallee poet John Shaw Neilson {{during a period of}} {{hospitalization}} for nervous exhaustion around 1900. To his bed come the voices and apparitions of all those people whom he might have met but who in life eluded him. It is a ghost community of jesters, singers and seers, who parade in harlequin costumes and recall the poet to the vanishing spirit of the Mallee forest. In particular, a Wotjobaluk {{man by the name of}} ‘Jowley’ haunts him, a man found by white people as a child abandoned in a hollow log - abandoned, lost, stolen? The sound installation ‘Mac’ (that forms part of Uneasily and which will receive its first national broadcast to coincide with Mildura Palimpsest # 8) evokes their strange meeting and a kind of reconciliation of peoples and cultures with environments that remains elusive. The hospital, where Neilson heard strange voices and saw strange visions, is evoked in a video work based on a set of ‘actions’ performed in Mildura’s Old Base Hospital, and sound recordings made in Pyrenees House, Ararat (a replica of the Swan Hill Hospital where Neilson was confined). The hospital solarium is transformed into a strangely distorted Mallee paddock, of sand, barbed wire and mattresses that leak like hour glasses. Caught in the fence lines of this dream world are scraps of a woman’s <b>dress,</b> bed <b>sheets</b> inscribed with charcoaled graffiti and footprints alluding to the ‘unevennesses’ of a life. Uneasily Along the sand is inspired by Paul Carter’s recent book, ‘Ground Truthing: explorations in a creative region’. The installation of Uneasily in Mildura coincides with Opening, another work inspired by ‘Ground Truthing’ that Carter and Dirk de Bruyn have created for the big screen at Federation Square, Melbourne...|$|R
40|$|Background: Skin graft {{is one of}} the {{commonly}} done procedures by plastic surgeons, dermato surgeons and general surgeons. Pain at the donor area is a common complaint by the patient. The skin graft donor site area is usually covered with petrolatum dressing dermatosurgeons. Aim: This study was done to compare collagen dressing with petroleum gauze dressing in control of post-operative pain on skin graft donor area. Materials and Methods: The study was done on forty patients, twenty as study group who received collagen dressing and twenty as control group who received petroleum gauze dressing. The procedure was randomly selected by permutated block size of four. The post-operative pain was assessed with numerical pain rating scale 0 to 10. Nursing staff did the recording of pain scale. The nursing staff was not aware whether patient had collagen or petroleum gauze dressing. Statistics: Statistical analysis used was independent 't'-test (two-sample test) and Levene's test. Results: Statistics proved that study group (collagen dressing) had lesser pain than control group (petroleum gauze dressing). Conclusion: The collagen <b>sheet</b> <b>dressing</b> on skin graft donor area reduces pain in post-operative period...|$|R
5000|$|African American {{folklore}} told {{of white}} doctors who would abduct, kill, and dissect, performing {{a plethora of}} experiments, referred to as “Night Doctors”. These tales are difficult to verify. White slave owners disseminated scare stories of putative tortures performed by “Night Doctors” to prevent freed slaves from moving to the North. In order to augment rumours, white slave owners <b>dressed</b> in white <b>sheets</b> to represent kidnappers. Wandering the African American communities, perpetuating beliefs slaves would be abducted, taken to medical facilities and killed. To many African Americans these [...] "Night Doctors" [...] weren't just fictions used as scare tactics; they were real life.

40|$|Introduction: Chronic skin ulcers, such as {{diabetic}} ulcers, venous leg ulcers {{and pressure}} ulcers, are intractable and increasing in prevalence, representing a costly problem in healthcare. We developed a combination therapy with a gelatin sheet, {{capable of providing}} sustained release of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the safety and efficacy of autologous PRP covered with a hydrocolloid dressing and PRP covered with a gelatin sheet in the treatment of chronic skin ulcers. Methods and analysis: Thirty patients with chronic skin ulcers who have not healed with conventional therapy for at least 1 month are being recruited. The patients will receive PRP after debridement, and the wounds will be covered with a hydrocolloid <b>dressing</b> or gelatin <b>sheet.</b> The efficacy will be evaluated according to the time from the beginning of PRP application to secondary healing or the day on which wound closure is achieved with a relatively simple surgical procedure, such as skin grafting or suturing. All patients will be followed up until 6 weeks after application to observe adverse events related to the application of PRP and the dressings. This study was designed to address and compare the safety and efficacy of PRP covered with a hydrocolloid dressing versus a gelatin sheet. If successful, this combination therapy may be an alternative to bioengineered skin substitutes containing living cells and lead to substantial progress in the management of chronic skin ulcers. Ethics and dissemination: The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kansai Medical University (KMU Number 0649 - 1, 4 August 2014 : V. 1. 0). The findings of this trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, and national and international scientific meetings as well as to the patients.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} samples three episodes from {{nineteenth century}} United States history that conveniently illustrate economic {{behavior in the}} arena of banking and finance. The first chapter considers improvements in cross-market arbitrage due to technological change. The completion of the undersea Atlantic telegraph cable in July 1866 more closely integrated securities markets on two continents. Chapter 1 conducts an event study on one security with a dual listing on the New York and London Stock Exchanges using daily data. The event study provides some evidence that the information lag between the two markets shortened from ten days to zero days. We can recover transatlantic steamship crossing times from securities prices. The second chapter investigates bank window dressing. Window dressing is a temporary change in portfolio designed to produce a more appealing report to regulators or to the public. Market observers accused national banks of window dressing after the Civil War. Chapter 2 attempts {{to determine whether or not}} postbellum Philadelphia banks window <b>dressed</b> their balance <b>sheets.</b> A test finds some evidence for window dressing. The third chapter conducts an econometric test of Diamond and Dybvig's (1983) theory of bank runs as interpreted by Calomiris and Gorton (1991). Diamond and Dybvig employ an exogenous liquidity shock to depositors in order to develop a theory of bank runs. Calomiris and Gorton interpret the exogenous liquidity shock as a seasonal withdrawal from the nation's agricultural interior. Chapter 3 reexamines the hypothesis that a seasonal interior reserve drain served as the exogenous liquidity shock before the bank panics of 1873 and 1893 in the United States. Using individual bank level data in New York, this paper tests whether the banks that held most of the deposits from the interior, the "interest-paying" banks, experience reserve drains just before the panic. The evidence reveals that a seasonal interior drain could have triggered the 1873 panic, but that Diamond and Dybvig's model cannot be applied to the bank panic of 1893 without a non-seasonal interpretation of the exogenous liquidity shock...|$|R
40|$|It is {{acknowledged}} that {{activities such as}} dressing changes and bed sheet changes are high-risk events; creating surges in levels of airborne bacteria. Burns patients are particularly high dispersers of pathogens; due to their large, often contaminated, wound areas. Prevention of nosocomial cross-contamination is therefore {{one of the major}} challenges faced by the burns team. In order to assess the contribution of airborne spread of bacteria, air samples were taken repeatedly throughout and following these events, to quantify levels of airborne bacteria. Air samples were taken at 3 -min intervals before, during and after a dressing and bed change on a burns patient using a sieve impaction method. Following incubation, bacterial colonies were enumerated to calculate bacterial colony forming units per m 3 (cfu/m 3) at each time point. Statistical analysis was performed, whereby the period before the high-risk event took place acted as a control period. The periods during and after the <b>dressing</b> and bed <b>sheet</b> changes were examined for significant differences in airborne bacterial levels relative to the control period. The study was carried out four times, on three patients with burns between 35 % total burn surface area (TBSA) and 51 % TBSA. There were significant increases in airborne bacteria levels, regardless of whether the dressing change or bed sheet change took place first. Of particular note, is the finding that significantly high levels (up to 2614 cfu/m 3) of airborne bacteria were shown to persist for up to approximately 1 h after these activities ended. This is the most accurate picture to date of the rapidly changing levels of airborne bacteria within the room of a burns patient undergoing a dressing change and bed change. The novel demonstration of {{a significant increase in the}} airborne bacterial load during these events has implications for infection control on burns units. Furthermore, as these increased levels remained for approximately 1 h afterwards, persons entering the room both during and after such events may act as vectors of transmission of infection. It is suggested that appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn by anyone entering the room, and that rooms should be quarantined for a period of time following these events...|$|R
40|$|Keloid, a {{rare disease}} for humans, infests {{the skin around}} the initial wound and extends. Since 1700 BC {{when it was first}} described, many {{researches}} have been trying to explore a deeper understanding of this disease and the mission never stops, for its still unknown etiopathogenesis. Electronic search, performed in PubMed, Embase and HKU Library, has identified 230 eligible studies reporting a total of 533 cases of keloid in literature. The analysis shows that the weighted mean of patients’ age is 36. 19, between the range of 13 and 62. Most studies report a mean/median age of patients between the 18 s and the 30 s. The weighted proportion of male patients to female patients is 0. 83, indicating that females are more likely to catch the disease. Two fifths (40 %) of keloid are in craniofacial areas while 15 % take place in thoracodorsal areas. Furthermore, the reports prove that TNF-α, IF-β, IL- 6, IL- 18, CTGF and SCF contribute to the formation of keloid. The receptors and inhibitors of P 13 K, MAPK, Sp 13, mTOR and c-KIT are therapeutic potentialities. Surgery is the most fundamental way to relieve the symptoms of this disease, but adjuvant irradiation therapy is considered a more effective approach, considering its high recurrence rate. Besides, injection, laser, occlusive dressing, compression therapy and cryotherapy are also viable options. We conducted a research of keloid in Hong Kong, Chinese on infected people from the age 1 to 86. The research results reveal that the ratio of male patients to females ones is 1 : 1. 96. Keloid is most likely to happen from age 20 to 39 and from 60 to 69 among males and 40 to 59 among females. The mean ± SD age is 42. 17 ± 19. 75 years in males and 41. 02 ± 19. 20 years in females (p= 0. 583 > 0. 005). Moreover, the mean is 41. 5 in males and 42. 0 in females (p = 0. 548 > 0. 005). For males, keloid occurs mainly on the chest and limbs, while for females, it is usually on the chest and head, suggesting a statistically significant difference（x^ 2 = 22. 282 ，P= 0. 004 < 0. 05 ）. Additionally, there is a significant difference between male and female patients who have keloid on their limbs (T= 2. 178, P= 0. 033 < 0. 05). The mean age of onset of males much older than females, which was 39. 7 and 31. 94, respectively. Surgery was {{the most common cause of}} keloid in Hong Kong, followed by skin injury, burn and inflammation. In terms of treatment, most patients choose injections, followed by <b>sheet</b> <b>dressing,</b> excisional surgery and cream therapy. Laser removal of keloid is the least favoured choice. As for the treatment period, most patients are treated more than a year. In conclusion, these findings provide more information of keloid and hopefully will serve as an indicator of prognosis and diagnosis for Hong Kong patients in the future. More investigations and researches should be conducted to offer a more thorough and profound understanding of this disease. published_or_final_versionSurgeryMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R
