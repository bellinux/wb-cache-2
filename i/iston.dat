6000|$|Miss Harriet, sat old Madison Chalkley, {{the biggest}} and most venerable citizen of the neighborhood. Mr Chalkley never, by any chance, got a letter, the only mail matter he {{received}} being, [...] "The Southern Baptist Recorder," [...] which came on Saturdays, but, like most of the people present, he was at the post-office every mail day to see who got anything. Next to him sat Colonel <b>Iston,</b> a tall, lean, quiet old gentleman, who had, for a long series of years, occupied the position of a last apple on a tree. He had no relatives, no friends with whom he corresponded, no business that was not conducted by word of mouth. In the last fifteen years he had received but one letter, and that had so surprised him that he carried it about with him three days before he opened it, and then he found that it was really intended for a gentleman of the same name in another county. And yet everybody knew that if Colonel <b>Iston</b> failed to appear in his place on mail day, it would be because he was dead or prostrated by sickness.|$|E
60|$|When the {{procession}} reached {{the domain of}} Miss Harriet Corvey, there was gathered inside the yard {{quite a number of}} the usual attendants on mail days, awaiting the arrival of Wesley Green with his waddling horse and leather bag. But all interest in the coming of the mail was lost in the surprise and admiration excited by the astounding apparition of old Aunt Patsy in the ox cart, attended by her retinue. As the oxen, skilfully guided by Uncle Isham's long prod, turned into the yard, everybody came forward to find out the reason of this unlooked-for occurrence. Even old Madison Chalkley, his stout legs swaddled in home-made overalls, dismounted from his horse, and Colonel <b>Iston</b> raised his tall form from the porch step where he had been sitting, and approached the cart.|$|E

40|$|The abil ity of some {{compacted}} clay mater ia ls {{to restrict}} the passage of sodium chloride relative to water when subjected to flow with sodium chloride solutions has been demon-strated by Kemper (1960) and by McKelvey and Milne (1962). Cont inued exper imental work on this phenomenon, directed toward an understand ing {{of the effect of}} variables such as the type of clay material, porosity, hydraul ic permeabi l i ty and solution concentra-t ion has been st imulated by the possibi l ity that salt f i ltering occurs in the subsurface {{as a result of the}} movement of brines in response to compact ion and other sources of hydraul ic pressure. The apparatus in which exper iments have been carried out has been described in the paper by McKelvey and Milne. A clay sample, in the form of s dry powder or water slurry is compacted in a nylon-l ined steel cyl inder between monel pistons capped with porous monel filter discs. The piston-cyl inder assembly is bolted between steel plates to mainta in the compact ion pressure. The input p <b>iston</b> has two openings, one of which enters a circular groove near the edge of the piston face while the other enters the center of th is face. The second piston has...|$|E
