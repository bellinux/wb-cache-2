40|$|The goal of {{the high}} {{harmonic}} fast wave (HHFW) research on NSTX is to maximize the coupling of RF power {{to the core of}} the plasma by minimizing the coupling of RF power to edge loss processes. HHFW core plasma heating efficiency in helium and deuterium L-mode discharges is found to improve markedly on NSTX when the density 2 cm in front of the antenna is reduced below that for the onset of perpendicular wave propagation (nonset ∝ B*k|| 2 /ω). In NSTX, the observed RF power losses in the plasma edge are driven {{in the vicinity of the}} antenna as opposed to resulting from multi-pass <b>edge</b> <b>damping.</b> PDI surface losses through ion-electron collisions are estimated to be significant. Recent spectroscopic measurements suggest that additional PDI losses could be caused by the loss of energetic edge ions on direct loss orbits and perhaps result in the observed clamping of the edge rotation. Initial deuterium H-mode heating studies reveal that core heating is degraded at lower kφ (- 8 m- 1 relative to 13 m- 1) as for the Lmode case at elevated edge density. Fast visible camera images clearly indicate that a major edge loss process is occurring from the plasma scrape off layer (SOL) in the vicinity of the antenna and along the magnetic field lines to the lower outer divertor plate. Large type I ELMs, which are observed at both kφ values, appear after antenna arcs caused by precursor blobs, low level ELMs, or dust. For large ELMs without arcs, the source reflection coefficients rise on a 0. 1 ms time scale, which indicates that the time derivative of the reflection coefficient can be used to discriminate between arcs and ELMs...|$|E

5000|$|Water {{intrusion}} into the indoor environment {{can be attributed}} from causes other than rising damp. Moisture penetration has been an ongoing problem for residences as evaporation occurs at the <b>edge</b> of the <b>damp</b> area, resulting in [...] "tide marks" [...] due to salt deposition. The [...] "tide mark" [...] is commonly distinguished as a feature of rising damp. However, even after the water intrusion has been treated, these salt accumulations still persist. This suggests that rising damp {{is not always the}} cause for the water penetration.|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} discovered phenomenon of nonlinear supratransmission consists {{in a sudden}} increase of the amplitude of a transmitted wave triggered by the excitation of nonlinear localized modes of the medium. We examine this process for the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain, sinusoidally driven at one <b>edge</b> and <b>damped</b> at the other. The supratransmission regime occurs for driving frequencies above the upper band-edge and originates from direct moving discrete breather creation. We derive approximate analytical estimates of the supratransmission threshold, which are in excellent agreement with numerics. When analysing the long-time behavior, we discover that, below the supratransmission threshold, a conducting stationary state coexists with the insulating one. We explain the bistable nature of the energy flux {{in terms of the}} excitation of quasi-harmonic extended waves. This leads to the analytical calculation of a lower-transmission threshold which is also in reasonable agreement with numerical experiments. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures. Phys. Rev. E (accepted...|$|R

This was done to simulate an idealized free-free boundary condition at the two <b>edges.</b> The <b>damping</b> ratio value and the natural frequency (first mode) obtained in this experiment were 0. 13 % and 508. 75 Hz respectively. In order to check the damping induced by the supporting ring, measurements were made with {{the top half of}} the ring removed. The specimen then was supported only by the bottom half of the ring (half ring). It was observed that the natural frequency of the specimen (first mode) increased of a value of 552. 5 Hz due to the influence of the reduced mass of the supporting ring. But the damping ratio value obtained was the same as that obtained with full supporting ring, namely 0. 13 %...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages [99]- 102. In {{striving for}} the {{elimination}} of mode selector or tuning circuit for the overtone operation of crystal controlled oscillators, a new resonator design having suppressed fundamental mode is presented in this thesis. The mode suppression was successfully achieved by restricting the electrode diameter to empirically established values and mass loading at crystal plate edge. Electrode diameter and electrode gap spacing are the two key parameters used to optimize the resonator performance. These surface perturbation effects, derived from the converse concept of trapped energy resonator and contouring at plate <b>edge,</b> significantly <b>damp</b> the fundamental mode vibratory energy and degrade the resonator Q. The resultant electrode arrangement was experimentally investigated and qualitatively discussed. For practical oscillator application, the preferred mode will be the one with lower motional resistance. Therefore, efforts have been made trying to obtain high fundamental mode motional resistance. This direct high frequency generation technique offers economical benefits such as component count and simplicity of circuit design. Resonators of such structure have been practically used in crystal clock oscillators. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
5000|$|The {{electrodes}} at {{the front}} {{and the back of}} the crystal usually are key-hole shaped, thereby making the resonator thicker in the center than at the rim. This confines the displacement field {{to the center of the}} crystal by a mechanism called energy trapping. [...] The crystal turns into an acoustic lens and the wave is focused to the center of the crystal. Energy trapping is necessary in order to be able to mount the crystal at the <b>edge</b> without excessive <b>damping.</b> Energy trapping slightly distorts the otherwise planar wave fronts. The deviation from the plane thickness-shear mode entails flexural contribution to the displacement pattern. Flexural waves emit compressional waves into the adjacent medium, which is a problem when operating the crystal in a liquid environment.|$|R
40|$|Planar {{ferromagnetic}} channels {{have been}} shown to theoretically support a long-range ordered and coherently precessing state where the balance between local spin injection at one <b>edge</b> and <b>damping</b> along the channel establishes a dissipative exchange flow, sometimes referred to as a spin superfluid. However, realistic materials exhibit in-plane anisotropy, which breaks the axial symmetry assumed in current theoretical models. Here, we study dissipative exchange flows in a ferromagnet with in-plane anisotropy from a dispersive hydrodynamic perspective. Through the analysis of a boundary value problem for a damped sine-Gordon equation, dissipative exchange flows in a ferromagnetic channel can be excited above a spin current threshold that depends on material parameters and the length of the channel. Symmetry-broken dissipative exchange flows display harmonic overtones that redshift the fundamental precessional frequency and lead to a reduced spin pumping efficiency when compared to their symmetric counterpart. Micromagnetic simulations are used to verify that the analytical results are qualitatively accurate, even in the presence of nonlocal dipole fields. Simulations also confirm that dissipative exchange flows can be driven by spin transfer torque in a finite-sized region. These results delineate the important material parameters that must be optimized for the excitation of dissipative exchange flows in realistic systems. Comment: 20 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the coupling of bright and dark surface lattice resonances (SLRs), which are collective Fano resonances in 2 D plasmonic crystals. As {{a result of}} this coupling, a frequency stop gap in the dispersion relation of SLRs is observed. The different field symmetries of the low- and high-frequency SLR bands lead to pronounced differences in their coupling to free-space radiation. Standing waves of very narrow spectral width compared to localized surface-plasmon resonances are formed at the high-frequency band <b>edge,</b> while subradiant <b>damping</b> onsets at the low-frequency band edge, leading the resonance into darkness. We introduce a coupled-oscillator analog to the plasmonic crystal, which serves to elucidate the physics of the coupled plasmonic resonances and which is used to estimate very high quality factors for SLRs.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{dependence}} of spin wave dispersion {{on the characteristics of}} the mesh used in a finite element micromagnetic simulation. It is shown that the dispersion curve has a cut off at a frequency which is analytically predictable. The frequency depends on the average mesh length used for the simulation. Based on this, a recipe to effectively obtain the dispersion relation has been suggested. In a separate study, spin wave reflections are absorbed by introducing highly <b>damped</b> <b>edges</b> in the device. However, an abrupt change in the damping parameter causes reflections. We compare damping profiles and identify an exponential damping profile as causing significantly less reflections.

50|$|Stylidium diffusum is a {{dicotyledonous}} {{plant that}} belongs to the genus Stylidium (family Stylidiaceae). It is an annual plant that grows from 3 to 14 cm tall.

Inflorescences are 1.5-8 cm long. Flowers are pink, white, or mauve and bloom from March to September in the southern hemisphere. S. diffusums distribution is scattered along {{the east coast of}} Queensland and has populations recorded from Elcho Island and Groote Eylandt in the Northern Territory in Australia.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a strong {{dependence of the}} effective damping on the nanomagnet size and the particular spin-wave mode that {{can be explained by}} the theory of intralayer transverse-spin-pumping. The effective Landau-Lifshitz damping is measured optically in individual, isolated nanomagnets as small as 100 nm. The measurements are accomplished by use of a novel heterodyne magneto-optical microwave microscope with unprecedented sensitivity. Experimental data reveal multiple standing spin-wave modes that we identify by use of micromagnetic modeling as having either localized or delocalized character, described generically as end- and center-modes. The damping parameter of the two modes depends on both the size of the nanomagnet as well as the particular spin-wave mode that is excited, with values that are enhanced by as much as 40 % relative to that measured for an extended film. Contrary to expectations based on the ad hoc consideration of lithography-induced <b>edge</b> damage, the <b>damping</b> for the end-mode decreases as the size of the nanomagnet decreases. The data agree with the theory for damping caused by the flow of intralayer transverse spin-currents driven by the magnetization curvature. These results have serious implications for the performance of nanoscale spintronic devices such as spin-torque-transfer magnetic random access memory.

40|$|Large water motion {{inside the}} {{moonpool}} of vessels operating in waves can be excited by pressure fluctuations produced by external waves and vessel motion. Extreme {{consequences of this}} effect may include injuries for crew members, and damages to deck equipment resulting in downtime for the vessel. The accepted method to predict this non-linear phenomenon {{is a combination of}} model tests and potential solver. Nevertheless, model tests are generally conducted {{at the end of the}} design phase leading to serious problems if the moonpool performance is not sufficient. CFD solvers proved their capability of modelling complex flow phenomena and their use as a design tool for the moonpool is growing. However, a complete verification & validation is still missing. In the present work the water motion inside a moonpool and the forces on the hull, for a vessel in head waves without forward speed, are estimated using the MARIN software ReFRESCO. In doing so, the goal is to define the accuracy of the code for a rectangular moonpool with sharp <b>edges</b> without additional <b>damping</b> devices. For a deeper comprehension of the physics involved, a stepwise approach was followed. The work starts with an empty domain in which only regular waves were generated to assess the propagation and absorption of waves in ReFRESCO. Secondly, fixed vessel simulations were performed to study the influence of grid dimension, mesh refinement and boundary conditions. Then forced heave oscillations were simulated to estimate the damping and added mass. Verification studies were carried out for all the presented to this point. Finally, results from free-floating simulations were validated against experimental results...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the potential sound insulation benefit by using damping material to absorb vibrational energy along its transmission path. Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) {{was used to}} evaluate the effect on system performance of adding damping globally, as well as its influence on individual transmission paths. Nine different theoretical models were studied using both bending only and three-wave SEA models to predict the system behaviour in different frequency regions. The results suggest that global damping treatment generally increases the sound insulation in buildings. Initial increases in the internal loss factor (a term used in SEA to describe material damping properties) were found to provide significant initial improvements in sound insulation and flanking paths as opposed to direct paths were found to benefit more from damping treatment. A simple approximation was proposed to predict the damping benefit of paths of specific order without the need to run a full SEA model. In the presence of heavily damped structural element, where SEA is less likely to provide accurate prediction, a forward ray tracing algorithm was proposed as a supplement. It enables one to predict the energy transmission through a heavily damped component coupling two or more lightly damped components (or SEA subsystems). The energy distribution along the <b>edges</b> of the <b>damped</b> component was studied. The contribution from the direct field was found to dominate the incident energy and resulting transmission, especially in areas close to the source when damping is high. Different passive damping treatment techniques were reviewed as well as the theoretical damping level that is achievable as a guidance for theoretical and experimental validation. Several damping measurement techniques were studied and experimental validation of the ray tracing code was undertaken...|$|R
60|$|As {{the town}} was {{placarded}} with references to the Dullborough Mechanics' Institution, I thought I would go and look at that establishment next. There had been no such thing in the town, in my young day, {{and it occurred to}} me that its extreme prosperity might have brought adversity upon the Drama. I found the Institution with some difficulty, and should scarcely have known that I had found it if I had judged from its external appearance only; but this was attributable to its never having been finished, and having no front: consequently, it led a modest and retired existence up a stable-yard. It was (as I learnt, on inquiry) a most flourishing Institution, and of the highest benefit to the town: two triumphs which I was glad to understand were not at all impaired by the seeming drawbacks that no mechanics belonged to it, and that it was steeped in debt to the chimney-pots. It had a large room, which was approached by an infirm step-ladder: the builder having declined to construct the intended staircase, without a present payment in cash, which Dullborough (though profoundly appreciative of the Institution) seemed unaccountably bashful about subscribing. The large room had cost--or would, when paid for--five hundred pounds; and it had more mortar in it and more echoes, than one might have expected to get for the money. It was fitted up with a platform, and the usual lecturing tools, including a large black board of a menacing appearance. On referring to lists of the courses of lectures that had been given in this thriving Hall, I fancied I detected a shyness in admitting that human nature when at leisure has any desire whatever to be relieved and diverted; and a furtive sliding in of any poor make- weight piece of amusement, shame-facedly and edgewise. Thus, I observed that it was necessary for the members to be knocked on the head with Gas, Air, Water, Food, the Solar System, the Geological periods, Criticism on Milton, the Steam-engine, John Bunyan, and Arrow-Headed Inscriptions, before they might be tickled by those unaccountable choristers, the negro singers in the court costume of the reign of George the Second. Likewise, that they must be stunned by a weighty inquiry whether there was internal evidence in Shakespeare's works, to prove that his uncle by the mother's side lived for some years at Stoke Newington, before they were brought- to by a Miscellaneous Concert. But, indeed, the masking of entertainment, and pretending it was something else--as people mask bedsteads when they are obliged to have them in sitting-rooms, and make believe that they are book-cases, sofas, chests of drawers, anything rather than bedsteads--was manifest even in the pretence of dreariness that the unfortunate entertainers themselves felt obliged in decency to put forth when they came here. One very agreeable professional singer, who travelled with two professional ladies, knew better than to introduce either of those ladies to sing the ballad 'Comin' through the Rye' without prefacing it himself, with some general remarks on wheat and clover; and even then, he dared not for his life call the song, a song, but disguised it in the bill as an 'Illustration.' In the library, also--fitted with shelves for three thousand books, and containing upwards of one hundred and seventy (presented copies mostly), seething their <b>edges</b> in <b>damp</b> plaster--there was such a painfully apologetic return of 62 offenders who had read Travels, Popular Biography, and mere Fiction descriptive of the aspirations of the hearts and souls of mere human creatures like themselves; and such an elaborate parade of 2 bright examples who had had down Euclid after the day's occupation and confinement; and 3 who had had down Metaphysics after ditto; and 1 who had had down Theology after ditto; and 4 who had worried Grammar, Political Economy, Botany, and Logarithms all at once after ditto; that I suspected the boasted class to be one man, who had been hired to do it.|$|R
