The molecular {{origins of the}} phase transitions of polymers have not been completely understood. The molecular level understanding of polymer behavior is of great technological and scientific value. For example, the melt to glass transition of a polymer [ [...] . ] is perhaps its most useful quantity describing it. A low [ [...] . ] polymer will be a useful elastomer and a <b>high</b> <b>Tg</b> <b>polymer</b> will serve for structural purposes. Additionally, sub-glass relaxations are related to polymer aging. Based on a simple poly (ethylene) model, the intramolecular and intermolecular factors governing polymer melting, the glass transition and subglass transitions were investigated through a careful and systematic variation of the torsional potential {{as well as the}} cohesive energy of the polymer. The model polymers were studied using constant pressure canonical (Gibbs) dynamics of a system of four polymer chains with one hundred and fifty beads per chain. The advantage of varying systematically the torsional potential is that the morphology of the polymer is controlled, ranging from highly amorphous to highly crystalline, depending on the gauche-trans conformational energy differences. The effect of cohesive energy on the various transitions may also be studied by changing the Van der Waals well depth of each bead in the polymer chain. The first study presented in this chapter is a semi-crystalline case where the gauche energy was + 1. 14 kcal/mol more stable than the trans energy, and the trans-gauche barrier was 3. 01 kcal/mol. A melting point, a glass transition and a tentatively assigned gamma relaxation were characterized. In a second study, the effect of the trans-gauche barrier on the phase transitions of a semi-crystalline polymer (gauche energy=+ 1. 14 kcal/mol) was investigated. In a third study, the effect of the torsional barrier on the glass transition of amorphous polymers (gauche energy=trans energy) was investigated. In a fourth study, the effects of crystallinity on the phase transitions of polymers was investigated by varying the trans-gauche energy differences while maintaining the trans-gauche barrier constant at 4. 03 kcal/mol. In the fifth and final study, the effect of the cohesive energy on the polymer phase transitions was investigated by changing the Lennard Jones well depth of each bead while maintaining the torsional potential fixed with a gauche energy of 1. 14 kcal/mol relative to the trans energy, and a trans-gauche barrier of 4. 03 kcal/mol. Based on these studies, new insights on the general thermo-physical properties of polymers were obtained. A summary of the molecular interpretations of the melting point, glass transition, and sub-glass transitions is provided at the conclusion of this study. Therefore, the strength of this study is its ability to produce numerous phase transitions within a single structural polymer model by a systematic variation of the intermolecular and intramolecular forcefield parameters. This allows an effective comparison of the thermodynamics, the kinetics and morphology of each of the polymer cases...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the application of grapeseed oil, a waste product from the wine industry, as a renewable feedstock to make polyesters and to compare the properties of these materials with those derived from soybean and rapeseed oils. All three oils were epoxidized to give renewable epoxy monomers containing between 3. 8 and 4. 7 epoxides per molecule. Polymerisation was achieved with cyclic anhydrides catalysed by 4 -methyl imidazole at 170 and 210 °C. Polymers produced from methyl tetrahydrophthalic anhydride (Aradur 917 ®) had greater tensile strength and Young’s Modulus (tensile strength = 12. 8 MPa, Young’s Modulus = 1005 MPa for grapeseed) than methyl nadic anhydride (MNA) derived materials (5. 6 and 468 MPa for grapeseed) due to increased volume of MNA decreasing crosslink density. Soybean and grapeseed oils produced materials with higher tensile strength (5. 6 – 29. 3 MPa) than rapeseed derived polyesters (2. 5 – 3. 9 MPa) due to a higher epoxide functionality increasing crosslinking.

40|$|The {{processability}} of <b>high</b> <b>Tg</b> <b>polymers</b> or polymers {{possessing a}} high viscosity {{can be improved}} by using (volatile) solvents, as they decrease the Tg and the viscosity of the system. Major disadvantage, however, is that the solvent has to be removed after processing in order to retain {{the properties of the}} polymer. A solution to this problem {{can be found in the}} use of reactive solvents (monomers) which, after processing, are polymerized into a constituent of the final material. By choosing the right conditions, the polymer can be retained as the matrix material and will dominate the properties of the final product. Conventionally, reactive solvents which need to be polymerized at a substantially high temperature and with the aid of another component are used, such as epoxy resin or styrene. However, in industrial applications like injection molding, these systems are difficult to use due to the high temperature of polymerization (high mold temperature) and the lack of control of polymerization in the (high temperature) extruder. By using the concept of ceiling temperature, the problems mentioned above can be overcome. Above the ceiling temperature, no polymerization of the solvent will occur and if started from a polymer, a depolymerization of the polymer will take place. Cooling the system below the ceiling temperature will result in a polymerization of the solvent again and consequently in the desired phase separation. Two conditions have to be fulfilled for such a low temperature polymerizing solvent, i. e. miscibility of the intractable polymer and the monomers from the depolymerized polymer solvent and a high enough degree of depolymerization of the polymer solvent (low enough ceiling temperature). In this present investigation, it is shown that these two conditions are met for Thermoplastic Polyurethanes (TPU) and that therefore systems with TPU as reactive solvent have the potential to be used in injection molding applications. Results concerning Polystyrene/TPU as a model system and Polyphenylene ether/TPU systems will be discussed...|$|R

Retrofitting conventional C 3 splitters is highly desirable due to the huge amount of thermal energy required to separate propylene from propane. Membrane separation is among the alternatives that both academia and industry have actively studied during the past decades, however; many challenges remain to advance membrane separation as a scalable technology for energy-efficient propylene/propane separations. The overarching goal of this research is to provide a framework for development of scalable ZIF-based mixed-matrix membrane that is able to deliver attractive transport properties for advanced gas separations. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) were pursued instead of conventional molecular sieves (zeolites and carbon molecular sieves) to form mixed-matrix membrane due to their intrinsic compatibility with <b>high</b> <b>Tg</b> glassy <b>polymers.</b> A systematic study of adsorption and diffusion in zeolitic imidazolate framework- 8 (ZIF- 8) suggests that this material is remarkably kinetically selective for C 3 and C 4 hydrocarbons and therefore promising for membrane-based gas separation and adsorptive separation. As a result, ZIF- 8 was used to form mixed-matrix dense film membranes with polyimide 6 FDA-DAM at varied particle loadings and it was found that ZIF- 8 significantly enhanced propylene/propane separation performance beyond the “permeability-selectivity” trade-off curve for polymeric materials.

40|$|Organic {{nonlinear}} optical (NLO) {{materials have}} been extensively investigated due totheir higher bandwidth, larger nonlinearity and lower cost {{as compared to}} inorganics. One ofthe most important subjects in developing NLO polymers for electro-optical (EO) modulationis whether the polymers possess excellent temporal stability. In recent years, dendriticmacromolecules have drawn considerable interest because of their unique physical andchemical properties, such as low solution viscosity, high solubility, {{and a large number}} ofterminal functional groups, caused by the highly branched structure. In this study, wepropose to develop two new types of hyperbranched polymer systems exhibiting large opticalnonlinearity and excellent temporal stability at elevated temperatures. In the first year, thehyperbranched polyimides will be prepared via a novel methodology, sequentialself-repetitive reaction (SSRR). This SSRR is based on aryl carbodiimide (CDI) chemistry. One of the diisocyanate monomers was reacted to form poly-CDI, and subsequently one ofthe triaromatic acids was reacted with poly-CDI to obtain intermediates, poly(N-acylurea) s. The poly(N-acylurea) s exhibit excellent organosolubility, which enable the fabrication of highquality optical thin films. The N-acylurea moieties are then converted to imide structuresvia SSRR, and the <b>Tgs</b> of the <b>polymers</b> will be elevated significantly. The selection of thephosphorus-containing polymer as the polymeric matrices provides enhanced solubility andthermal stability, and excellent optical quality. Excellent temporal stability and low waveguideoptical loss would also be obtained for the hyperbranched polymers. In the second year, the NLO-active poly-CDIs are first prepared from the respectivecoupling reaction of two types of isocyanate-containing chromophores (DNDA(2, 4 -diamino- 4 '-(4 -nitrophenyl-diazenyl) azobenzene) and DAC(bis(4 -aminophenyl(4 -(4 -nitrophenyl) -diazenyl) -phenyl) amine)). Subsequently, a DOPOcontaining triaromatic acid will be added to obtain an intermediate, poly(N-acylurea). Afterin-situ poling and curing process, N-acylurea moieties are converted to amide or imidestructures via SSRR, and the <b>Tgs</b> of the <b>polymers</b> are elevated significantly. The spatialseparation of chromophores endows the polymers with favorable site-isolation effect andavoids chromophoric aggregation. A series of NLO hyperbranched polymers exhibitexcellent thermal stability after poling and curing would be developed. Thesepoly(N-acylurea) s can be further mixed with the organically modified montmorillonite (MMT) to be processed into thin films for further poling. Incorporating only a small amount oforganically modified MMT into the <b>high</b> <b>Tg</b> hyperbranched <b>polymers</b> seem to be a reasonableapproach to enhance the NLO stability. Apart from the measurement of EO coefficients(Pockels effect), preliminary evaluation of these materials for waveguides via optical lossstudy will also be performed. 超分枝高分子之樹枝狀結構不僅能改善加工上的問題(如溶解性及穩定性) ，其規則性奈米孔洞(viod) 亦會降低光波導中光散射(light scattering) 及振動吸收(vibrationalabsorption) 所造成的光損失值，適用於光傳遞材料；樹枝狀結構的優點眾多，但在大的分枝度下會導致熱穩定性的明顯降低。為克服熱穩定性不佳的缺點，導入具高玻璃轉移溫度之高分子結構和無機材料成為研究的熱門重點。二次非線性光學高分子材料因具大的非線性光學係數、低介電常數、快速應答、寬廣的變頻範圍、優越光學透明性、易加工成膜等優點，近年來已被廣泛的研究，應用在光電元件上，例如光開關裝置、光電調制器等。製備超樹枝狀結構高分子，且具備高玻璃轉移溫度及有高溫極化熟化之能力的材料，將是本計畫之重點，計畫區分為兩年進行，分述如下：第一年：利用新製備方式(連續自我反覆反應，SSRR) 開發超分枝聚醯胺與超分枝聚醯亞胺高分子。藉由獨特且具有高溶解性的poly(N-acylurea) 中間體，強化高分子材料之加工性，克服聚醯胺與聚醯亞胺溶解度之問題；利用中間體改善超分枝高分子在合成分歧化時造成之凝膠化現象，使材料能溶於有機溶劑中，方便加工，隨後再予以加熱，完成超分枝結構，製備出堅硬主鏈結構之超分枝聚醯胺與聚醯亞胺。實驗首先利用雙異氰酸鹽單體以DMPO (1, 3 -dimethyl- 3 -phospholene oxide) 為觸媒下，製備出聚碳二醯胺(poly-CDI) ，接著添加不同結構的三酸單體(triaromatic acid) ，形成含不同磷比例之高分子中間體，poly(N-acylurea) s；利用升高溫度即可經由SSRR 反應轉化官能基，形成超分枝全聚醯胺、超分枝全聚醯亞胺與超分枝含磷全聚醯亞胺材料，材料的分枝度可藉由三酸單體所用比例進行控制。在計畫中，將對不同含磷結構與不同含磷比例進行穩定性與光學特性之評估，希望將含磷材料進行光學材料特性的全盤研究。預期合成出來的超分枝高分子具有極佳之熱性質與可調之波導光損失值。第二年：預計將挑選最為穩定之DOPO 系列進行後續高溫穩定性超分枝高分子應用的方向。將具二次非線性特性之發色團基改質成雙異氰酸鹽單體，所選用之發色團基分別具有以下優點：發色團基 DAC (4 -(N,N-bis(p-aminophenyl) amino) - 4 ’-nitroazobenzene) 具有極佳的μβ 值， 且其熱裂解溫度也相當高； 而偶氮苯發色團基DNDA(2, 4 -diamino- 4 ’-(4 -nitrophenyl -diazenyl) azobenzene) 具備容易合成、大的非線性光學係數以及成本便宜…等。研究中，將針對不同含磷比例與不同發色團基比例的調整中，比較各比例之熱穩定性、電光係數值、折射率、光損失值、分子量以及分枝度之關係。此外，也將進行奈米蒙脫土光學複合材料(nanocomposites) 的相關研究，將具有應用潛力之超樹枝狀二次非線性光學特定比例中間體，poly(N-acylurea) s，導入微量的不同胺基量之層狀有機改質蒙脫土(organoclay) ，藉由升高溫度進行SSRR 反應，將高分子共價鍵結於無機蒙脫土表面提升相容性並提高材料熱性質，在此同時亦可保有不錯的光學性質，獲取最合適的性質與有機無機比例。研究中藉由光電性質量測評估材料結構，如製備薄膜之好壞(影響後續之處理) 、光學性質(光損失;optical loss) 、光電係數大小(應用上之潛力) 、熱性質的優劣(材料的長時間穩定性) 等等。探討不同發色團基系列非線性光學高分子對光電性質的影響，期望解決光電係數低、應用壽命短(長時間使用穩定性及光損失) 之問題...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{materials}} such as nacre, bone and crustaceans fascinate us with their synergistic combination of strength, stiffness, high toughness and light weight. Their high mechanical performance originates from the combination of soft and hard building blocks, high fraction of inorganic reinforcements, and perfectly ordered structures. Replication of those structural features and transferring the high mechanical properties, especially the combination of high stiffness and high toughness would undoubtedly benefit a wide field of areas. Nacre {{is among the most}} extensively studied biological materials, due to its high mechanical performance and unique structure. Different approaches have been employed to mimic the inorganic/organic brick and mortar structure, and in this work we utilize the most recently developed ‘self-assembled nacre mimetics’, in that it is easy and simple and allows for large area production of thick films. Well defined polymers, despite its low fraction (usually below 5 vol% in nacre), play very important roles in the mechanical properties, such as integrating the inorganic reinforcements, providing appropriate frictional sliding between the platelets, and giving sacrificial bonds and hidden length mechanisms to enhance the toughness. However, all of the previous work only concentrated on commercially available, <b>high</b> <b>Tg</b> <b>polymers,</b> and no efforts have so far been devoted to careful macromolecular engineering of the polymer phase. I am going to address this challenge {{in the first part of}} my PhD work. Dynamic polymers were designed with low glass-transition temperature and bonded by quadruple hydrogen-bonding motifs, and subsequently assembled them with high-aspect-ratio synthetic nanoclays to generate nacre-mimetic films. The high dynamics and self-healing of the polymers render transparent films with a near-perfectly aligned structure. Varying the polymer composition allows molecular control over the mechanical properties up to very stiff and very strong films (E ≈ 45 GPa, σUTS ≈ 270 MPa). The amount of supramolecular bonds in the nacre mimetic material governs the mechanical properties in a large extent. Stable crack propagation and multiple toughening mechanisms occur in situations of balanced dynamics, enabling synergistic combinations of stiffness and toughness. In the second part, I transfer the supramolecularly engineered nacre mimetic composites into a light adaptive material via doping a small fraction of reduced graphene oxide. Supramolecular interactions of the nanoconfined polymer phase govern the mechanical tensile properties of all nacre-mimetic films. The materials containing higher molar amount of supramolecular motifs are very stiff and strong, whereas those with lower amount realize interesting combination of stiffness and toughness/ductility. Co-assembly of 1 wt% of RGO imparts a strong photo-thermal effect, the material quickly reach a steady state temperature where heat generation and dissipation are balanced. The amount of supraomolecular bonds and more importantly the laser intensity governs the stress relaxation mechanism in the RGO doped nacre mimetic materials. In situ digital image correlation (DIC) analysis shows that we can modulate the strain field at will by using localized laser irradiation. Most importantly, the material is light adaptive. The bulk material turns from strong/stiff to soft/tough when we globally irradiate it and readily opens up the supramolecular bonds. In the third part, I explore other possibilities of our supramolecular copolymers as the soft phase of a different type of bioinspired nanocomposite materials. The synthesized low Tg, hydrophilic copolymers with varying functionalization of supramolecular bonding were self-assembled with cellulose nanocrystals, to give ordered cholesteric phases with characteristic photonic stop bands. The dimensions of the helical pitch are controlled by the ratio of polymer/CNC. We demonstrate that the supramolecular motifs regulate the swelling when exposing the biomimetic hybrids to water, and they allow engineering the photonic response. Moreover, the amount of hydrogen bonds and the polymer fraction are decisive in defining the mechanical properties. The molecular engineering allows us to span an unprecedented mechanical property range from highest inelastic deformation (strain-to-failure, εb up to ∼ 13 %) to highest stiffness (E ∼ 15 GPa) and combinations of both...|$|R

Fundamental understanding of better proton and charge transport properties are required to achieve desirable alternative energy materials. ^ In this thesis, we focus on molecular design, synthetic approaches, and understanding structure-property relationships to improved proton conductivity and optoelectronic properties. In proton conducting polymers, we tethered N-heterocycles (imidazole and benzotriazole) as proton carrier in two polymer systems; dendritic-linear block copolymers and helical polymers. Dendritic-linear block copolymers functionalized with imidazole and benzotriazole are designed to self-organize into nano scale assemblies that would increase local charge density and enhance proton conductivity. We found that microphase separation within disordered structure of imidazole-based block copolymers could relate to the higher conductivity compared to benzotriazole-based block copolymers {{that do not have}} phase separation in the same length scale. ^ In the second system, we have focused on effect of chirality on proton conductivity in helical polymer. We functionalized L-histidine and histamine on poly(phenylacetylene) and poly(4 -vinylbenzoate). Poly(phenylacetylene) is known as dynamic helical polymer while poly(4 -vinylbenzoate) is a random polymer. Effects of backbone chirality, side chains and doping acids on proton conductivity are evaluated in this work. We found that a single handed conformation of poly(phenylacetylene) bearing L-histidine can enhanced proton conductivity compared to those of containing histamine. Whereas, vinyl backbone, poly (4 -vinylbenzoate) bearing L-histidine exhibited lower conductivity due to a <b>higher</b> <b>Tg</b> of the <b>polymer.</b> ^ Cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) derivatives are often used as an active layer in optoelectronic devices.

Careful removal of the host crystalline CD lattice from the polymer-CD-IC crystals leads to coalescence of the guest polymer chains into bulk samples, which we have repeatedly observed to behave distinctly from those produced from their solutions or melts. While amorphous polymers coalesced from their CD-ICs evidence significantly <b>higher</b> glass-transition temperatures, <b>Tgs,</b> <b>polymers</b> that crystallize generally show higher melting and crystallization temperatures (Tms, Tcs), and some-times different crystalline polymorphs, when they are coalesced from their CD-ICs. Formation of CD-ICs containing two or more guest homopolymers or with block copolymers can result in coalesced samples which exhibit intimate mixing between their common homopolymer chains or between the blocks of the copolymer. On a more practically relevant level, the distinct organizations and behaviors observed for polymer samples coalesced from their CD-ICs {{are found to be}} stable to extended annealing at temperatures above their Tgs and Tms. We believe this is a consequence of the structural organization of the crystalline polymer-CD-ICs, where the guest polymer chains included in host-IC crystals are separated and confined to occupy the narrow channels formed by the host CDs during IC crystallization. Substantial degrees of the extended and un-entangled natures of the IC-included chains are apparently retained upon coalescence, and are resistant to high temperature annealing. Following the careful removal of the host CD lattice from each randomly oriented IC crystal, the guest polymer chains now occupying a much-reduced volume may be somewhat “nematically” oriented, resulting in a collection of randomly oriented “nematic” regions of largely extended and un-entangled coalesced guest chains. The suggested randomly oriented nematic domain organization of guest polymers might explain why even at high temperatures their transformation to randomly-coiling, interpenetrated, and entangled melts might be difficult. In addition, the behaviors and uses of polymers coalesced from their CD-ICs are briefly described and summarized here, and we attempted to draw conclusions from and relationships between their behaviors and the unique chain organizations and conformations achieved upon coalescence...|$|R

Two compounds showed <b>high</b> <b>Tg</b> of 108 °C and 110 °C and high Td of 448 °C and 449 °C. Comparing on Tm and Td of three compounds, two compounds having prevented molecular packing had the slightly decreased Tm and the increased Tg and Td.

Objective Assess whether risk factors for CVD and T 2 DM retained from childhood to adulthood predict CVD and T 2 DM in young adulthood. Study design 770 schoolchildren, ages 5 – 20 (mean age 12), 26 -yr prospective follow-up. We categorized childhood and adult risk factors and 26 -year changes (triglycerides [TG], LDL cholesterol, BMI, blood pressure [BP] and glucose ≥, and HDL cholesterol Results Children who had <b>high</b> <b>TG</b> and retained <b>high</b> <b>TG</b> as adults had increased CVD events as adults (p =. 0005). Children who had normal BMI and retained normal BMI as adults had reduced CVD events as adults (p =. 02).

Both triblock and multiblock copolymers were prepared. The {{length of the}} difunctional polysulphone was varied from 2000 to 20, 000 g/mol. The monodisperse amide segment was the tetra-amide T 6 T 6 T based on terephthalic acid (T) and hexamethylene diamine (6) units. The main goal of this work was to study if the <b>high</b> <b>Tg</b> amorphous polysulphone could be modified to a <b>high</b> <b>Tg</b> semi-crystalline PSU-T 6 T 6 T copolymer. The copolymers were characterized by viscosity measurements, NMR, FTIR, MALDI-TOF, DSC, and DMA. Depending on the amide concentration in the copolymers the T 6 T 6 T melting temperatures ranged between 220 and 270 °C and thus the crystallization window was small 50 – 100 °C. From the FTIR results, {{it was revealed that}} the crystallinity of the T 6 T 6 T segments in the copolymer could be very high, up to 92 – 97 %. The T 6 T 6 T has crystallized out into nanoribbons with a high aspect ratio. These <b>high</b> <b>Tg</b> semi-crystalline copolymers had a high dimensional and solvent resistance...|$|R

Materials and Methods: The Isfahan cohort study is a population-based, on-going longitudinal study of adults aged 35 years old or more, living in urban and rural areas of three counties in central Iran namely Isfahan, Najafabad and Arak. Participants were selected by multistage random sampling and were recruited to reflect the age, sex and urban/rural distribution of the community. The sample was restricted to subjects with MetS based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria and no history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer {{at the time of the}} baseline clinical examination. Results: Among different phenotypes of MetS components, clustering of <b>high</b> triglycerides (<b>TGs),</b> low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and abdominal obesity (ABO) was the most related to the all-cause mortality among women and followed in order by <b>high</b> <b>TGs,</b> hypertension (HTN) and ABO.

Laboratory results were compared {{with a group of}} normal subjects. Results: All cases had positive urinary cocaine, with a mean consumption lapse of 7. 6 years. The frequency of smoking was higher in cases. Dependent males had higher body mass index than controls. Compared to controls, dependent females had significantly <b>higher</b> triglyceride (<b>TG)</b> levels and lower HDL cholesterol. Therefore the relation total/HDL cholesterol was higher (p = 0. 0365). Dependent males had <b>higher</b> <b>TG</b> levels than their normal counterparts. Dependent subjects consuming cocaine base-paste had <b>higher</b> <b>TG</b> levels. Total proteins, albumin, urea and blood urea nitrogen were lower in dependent subjects. Among males, serum creatinine was lower and blood urea was positively correlated with the daily amount of cocaine use (p = 0. 03).

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop an {{optimised}} sonochemical surface modification process which could be operated at low temperature and which uses non‐hazardous chemistry with short treatment times. A range of sonochemical parameters such as ultrasonic intensity/power and process temperature were investigated. Design/methodology/approach – A 20 [*]kHz ultrasonic probe was used as the ultrasonic source. Ultrasound was applied through deionised water (DI) to sonochemically surface modify a <b>high</b> <b>Tg</b> epoxy laminate material (Isola 370 HR). The efficiency of the sonochemical surface modification process was determined by weight loss, roughness, adhesion and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Findings – This study has confirmed that ultrasound has the ability to surface modify a <b>high</b> <b>Tg</b> epoxy substrate material (Isola 370 HR). Weight loss and roughness values were increased by using an optimised ultrasonic process compared to control samples which were processed under “silent” conditions. Adhesion testing showed an improvement in the adhesion level between the surface and the subsequently electroless plated copper. Originality/value – Surface modification of <b>high</b> <b>Tg</b> materials generally utilizes wet chemical methods. These processes involve using hazardous chemicals, high temperatures, require high volumes of water for rinsing and need relatively long immersion times. This research has shown that by optimising ultrasonic parameters, surface modification can be brought about in deionised water (DI) at low temperature...|$|R
