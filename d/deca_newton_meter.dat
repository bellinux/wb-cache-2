40|$|Aging is characterised by {{a decline}} in {{physiological}} function. The rate of this decline can depend on certain lifestyle factors, genetics, and the environment. Although life expectancy is slowly increasing, {{there is a need}} to reduce the time spent in debilitated, and non-independent states by elderly individuals. Preventive measures need to be implemented to reduce dependency and improve the quality of life for elderly individuals. One such preventive and remedial measure is the use of exercise and physical activity. Because limited exercise prescription exists for the elderly population, {{there is a need to}} determine the effectiveness of exercise interventions that are more desirable for elderly individuals. Hence, the purpose of this pilot study was to implement and compare two types of exercise interventions, a holistic exercise intervention (Range of Motion Dance method or ROM) and a Conventional Exercise intervention commonly performed in the community by aged individuals. Forty-three elderly individuals over 65 -years of age were randomly allocated to the two intervention groups and a control group. The exercise interventions were performed for 10 -weeks and included baseline and post-intervention testing. The groups were compared using Analysis of Covariance on the following variables; muscular strength (grip strength, isokinetic knee flexion and extension); postural stability (Berg Balance Scale, and Center of Pressure) : and functionality (Timed 2 ̆ 7 up 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 go 2 ̆ 7 and Physical Performance Test). T-tests were performed to compare the two intervention groups on attrition and compliance. The Conventional Exercise and the ROM exercise groups generally showed similar results on all physiological parameters when compared to each other. However, some statistically significant differences were observed between the intervention groups and the control group for isokinetic knee flexor and extensor strength, grip strength and the Physical Performance Test. Mean differences between post-intervention and baseline results for knee extensor and flexor strength measures ranged between 0. 97 to 5. 78 <b>Newton</b> <b>meters</b> for the Conventional Exercise group; - 6. 00 to 5. 73 <b>Newton</b> <b>meters</b> for 2 ̆ 7 the ROM group and; 8. 74 to 5. 36 <b>Newton</b> <b>meters</b> for the Control group.

Muscle strength was measured by using KIN-COM (Japan Chattanooga), corrected for gravity. Peak torque expressed in <b>newton</b> <b>meters</b> was divided by body weight in kilograms to produce torque values adjusted by body weight (APT). The results are summarized as follows: 1) The ratio of APT was lower in concentric contraction for both flexors and extensors. 2) The ratio of APT was lower in flexors for both concentric and eccentric contraction. 3) A significant difference in APT was observed between JM and CS, except in the case of concentric contraction of the knee extensors. These results suggest that we should pay attention to the charactaristics of muscle contraction in evaluating muscle strength during exercise...|$|R

In order {{to ensure the quality}} of data collected, underwater inspection mission require a high stability AUV, especially in roll and pitch direction. However, conventional AUV adopt torpedo-shaped body, which has limited passive restoring moment in roll and pitch direction. Therefore, this paper presents design of a box-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle which is highly stable in roll and pitch direction. The passive stability of the designed autonomous underwater vehicle is improved by putting the heavy components at the bottom part of the vehicle whereas light component at the top part of the vehicle. The designed vehicle weights 68. 8 kilogram in air with 0. 6 kilogram positive buoyant. It has centre of buoyancy exactly above the centre of gravity with 7. 39 centimeter metacentric height.

Seven nondisabled participants performed a 1 min exercise test at 70 rpm on a hand cycle (HC) fixed to an ergometer in synchronous (SC) mode versus asynchronous (AC) mode and in arm-power (AP) versus arm-trunk-power (ATP) type of propulsion. Higher (p < 0. 001) flexion/extension of the trunk was found during ATP versus AP type and higher (p < 0. 001) lateral flexion and rotation of the trunk in AC versus SC mode. The trunk ROM should explain the different force generation patterns observed in this investigation between AC and SC modes and AP and ATP types. However, kinetic results do not allow the most effective type or mode of propulsion (FEF 2 D: from 72. 9 % to 89. 3 %) to be established. We conclude that trunk movement is an important parameter to consider in ergonomically optimizing hand cycling. Nevertheless, future studies in experienced HC users, especially with limited trunk function, should be performed...|$|R

Therefore, there seemed to be no a priori reason why the bridge could not be used to make noncontact measurements of shear stress produced by static torque. The results of such measurements are described here. A 2. 54 -cm cold-rolled steel bar was placed in a fixture and subjected to various applied torques. The measurements produced an initial transient signal followed by a changed static signal. The transient signal, which lasts the order of 6 – 8 seconds, seemed to be proportional to the rate of change of the application of torque although no quantitative measurements were made to prove this. The static signal, which was measured 30 seconds after the torque was applied, was proportional to the torque over the range of torques from 4 to 57 <b>newton</b> <b>meters.</b> If transient signals had been produced in the original linear stress tests [1, 2], they would not have been noticed because of the technique of obtaining the data in those experiments...|$|R

The present work is aim to modeling & prediction of parameters affecting mechanical wear of Incoloy- 800 using Taguchi’s methodology to design experiments and Artificial Neural Networking to model and predict the parameters.

RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS — We examined leg and arm muscle mass and strength at baseline and 3 years later in 1, 840 older adults aged 70 – 79 years in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study.

40|$|Abstract Background Exercise {{causes a}} variety of {{physiological}} and metabolic changes that can in turn reduce exercise tolerance. One of the potential mechanisms responsible for fatigue is “exercise-induced hyperammonemia”. Previous {{studies have shown that}} supplementation with amino acids can increase training tolerance. The α-keto acids are biochemical analogs of amino acids and can be converted to amino acids through transamination, thus reducing the cellular ammonia level. This double blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to investigate the effects of α-keto acid supplementation (KAS) on training tolerance, training effect, and stress-recovery state. Methods Thirty-three untrained young male adults underwent four weeks of training (5 sessions/week; 30 minutes running at the individual anaerobic threshold followed by 3 x 3 minute sprints/each session). Throughout the 4 [*]weeks of training and one week of recovery, subjects took α-ketoglutarate (AKG group, 0. 2 [*]g/kg/d, n[*]=[*] 9), branched-chain keto acids (BCKA group, 0. 2 [*]g/kg/d, n[*]=[*] 12) or isocaloric placebo (control group, n[*]=[*] 12) daily.

40|$|Background—Pregnancy {{provides}} a unique model {{to study the}} adaptation of the heart in a physiological situation of transient load changes. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the performance of the left ventricle (LV) in normal, uncomplicated pregnancies while considering the actual LV load and shape. Methods and Results—Serial echocardiographic examinations were performed in 51 women in each pregnancy trimester and 3 to 6 months after delivery. Data from 10 nulliparous, age-matched women were used as the control. Conventional parameters of LV function (ejection fraction) as well as myocardial deformation (strain) were interpreted, taking into consideration maternal hemodynamics and LV shape. Cardiac output increased during pregnancy because of a higher stroke volume in early pregnancy and a late increase in heart rate, whereas total vascular resistance decreased. Progressive development of eccentric hypertrophy was observed, which subsequently recovered postpartum. Sphericity index decreased from the first to the third trimester (1. 920. 17 versus 1. 710. 17) and returned postpartum to values comparable to the control. Although higher LV stroke work was noted toward the third trimester (5. 91. 1 versus 5. 31. 0 <b>Newton</b> <b>meter,</b> P 0. 001), ejection fraction showed no significant changes. LV strain decreased significantly in late pregnancy (19. 52 % to 17. 61. 6 %, P 0. 001) and returned to baseline values after delivery (19. 52 %).
