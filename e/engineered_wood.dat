5|$|Wood is pulped {{for paper}} {{and used in}} the {{manufacture}} of cardboard and made into <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> products for use in construction such as fibreboard, hardboard, chipboard and plywood. The wood of conifers is known as softwood while that of broad-leaved trees is hardwood.|$|E

25|$|Light-frame {{structures}} usually gain {{seismic resistance}} from rigid plywood shear walls and wood structural panel diaphragms. Special provisions for seismic load-resisting systems for all <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> structures requires consideration of diaphragm ratios, {{horizontal and vertical}} diaphragm shears, and connector/fastener values. In addition, collectors, or drag struts, to distribute shear along a diaphragm length are required.|$|E
25|$|A wood {{surface is}} ideal for social dancing if {{maintained}} properly and is also standard for many indoor sports. <b>Engineered</b> <b>wood</b> is normally used nowadays for wood flooring as it is less liable to warp or shrink and is more economic. Tap dance is especially punishing and a tough hardwood surface like oak or maple is preferred for any regular use.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} {{surface is}} normally of vinyl or hardwood, <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> or laminate. For dance the surface may be replaceable so for instance a theatre can adapt easily to either ballet or tap dance, these are normally made of vinyl sheeting. Hardwood is however preferred for tap dance. Some sports have extra requirements like spike resistance or a standard ball bounce.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{southeast}} Asia Dalbergia oliveri is harvested {{for use in}} woodworking. It has a very fragrant {{and dense}} grain near the core, however the outer sapwood is soft and porous. Dalbergia cultrata that has variegated burgundy to light brown color, a blackwood timber is sold as Burmese Rosewood. Products built with rosewood based <b>engineered</b> <b>woods</b> are sold as Malaysian Rosewood or as Dalbergia oliveri.|$|R
25|$|Wood {{unsuitable}} for construction in its native form may {{be broken down}} mechanically (into fibers or chips) or chemically (into cellulose) and used as a raw material for other building materials, such as <b>engineered</b> <b>wood,</b> as well as chipboard, hardboard, and medium-density fiberboard (MDF). Such wood derivatives are widely used: wood fibers are {{an important component of}} most paper, and cellulose is used as a component of some synthetic materials. Wood derivatives can be used for kinds of flooring, for example laminate flooring.|$|E

In addition, rural areas' populations were committed to agrarianism that was of great importance for a majority of the total population, with many families living exclusively from agriculture or complementing their salaries with farming, husbandry and forestry yields.|$|E
500|$|Timber, [...] "trees {{that are}} grown {{in order to}} produce wood" [...] is cut into lumber (sawn wood) for use in construction. Wood has been an important, easily {{available}} material for construction since humans started building shelters. <b>Engineered</b> <b>wood</b> products are available which bind the particles, fibres or veneers of wood together with adhesives to form composite materials. Plastics have taken over from wood for some traditional uses.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Engineered</b> <b>wood</b> products, glued {{building}} products [...] "engineered" [...] for application-specific performance requirements, {{are often used}} in construction and industrial applications.

2500|$|In 1976, George Goodwin {{began as}} a master {{carpenter}} and home builder. After a diver friend gave him antique long leaf pine logs found in the Suwannee River for his own project, the idea to reclaim logs from rivers was expanded into a sawmill operation in Micanopy, Florida. The company became incorporated in Florida in 1984. In 2002 it received Federal Trademark registration for [...] "River-Recovered" [...] from the US Patent & Trademark Office. In 2003, George and Carol Goodwin created the Reclaimed Wood Council, which was formed to educate buyers and set standards for reputable manufacturers of reclaimed woods. In 2007 the company introduced Precision <b>Engineered</b> <b>wood</b> flooring (PE), manufactured using reclaimed and sustainable woods.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{university}} {{announced it would}} enclose its football stadium, the fledgling Trus-Joist Company of Boise bid on and won the project. While steel and aluminum were {{the products of the}} day for domes and large unsupported buildings, Trus-Joist saw the UI stadium as a chance to demonstrate the strength, durability, and economy of their <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> products. From the final design to the end of construction, the enclosure project took just 10 months and $1 million to complete. In 1976, the Kibbie Dome roof won the [...] "Structural Engineering Achievement Award" [...] from the American Society of Civil Engineers. TJ International, the successor to Trus-Joist, was acquired by Weyerhaeuser in late 1999.|$|E

50|$|The {{skeletonized}} buttstock, {{pistol grip}} and folding carry handle/grip on the barrels were originally manufactured from birch plywood laminates. Such <b>engineered</b> <b>woods</b> are stronger and resist warping {{better than the}} conventional one-piece patterns, do not require lengthy maturing, and are cheaper. The wooden furniture was finished with the Russian amber shellac finishing process. Small accessories and an oil-solvent container can be stored inside butt recesses. Later the buttstock was fitted with a hinged butt-rest. More recent PKM machine guns and barrel assemblies are equipped with a new black glass-filled polyamide buttstock, pistol grip and barrel carry handle/grip shaped like the previously used laminated wooden stock and grips.|$|R
2500|$|The company's defense {{products}} {{division is}} known as [...] "Hodgdon Defense Composites". On January 11, 2008 Hodgdon and the U.S. Navy unveiled an experimental version of the Mark V Special Operations Craft, designated the Mk V.1, designed {{to reduce the number}} of injuries sustained by sailors and SEALs during the operation of the aluminum version of the vessel. Nicknamed the MAKO, the vessel [...] was developed by a subsidiary of Hodgdon Shipbuilding, in collaboration with the University of Maine's Advanced <b>Engineered</b> <b>Wood</b> Composites Center. It features a hull made of layers of carbon fiber, a foam core and an outer layer of Kevlar for additional strength. It was constructed and launched at the Hodgdon Yachts East Boothbay facility. The MAKO is lighter than the current Mk V. The Office of Naval Research funded the prototype “to compare the properties of composite construction with aluminum” versions of the same craft.|$|E

The many good islands were in poor estate, and French troops lightly armed in Scottish jacks would help the revenue of the Queen and Dowager.
