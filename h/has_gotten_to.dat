The mixtape features guest appearances from fellow rappers J. Cole, Juicy J, King Chip, French Montana, Royce da 5'9", Kendrick Lamar, Tyga, Chris Brown, Wale and Wiz Khalifa, along with track narrations by Common, Young Jeezy and Snoop Dogg. Production {{was provided by}} Hit-Boy, Da Internz, Lex Luger and Key Wane. Before the album's release, Big Sean released a handful of his inspirational video blogs, which gets in touch on how far he <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> where he’s at throughout his career and what he plans on doing to further his position in music. Most of his vlogs feature cameo appearances from Kanye West, 2 Chainz, Pusha T, Common, No I.D., Rita Ora, Trey Songz, Wale, Wiz Khalifa, Lupe Fiasco, Teyana Taylor and T-Pain, among others. Starting on February 23, 2013, Sean began a European tour in promotion of the album, which continued until March 13, 2013. On September 28, 2013, Sean released a 23-minute documentary covering the development and making of the album, which began 269 days before the project's release.|$|E

It also set a record for the fastest sell-out of Japan's Tokyo Dome, selling out within seven minutes. Jackson became the only female artist other than Madonna to fill arenas at the time. It was ranked the fifth most successful tour of 1990, making her the only female artist to place within the top ten. It also solidified her reputation as a fashion icon, as fans imitated her [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] outfit and regalia. Ebony magazine reported [...] "hoards of teen girls were imitating her distinctive look—black quasi-military long jackets, black tight-tight pants, and big white shirts." [...] Joel Selvin of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote [...] "the 23-year-old has been making smash hit records for four years, becoming a fixture on MTV and a major role model to teenage girls across the country." [...] Over $450,000.00 in proceeds from the tour's Madison Square Garden show were used to establish the Rhythm Nation scholarship program. The annual scholarship awards $5,000.00 to students majoring in performing arts and communications at United Negro College Fund member colleges and universities. William Allen, then-executive {{vice president of the}} UNCF, remarked: [...] "Jackson is a role model for all young people to emulate and the message she <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> the young people of this country through the lyrics of 'Rhythm Nation 1814' is having positive effects." ...|$|E

500|$|Chamberlain's 100 {{points is}} widely {{considered}} one of basketball's greatest records. Decades after his record, many NBA teams did not even average 100points as fewer field goals per game were being attempted. The closest any player <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> 100points was the Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant, who scored 81 in a 122–104 win over the Toronto Raptors on January 22, 2006. Whereas Chamberlain was fed repeatedly by teammates for inside shots in a blowout win, Bryant created his own shot—mostly from the outside—in a game which the Lakers trailed at halftime by 14 and did not pull away until the fourth quarter. Chamberlain, playing {{in an era when}} the games were paced faster and scoring opportunities were more plentiful, accounted for 59 percent of his team's points, compared to Bryant scoring 66 percent of the Lakers' 122 points. Bryant afterwards said Chamberlain's record was [...] "unthinkable ... It's pretty exhausting to think about it." [...] David Thompson broke Chamberlain's record for points in a quarter by scoring 32 {{in the first quarter of}} his 73-point game. Adrian Dantley tied the record of 28 free throws made in a regular season game on January 4, 1984, but through the 2010–11 season, all of Chamberlain's other records set that day still stand. Twenty years after the Warriors and Knicks combined for 316 points, the San Antonio Spurs defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 171–166 in triple overtime on March 6, 1982, for a total of 337 points. That record was broken more quickly as the Detroit Pistons defeated the Denver Nuggets 186–184 (also in triple overtime) on December 13, 1983, for 370 points.|$|E
500|$|Jackson's Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 {{became the}} most {{successful}} debut tour in history and set a record for the fastest sell-out of Japan's Tokyo Dome. She established the [...] "Rhythm Nation Scholarship," [...] donating funds from the tour to various educational programs. As Jackson began her tour, she was acknowledged for the cultural impact of her music. Joel Selvin of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote [...] "the 23-year-old has been making smash hit records for four years, becoming a fixture on MTV and a major role model to teenage girls across the country", and William Allen, then-executive {{vice president of the}} United Negro College Fund, told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Jackson is a role model for all young people to emulate and the message she <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> the young people of this country through the lyrics of 'Rhythm Nation 1814' is having positive effects." [...] She also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in recognition of her impact on the recording industry and philanthropic endeavors. The massive success experienced by Jackson placed her in league with Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Tina Turner for her achievements and influence. Ebony magazine remarked: [...] "No individual or group has impacted the world of entertainment as have Michael and Janet Jackson," [...] arguing that despite many imitators, few could surpass Jackson's [...] "stunning style and dexterity." [...] With her recording contract under A Records fulfilled in 1991, she signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Virgin Records—estimated between thirty-two to fifty million dollars—making her the highest paid recording artist at the time. The recording contract also established her reputation as the [...] "Queen of Pop." [...] In 1992, Jackson provided guest vocals on Luther Vandross's [...] "The Best Things in Life Are Free", becoming a top ten Billboard hit and reaching the top ten internationally.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain is {{regarded}} as one of the most extraordinary and dominant basketball players in the history of the NBA. The 1972 NBA Finals MVP is holder of numerous official NBA all-time records, establishing himself as a scoring champion, all-time top rebounder and accurate field goal shooter. He led the NBA in scoring seven times, field goal percentage nine times, minutes played eight times, rebounding eleven times, and assists once. He was also responsible for several rule changes, including widening the lane from 12 to 16 feet, as well as changes to rules regarding inbounding the ball and shooting free throws. Chamberlain is most remembered for his 100-point game, which is widely considered one of basketball's greatest records. Decades after his record, many NBA teams did not even average 100points as fewer field goals per game were being attempted. The closest any player <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> 100points was the Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant, who scored 81 in 2006. Bryant afterwards said Chamberlain's record was [...] "unthinkable ... It's pretty exhausting to think about it." [...] Chamberlain's main weakness was his notoriously poor free throw shooting, where he has the third lowest career free throw percentage in NBA history with 51.1% (based on a minimum of 1,200 attempts). Chamberlain claimed that he intentionally missed free throws so a teammate could get the rebound and score two points instead of one, but later acknowledged that he was a [...] "psycho case" [...] in this matter. On the other hand, he committed surprisingly few fouls during his NBA career, despite his rugged play in the post. Chamberlain never fouled out of a regular season or playoff game in his 14-year NBA career. His career average was only two fouls per game, despite having averaged 45.8 minutes per game over his career. He had five seasons where he committed less than two fouls per game, with a career low of 1.5 fouls during the 1962 season, in which he also averaged 50.4 points per game. His fouls per 36 minutes (a stat used to compare players that average vastly different minutes) was a remarkable 1.6 per game. [...] "First he was a scorer. Then he was a rebounder and assist man. Then with our great Laker team in 1972, he concentrated on the defensive end", said Sharman. In his two championship seasons, Chamberlain led the league in rebounding, while his scoring decreased to 24 and 15 points per game. By 1971–72 at age 35 and running less, his game had transformed to averaging only nine shots per game, compared to the 40 in his record-setting 1961–62 season. He also has a signature 'Dipper' move, whereby he would fake a hook shot, and extends his arm to a short-range finger roll to shoot under a block attempt. For his feats, Chamberlain was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978, named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, ranked #2 in SLAM Magazines Top 50 NBA Players of All-Time and #13 in the ESPN list [...] "Top North American athletes of the century" [...] and voted the second best center of All-Time by ESPN behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on March 6, 2007. During his career, Chamberlain competed against future Hall of Famers including Russell, Thurmond, Lucas, and Walt Bellamy. He later faced Unseld, Abdul-Jabbar, Dave Cowens, and Elvin Hayes.|$|E

For this, Rosenfeld and his sponsors at AJC have been treated to the sort of public tar and feathering that is usually reserved only for the troglodyte denizens of the far-right." [...] Tobin concludes [...] "in recent years, it is the supporters of Israel who are becoming pariahs in intellectual circles, not its critics. For all the talk of 'martyrdom' on the part of people like Tony Judt, the fact is, they have not suffered one bit for pot shots at Israel or their sneers at those who stand up for Zion. If we want to know where we are headed, we need only look to Britain, where in intellectual and artistic circles it <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> the point where it may no longer be possible to identify as a Jew without also disavowing any support for Israel." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{had turned}} into the Great Western Hotel, not as yet knowing {{where to look for}} a home; and there we will leave him, eating his solitary mutton-chop at one of those tables which are so {{comfortable}} to the eye, but which are so comfortless in reality. I speak not now with reference to the excellent establishment which has been named, but to the nature of such tables in general. A solitary mutton-chop in an hotel coffee-room is not a banquet to be envied by any god; and if the mutton-chop be converted into soup, fish, little dishes, big dishes, and the rest, the matter becomes worse and not better. What comfort are you to have, seated alone on that horsehair chair, staring into the room and watching the waiters as they whisk about their towels? No one but an Englishman has ever yet thought of subjecting himself to such a position as that! But here we will leave John Eames, and in doing so I must be allowed to declare that only now, at this moment, has he entered on his manhood. Hitherto he has been a hobbledehoy,--a calf, as it were, who had carried his calfishness later into life than is common with calves; but who did not, perhaps, on that account, give promise of making a worse ox than the rest of them. His life hitherto, as recorded in these pages, had afforded him no brilliant success, had hardly qualified him for the role of hero which he has been made to play. I feel that I have been in fault in giving such prominence to a hobbledehoy, and that I should have told my story better had I brought Mr Crosbie more conspicuously forward on my canvas. He at any rate <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> himself a wife--as a hero always should do; whereas I must leave my poor friend Johnny without any matrimonial prospects.|$|E
