25|$|<b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> {{going into}} that fight. I knew Conn was kinda small and I didn't want them {{to say in the}} papers that I beat up on some little guy so the day before the fight I did a little roadwork to break a sweat and drank as little water as {{possible}} so I could weigh in under 200pounds. Chappie was as mad as hell. But Conn was a clever fighter, he was like a mosquito, he'd sting and move.|$|E
25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E
500|$|With Spielberg {{no closer}} to committing, August, working with Jinks and Cohen, {{considered}} Stephen Daldry as a potential director. [...] "Once Steven decided he wasn't going to do it, we put the script {{back to the way}} it was," [...] recalls Jinks. [...] "Steven even said, 'I think <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> with a couple of things I asked you guys to try.'" [...] August took his favorite elements from the previous drafts, coming up with what he called [...] "a best-of Big Fish script. [...] "By the time we approached Tim Burton, the script was in the best shape it had ever been." ...|$|E

2500|$|One professor, Dale Brigham, was at {{the center}} of {{controversy}} when he chose to administer a planned exam for Nutritional Science 1034, saying, [...] "If you don’t feel safe coming to class, then don’t come to class... I will be there, and there will be an exam administered in our class," [...] while allowing students an option to take a make-up exam. After some students complained that the professor was not taking the threats seriously, Brigham apologized and offered his resignation, saying, [...] "If my leaders think that my leaving would help, I am all for it. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> and I do not want to cause further harm." [...] However, the university turned down the resignation later that day.|$|E
2500|$|The king took {{measures}} to reconcile {{public confidence in}} the monarchy. In the wake of the scandal surrounding the Duke of Palma de Mallorca, the king spoke in his 2011 Christmas Eve National Speech that no-one is above the law. Additionally, the king addressed the perennial critique of the monarchy by publishing the budget spent on the monarchy and royal household. In 2012, the king and Prince of Asturias volunteered an additional 7% pay-cut in solidarity with government officials, bringing the king's taxable income for 2012 at about 270,000 euros, and that of the prince at 131,000 euros. Of the events surrounding the safari, the contrite king issued a rare apology and said [...] "I am very sorry. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> It will not happen again." [...] Furthermore, the king and the Prince of Asturias stepped up public engagements, particularly those of a business nature, in an effort to promote [...] "Brand Spain," [...] as the king put it as he answered written questions. The king's mantra for Spanish business; [...] "Export, export, export!" [...] Spanish business magnets rallied to the king's cause; [...] "From a corporate point of view, [...] is Spain’s No. 1 ambassador," [...] said César Alierta, chairman of the Spanish telecommunications giant Telefónica. The king is also credited with brokering a deal worth $9.9 billion for a Spanish consortium in Saudi Arabia to construct a high-speed rail line by leveraging his personal relationship with Saudi King Abdullah and outmaneuvering a French bid. “Without the king, this contract would not have gone ahead,” according to former Spanish foreign minister Miguel Angel Moratinos. The king's role as a [...] "business diplomat and deal maker" [...] for his country's interest was brought to light during the safari scandal, as the safari was paid for by Mohamed Eyad Kayali, a Syrian construction magnate and longtime friend of the king. The two worked together on the deal which awarded the Haramain High Speed Rail Project to the Spanish consortium. For supporters of the monarchy the king is an [...] "irreplaceable resource" [...] with unrivaled relationships with other world leaders. Observers credit the king with easing tensions between Spain's former government of José Zapatero and the George W. Bush administration, while also helping to resolve disputes in Latin America.|$|E
