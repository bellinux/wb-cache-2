25|$|Another popular {{reactor type}} is the flow through reactor (continuous <b>flow</b> <b>reactor),</b> {{which also has}} {{internal}} electrodes, but this reactor allows monomer gas to flow through the reaction chamber as its name implies, which should give a more even coating for polymer film deposition. It has the advantage that more monomer keeps flowing into the reactor in order to deposit more polymer. It has the disadvantage of forming what is called “tail flame,” which is when polymerization extends into the vacuum line.|$|E
25|$|This type of reactor {{contains}} {{a number of}} tubes with small diameter. These tubes contain catalyst and are surrounded by boiling water which removes the heat of reaction. A fixed-bed reactor is suitable for operation at low temperatures and has an upper temperature limit of 530nbsp&K. Excess temperature leads to carbon deposition and hence blockage of the reactor. Since large amounts of the products formed are in liquid state, this type of reactor can also {{be referred to as}} a trickle <b>flow</b> <b>reactor</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{creating}} uniform wastewater loadings tend {{to reduce}} the probability of upsets. Fixed-film or attached growth secondary treatment bioreactors are similar to a plug <b>flow</b> <b>reactor</b> model circulating water over surfaces colonized by biofilm, while suspended-growth bioreactors resemble a continuous stirred-tank reactor keeping microorganisms suspended while water is being treated. Secondary treatment bioreactors may {{be followed by a}} physical phase separation to remove biological solids from the treated water. Upset duration of fixed film secondary treatment systems may be longer because of the time required to recolonize the treatment surfaces. Suspended growth ecosystems may be restored from a population reservoir. Activated sludge recycle systems provide an integrated reservoir if upset conditions are detected in time for corrective action. Sludge recycle may be temporarily turned off to prevent sludge washout during peak storm flows when dilution keeps BOD concentrations low. Suspended growth activated sludge systems can be operated in a smaller space than fixed-film trickling filter systems that treat the same amount of water; but fixed-film systems are better able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.|$|E
50|$|With {{respect to}} batch and plug <b>flow</b> <b>reactors</b> (PFRs), the dispersities for the {{different}} polymerization methods are the same. This is largely because while batch reactors depend entirely on time of reaction, plug <b>flow</b> <b>reactors</b> depend on distance traveled in the reactor and its length. Since time and distance are related by velocity, plug <b>flow</b> <b>reactors</b> can be designed to mirror batch reactors by controlling the velocity and length of the reactor. Continuously stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs) however have a residence time distribution and cannot mirror batch or plug <b>flow</b> <b>reactors,</b> which can cause {{a difference in the}} dispersity of final polymer.|$|R

50|$|In {{environmental}} engineering, {{residence time}} applies to water treatment and wastewater treatment. It {{refers to the}} amount of time that water spends in a batch reactor, plug <b>flow</b> <b>reactor,</b> completely mixed <b>flow</b> <b>reactor</b> (CMFR), and/or flocculation tanks. Batch reactors, plug flow reactors, and CMFR’s are used in wastewater treatment plants as a means of treating wastewater. Flocculation tanks are part of drinking water treatment facilities where the chemically treated water needs enough time to form flocs. Flocs are colloidal particles that have combined with a coagulant in order to form large enough particles that will eventually settle out in the next phase of water treatment. before reaching the sedimentation basin. These processes are dependent on an adapted version of residence time. In this situation, the important parameter is how long a concentration of fluid needs to remain in the system to be adequately treated.|$|E

40|$|Condensational {{growth in}} {{continuous}} <b>flow</b> <b>reactors,</b> such as con-tinuously mixed <b>flow</b> <b>reactors</b> (CMFRs) and <b>flow</b> tube <b>reactors,</b> is widely {{employed in the}} field of aerosol science and technology to produce particles for industrial use and scientific research. The development of analytical equations for the number-diameter dis-tribution n(d) of the particles in the outflow from these reactors is advantageous both for the inversion of data sets to obtain thermo-dynamic and kinetic parameters {{as well as for the}} rational design of experiments. In this study, equations are derived that relate the number-diameter distribution n(d) to the probability density function p(t) of particle residence time. Specifically, the condensa-tional growth rate is used to derive n(d) based on p(t). Analytical equations are developed for CMFRs, laminar-flow reactors, and dispersive plug-flow reactors, with a focus on CMFRs. The CMFR equation accurately describes data sets collected for α-pinene and β-caryophyllene ozonolysis in the Harvard Environmental Cham-ber (HEC). The interpretation is that condensational growth can be considered as the principal mechanism for change in particle diameter in these experiments. [Supplemental files are available for this article.
