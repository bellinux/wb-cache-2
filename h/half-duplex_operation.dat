30|$|All the {{aforementioned}} works are for one relaying node. It {{is easy to}} envisage that in real systems, more than one relay can be used. Schein in [15] started {{the investigation of the}} network with one source-destination pair and two parallel relays in between. This model was further studied in [16] under the assumption of <b>half-duplex</b> relay <b>operations.</b> For one-way multiple-relay networks in general, cooperative strategies were proposed and studied in [17]. We remark that a notable feature that does not exist in the single-relay case is that the multiple relays can act as a virtual antenna array so that beamforming gain can be reaped at the receiver. In this paper, we follow this line of research and consider two-way communications. Two-relays are assumed, for this simple model already captures the essential features of the more general multiple-relay case. We are interested in knowing how different techniques can be used to construct transmission strategies for the two-way two-relay network and how they perform under different channel conditions. In particular, we apply the idea of network coding to both the physical layer and the network layer. Besides, channel coding techniques for multiple access channel (MAC) and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channel are also employed. Several transmission strategies are thus constructed and their achievable rate regions are derived.|$|R

50|$|The BroadR-Reach {{automotive}} Ethernet standard realizes simultaneous transmit {{and receive}} (i.e., full-duplex) operations on a single-pair cable {{instead of the}} <b>half-duplex</b> <b>operation</b> in 100BASE-TX, which uses one pair for transmit and one for receive {{to achieve the same}} data rate. In order to better de-correlate the signal, the digital signal processor (DSP) uses a highly optimized scrambler when compared to the scrambler used in 100BASE-TX. This provides a robust and efficient signaling scheme required by automotive applications. The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard uses a signaling scheme with higher spectral efficiency than that of 100BASE-TX. This limits the signal bandwidth of Automotive Ethernet to 33.3 MHz, which is about half the bandwidth of 100BASE-TX. A lower signal bandwidth improves return loss, reduces crosstalk, and ensures that BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard passes the stringent automotive electromagnetic emission requirements.|$|E
30|$|One way to {{increase}} network capacity is by means of increasing the radio access points and reducing the cell size. However, since a regular BS is expensive, this solution is not attractive to network operators. Pursuing the same objective with lower cost, relay-based deployments is a promising approach {{that will have a}} large effect on system’s functions and architectures [4, 5]. While implementation details of full-duplex RS are still under investigation, relay-based enhancements in standards consider <b>half-duplex</b> relay <b>operation</b> [5], which incur a rate penalty as they require at least two timeslots to relay a message from source to destination [6, 7]. It is therefore crucial to enhance the capacity of the in-band wireless backhaul between source and relay (in our case, the BS–RS link) {{to increase}} the information rate. One of the solutions usually assumed is that relay stations (RSs) are placed in specifically planned positions above roof-top or in lampposts, ensuring line-of-sight (LOS) conditions in the BS–RS link, and hence reducing the path loss and shadowing effects. However, the price to pay is twofold: the likely LOS propagating conditions also to other-cell BSs (which will inject harmful interference) and the rank deficiency of the spatial channel when both BS and RS are equipped with multiple antennas. Both effects are detrimental to MIMO channel gains [8, 9].|$|R

30|$|Many {{different}} relay transmission {{techniques have}} been developed {{over the past ten}} years. The simplest strategy (already deployed in commercial systems) is the analog repeater, which uses a combination of directional antennas and a power amplifier to repeat the transmit signal [12]. More advanced strategies use signal processing of the received signal. Amplify-and-forward relays apply linear transformation to the received signal [13 – 15] while decode-and-forward relays decode the signal then re-encode for transmission [16]. Other hybrid types of transmission are possible including the information-theoretic compress-and-forward [17] and the more practical demodulate-and-forward [18]. In research, relays are often assumed to be half-duplex (they can either send or receive but not at the same time) or full-duplex (can send and receive at the same time) [19]. While full-duplex relays are under investigation, practical systems are considering <b>half-duplex</b> relay <b>operation,</b> which incur a rate penalty since they require two (or more timeslots) to relay a message. Two-way relays avoid the half-duplex assumption by using a form of analog network coding that allows two messages to be sent and received in two time-slots [20]. Relaying has been combined with multiple antennas in the MIMO relay channel [21, 22], and the multiuser MIMO relay [23]. Despite extensive work on relaying, prior work has not as extensively investigated the impact of interference as seen in cellular systems. One exception is [24], which utilizes resource allocation to avoid interference. Conversely, this paper considers exploiting the interference using increased spatial dimensions via extra antennas at the relay.|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we consider}} cooperative communication systems with relay conferencing, where the relays own the capabilities {{to talk to}} their counterparts via either wired or wireless out-of-band links. In particular, we focus on the design of conferencing protocols incorporating the <b>half-duplex</b> relaying <b>operations,</b> and study the corresponding capacity upper and lower bounds for some typical channels and networks models, including the diamond relay channels (one source-destination pairs and two relays), large relay networks (one source-destination pairs and N relays), and interference relay channels (two source-destination pairs and two relays). First, for the diamond relay channels, we consider two different relaying schemes, i. e., simultaneous relaying (for which the two relays transmit and receive in the same time slot) and alternative relaying (for which the two relays exchange their transmit and receive modes alternatively over time), for which we obtain the respective achievable rates by using the decode-and-forward (DF), compress-and-forward (CF), and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying schemes with DF and AF adopted the conferencing schemes. Moreover, we prove some capacity results under some special conditions. Second, we consider the large relay networks, and propose a "p-portion" conferencing scheme, where each relay can talk to the other "p-portion" of the relays. We obtain the DF and AF achievable rates by using the AF conferencing scheme. It is proved that relay conferencing increases the throughput scaling order of the DF relaying scheme from O(log(log(N))) for the case without conferencing to O(log(N)); for the AF relaying scheme, it achieves the capacity upper bound under some conditions. Finally, we consider the two-hop interference relay channels, and obtain the AF achievable rates by adopting the AF conferencing scheme and two different decoding schemes at the destination, i. e., single-user decoding and joint decoding. For the derived joint source power allocation and relay combining problem, we develop some efficient iterative algorithms to compute the AF achievable rate regions.

30|$|With {{the advance}} of antenna and signal {{processing}} technology, full-duplex (FD) has received significant attention, where wireless nodes can receive and transmit information simultaneously in the same frequency band (see references [7 – 10] and therein). In [11], the authors investigated harvest-use (HU) relaying system with <b>half-duplex</b> and full-duplex <b>operation</b> mode. The main conclusion in [11] is that FD {{seems to be an}} attractive and promising technology for HU-based cooperative networks. In [12], the authors considered a time switching-based full-duplex wireless powered relaying system, where the relay node operated in full-duplex mode with simultaneously information reception and information transmission. Specifically, they provided an analytical characterization of the achievable throughput of three different communication modes, namely, instantaneous transmission, delay-constrained transmission, and delay tolerant transmission by optimizing time splitting ratio. In [13], the authors examined a beamforming scheme in a time switching-based relaying energy harvesting system with multi-antenna full-duplex DF relays. Moreover, a full-duplex wireless-powered transmission system with simultaneous information reception and energy transmission was investigated in [14]. In [15], the authors proposed a novel two-phase protocol for an AF relay to activate full-duplex transmission. Especially, they regarded the energy from the loopback—interference channel as useful energy and integrated this energy into the wireless-powered transfer process, and the optimal power allocation and beamforming design at the relay node were derived. However, the performance and diversity of full-duplex relaying with WIPT networks can be further improved.|$|R
40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: To enable ultra-high {{data rate}} and {{ubiquitous}} coverage in future wireless networks, new physical layer techniques are desired. Relaying is a promising technique for future wireless networks since it can boost the coverage and can provide low cost wireless backhauling solutions, {{as compared to}} traditional wired backhauling solutions via fiber and copper. Traditional one-way relaying (OWR) techniques suffer from the spectral loss due to the <b>half-duplex</b> (HD) <b>operation</b> at the relay. On one hand, two-way relaying (TWR) allows the communication partners to transmit to and/or receive from the relay simultaneously and thus uses the spectrum more efficiently than OWR. Therefore, we study two-way relays and more specifically multi-pair/multi-user TWR systems with amplify-and-forward (AF) relays. These scenarios suffer from inter-pair or inter-user interference. To deal with the interference, advanced signal processing algorithms, in other words, spatial division multiple access (SDMA) techniques, are desired. On the other hand, if the relay is a full-duplex (FD) relay, the spectral loss due to a HD operation can also be compensated. However, in practice, a FD device is hard to realize due to the strong loop-back self-interference and the limited dynamic range at the transceiver. Thus, advanced self-interference suppression techniques should be developed. This thesis contributes to the two goals by developing optimal and/or efficient algebraic solutions for different scenarios subject to different utility functions of the system, e. g., sum rate maximization and transmit power minimization. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, we first study a multi-pair TWR network with a multi-antenna AF relay. This scenario can be also treated as the sharing of the relay and the spectrum among multiple operators assuming that different pairs of users belong to different operators. Existing approaches focus on interference suppression. We propose a projection based separation of multiple operators (ProBaSeMO) scheme, which can be easily extended when each user has multiple antennas or when different system design criteria are applied. To benchmark the ProBaSeMO scheme, we develop optimal relay transmit strategies to maximize the system sum rate, minimize the required transmit power at the relay, or maximize the minimum signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of the users. Specifically for the sum rate maximization problem, gradient based methods are developed regardless whether each user has a single antenna or multiple antennas. To guarantee a worst-case polynomial time solution, we also develop a polynomial time algorithm which has been inspired by the polynomial time difference of convex functions (POTDC) method. Finally, we analyze the conditions for obtaining the sharing gain in terms of the sum rate. Then we study the sum rate maximization problem of a multi-pair TWR network with multiple single antenna AF relays and single antenna users. The resulting sum rate maximization problem, subject to a total transmit power constraint of the relays in the network, yields a similar problem structure as in the previous scenario. Therefore the optimal solution for one scenario can be used for the other. Moreover, a global optimal solution, which is based on the polyblock approach, and several suboptimal solutions, which are more computationally efficient and approximate the optimal solution, are developed when there is a total transmit power constraint of the relays in the network or each relay has its own transmit power constraint. We then shift our focus to a multi-pair TWR network with multiple multi-antenna AF relays and multiple dumb repeaters. This scenario is more general because the previous two scenarios can be seen as special realizations of this scenario. The interference management in this scenario is more challenging due to the existence of the repeaters. Interference neutralization (IN) is a solution for dealing with this kind of interference. Thereby, necessary and sufficient conditions for neutralizing the interference are derived. Moreover, a general framework to optimize different system utility functions in this network with or without IN is developed regardless whether the AF relays in the network have a total transmit power limit or individual transmit power limits. Finally, we develop the relay transmit strategy as well as base station (BS) precoding and decoding schemes for a TWR assisted multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) downlink channel. Compared to the multi-pair TWR network, this scenario suffers from the co-channel interference. We develop three suboptimal algorithms which are based on channel inversion, ProBaSeMO and zero-forcing dirty paper coding (ZFDPC), which has a low computational complexity, provides a balance between the performance and the complexity, and suffers only a little when the system is heavily loaded, respectively. In the second part of this thesis, we investigate self-interference (SI) suppression techniques to exploit the FD gain for a point-to-point MIMO system. We first develop SI aware transmit strategies, which provide a balance between the SI suppression and the multiplexing gain of the system. To get the best performance, perfect channel state information (CSI) is needed, which is imperfect in practice. Thus, worst case transmit strategies to combat the imperfect CSI are developed, where the CSI errors are modeled deterministically and bounded by ellipsoids. In real word applications, the RF chain is imperfect. This affects the performance of the SI suppression techniques and thus results in residual SI. We develop efficient transmit beamforming techniques, which are based on the signal to leakage plus noise ratio (SLNR) criterion, to deal with the imperfections in the RF chain. All the proposed design concepts can be extended to FD OWR systems...|$|R
