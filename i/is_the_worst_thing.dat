500|$|In his mature works El Greco {{demonstrated}} a characteristic tendency to dramatize {{rather than to}} describe. The strong spiritual emotion transfers from painting directly to the audience. According to Pacheco, El Greco's perturbed, violent and at times seemingly careless-in-execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style. El Greco's preference for exceptionally tall and slender figures and elongated compositions, which served both his expressive purposes and aesthetic principles, led him to disregard {{the laws of nature}} and elongate his compositions to ever greater extents, particularly when they were destined for altarpieces. The anatomy of the human body becomes even more otherworldly in El Greco's mature works; for The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception El Greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself by another [...] "because in this way the form will be perfect and not reduced, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> that can happen to a figure'". A significant innovation of El Greco's mature works is the interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two which completely unifies the painting surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of Cézanne and Picasso.|$|E

It's always good to have some negative as well. Otherwise you would end up with equality and equality <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> in the world. Equality is stagnation. It doesn't let anything grow. It holds back.|$|E

2500|$|Speaking to Der Spiegel {{magazine}} in November 2013, Cornelius insisted {{that his father}} had obtained the works legally and stated that he would not voluntarily return any of them to previous owners. Feeling threatened by the intense media attention, Gurlitt's brother-in-law offered 22 works in his possession to the police for safekeeping. In November 2013, Der Spiegel revealed that they had received a letter from Gurlitt telling them that [...] "the name Gurlitt may not appear in your magazine." [...] Gurlitt then told two reporters from the Paris Match, who confronted him in a Munich supermarket, that [...] "Applause from the wrong side <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> there is." [...] Der Spiegel found this comment [...] "puzzling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tarantino and his producer, Lawrence Bender, {{brought the}} script to Jersey Film. Before even seeing Reservoir Dogs, Jersey had {{attempted}} to sign Tarantino for his next project. Ultimately a development deal worth around $1 million had been struck: The deal gave A Band Apart, Bender and Tarantino's newly formed production company, initial financing and office facilities; Jersey got {{a share of the}} project and the right to shop the script to a studio. Jersey had a distribution and [...] "first look" [...] deal with Columbia TriStar, which paid Tarantino for the right to consider exercising its option. In February, Pulp Fiction appeared on a Variety list of films in pre-production at TriStar. In June, however, the studio put the script into turnaround. According to a studio executive, TriStar chief Mike Medavoy found it [...] "too demented". There were suggestions that TriStar was resistant to back a film featuring a heroin user; there were also indications that the studio simply saw the project as too low-budget for its desired star-driven image. Avary— who was about to start shooting his own directorial debut, Killing Zoe— has said that TriStar's objections were comprehensive, encompassing the script's fundamental structure. He characterizes the studio's position: [...] "'This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> ever written. It makes no sense. Someone's dead and then they're alive. It's too long, violent, and unfilmable.' ...So I thought, 'That's that!'" ...|$|E

According to Pacheco, El Greco's perturbed, violent and at times seemingly careless-in-execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style. The preference of El Greco for very tall and slender figures and elongated compositions, which served both the expressive purposes and the aesthetic principles of the master, led him to disregard {{the laws of nature}} and elongate his compositions more and more, particularly when they were destined for altarpieces. The anatomy of the human body becomes even more otherworldly in the painter's mature works. For example, for the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception that he painted for the side-chapel of Isabella Oballe in the church of Saint Vincent in Toledo (1607–1613), El Greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself by another 1.5 feet [...] "because in this way the form will be perfect and not reduced, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> that can happen to a figure'". The minutes concerning the commission, which were composed by the personnel of the municipality, describe El Greco as [...] "one of the greatest men in both this kingdom and outside it". A significant innovation of El Greco's mature works is the interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between them which completely unifies the painting surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in Cézanne's and Picasso's works.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the Big 8's {{official}} {{ruling on}} the matter, the reactions from many {{on all sides}} were not {{in agreement with the}} Big 8 committee in the end. When asked at the Look All-America gathering in New York City Missouri All-American, Danny LaRose said, [...] "It'll always be a 9–1 season as far as I'm concerned. And I think the other players will feel that way, too." [...] However, LaRose also expressed his admiration of the Big Eight [...] "for standing up for what was right – enforcing its own rules". Also at the gathering, Colorado All-American guard Joe Romig echoed similar feelings when he said, [...] "I don't care what the NCAA or the Big Eight does. We lost the game at Kansas. Nothing will change that." [...] Meanwhile, Kansas All-American quarterback John Hadl expressed more concern about his teammate when asked at the All-America gathering and had this to say, [...] "He's a good guy. I hope it doesn't hit him too hard." [...] Missouri head coach Dan Devine expressed his apparent disappointment in the process adopted by the Big 8 when he said, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> that could happen in inter-collegiate athletics. I mean {{the fact that they were}} playing a boy not knowing he was ineligible. That should have been determined before he played." [...] For his part then executive secretary of the Big 8, Reaves Peters, said the case was the [...] "toughest case to come before us in history".|$|E
