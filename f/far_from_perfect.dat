Because of this some Turkic intelligentsia tended to use the Latin or even Cyrillic script. The first attempts appeared in the mid-19th century among Azerbaijanis. At the same period the Russian missionary Ilminski, along with followers, invented the modified Russian alphabet for all peoples of Idel-Ural. Nevertheless, modern alphabet uses other glyphs: (Ә instead of Ӓ, Ө instead of Ӧ, Ү instead of Ӱ, Җ instead of Ж, Ң instead of Ҥ), the principles of the modern Cyrillic Tatar alphabet was first invented then.

500|$|During an 1861 Royal Institution {{lecture on}} colour theory, Maxwell {{presented}} the world's first demonstration of colour photography by this principle of three-colour analysis and synthesis. Thomas Sutton, {{inventor of the}} single-lens reflex camera, took the picture. He photographed a tartan ribbon three times, through red, green, and blue filters, also making a fourth photograph through a yellow filter, which, according to Maxwell's account, was not used in the demonstration. Because Sutton's photographic plates were [...] insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green, {{the results of this}} pioneering experiment were <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>perfect.</b> It was remarked in the published account of the lecture that [...] "if the red and green images had been as fully photographed as the blue," [...] it [...] "would have been a truly-coloured image of the riband. By finding photographic materials more sensitive to the less refrangible rays, the representation of the colours of objects might be greatly improved." [...] Researchers in 1961 concluded that the seemingly impossible partial success of the red-filtered exposure was due to ultraviolet light, which is strongly reflected by some red dyes, not entirely blocked by the red filter used, and within the range of sensitivity of the wet collodion process Sutton employed.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the disorders of Stephen's reign in England there were many legal cases concerning land to be resolved: many religious houses had lost land during the conflict, while in other cases owners and heirs had been dispossessed of their property by local barons, which in some cases had since been sold or given to new owners. Henry relied on traditional, local courts—such as the shire courts, hundred courts and in particular seignorial courts—to deal with most of these cases, hearing only a few personally. This process was <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>perfect</b> and in many cases claimants were unable to pursue their cases effectively. While interested in the law, during the first years of his reign Henry was preoccupied with other political issues and even finding the King for a hearing could mean travelling across the Channel and locating his peripatetic court. Nonetheless, Henry was prepared to take action to improve the existing procedures, intervening in cases which he felt had been mishandled, and creating legislation to improve both ecclesiastical and civil court processes. Meanwhile, in neighbouring Normandy, Henry delivered justice through the courts run by his officials across the duchy and occasionally these cases {{made their way to the}} King himself. He also operated an exchequer court [...] at Caen that heard cases relating to royal revenues and maintained a number of king's justices who travelled across the duchy. Between 1159 and 1163, Henry spent time in Normandy conducting reforms of royal and church courts and some measures later introduced in England are recorded as existing in Normandy as early as 1159.|$|E

500|$|Upon its {{publication}} in English in early 2009, The Kindly Ones received mixed reviews. The New Republics literary critic Ruth Franklin called it [...] "one {{of the most}} repugnant books I have ever read [...] if getting under {{the skin of a}} murderer were sufficient to produce a masterpiece, then Thomas Harris would be Tolstoy." [...] Michiko Kakutani, the principal book critic of The New York Times, called the novel [...] "illfully sensationalistic and deliberately repellent" [...] and went on to question the [...] "perversity" [...] of the French literary establishment for praising the novel. In a reply to Kakutani, writer and novelist Michael Korda wrote, [...] "You want to read about Hell, here it is. If you don’t have the strength to read it, tough shit. It’s a dreadful, compelling, brilliantly researched, and imagined masterpiece, a terrifying literary achievement, and perhaps the first work of fiction {{to come out of the}} Holocaust that places us in its very heart, and keeps us there." [...] Writing for Time, American writer and journalist Lev Grossman compared it to Roberto Bolaño's 2666, similar in [...] "their seriousness of purpose, their wild overestimation of the reader's attention span and their interest in physical violence that makes Saw look like Dora the Explorer," [...] but added that while <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>perfect,</b> The Kindly Ones [...] "is unmistakably the work of a profoundly gifted writer, if not an especially disciplined one." [...] In her review for Los Angeles Times, novelist and essayist Laila Lalami wrote: [...] "Jonathan Littell has undertaken a very ambitious project in The Kindly Ones, and I think his boldness deserves to be commended. In the end, however, his highly problematic characterization and awkward handling of point of view make this book far more successful as a dramatized historical document than as a novel." [...] British historian Antony Beevor, author of Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin 1945, reviewing The Kindly Ones in The Times, called it [...] "a great work of literary fiction, to which readers and scholars will turn for decades to come," [...] and listed it as one of the top five books of World War II fiction.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the first season of Luke Cage, The Atlantics David Sims wrote on the pacing issue of Marvel's Netflix series, a common {{complaint}} to that point, stating, [...] "After two seasons of Daredevil, one of Jessica Jones, and now one of Luke Cage, the Netflix model feels fundamentally flawed, encouraging the kind of molasses-slow plotting comic books are designed to eschew. The problem isn’t that these shows are bad, necessarily... But they all take far too long to get going, by which point many viewers will have already tuned out." [...] He felt one of the problems was the fact that Netflix does not rely on viewers tuning into a particular series as broadcast series do each week, but rather subscribers who, if they lose interest, [...] "can take as long as they want to catch up... as long as they keep paying their subscription fee every month." [...] The Netflix series are also afforded the opportunity to explore elements in more detail, with Sims noting [...] "A lot of this detail [...] good, {{but it could have been}} considerably compressed—none of the Marvel Netflix series, so far, would have lost much by being squeezed into 10 episodes, or even 8. If Netflix shaved the 60-minute running time down quite a bit, it would likely inspire more economical—and better—storytelling from its shows." [...] Sims concluded by saying, [...] "What’s most frustrating of all is that Netflix isn’t getting rid of this approach anytime soon. Daredevil season three, Jessica Jones season two, Iron Fist, and The Punisher are all on their way, and each will follow the same 13-episode structure... The only respite may come in the form of The Defenders, a planned crossover series... over the course of just eight episodes. Who knows? The show might even surprise viewers and explain its villain’s motivations within the first hour. Until then, fans will be stuck needlessly giving over entire days to these series, while others are deterred from watching at all." [...] In her review for the first season of Iron Fist, Allison Keene of Collider.com spoke more on the pacing of Marvel's Netflix series, stating, [...] "By focusing so intently on making these series... much more grounded in a gritty real world than what we typically expect from a superhero show (like DC's candy-colored [...] on The CW), the problem is that they miss out on the key element: this [...] be fantastical entertainment." [...] With The Defenders, Jeff Jansen of Entertainment Weekly felt many improvements were made to the general complaints the previous seasons received. He said, [...] "The Defenders is <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>perfect.</b> But it’s an enjoyable superhero adventure distinguished by improvements and innovations that I hope Marvel will carry forward. Shorter seasons. More team-ups. Fewer shows. Start the consolidation by letting go of Iron Fist.

[...] However, he went on to argue that [...] "The scene is <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>perfect.</b> While the perversity of Florinda's past behavior represents an advance from the flatness of Southey's usual character portraits, it still lacks substance to be fully convincing. The brittle illogic of her action seems less an outgrowth of her psychology than a convenience for the poet, enabling him to exculpate the king without simply abandoning the rape motif of the legend. Even so [...] the scene is a touching one, and the predicament it recalls surprises by its humanity. For once Southey seems to have confronted reality without barricading himself behind moral absolutes."
