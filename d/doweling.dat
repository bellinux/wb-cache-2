40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the in vitro fracture resistance of roots with glass-fiber and metal <b>dowels</b> with different designs. METHODS: Fifty-endodontically treated maxillary central incisors were embedded in acrylic resin. Ten of them received only the coronary preparation, {{and the remaining}} forty were embedded (except for 4 mm of the cervical area) after removing the clinical crowns. Specimens were divided into five groups (n= 10) : control (teeth with only coronary preparation), cylindrical cast <b>dowel,</b> conical cast <b>dowel,</b> cylindrical glass-fiber <b>dowel</b> and conical glass-fiber <b>dowel.</b> Specimens were subjected to an increasing compressive load (N) until fracture. RESULTS: ANOVA indicated significant difference (P<. 05) among the groups, and the Tukey-Kramer´s test identified these differences. The control group (867 ± 243 N) presented the highest values and was statistically similar to cylindrical glass-fiber <b>dowel</b> group (711 ± 180 N). There is no significant difference among the metal <b>dowel</b> cylindrical (435 ± 245 N) or conical (585 ± 164 N) group and conical glass-fiber <b>dowel</b> (453 ± 112 N).

Both ends of the fibula were fixed to the recipient bones by intramedullary <b>doweling</b> with transfixing screws on each side. Skin incision for tumor resection was carefully designed to include the biopsy site and any previous operative scars, and to allow direct exposure of the major neurovascular bundles. This was mostly done through a separate posteromedial approach to facilitate exposure of the posterior tibial neurovascular bundle.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a study of alternate pavement designs targeted at reducing the initial construction costs of concrete pavements without compromising pavement performance. Test sections were constructed with alternate dowel materials, reduced dowel placements, variable thickness concrete slabs and alternate surface and subsurface drainage details. Performance data was collected out to 5 and 7 years after construction. The study results indicate that FRP composite dowels may not be a practical alternative to conventional epoxy coated steel dowels due to their reduced rigidity, which results in lower deflection load transfer capacities at transverse joints. Ride quality measures also indicate higher IRI values on sections constructed with FRP composite dowels. Study results for sections constructed with reduced placements of solid stainless steel dowels also indicate reduced load transfer capacity and increased IRI values as compared to similarly designed sections incorporating epoxy coated dowels. Reduced <b>doweling</b> in the driving lane wheel paths also is shown to be detrimental to performance for most constructed test sections. The performance of sections with reduced <b>doweling</b> in the passing lane wheel paths indicates that this alternate may be justifiable to maintain performance trends similar to those exhibited by the driving lane with standard dowel placements. Performance data from sections constructed with variable slab geometry and drainage designs indicate that one-way surface and base drainage designs are performing as well or better than standard crowned pavements with two-way base drainage. The drainage capacity of the base layer, constructed with open graded number 1 stone, appears sufficient to handle all infiltrated water...|$|E

40|$|Jointed plain {{concrete}} pavements use <b>dowel</b> bars to transfer load across transverse joints. The {{job of the}} designer is to optimize the number, size, and location of the <b>dowels</b> in a given pavement. This research used data from two different construction locations. The first project evaluated the performance of standard 1. 5 inch round and elliptical shaped <b>dowel</b> bars at different spacing intervals using full <b>dowel</b> baskets. The performance potential of standard 1. 5 inch round and elliptical <b>dowels</b> placed in the wheel paths only was also evaluated on the same project. The second project compared corrosion resistant <b>dowel</b> bar (stainless steel and {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) <b>dowel</b> bars) performance to round 1. 5 inch epoxy-coated steel <b>dowel</b> bars. The stainless steel and GFRP bars are for possible use in environments where steel corrosion may be an issue. Performance data was measured on both projects in terms of deflections, using falling weight deflectometer (FWD) data collected biannually. Joint faulting data was collected over the five-year test period for both projects. Roughness data was collected for only the elliptical <b>dowel</b> bar project over the five-year test period. Resilient modulus values were found by triaxial testing of the pavement subgrade samples. Performance criteria graphed verses resilient modulus allowed for the comparison of different <b>dowels</b> as the subgrade resilient modulus changed. The elliptical <b>dowel</b> bar study indicated medium elliptical <b>dowel</b> bars at 12 inch or 15 inch spacing perform equally to the standard 1. 5 inch round <b>dowel</b> bars at 12 inch spacing.

40|$|When we see {{an object}} in the world, {{there may be a}} large number of {{different}} ways to interact with that object. This large 'visuomotor space' can be constrained through affordances (perceptually available object properties defining potential uses), task demands and the actor's intentions. The effects of perceptual biases can be modified by performance factors, such as a limb's end-state-comfort (ESC; Rosenbaum et al. 1990). We investigated how two other potential performance biases affected interaction with a perceptually under-constrained object: hysteresis (H) and minimal forearm rotation (MR). Experiment 1 found H and MR operating in adult participants who reached-to-grasp a <b>doweling</b> placed at different orientations either randomly or systematically (orientation changed by 30 ° every five reaches either clockwise or counter-clockwise). In the random condition, participants switched between pronation and supination depending on which required minimum forearm rotation, but a systematic reach history delayed the transition from pronation to supination in the counter-clockwise condition (and vice versa). This effect was more pronounced in 5 - 15 year old children. Experiment 2 placed ESC and MR in opposition. Participants reached-to-grasp a <b>doweling</b> at one of two initial orientations and rotated it clockwise or counter-clockwise by 180 °. On half the trials, ESC could only be achieved at the expense of MR. Adults reliably acted to achieve ESC when reaching with their preferred hand (100 % of trials but less so with the non-preferred hand at circa 80 %). Younger children (5 - 8 years) and children with developmental coordination disorder (5 - 13 years) were primarily driven by MR {{and to a lesser extent}} H. Older children (9 - 13 years) showed a clear developmental trend towards adult behaviour. Thus, action selection is a dynamic process subject to numerous performance biases even in skilled adult participants. Importantly, the effect of performance biases on perceptually under-constrained objects varies with skill level and developmental status...|$|E

There are various techniques to assemble multi-layer wooden panels into prefabricated, load-bearing construction elements. However, comparative market and economy studies are still scarce. In this study, the following assembling techniques were compared: laminating, nailing, stapling, screwing, stress laminating, <b>doweling,</b> dovetailing, and wood welding. The production costs, durability, and ecological considerations were presented. This study was based on reviews of published works and information gathered from 27 leading wood product manufacturing companies in six European countries. The study shows that the various techniques of assembling multi-layer wooden construction panel elements are very different. Cross laminated timber (CLT) exhibited the best results in terms of cost and durability. With regard to ecological concerns, dovetailing is the best. Taking into account both durability and ecological considerations, wooden screw-doweling is the best. These alternatives give manufacturers some freedom of choice regarding the visibility of surfaces and the efficient use of lower-quality timber.

Even if a sur-face has only one type of roughness ele-ment, the flow will depend not only on form and height, but also on the num-ber of roughness elements per unit area {{and the manner in which}} they are distri-buted. A knowledge of the effect of roughness on the flow field may suggest the best spacing of crops for erosion control, Chepil and Woodruff (1963) defined a critical surface-barrier ratio (CSBR) as the distance between nonerodible sur-face barriers, Lx, divided by the height of the barrier, H, that will prevent wind from moving the erodible particles. Ear-lier, Chepil (1950) called the reciprocal of this ratio a critical surface-roughness constant. On cultivated soil, L,/H has a value of 4 to 20, depending on the friction velocity of the wind and on the. thresh-old friction velocity of the erodible soil particles (Chepil 1958).

Researchers have become more knowledgeable about shear and what the most important influences are. This project aims to experimentally investigate shear behaviour of RC beam strengthened in shear with an inclined stirrup (45 ˚, 60 ˚, 75 ˚) and comparing the results. The study also aims to compare the Euro code's shear formula with test results. Furthermore, I was also interested in studying the orientation of diagonal shear cracks and its most important influences. A total of six beams were cast, each with different types of shear reinforcement. They were over-reinforced in bending to make sure it fails in shear during the test. First beam was designed with conventional vertical shear reinforcement and second one without shear reinforcement. Three beams were reinforced in shear with an inclined stirrup at an angle of 45 ˚, 60 ˚and 75 ˚ respectively.

My findings were that the Eurocode (EC- 2 : 2004) gives a safe estimation on shear failure of beam. In the shear test, beams with inclined shear reinforcement performed much better than vertical one.

Data was collected along USH 18 / 151 in lowa/Dane Counties from a total of 17 test sections constructed to monitor performance variations due to base layer design, transverse joint sealing practices, and transverse joint <b>doweling.</b> The field data collected for this research included slab dimensions, surface detections from central slab and slab comer positions, and slab temperature measurements at various slab depths. In addition to the collected field data, construction records were reviewed to determine base layer design and pavement surface thickness as measured by cores extracted after construction. The data was used in conjunction with back calculation procedures developed by the author to establish slab-by-slab interior and corner foundation support k-values. The ratio of corner k-value to interior k-value, termed the slab support ratio, was used to identify slabs which were not uniformly supported by foundation materials. This research concluded that for the test sections included, little or no evidence of poor support could be found. However, based on the limited data obtained, there were some indications of poor support due to base layer densification. As a result of this research investigation, the author recommends a more detailed study of certain test sections included in this study to better quantify the reasons for the indications of poor support. In addition, testing is recommended along other jointed concrete test sections within Wisconsin to examine the impact of heavier trafficking on the quality of support provided by base layers of varying design...|$|E
40|$|In August, 1961, {{while still}} under construction, the {{spillway}} chute of the Karnafuli Hydroelectric Project was severely damaged by flows up {{to a maximum}} of 123, 000 cfs. A Special Board of Consultants reviewed the damage and considered three possible causes of the damage: (1) seepage uplift pressures, (2) failwater uplift, and (3) impact of logs. An inspection of the site and piezometer records indicated that seepage was not the primary cause. Opinions were divided on the other two items. A revised design of the chute was recommended for construction before the next high water, and recommendations were made for model and prototype studies to assist in an evaluation of the cause of the damage and the adequacy of repairs. A 1 : 28 scale section model was constructed and tested in the Hydraulic Laboratory of the East Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority. A report of October, 1962, presented the results of these studies together with prototype flow measurements on the reconstructed spillway. The present study was authorized effective October 2, 1962. A comprehensive model of the spillway and associated area was constructed to a scale of 1 : 132. A section model of one full bay and two half bays was constructed to a scale of 1 : 60. The model studies involved (1) measurements of flow pattern, log retention, and scour in the comprehensive model, and (2) measurements of temporal mean pressures, fluctuating pressures, log velocities and accelerations, and movement of model chute slabs in the section model. In addition, exploratory data were obtained on full-scale log impacts on a section of slab similar to the original chute. It was concluded that: (1) logs could have caused appreciable damage to the initial chute design, but some other mechanism was needed to remove the slabs; (2) fluctuating pressures associated with the hydraulic jump have caused sufficient uplift to remove the slabs with or without damage logs; (3) the increased thickness and new design of the drainage system the revised chute should provide adequate protection against fluctuating pressures; and (4) consideration should be given to <b>doweling</b> or otherwise holding down the floor of the stilling basin to avoid possible uplift of the basin slabs.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experimental}} study presented herein is the assessment and quantification {{of the behavior of}} individual <b>dowels</b> in multi-dowel connections loaded by a bending moment. For this purpose, double-shear, steel-to-timber connections with nine steel <b>dowels</b> arranged in different patterns and with different <b>dowel</b> diameters were tested in four-point bending. In order to achieve a ductile behavior with up to 7 ° relative rotation, the connections were partly reinforced with self-tapping screws. The reinforcement did not influence the global load–deformation behavior, neither for <b>dowel</b> diameters of 12  mm nor for 20  mm, as long as cracking was not decisive. The deformation of the individual <b>dowels</b> was studied by means of a non-contact deformation measurement system. Thus, the crushing deformation, that is, the deformation at the steel plate, and the bending deformation of the <b>dowels</b> could be quantified. In the case of 12  mm <b>dowels,</b> the bending deformation was larger than the crushing deformation, while it was smaller in the case of 20  mm <b>dowels.</b> Moreover, <b>dowels</b> loaded parallel to the grain showed larger bending deformations than <b>dowels</b> loaded perpendicular to the grain. This indicates that the loading of the individual <b>dowels</b> in the connection differs depending on their location...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} shear-carrying {{structures}} very often profits by the <b>dowel</b> action developed by reinforcing bars or shear connectors, since <b>dowel</b> action is, in principle, a very efficient shear-transfer mechanism. Within the same element, the reinforcing bars may act as <b>dowels</b> {{as soon as}} stress-induced interfaces form (cracks in the ultimate load situation), while shear connectors between side-by-side elements (studs, pins, <b>dowels)</b> develop a <b>dowel</b> action {{from the very beginning}} of the loading process, including the service load situation. Within this framework an experimental program has been carried out to investigate the <b>dowel</b> action in 27 reinforced concrete specimens fitted up with a single deformed bar of 14, 18, and 24 -mm diameter (No. 5, 6, and 8). The shear response of the <b>dowel</b> bar, the displacements and curvatures up to failure, and the subgrade stiffness of the concrete embedment were measured or evaluated. The tests give new evidence on the behavior of <b>dowel</b> action and allow further checks of the models available in literature for predicing <b>dowel</b> strength and stiffness. Furthermore, suitable formulations are proposed for the subgrade stiffness of the concrete embedment to allow the professional engineer to design a <b>dowel</b> bar or introduce <b>dowel</b> action in a safer and more consistent way...|$|R
