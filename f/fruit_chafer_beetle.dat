40|$|Eudicella trimeni is {{reportedly}} {{one of the}} most endangered species of the genus, having been declared vir tually extinct until recently. Present research has shown that the species occurs in an area wider than pre-vi ously known. However, its habitat is disappearing at a fast rate and the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal populations appear to be sufficiently different from each other to warrant at least subspecies status and fur-ther investigation. Third instar larvae of the northern population were collected recently in the Karkloof Na ture Reserve, KwaZulu-Natal. They were reared to adulthood under environmentally controlled condi-tions and are here described.

40|$|AbstractLittle {{is known}} about the {{pollination}} biology of the large (c. 230 species) African orchid genus, Eulophia. Here we report the discovery of pollination by flower <b>chafer</b> <b>beetles</b> (Cetoniinae; Scarabaeidae) in two color forms of E. ensata and in E. welwitschii. Both species have congested, capitate inflorescences, traits that are generally associated with pollination by flower <b>chafer</b> <b>beetles</b> in Eulophia and other plant genera. Pollinarium reconfiguration, including pollinarium bending and anther cap retention, in these beetle-pollinated species is slow. Such slow reconfiguration is predicted by Darwin's hypothesis to be a mechanism that limits geitonogamous self-pollination by slow moving beetles. A breeding system experiment conducted on E. welwitschii showed that this species, like most others in the genus, is self-compatible, but is dependent on pollinators for fruit set. As all Eulophia species are non-rewarding, the basis of attraction of beetles to flowers of the study species seems to be the generalized resemblance of their inflorescence in terms of flower arrangement and color to the capitula of sympatric rewarding Asteraceae that are utilized as food or rendezvous sites (or both) by flower <b>chafer</b> <b>beetles...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractFloral scent {{is a key}} {{functional}} trait for pollinator {{attraction to}} flowers, but is poorly documented in many plant lineages and pollination systems. In South African grasslands, <b>chafer</b> <b>beetles</b> (Scarabaeidae: Cetoniinae), particularly Atrichelaphinis tigrina, Cyrtothyrea marginalis and Leucoscelis spp., are common floral visitors and specialized pollination by these beetles has recently been established in several asclepiad, orchid and protea species. <b>Chafer</b> <b>beetles</b> {{are known to be}} attracted by a variety of floral volatile compounds and scent has been suggested to be an important signal in these chafer-operated pollination systems. In this study, we used dynamic headspace extraction methods and coupled gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) to examine the chemical composition of the floral scents of seven putatively chafer-pollinated asclepiad species in the genera Asclepias, Pachycarpus and Xysmalobium. We identified 15 – 57 compounds in the scents of these species, of which seven were common to all species examined. The scent profiles of each species separate into discrete clusters in two dimensional space based on non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), indicating clear distinctions between species and suggesting that plants may use different combinations of volatiles to attract beetles. Two plants suspected to be intergeneric hybrids were also examined. Data on pollination systems, morphology and scent chemistry are consistent with the hypothesis that these plants are hybrids between the chafer-pollinated species Asclepias woodii and Pachycarpus concolor. The results of this study are discussed in relation to the role of <b>chafer</b> <b>beetles</b> as generalist pollinators of specialized asclepiads...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} first case of <b>chafer</b> <b>beetle</b> [Anisoplia austriaca (Herbst 1783) ] {{mortality}} caused by Actinomucor elegans var. elegans in wheat fields of the Kurdistan province, Iran. For three years, dead larvae of Anisoplia austriaca were collected from wheat fields of the Kurdistan province. Similar isolates of a fast-growing fungus were recovered from all samples. The fungal isolates were identified as A. elegans var. elegans based on morphological and cultural characteristics. The identity of the species was further confirmed using sequence data of the ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) region of ribosomal DNA. Koch’s postulates were fulfilled by the inoculation of the larvae of A. austriaca and Galleria mellonella (Linnaeus, 1758) (as the model insect) using the spore suspension of A. elegans var. elegans. The viability of sporangiospores was evaluated using a spore dilution technique on germination medium. The results on the pathogenicity (100 % mortality in A. austriaca larvae) and viability tests (germination: 95. 45 %) demonstrated that A. elegans var. elegans {{can be considered as}} a potential biocontrol agent against the <b>chafer</b> <b>beetle.</b> Field experiments are still required to evaluate the capacity of A. elegans as a biological control agent...|$|R
40|$|Translocation is an {{important}} tool {{for the conservation of}} endangered species with threatened habitats and low population numbers. Without high habitat quality, translocations have low chances of success, regardless of how many organisms are released or how well they are prepared for the release. It is therefore crucial to be able to identify sites in which translocations {{are most likely to be}} successful based on key environmental characteristics specific to the species and habitat in question. Species information is also needed to determine critical life history traits and minimum habitat fragment sizes. The Cromwell <b>chafer</b> <b>beetle</b> Prodontria lewisii Broun is an ideal candidate for translocation because it has a very limited habitat range, being entirely confined to the 81 ha Cromwell <b>Chafer</b> <b>Beetle</b> Nature Reserve (CCBNR) in Cromwell, Central Otago. The entire population is estimated to contain about 3, 000 individuals. This study aimed to identify key plant and soil sites for optimum larval and adult survival by using a combination of field and laboratory-based studies. Larvae survived significantly better on the cushion plant Raoulia and on the grass Festuca rubra than on silver tussock Poa cita, despite this being the plant with which they are traditionally associated. Plant and soil surveys were conducted both within the existing reserve and in a potential new site at the Lindis Crossing. Soil pH, density and particle size were measured, but were not significantly related to <b>chafer</b> <b>beetle</b> survival. However, both larvae and adults survived significantly better when raised in soil from the CCBNR sites than from the experimental Lindis translocation site. Survival varied within the different soil sites of the beetles’ current range, with survival increasing significantly from south to north within the reserve. Results are discussed in the context of their management implications and a set of recommendations are presented. The approach taken here presents a model that could be applied to help identify suitable habitat for the translocation of other invertebrate species...|$|R
