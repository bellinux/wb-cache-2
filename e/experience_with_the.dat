5|$|Another {{follow-up}} {{game called}} Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny was planned, which {{revolved around the}} Spear of Longinus. Development was outsourced to a small Canadian studio, but eventually stopped as LucasArts did not have <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> supervision of external teams. Elaine Lee loosely reworked the story into another four-part comic book series, released from April to July 1995.|$|E
5|$|During Operation Just Cause in December 1989, Navy Reserve Commodore Maria Morales from Puerto Rico was {{deployed}} to Panama and served at Rodman Naval Station. According to Morales, in Panama {{she had her}} first real <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> anguish and impact of an armed conflict, not only on military service members, but on families as well.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} {{receiving}} her MFA, {{she returned to}} Loyola University-Chicago, where she had previously earned a BA in English, to work as an administrative assistant. Prior to this job, she worked in the Chicano barrio in Chicago, teaching high school dropouts at Latino Youth High School. Through these jobs, she gained more <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> problems of young Latino Americans.|$|E

5|$|Hamlet's soliloquies {{have also}} {{captured}} the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the thrust of his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.|$|E
5|$|John {{is offered}} {{a job at the}} Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Alice asks him to {{postpone}} accepting the job, but he feels this is impossible. At her doctor's suggestion, Alice delivers a speech at an Alzheimer's conference about her <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> disease, using a highlighter to remind herself which parts of the speech she has already spoken, and receives a standing ovation.|$|E

Despite being named to the team, Schneider did not play in any games, instead serving as the team's third goaltender behind John Grahame and Jason Bacashihua.|$|E

5|$|The exomoon LV-426, {{where the}} Nostromo {{initially}} encountered the derelict ship containing alien eggs, is {{now home to}} the terraforming colony Hadleys Hope. When contact is lost with the colony, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany Burke and a colonial marine unit to investigate the disturbance. Despite suffering from recurring nightmares about her original <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> alien, she eventually joins the expedition on Burke's word that their mission is to exterminate the creatures. Aboard the spaceship USS Sulaco, she is introduced to the colonial marines and the android Bishop, toward whom Ripley is initially hostile following her <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> traitorous android Ash aboard the Nostromo and the Marion.|$|E
5|$|A Roman Catholic, Dacey was {{influenced}} in his political opinions by protectionism and the rerum novarum, which supported people's {{right to join}} trade unions. He combined these beliefs with his <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Wool and Basil Workers Union and the Labor platform. He was an anti-billite, meaning that he was against Federation, and spoke against it, for example at Coraki, New South Wales on 15 June 1899, based on his opposition to free trade.|$|E
5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between January and April 1996, {{the story}} begins with the New York Police Department using Brock's wife, Ann, to trap him. Brock sends the symbiote to Ann, turning her into She-Venom again and letting her escape. In issue #3, Ann is afraid of the symbiote's influence and refuses {{to have anything to}} do with Brock while he wears it. This plotline is resolved in The Amazing Spider-Man Vol.2 #19 (2000), in which Ann's <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> symbiote triggers her suicide. The story includes contemporary Spider-Man Ben Reilly trying to bring Venom to justice.|$|E

5|$|ArtRave's {{concept and}} name {{are derived from}} the {{similarly}} named release party for Artpop. The stage resembled a cave and consisted of two sections connected by catwalks made of translucent lucite, allowing the audience to move underneath the catwalks while still being able to watch the show. Gaga's costumes in the show included one with tentacles, one with bejeweled wings, a rave-inspired outfit and a necklace made of marijuana leaves. Costume designers and choreographers aspired to make a single, coherent show. The lighting fixtures used for the concert were from Clay Paky and the main idea was to create an immersive rave <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lights. They were also designed to accommodate minor changes in the show sequences.|$|E
5|$|Before Lucas {{had started}} writing, his {{producing}} partner Rick McCallum {{was preparing for}} the film. McCallum stated that his <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>The</b> Young Indiana Jones Chronicles led to many of his decisions on The Phantom Menace, such as long-term deals with actors and soundstages, the employment of recent graduates with no film experience, {{and the creation of}} sets and landscapes with digital technology. In April 1994, McCallum started searching for artists in art, architecture and design schools, and in mid-year he began location scouting with production designer Gavin Bocquet. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) art director Doug Chiang impressed McCallum the most and was hired as the design director.|$|E

5|$|Due to a {{small number}} of embassies, Azerbaijan can be more {{difficult}} to obtain a visa when compared to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad. This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants could receive a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem. In a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports.|$|E
5|$|Following Freud's early speculations about infant <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mother, Otto Rank {{suggested}} a powerful role in personality development for birth trauma. Rank stressed the traumatic experience of birth as a {{separation from the}} mother, rather than birth as an uncomfortable physical event. Not long after Rank's introduction of this idea, Ian Suttie, a British physician whose early death limited his influence, suggested that the child's basic need is for mother-love, and his greatest anxiety is that such love will be lost.|$|E
5|$|HMS Zealous {{was laid}} down on 26 October 1859 as a wooden two-deck, 90-gun ship {{of the line}} by Pembroke Royal Dockyard, but her {{construction}} was suspended pending <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conversion of her half-sisters of the Prince Consort class to broadside ironclads. The Admiralty ordered on 2 July 1862 that she be cut down one deck and converted to an armoured frigate {{for the price of}} £239,258. The ship was launched on 7 March 1864 and commissioned in September 1866, but was not completed until 4 October 1866.|$|E

5|$|Having now gained <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Super Famicom sound chip, Uematsu {{felt that}} the sound quality of the soundtrack for the next game in the series, Final Fantasy V (1992), was much better than that of IV. He named this as the primary reason that the soundtrack album was two CDs long, a first for the series. Like IV, the discography of Final Fantasy V {{included}} an arranged and a piano album {{in addition to the}} main soundtrack album.|$|E
5|$|In his Commentary on Isaiah (1529), Zwingli {{noted that}} there were three kinds of governments: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. He {{expressed}} his preference for aristocracy which is not surprising given his <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Zürich council. In the publication, rather than comparing the three forms of government, he gave a defence of aristocracy against a monarchy. He argued that a monarchy would invariably descend to tyranny. A monarchy had inherent weaknesses in that a good ruler could be easily replaced by a bad one or a single ruler could be easily corrupted. An aristocracy with more people involved did not have these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|In his memoirs, Władysław Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and hopelessness which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes. Szpilman's memoir {{served as a}} basis for a screenplay, written as early as 1945 by the Polish writers Jerzy Andrzejewski and Czesław Miłosz, entitled Robinson of Warsaw. The movie that was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily censored by the communist authorities, and its original theme changed {{to such an extent that}} Miłosz requested his name be removed from the film's credits. The <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> film contributed to Miłosz's disillusionment with cinema as an artistic medium.|$|E
