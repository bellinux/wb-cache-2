Both antigens are present on the red blood cells of horse and sheep but guinea pig kidney cells have only the Forssman antigen.

5000|$|Risk {{factors that}} have been {{identified}} as increasing vent pecking include dim lights placed in nest boxes to encourage hens to use the boxes, the diet being changed more than three times during the egg laying period, the use of bell drinkers, and the hens beginning to lay earlier than 20 weeks of age. [...] Vent pecking is associated with indicators of stress, e.g. fluctuating asymmetry, <b>heterophil</b> to lymphocyte ratio, and tonic immobility duration. [...] Vent pecking can be related to disease or immune challenge as it sometimes becomes prevalent in cases of Gumboro disease (Infectious Bursal Disease) and is increased by challenges with the protein antigen, human serum albumin (HuSA). [...] Housing design can influence vent pecking. Mortality caused by cannibalism was reduced when hens had sufficient room to perch all facing the feed trough, thus giving their perch-mates little opportunity to peck at the vent region [...] and increased pecking activity and cannibalistic behaviour can occur due to inadequate height of the perches. [...] Larger group sizes lead to increases in vent pecking suggesting that social learning plays a role.|$|E

40|$|IT {{has been}} the writer's opinion {{heretofore}} that all cases of infectious mononucleosis, if properly studied, would reveal positive <b>heterophil</b> ag-glutination tests. This statement requires some clarification: from the serologic viewpoint a proper study would mean testing for <b>heterophil</b> anti-bodies at frequent intervals (preferably weekly) {{for at least three}} months before the failure to observe a positive test was acceptable. Furthermore, the <b>heterophil</b> agglutination tests should include absorption with guinea pig kidney and beef cell antigens particularly for titers that are, unabsorbed, within the normal range of 1 : 56 or lower, or within slightly elevated ranges such as 1 : 112 or 1 : 224. In this way seemingly normal or low titers of <b>heterophil</b> antibodies can be detected as the infectious mononucleosis type of <b>heterophil</b> antibodies. As a final point of clarification, a positive test is defined as one which, at any level of unabsorbed titer, reveals infectious mononucleosis-type <b>heterophil</b> antibodies on absorption with the differen-tiating antigens, or, in the absence of absorption tests, yields an unabsorbed titer of at least 1 : 1792 (if serum sickness can be satisfactorily excluded).

A granulocytopenic chicken model in more mature birds hics. demonstrated the significant role heterophils have in the defense mechanism against Salmonella. Heterophils from 3 - 5 week-old chickens {{have been shown to be}} highly efficient at phagocytizing and killing Salmonella when compared to monocytes. The purpose of the following experiments was threefold. First, 1 investigated the phagocytic and bactericidal activities of heterophils from chickens during the first 7 days post-hatch to evaluate whether decreased <b>heterophil</b> function plays a role in the susceptibility of young chicks to Salmonella infections. Results demonstrated the ability of the <b>heterophil</b> to phagocytose Salmonella enteritidis did not change on Day 1 or Day 4, but then doubled by Day 7. Bactericidal activity of the heterophils throughout the first 7 days post-hatch demonstrated efficient killing of Salmonella enteritidis. Based on this data, l concluded a relationship exists between the age of the chick, the functional activity of the <b>heterophil,</b> and the susceptibility to organ invasion by Salmonella. Secondly, immunoprophylactic administration of Salmonella enteritidis-immune lymphokines (ILK) in day-old chicks results in both significant reduction in SE organ invasion and enhanced activation of heterophils. Therefore, I evaluated the effects of ILK on the ontogenesis of <b>heterophil</b> phagocytosis and bacterial killing. Administration of ILK induced a significant increase 7 < 0. 05) in <b>heterophil</b> phagocytosis when injected on either day 1, 4, or 7 post-hatch as compared to control chicks of the same age. Thus, administration of ILK to chicks during the first week of life increases functional development and potentiates <b>heterophil</b> biological activity during the greatest period of susceptibility to Salmonella invasion. Thirdly, 1 evaluated the duration of enhanced <b>heterophil</b> phagocytosis of SE following the prophylactic administration of a single injection of ILK to neonatal chicks. Administration of ILK at day-of-hatch resulted in a significant increase in <b>heterophil</b> phagocytic acclivity 7 < 0. 05) through day 5 post-hatch. No significant differences in phagocytic activities of heterophils from control and ILK treated chicks was demonstrated from day 6 through 14 post-hatch.

40|$|Immune {{responses}} in poultry can {{be influenced by}} genetic background, nutrition, environment and management, or any combination of the above. Chicken heterophils are {{the first line of}} defense that can launch a series of intra- and extracellular antimicrobial mechanisms. Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE) is a causative agent of a bacterial foodborne illness, commonly occurring after consumption of contaminated eggs and meat. In 2008, SE affected 3 out of 100, 000 U. S. inhabitants on average and it is now receiving increased public awareness. The limited scope of current knowledge about basis for the difference in <b>heterophil</b> responses during and after exposure to immunomodulators prompted the study of <b>heterophil</b> defense mechanisms against Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE) infection in three genetically distinct chicken lines (Leghorn, broiler and Fayoumi) supplemented with dietary immunomodulators (β-glucan, ascorbic acid and corticosterone). We hypothesize that <b>heterophil</b> function in three genetic chicken lines during exposure to dietary immunomodulators and challenge with SE will be significantly different. To test the hypothesis, we have isolated blood heterophils from three diverse chicken genetic lines; [outbred broiler and two highly inbred layer lines (Leghorn and Fayoumi) ] that were fed diet supplemented with immunomodulators (β-glucan, ascorbic acid and cortisol) and challenged with SE. We used <b>heterophil</b> extracellular trap release (HETs, phagocytosis, bacterial killing and oxidative burst to determine <b>heterophil</b> function differences from different treatment groups. The emphasis of this dissertation was on the role of genetic background and dietary immunomodulators on chicken <b>heterophil</b> function in order to prevent and control SE colonization and shedding, using selected breeds of chickens. First, the baseline <b>heterophil</b> function was monitored in vitro using oxidative burst, phagocytosis and bacterial killing to study intracellular killing mechanisms. Additionally, HETs-DNA release has been for the first time described in avian species and used to explore a potential role of extracellular <b>heterophil</b> killing. We compared the responses of different chicken lines with dietary immunomodulatory effects when exposed to SE challenge. In vivo <b>heterophil</b> function and bacterial clearance by bacterial cultures were evaluated in both challenged and non challenged chickens. The responses of chicken heterophils to dietary immunomodulators and SE challenge were significantly influenced by genetic background, and dietary immunomodulators have significant effect on <b>heterophil</b> function in both non-challenged and challenged chickens. Increased SE clearance in challenged birds that were fed with supplemented diet was also observed.

40|$|SUMMARY: Positive {{troponin}} {{test results}} in peripheral blood {{can be detected}} either during myocardial injury or from falsely positive test results. In this report, we present the positive results of a troponin test in a 24 -year-old pregnant woman referred to the emergency department with atypical chest pain, and the clinical algorithm {{that we used to}} make the correct diagnosis. This patient presented with the same complaint of chest pain at different times while positive troponin levels were detected. In the absence of signs of myocardial injury, we suspected that <b>heterophil</b> antibodies were playing a major role. Further examinations revealed <b>heterophil</b> antibodies that could cross react with the troponin tests in peripheral blood. Key words: False positive troponin, <b>heterophil</b> antibodie...|$|E

Although this rise in titre preceded an acute rejection episode in the renal graft in some instances, it is considered that this relationship was coincidental.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported that the}} prophylactic administration of factor(s) from T-cell supernatants derived from Salmonella enteritidis-immune chickens (ILK) have a favorable effect in controlling or eliminating salmonellosis in neonatal poultry. Experimentally, we have used the intraperitoneal injection as the standard method of administering ILK to neonatal poultry. However, this method is neither easy, practical, nor economical for the poultry industry. In the present study, we evaluated the effectiveness of oral (p. o.), intranasal (i. n.), and subcutaneous (s. c.) administration of ILK for ease of delivery, induction of protective resistance against Salmonella enteritidis (Se) organ invasion, {{and the ability to}} activate peripheral blood <b>heterophils</b> in day-old chickens. In the first experiments, delivery of ILK p. o., i. n., and s. c. significantly (P < 0. 01) increased the resistance of day-old chickens to Se organ invasion. The level of protection was equivalent to that induced by the i. p. route. Administration of a comparable protein control (bovine serum albumin, BSA) by the 3 routes induced no protective effect against Se organ invasion. Likewise, a significant increase was found in the number of circulating <b>heterophils</b> within 4 h of administration of the ILK by all routes. In the 2 nd experiment, the function of the <b>heterophils</b> from ILK-treated birds was compared with that of the control cells in adherence, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis assays. The <b>heterophils</b> from birds given ILK i. p., s. c., p. o., or i. n. had significantly (P < 0. 01) increased functional activities when compared to the activities of the <b>heterophils</b> from the control birds. These studies indicate that the delivery of ILK either orally or parenterally, routes which can be used by the poultry industry, can confer protection to chickens against a localized enteric Se organ invasion by potentiating the systemic heterophilic innate response...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In specific-pathogen-free {{chickens}} {{infected with}} the highly virulent HPS- 2 strain or virulent reference GBF- 1 strain of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), pathologic changes of the bone marrow were investigated. On histologic examination, bone marrow lesions were prominent in the HPS- 2 group but only mild in the GBF- 1 group. The bone marrow of the HPS- 2 group showed severe lysis and depletion of <b>heterophil</b> myelocytes with pyknotic nuclear alteration 2 – 3 days after inoculation. On examination with an electron mi-croscope, <b>heterophil</b> myelocytes were characterized by shrinkage of the cytoplasm and peripheral condensation of nuclear chromatin. IBDV particles were not detected in altered myelocytes. A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling method demonstrated a positive reaction in only <b>heterophil</b> myelocytes. In contrast, nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HPS- 2 –infected bone marrow cells was indiscernible by agarose gel electrophoresis. These findings indicate that lysis of bone marrow cells is selectively induced in <b>heterophil</b> myelocytes {{at an early stage}} after IBDV infection and independent of virus replication.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{different}} types of circulating leucocytes may provide information about the health state of birds in the wild. We counted the number and proportions of circulating leucocytes in blood smears of nestling pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) shortly before fledging. We studied the relationship between these haematological measures and environmental factors like parasitism, body mass, hatching date, and brood size. The heterophils-to-lymphocytes ratio was higher in nestlings whose nests suffered from mite infestation and in lighter individuals, heterophils being the cells that responded preferentially to malnutrition. Recruited birds had lower lymphocyte and <b>heterophil</b> counts when nestlings than non-recruited ones. Our results show that <b>heterophil</b> count is a better predictor of local recruitment than other variables widely used for nestlings as survival predictors, like body mass or hatching date, supporting the hypothesis that low <b>heterophil</b> counts reflect a good individual health state in nestlings.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Heterophils</b> are {{important}} mediators of innate resistance in poultry, especially in young birds {{that have not}} yet developed an acquired immune response. Invasion of the intestinal mucosa by Salmonella spp. initiates the recruitment of large numbers of <b>heterophils</b> to the lamina propria. Thus, the heterophilic response can control, but not eliminate, bacterial num-bers in the bird until development of acquired immu-nity. Unfortunately, chicks and turkey poults are highly susceptible to Salmonella infections during the first 4 d posthatch due to the functional immaturity of both the innate and acquired immune systems. We have previ-ously shown that the administration of Salmonella enteritidis (SE) -immune lymphokines (ILK) into either 18 -d-old developing embryos or day-of-hatch chicks an...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{interaction}} between <b>heterophils</b> and monocyte-macrophage system cells with salmonella, one-day-old White Plymouth Rock chicks were inoculated with 2 × 108 colony forming unit (CFU) of Salmonella enteritidis phage type 4. Samples from the caeca were taken for light and electron microscopy study. Groups of birds were euthanized by cervical dislocation at 6 hours (h) post inoculation and after 3, and 10 days (d) post inoculation. Histological examination at 3 d after infection showed heterophilic and mononuclear infiltration into the lamina propria mucosae and tela submucosa. The accumulation of macrophage-like cells accompanied this process at 10 d after infection. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of <b>heterophils</b> in the lamina propria at 3 d after infection and their migration between mucosal epithelial cells to intestinal lumen at 10 d after infection. Some of them were smaller with gap formation between intercellular space and <b>heterophils.</b> There was a decrease {{of the number of}} specific granules inside. Bacteria were not found within their cytoplasm. Oedema, condensation of chromatin, disruption of nuclear membrane and degradation of cytoplasmic organelles were seen in macrophage-like cells in the lamina propria. Formations of intracellular inclusions with cytoplasmic organelles and bacteri...|$|R
