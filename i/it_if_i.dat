500|$|Her {{books were}} very popular during the Great Depression and World War II. Her novels, which {{journalist}} Lesley McDowell described as containing [...] "derring-do, dashing blades, and maids in peril", allowed readers {{to escape from}} the mundane and difficult elements of their lives. In a letter describing her novel Friday's Child, Heyer commented, [...] "'I think myself I ought to be shot for writing such nonsense. ...

500|$|In 1935, Somervell was {{appointed}} {{as head of}} the Works Project Administration in New York City. Over the next {{three and a half years}} he spent $10,000,000 a month on Great Depression relief works. He worked with the local politicians and labor leaders. He upheld the right of workers to form unions and improved relations with left-wing groups, once declaring that [...] "I wouldn't know a Red if I saw one, and wouldn't do anything about <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did". The biggest project was the construction of LaGuardia Airport. Somervell established a reputation as a man who could handle projects involving hundreds of thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars.|$|E

Maguire said he always knew he was good enough to win a tournament and that he would aim for a top-16 finish for the season. White said, [...] "Stephen outplayed me in safety, potting and position so he deserved to win" [...] and, [...] "He gave me a good bashing.

The group eventually signed with Atlantic Records for North and South America, and formed their own label with Watson, [...] (distributed by EMI), for Australia and Asia. In November 2000, after the group had left the label, Sony issued The Best of Volume 1 without the band's involvement. Johns disavowed the compilation, [...] "We thought about putting out ads in the street press to make people aware that we weren't endorsing it, {{but that would have}} blown the whole thing out of proportion ...

I'll keep doing it as long as I still {{get a kick out of}} <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> were to stop doing it, I would miss it terribly." [...] Sony Pictures's contract to co-produce the series with MGM and Eon expired with the release of Spectre and the distribution rights to release Bond 25 in cinemas were put up for negotiation, with MGM and Eon only offering a one-film contract. In July 2017 it was announced that the film would be released on 8 November 2019. In August 2017 Craig confirmed that he would reprise his role as Bond.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} the final episode, [...] "These Are The Voyages..." [...] was mostly negative.

It was written by Berman and Braga, who responded to negative criticism of the episode by saying [...] "You have to remember that under normal circumstances most people probably would have thought this was a very cool episode because it has a great concept driving it". Berman later said that [...] "I would have never done <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had known how people were going to react." ...|$|E

500|$|The Rio Branco Cabinet, {{increasingly}} divided, {{resigned in}} June 1875 after having served for four years. The Cabinet's viability had been impaired by the ongoing crisis with the Catholic Church {{and an international}} financial crash that caused the failure of several Brazilian banks. The Emperor attempted, without success, to convince Paranhos to continue {{as head of the}} government. Paranhos replied in a letter: [...] "Your Majesty knows that I wish to deliver my post to whoever is better to occupy <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> have not become sick in public thus far, {{there is no doubt that}} I am tired." [...] PedroII had no intention on naming the 2nd Viscount of Uruguai as Rio Branco's replacement, to prevent the ultraconservative faction from coming to power. Instead, he called on the Duke of Caxias to head a new cabinet.|$|E
500|$|Carte {{later said}} it was [...] "the scheme of my life" [...] to found a school of high-quality, family-friendly English comic opera, in {{contrast}} to the [...] burlesques and adaptations of French operettas that dominated the London musical stage at that time. His experience in writing operettas, however, had convinced him that his own creative talents were inadequate for the task. He later wrote to dramatist W. S. Gilbert, [...] "I envy your position but I could never attain <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> could be an author like you I would certainly not be a manager. I am simply the tradesman who sells your works of art." [...] Furthermore, in 1874 Carte did not yet have the resources to make his idea into reality, and after his season at the Opera Comique, he terminated his lease. In the same year, he arranged for his client, Offenbach, to collaborate with H. B. Farnie to write a new operetta on the theme of Dick Whittington and His Cat, which played during the Christmas season at the Alhambra Theatre.|$|E
500|$|When Johnston {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1877, {{he was involved in}} the controversial Texas-Pacific Bill, a battle between Northern and Southern railroad interests. Johnston was opposed to Tom Scott's Texas and Pacific Railway, and the bill, which favored Scott's interests. Scott was trying to persuade Southern states to accept his railroad so that they would subsequently appoint senators who would vote for the bill. Johnston's seat was vulnerable if Scott succeeded in influencing the Virginia legislature, as it was known that he opposed the bill. As Johnston wrote in a letter, [...] "...what I have done about the Pacific road is before the people and I cannot recall <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would. It would not be policy to retreat from my position nor am I inclined to do so, if was policy. I thought & I think that I was right & am therefore ready to take the consequences. I intend to fight it out on that line." [...] William Mahone worked to prevent his re-election. Most Southern states went along with Scott, but Virginia and Louisiana did not, and Johnston was re-elected.|$|E

500|$|In {{their first}} game of April, Vancouver {{attempted}} to improve its offensive production by re-calling their 2011 first round draft choice, Nicklas Jensen, and forward Bill Sweatt. The recalls failed to produce, however, as the Canucks lost to the San Jose Sharks 3–2. The following day, the Canucks acquired centre Derek Roy from the Dallas Stars for Kevin Connauton and a second-round draft pick. The trade {{was believed to be}} an attempt to fill a hole at centre while Kesler was out with an injury. The expectation was that Roy would become the team's third line center once Kesler returned to the line-up, though the possibility of the two playing together was proposed. [...] At the NHL trade deadline, Vancouver failed to trade Luongo. They were reportedly close to a deal with the Toronto Maple Leafs, which eventually fell through. In response to finding out {{that he would not be}} traded, Luongo stated, [...] "My contract sucks — that's what's the problem," [...] and would [...] "scrap <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could now." [...] The Canucks felt they needed more size and grit in their line-up and attempted to add some though trades. However, they missed out on acquiring Ryane Clowe and Raffi Torres. Clowe chose to waive his no-trade clause to go to the New York Rangers so he could play in the Eastern Conference. The Coyotes traded Torres to the Sharks, as they considered San Jose's third-round pick more attractive than the Canucks' third-rounder.|$|E
500|$|Peter Buck's {{style of}} playing guitar has {{been singled out}} {{by many as the}} most {{distinctive}} aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's [...] "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" [...] style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American folk rock band The Byrds. Buck has stated [...] " [...] Roger McGuinn was a big influence on me as a guitar player", but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including Big Star and The Soft Boys, that inspired him more. Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of Johnny Marr of alternative rock contemporaries The Smiths. While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by Marr, whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M. Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, [...] "I know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo, people go nuts, but I don't write songs that suit that, and I am not interested in that. I can do <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have to, but I don't like it." [...] Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by Paul McCartney of The Beatles and Chris Squire of Yes; Mills has said, [...] "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways [...] [...] [...] I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the kick drum, root note bass work." [...] Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said [...] "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality." ...|$|E
