5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. <b>Horse</b> <b>manure</b> was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|E

50|$|On many farms, {{the basic}} {{composting}} ingredients are animal manure generated {{on the farm}} and bedding. Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non-traditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and <b>horse</b> <b>manures,</b> when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials - those low in nitrogen preferred, such as sawdust or straw.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure {{variations}} in the isotopic composition (d 13 C and d 15 N) during the composting of different agricultural wastes using bench-scale bioreactors. Four different feedstocks of agricultural wastes (<b>Horse</b> bedding <b>manure</b> + legumes residues; Dairy manure + Jatropha mill cake; Dairy manure + sugarcane residues; Dairy manure) were used for aerobic-thermophilic composting. During composting no significant differences were found between the d 13 C values of the source material and the compost, except for Dairy manure + sugarcane residues. d 15 N values increased significantly in composts of <b>Horse</b> bedding <b>manure</b> + legumes residues and Dairy manure + Jatropha mill cake. d 15 N values of composts may be related to NH 3 volatilization during the composting process. Isotopic signatures (d 13 C, d 15 N) can be used to differentiate composts from different feedstock sources and d 15 N values may be a quantitative indicator of NH 3 volatilization during composting. Use of bench-scale bioreactors is a promising apparatus to study the dynamics of C and N and stable isotopes signatures during composting, but future adjustments regarding sampling methodology are necessary. 201...|$|R
30|$|The {{normalized}} aboveground P {{content was}} significantly different between P fertilizers in all experiments (Fig.  3). In the Castel soil, inoculation with BE 1 {{led to a}} significantly larger P content in the P 0 and cow manure compost treatments, while inoculation with BE 2 and BE 3 resulted in an increased P content in both animal manure treatments (Fig.  3 b). In the Vörden soil, inoculation with BE 2 resulted in an increased P content when combined {{with any of the}} recycling fertilizers (Fig.  3 e). In the remaining soils (Buus, Humpolec, Lukavec, and Taastrup), BE inoculation did not result in increased aboveground P contents. In the Castel soil, the higher P content due to BE 2 addition (combined with cow and <b>horse</b> <b>manures)</b> is reflecting the significant increase in P concentration in the aboveground biomass (Table  7). BE 3 increased P concentration only in the P 0 treatment, while BE 1 did not induce any P concentration increase. In the Vörden soil, where plants also accumulated more P in the aboveground biomass (Fig.  3 e), P concentration was also higher (as compared to the corresponding BE 0 control), but only when sewage sludge ashes were combined with BE 2 and when P-enriched BOF slags were combined with BE 2 or BE 3.|$|R

25|$|The canal {{was used}} for the {{carriage}} of coal, timber, straw and manure. Straw was shipped to London, for use as bedding for horses, and <b>horse</b> <b>manure</b> was transported in the opposite direction, from the bus depots of London, to be used as fertiliser on farms in the locality. Coal was delivered to Aston Clinton House from the canal, and to three gas works, which were located at Wendover, Halton and near Bucklandwharf bridge, which carries the old route of the A41 road over the canal. The coal came from the Midlands, and was used to produce coal for lighting. The Gas Works at Aston Clinton survived until 1964. In 1875, Heygates flour mill was built {{on the banks of the}} canal at Gamnel Bridge. It was powered by steam engines, for which the canal supplied the water. Grain was delivered by boat, and the processed flour was transported away by boat. After the end of the Second World War water transport was superseded by trucks, and in 2013 the mill operated a fleet of 16 trucks to deliver flour to markets in the south of England.|$|E

To do so, she works heavily with Kristoff, Sven and Olaf to make this a reality. Upon making sure that her surprise party in the palace courtyard is ready, she leaves Kristoff in charge while she goes to get Anna. However, Elsa starts to come down with a cold as she leads Anna on a treasure hunt to find all the gifts that have been made for her.

As Anna notices Elsa's cold getting worse, she tries in vain to get Elsa to stop exerting herself, even taking medicine from Oaken in case Elsa gets sicker. Unfortunately, Elsa's cold cause her to become very tired and behave in a seemingly intoxicated-like manner, and she nearly falls from Arendelle's clock tower only for Anna to save her. Upon finally admitting to Anna that she is indeed sick after the previous incident, she allows Anna to escort her home feeling she has ruined everything, and finds that the party has gone off successfully for Anna (as well as discovering her snowgie creations), and still slightly intoxicated, she ends the party by accidentally sneezing into the birthday bugle horn, which inadvertently sends a gigantic snowball {{all the way to the}} Southern Isles and hits the now-demoted Hans, causing him to fall into a pile of <b>horse</b> <b>manure.</b> Afterwards, Anna tells a now bed-ridden Elsa that she has given her the best birthday ever by letting her take care of her.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of growing continuous corn is receiving increasing consideration {{with the changing}} agricultural patterns. Farmers are devoting more and more acres to intensive cropping sequences in which corn follows corn more often. The practice of continuous corn-growing consecutive corn crops on the same land-is on the increase. This is because corn is the most profitable crop generally grown in the Corn Belt, because limitations in production technology have been eased, and because farm product demands or values have altered. Early research with crop rotations generally resulted in conclusions that continuous culture of inter tilled crops, especially of corn, was less profitable than other alternatives and resulted in decreasing soil fertility and continuously declining yields. The early experiments indicated that a crop rotation, including a nitrogen-fixing legume, was needed to increase or even maintain fertility levels. These experiments usually did not explore the use of N, and, if they did, the N usually was used in low amounts, probably {{because of the high}} cost.

40|$|Background: Earthworms play a {{critical}} role in organic matter decomposition because of the interactions they establish with microorganisms. The ingestion, digestion, assimilation of organic material in the gut and then casting is the first step in earthworm-microorganism interactions. The current knowledge of these direct effects is still limited for epigeic earthworm species, mainly those living in man-made environments. Here we tested whether and to what extent the earthworm Eisenia andrei is capable of altering the microbiological properties of fresh organic matter through gut associated processes; and if these direct effects are related to the earthworm diet. Methodology: To address these questions we determined the microbial community structure (phospholipid fatty acid profiles) and microbial activity (fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis) in the earthworm casts derived from three types of animal <b>manure</b> (cow, <b>horse</b> and pig <b>manure),</b> which differed in microbial composition. Principal Findings: The passage of the organic material through the gut of E. andrei reduced the total microbial biomass irrespective of the type of manure, and resulted in a decrease in bacterial biomass in all the manures; whilst leaving the fungi unaffected in the egested materials. However, unlike the microbial biomass, no such reduction was detected in the total microbial activity of cast samples derived from the pig manure.

Passive treatment of AMD by bacterial sulfate reduc-tion (BSR) generates alkalinity via bicarbonate production and removes metals from solution via sulfide precipitation. Successful BSR systems require electron donors, the capacity to strip oxygen, and to reduce metal through bacterially-mediated reactions. Numerous carbon sources, including <b>horse</b> and cow <b>manure,</b> chicken litter, ethanol, methanol, and municipal sewage sludge and compost, have been successfully applied to treat AMD by BSR; MWW contains a wide va-riety of organic compounds ranging from simple sugars to cellulose, indicating suitability as a rich substrate for microbial communities.
