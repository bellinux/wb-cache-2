500|$|Back at his apartment, Jerry's parents, Morty and Helen, sleep over, with Jerry {{sleeping}} in Kramer's apartment. <b>He</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> party and {{claims that he}} cannot get the phone number of the woman from Elaine {{because he does not}} talk about other women with her; additionally, she is still angry with him. Morty suggests that Jerry [...] "stake out" [...] the woman by waiting outside her office, an idea which Jerry likes. The following day, Jerry and George Costanza perform the stake out, pretending that they are coming to see someone else in the building named [...] "Art Corvelay", but under pressure, George insists that they make it [...] "Art Vandelay".

500|$|As {{the three}} summer interns prepare to depart, Michael (Steve Carell) hears from {{various members of}} the office that two of the interns might be dating, and feels upset that he was left out of the gossip. <b>He</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} with the third intern, and learns that the interns had recently gone out to a young people's club, where they saw Stanley (Leslie David Baker) dancing with a woman, presumably his wife Teri. Michael, wanting to start some gossip of his own, forms the conclusion that Stanley was out because he was having a mid-life crisis and shares it with the office, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) claims Stanley does not like crowds and that Teri is out of town. When Michael confronts the interns about this, they insist they saw Stanley there [...] "making out" [...] with a woman. Now realizing that Stanley is possibly having an affair and he is the first person to learn of it, Michael starts telling the employees. Jim (John Krasinski) urges Michael to stop spreading a rumor that he does not know for certain to be true. When Stanley is leaving, Michael heads to the parking lot to discuss the rumor with him. Stanley initially denies it, but when Michael mentions that he was spotted in the club by the interns, he reveals that since Teri has been out of town constantly, he has been seeking company from a nurse named Cynthia, whom he met in rehab. Stanley urges Michael not to say anything since he is breaking it off with Cynthia, and Michael agrees, despite having already told the entire office.|$|E

2500|$|The {{historian}} Peter Hunter-Blair expounded {{what is now}} {{regarded as}} the traditional view of the Anglo-Saxon arrival in Britain. He suggested a mass immigration, fighting and driving the Sub-Roman Britons off their land and into the western extremities of the islands, and into the Breton and Iberian peninsulas. This view was probably influenced by sources such as Bede, where <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Britons being slaughtered or going into [...] "perpetual servitude".

He confessed to using amphetamines in the book, stating that his first drug use was in Hawaii in April 1998.

Dunnigan is greeted by his wife and son, and Danny and Ruth walk the street hand in hand.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Louis Menand {{thought that}} {{teachers}} assign the novel {{because of the}} optimistic ending, to teach adolescent readers that [...] "alienation is just a phase." [...] While Brooks maintained that Holden acts his age, Menand claimed that Holden thinks as an adult, given his ability to accurately perceive people and their motives. Others highlight the dilemma of Holden's state, in between adolescence and adulthood. Holden is quick to become emotional. [...] "I felt sorry as hell for..." [...] is a phrase he often uses. It is often said that Holden changes at the end, when he watches Phoebe on the carousel, and <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> golden ring and how it's good for kids to try and grab it.|$|E

2500|$|The book {{received}} {{praise from}} many critics, garnering near-unanimous acclaim. In a review Publishers Weekly wrote that [...] "a talented new humorist springs onto the scene: Rakoff has a rapier wit, slashing {{in all directions}} with slice-of-life insights and cutting remarks, sometimes nicking himself with self-deprecation in his dexterous duel with the American experience." [...] Kevin Cowherd {{said that in the}} book, Rakoff [...] "makes a strong bid for the title of Most Neurotic Man on the Planet, and the results are absolutely hilarious – when they're not achingly revealing and tinged with sadness." [...] Max Magee called the collection a [...] "meta-article in which <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> particulars and relative merits of his assignment as he embarks on that assignment" [...] and that [...] "the reader feels invited in for a behind the scenes look at {{what it is like to}} be a disaffected, overly-qualified, under-ambitious journalist as he takes on his fluffy assignments." [...] David Bahr calls Fraud [...] "witty, insightful and typically bittersweet." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{explain the}} {{presence}} of the [...] "dark lady", Stanborough asserts that she is the good self's exact opposite: [...] "The first was masculine, so this one is necessarily characterized as feminine; the first was 'faire,' or light, so this one is 'colour'd ill.'" [...] The entire argument is based in the fact that Stanborough believes that, in order to have creative insight, an artist has mental divisions between depression and joy. [...] Booth exposes the underlying sexual nature of the poem in line 12 where it states [...] "one angel in another's hell". [...] <b>He</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> work of Ingram and Redpath when they discuss the meanings used for hell in the time Shakespeare was writing. [...] They wrote that [...] "several meanings appear to be present: ... such a position was often used as a pretext for a sexual tumble; 'hell' is probably also... the female sexual organ" [...] in which case [...] "'one angel' is the man, and 'another' is the woman" [...] clearly engaging in sex.|$|E
2500|$|Until August 2010, WikiLeaks was {{hosted by}} PRQ, a Sweden-based company {{providing}} [...] "highly secure, no-questions-asked hosting services". PRQ {{is said to}} have [...] "almost no information about its clientele and maintains few if any of its own logs". Currently, WikiLeaks is hosted mainly by the Swedish Internet service provider Bahnhof in the Pionen facility, a former nuclear bunker in Sweden. Other servers are spread around the world with the main server located in Sweden. Julian Assange has said that the servers are located in Sweden (and the other countries) [...] "specifically because those nations offer legal protection to the disclosures made on the site". <b>He</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Swedish constitution, which gives the information providers total legal protection. It is forbidden according to Swedish law for any administrative authority to make inquiries about the sources of any type of newspaper. These laws, and the hosting by PRQ, make it difficult for any authorities to eliminate WikiLeaks; they place an onus of proof upon any complainant whose suit would circumscribe WikiLeaks' liberty, e.g. its rights to exercise free speech online. Furthermore, [...] "WikiLeaks maintains its own servers at undisclosed locations, keeps no logs and uses military-grade encryption to protect sources and other confidential information." [...] Such arrangements have been called [...] "bulletproof hosting".|$|E

2500|$|The film {{features}} multiple post-credit scenes. The first {{gives the}} Vulture {{a chance at}} redemption, showing him protect Parker from another villain. Watts said this [...] "was a really interesting thing {{in the development of}} the story. You couldn’t just rely on the tropes of the villain being a murderer and killing a bunch of people. He had to be redeemable in some capacity in the end and that he believes everything he said, especially about his family." [...] The second post-credits scene is an additional Captain America PSA, where <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> value of patience—a joke at the expense of the audience, who have just waited through the film's credits to see the scene. This was a [...] "last-minute addition" [...] to the film. Watts completed work on Homecoming at the beginning of June 2017, approving the final visual effects shots. He stated that he had never been told that he could not do something by Marvel or Sony, saying, [...] "You assume you’ll have to fight for every little weird thing you wanna do, but I didn’t really ever run into that. I got to do kind of everything I wanted to." [...] That month, Starr explained that he was playing the academic decathlon coach at Parker's high school, and Marshall-Green was said to be portraying another Shocker.|$|E
