5|$|A first {{opening of}} the bridge {{took place in the}} same day with the ceremonies for the {{national}} day on July 14, 1897, in the presence of governor Chabié. The ribbon for the access zone was cut by the governor's wife, then the officials walked a short distance to the mobile deck, which was opened to allow the passage of the military ship L'Ardent. 21 cannon shots were fired at dusk and <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> commemorate the construction of the bridge and on that day there were organised ceremonies including horse races and donkey races. The second opening was on October 19, 1897, in the presence of André Lebon, the prime minister of the French colonies.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October of each year, Pleione {{along with}} the rest of the cluster can be seen rising in the east in the early morning before <b>dawn.</b> <b>To</b> see it after sunset, one will need to wait until December. By mid-February, the star is visible to {{virtually}} every inhabited region of the globe, with only those south of 66° unable to see it. Even in cities like Cape Town, South Africa, at the tip of the African continent, the star rises almost 32° above the horizon. Due to its declination of roughly +24°, Pleione is circumpolar in the northern hemisphere at latitudes greater than 66° North. Once late April arrives, the cluster can be spotted briefly in the deepening twilight of the western horizon, soon to disappear with the other setting stars.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War I, B3, B4, and B5 were at Dover and were deployed on a line between Calais and the Goodwin Sands to protect {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force to France. Each submarine would sail from Dover before <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> be secured at the buoy marking their billet at dawn, the idea being that {{they would be able to}} slip from the buoy when they spotted an enemy ship and manoeuvre to attack. That this was not a good tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October. Nonetheless the scheme was successful and the BEF crossed to France without loss.|$|E

5000|$|Conclusion: This {{final chapter}} is more passionate and urgent than its predecessors. In it, he criticizes conformity: [...] "If {{a man does}} not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a {{different}} drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away", By doing so, men may find happiness and self-fulfillment. I do not say that John or Jonathan will realize all this; but such is {{the character of that}} morrow which mere lapse of time can never make <b>to</b> <b>dawn.</b> The light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us.

5|$|In 1951, in {{what was}} a common {{practice}} during this time, the Hungarian Police arrived at <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> seize the Pallendal family home and arrest and deport the family from Budapest. Seven-year-old Béla and six-year-old László Banathy, along with their Pallendal grandmother and two aunts, were put aboard a freight train and sent toward Russia. The train stopped occasionally and a few hundred people were forced off at rural towns. The Pallendal family was ejected in eastern Hungary. There an uncle located them and hid them from authorities in a small village.|$|E
5|$|In {{this night}} battle the 64th Field Artillery Battalion, {{supporting}} the 1st Battalion, became {{directly involved in}} the fighting. About 50 North Koreans infiltrated before <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> A Battery's position and assaulted it. North Koreans employing submachine guns overran two artillery-machine-gun perimeter positions, penetrating to the artillery pieces at 03:00. There, Captain Andrew C. Anderson and his men fought hand-to-hand combat with the North Koreans. Some of the guns fell temporarily into North Korean hands but the artillerymen repulsed the attack, aided by the concentrations of fire from C Battery, 90th Field Artillery Battalion nearby, which cut off the North Koreans from reinforcements. In defending its guns in this night battle, A Battery lost seven men killed and 12 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The flight muscles {{need to be}} kept at a {{suitable}} temperature for the dragonfly {{to be able to}} fly. Being cold-blooded, they can raise their temperature by basking in the sun. Early in the morning, they may choose to perch in a vertical position with the wings outstretched, while {{in the middle of the}} day, a horizontal stance may be chosen. Another method of warming up used by some larger dragonflies is wing-whirring, a rapid vibration of the wings that causes heat to be generated in the flight muscles. The green darner (Anax junius) is known for its long-distance migrations, and often resorts to wing-whirring before <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> enable it to make an early start.|$|E

5|$|The {{gathering}} of the dignitaries at the station and {{the departure of the}} trains was a major event. Every hotel room and lodging-house in Liverpool was full the night before. From 9.00am onwards the area around the station was filled with people, and crowds thronged the trackside at Liverpool to watch the trains depart. One group of men had each paid two shillings for access to the best vantage point, the top of a chimney near the tunnel leading to Crown Street railway station; they were hoisted up by rope and board shortly after <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> watch proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} is {{generally}} conducted {{on a daily}} basis, from <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> dusk when they have chicks to feed. Overnight trips are sometimes made, especially as the chicks grow older; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data loggers to track {{the movement of the}} birds showed the foraging trips become longer once the chick-rearing period is over. Birds venture out for 10–20 days during incubation and before the moult. Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single consumer of marine resources among all of the seabirds, with an estimated take of 9.2 million tonnes of krill a year. Outside the breeding season, macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper, longer, and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. Year round, foraging dives usually occur during daylight hours, but winter dives are more constrained by daylight due to the shorter days.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E

5|$|Reinforcements, {{consisting}} of elements from the QRF, 10th Mountain Division soldiers, Rangers, SEALs, Pakistan Army tanks and Malaysian armored personnel carriers, finally arrived at 1:55am on 4 October. The combined force worked until <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> free the pilot's body, receiving RPG and small arms fire throughout the night. All the casualties were loaded onto the armored personnel carriers, {{and the remainder}} of the force was left behind and {{had no choice but to}} move out on foot. AH-6 gunships raked the streets with fire to support the movement. The main force of the convoy arrived at the Pakistani Stadium-compound for the QRF-at 6:30am, thus concluding one of the bloodiest and fiercest urban firefights since the Vietnam War. Task Force Ranger experienced a total of 17 killed in action and 106 wounded. Various estimates placed Somali casualties above 1,000. Although Task Force Ranger's few missions were successes, the overall outcome of Operation Gothic Serpent was deemed a failure because of the Task Force's failure to complete their stated mission, capturing Mohamed Farrah Aidid. Most U.S. forces pulled out of Somalia by March 1994. The withdrawal from Somalia, was completed on March 1995. Even though Operation Gothic Serpent failed, USSOCOM still made significant contributions to operations in Somalia. SOF performed reconnaissance and surveillance missions, assisted with humanitarian relief, protected American forces and conducted riverine patrols. Additionally, they ensured the safe landing of the Marines and safeguarded the arrival of merchant ships carrying food.|$|E
5|$|The first {{attack on}} Île de la Passe was {{launched}} {{on the evening}} of 10 August, with Staunch towing boats carrying over 400 soldiers, Royal Marines and volunteer sailors to the island under cover of darkness, guided by Nereides pilot. During the night however, the pilot became lost and the boats were scattered in high winds and had not reassembled by <b>dawn.</b> <b>To</b> distract French attention from the drifting boats, Pym directed Captain Henry Lambert in Iphigenia to sail conspicuously off Port Napoleon, where {{the main body of the}} French squadron, led by Hamelin in Vénus, was based. Pym joined Lambert later in the day and the frigates subsequently returned to the waters of Grand Port by different routes, confusing French observers from the shore as to British intentions. By 13 August, the boats originally intended for the attack had still not been assembled and Pym decided that he could not risk waiting any longer without the French launching a counterattack. Launching his own boats at 8:00 pm, guided by the pilot and commanded by Pym's second in command, Lieutenant Norman, Pym's marines and sailors landed on the island in darkness under heavy fire from the defenders. Norman was killed in the initial exchange of fire, but his deputy, Lieutenant Watling, seized the island by storming the fortifications surrounding the battery. Seven British personnel were killed and 18 wounded in the battle, in which the storming party managed to seize intact French naval code books and took 80 prisoners. Willoughby was furious that Pym had assumed command of the operation without his permission and the officers exchanged angry letters, part of an ongoing disagreement between them that engendered mutual distrust.|$|E
5|$|Women {{typically}} {{began working}} at the mines at around the age of 10 or 11, {{although there are some}} cases of girls starting work at as young as six, and in areas such as Camborne with a high demand for workers it was not unusual for girls to start work at age seven or eight. (Charles Foster Barham's enquiry of 1841 found an average age for starting work of 12.) Until the 1870s Cornwall was largely unaffected by legislation which limited child labour in mines elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and the typical ages of bal maidens remained virtually unchanged between the 1841 census and the 1871 census. Women would typically remain at the mine until they married; while this generally meant that they stopped working at between the ages of 19 and 24, it was not unusual for unmarried women and widows to continue working into their 60s and 70s; and a 93-year-old bal maiden was recorded in the 1891 census. A typical working day would last from 7.00am to 5.00pm in summer and from <b>dawn</b> <b>to</b> dusk in winter, (ore dressing by candle-light was not cost effective) with a lunch break of either half an hour or an hour at noon. Lunch typically consisted of pasties, hoggans (hard pasties made with unleavened barley flour and filled with pork, potato or dried fruit) or fish eaten cold or warmed in ovens attached to the mine's furnaces, along with mugwort or pennyroyal tea, and it was not usual even for workers who lived near their workplace to go home for meals. Although still not paid on a piece-rate basis, each bal maiden would be expected to meet a daily quota to earn her pay; some mines operated on the basis that once the quota had been met the bal maidens were allowed to go home, meaning the working day could finish up to two hours early. Although at a few tin mines at which water-powered machinery was in continuous operation bal maidens would work seven days a week, {{in the vast majority of}} the industry they were not expected to work on Sundays. As well as the religious holidays observed in the rest of the United Kingdom, Cornish miners also celebrated St Piran's Day (5March) and Chewidden Thursday (the Thursday before Christmas), purportedly the day on which St Piran rediscovered tin-smelting. Other than religious holidays and parish feast days, Cornish miners had no holidays until labour reforms in the early 20thcentury.|$|E
