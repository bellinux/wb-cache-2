40|$|For the {{development}} of the X-ray Free Electron Lasers test facility (SXFEL) at SINAP, ultra-short bunch is the crucial requirement for excellent lasing performance.

The distributions of <b>deflecting</b> fields are considered with respect to non linear additions, which provide emittance deteriorations during a transformation.

40|$|Existing {{multihop}} wireless {{routing protocols}} {{are incapable of}} reacting quickly to transient degradation of link quality rendering them unsuitable for supporting real-time applications. This limitation is imposed on the metricbased routing protocols {{in order to achieve}} route stability and low protocol overhead. We design <b>Deflect,</b> a lightweight and opportunistic mechanism that works underneath the routing layer. <b>Deflect</b> enables fast local adaptation of end-to-end routes in response to sudden drops in link delivery ratio or node failures. <b>Deflect</b> nodes snoop on transmissions to monitor link quality, and <b>deflect</b> traffic on other nodes to circumvent a poor-quality link. The design of <b>Deflect</b> achieves the following goals: a) zero message overhead mechanism for monitoring link quality at a very short time scale; b) fast switching of traffic through a node in neighborhood of the poor link; c) transparency to end-to-end routing protocol. We show that <b>Deflect</b> can react to link quality degradation within a few hundred milliseconds, compared to tens of seconds for an end-to-end routing protocol. Experiments in presence of controlled interference with <b>Deflect</b> show that the average measurement error is less than 5 %. Overall, <b>Deflect</b> is shown to provide significant improvement in packet loss and delay compared with traditional metric-based routing. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Deflecting</b> {{cavities}} {{are used}} in particle accelerators for the manipulation of charged particles by <b>deflecting</b> or crabbing (rotating) them. For short deflectors, {{the effect of the}} power coupler on the <b>deflecting</b> field can become significant. The particular power coupler type can introduce multipole rf field components and coupler-specific wakefields. Coupler types that would normally be considered like standard on-cell coupler, waveguide coupler, or mode-launcher coupler could have one or two rf feeds. The major advantage of a dual-feed coupler is the absence of monopole and quadrupole rf field components in the <b>deflecting</b> structure. However, a dual-feed coupler is mechanically more complex than a typical single-feed coupler and needs a splitter. For most applications, <b>deflecting</b> structures are placed in regions where there is small space hence reducing the size of the structure is very desirable. This paper investigates the multipole field components of the <b>deflecting</b> mode in single-feed couplers and ways to overcome the effect of the monopole component on the beam. Significant advances in performance have been demonstrated. Additionally, a novel coupler design is introduced which has no monopole field component to the <b>deflecting</b> mode and is more compact than the conventional dual-feed coupler...|$|R

5|$|The {{calutron}} {{is a type}} of sector mass spectrometer, {{an instrument}} in which a sample is ionized and then accelerated by electric fields and <b>deflected</b> by magnetic fields. The ions ultimately collide with a plate and produce a measurable electric current. Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses, the heavier isotopes are <b>deflected</b> less by the magnetic field, causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass, striking the plate at different locations. The mass of the ions can be calculated according to the strength of the field and the charge of the ions. During World War II, calutrons were developed to use this principle to obtain substantial quantities of high-purity uranium-235, by taking advantage of the small mass difference between uranium isotopes.|$|E

5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, light does not travel along {{straight}} lines when it propagates in a gravitational field. Instead, it is <b>deflected</b> {{in the presence}} of massive bodies. In particular, starlight is <b>deflected</b> as it passes near the Sun, leading to apparent shifts of up 1.75 arc seconds in the stars' positions in the sky (an arc second is equal to 1/3600 of a degree). In the framework of Newtonian gravity, a heuristic argument can be made that leads to light deflection by half that amount. The different predictions can be tested by observing stars that are close to the Sun during a solar eclipse. In this way, a British expedition to West Africa in 1919, directed by Arthur Eddington, confirmed that Einstein's prediction was correct, and the Newtonian predictions wrong, via observation of the May 1919 eclipse. Eddington's results were not very accurate; subsequent observations of the deflection of the light of distant quasars by the Sun, which utilize highly accurate techniques of radio astronomy, have confirmed Eddington's results with significantly better precision (the first such measurements date from 1967, the most recent comprehensive analysis from 2004).|$|E
