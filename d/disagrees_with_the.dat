5|$|The novel {{started a}} new era of {{literature}} after the downfall of President Suharto and ignited the sastra wangi (literally 'fragrant literature') literary movement as well as an influx of sexually themed literary works by women. Utami <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> label sastra wangi, stating that it reflects the obsession of the press with the women writers and not their work.|$|E
5|$|Members of Howling Bells {{have cited}} The Beatles, Charles Mingus, Peter Green, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Jimi Hendrix as influences. The {{catalyst}} for the change from Waikiki to Howling Bells was Juanita and Joel's trip to see Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in Australia. They saw this band shrouded in red lights, and it created an atmosphere that inspired them to alter their musical direction. The band's style {{has been compared to}} that of Siouxsie and the Banshees, PJ Harvey, The Velvet Underground, Nick Cave, Mazzy Star, and The Duke Spirit. Their music has been called folk rock, melodic blues, and country-goth. Juanita <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> group's gothic characterization.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{traditional}} Israeli historiography, Arab {{sources in}} general {{do not see}} it as {{a turning point in the}} war. They agree that the Egyptian declarations regarding Tel Aviv as the main strategic objective were ostentatious rather than operative. In his book 1948, New Historian Benny Morris also <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> traditional Israeli view, and states that portraying the operation as the catalyst for the Egyptian halt is a mistake. However, in a March 15, 2007 panel of historians, Morris said that at least in the Egyptian expeditionary force, the Israeli attack did lead to a decision to stop advancing.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{this section}} Heilmann embarks on a {{thorough}} description of the Berlin Archaeopteryx specimen, which includes detailed comparisons to specific aspects of modern birds. Following a comparison of its skull to that of Aetosaurus, Euparkeria, and a modern pigeon, Heilmann states that he <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> scientific consensus {{of the time that}} the skull of Archaeopteryx is that of a true bird. He writes that the reptilian features of the skull are much more pronounced, citing features of the teeth, fenestrae, and jaw structure as being undeniably un-birdlike. Heilmann found that much of Archaeopteryxs anatomy, in fact, was decidedly reptilian and generally opposed to that of modern birds. This included the pelvis, which lacks a pectineal process and has a very different os sacrum from modern birds, as well as the carpus, which Heilmann wrote exhibited the same phenomena found in the wrists of modern reptiles. Its tail was also noted by Heilmann as being extremely reptilian and resembling nothing known of modern birds.|$|E
5|$|The novella {{begins with}} 5-Liu Hsing, as a child, being taught about Earth {{through the use}} of virtual reality tapes, an {{experience}} which her younger self takes exception to. She develops a close friendship with 5-Nova Luis. At the age of seven Hsing and the other children of similar age are allowed to put on clothes for the first time; Hsing greatly looks forward to this ceremony, a rite of passage aboard the Discovery. As the children grow older Luis begins to develop an interest in the virtual reality programs that allow people on the ship to explore the planet they have left behind. Disagreements with her friend Rosie, a member of Bliss, lead Hsing to explore the philosophy of the angels. Although she questions in her own mind the purpose of the voyage, she <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> angels' thinking, which eventually damages her friendship with Rosie. Luis also investigates this group, by participating in some of their practices.|$|E
5|$|Marlene (Merle Dandridge) is {{the leader}} of the Fireflies, a militia {{movement}} hoping to wrest control of the Quarantine Zones from the military. She was tasked by Ellie's mother, a close friend of hers, to look out for her daughter, but Ellie only met her after her infection. After being wounded in Boston, she offers to sell Joel and Tess the merchandise Robert stole from them and sold to her in return for smuggling Ellie out of the Quarantine Zone. Joel meets Marlene again at the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City, where scientists are running tests on Ellie. Marlene reveals that they will operate on Ellie, which will result in her death; Joel <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> operation and fights back. After Joel rescues Ellie, Marlene tries to stop him from leaving, insisting that taking Ellie will merely delay her death until a more gruesome one occurs, and Ellie's return to her would help to create a cure against the infection. Joel disregards her and instead shoots her in the stomach. She begs for her life, but Joel executes her with a shot to the head, ensuring that no-one is left to come after them.|$|E

Van Voytz and Count Golke – the Alliance/Imperial liaison – negotiate with Alliance Command and agree to a compromise: {{one half of the}} Tanith First is sent to the northern Montorq forests to scout the area, while the other is redeployed to the Seiberq Pocket – the most dangerous section of the war zone – where they are tasked with infiltrating the Shadik lines and destroying the enemy's newly developed siege guns.|$|E
25|$|Points {{are awarded}} for each pass, and usually one driver prevails.

Sometimes {{mechanical}} failure determines the battle's outcome, either during or preceding a heat. If a car cannot enter a tandem battle, the remaining entrant (who automatically advances) {{will give a}} solo demonstration pass. In the event of apparently close or tied runs, crowds often demonstrate their desire for another run with chants of 'one more time'.|$|E

25|$|More's {{persecution}} {{is made to}} seem {{even more}} unjust by the inclusion of Eustace Chapuys, the long-time Imperial ambassador to England, into the story. Chapuys recognises More as a stout man of the church, and in Act II, after More's resignation from the Chancellorship, he informs More of a planned rebellion along the Scottish border, expecting More to be sympathetic. Instead, More informs Norfolk of the plot, showing him to be patriotic and loyal to the King. This, along with More's refusal to actually speak out against the King, shows {{him to be a}} loyal subject, and thus Cromwell appears to prosecute him out of personal spite and because he <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> King's divorce.|$|E
25|$|Ford {{believes}} that {{victory over the}} guilt of sin (justification) was provided at the cross, victory over the power of sin (sanctification) {{is the work of}} a lifetime and victory over the presence of sin (glorification) occurs at the return of Christ Jesus. Ford <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> belief of sinless perfection, and does not hold to the belief that the saints are sealed at the end time, but holds that the final removal of sin occurs when mortality changes to immortality at the return of Jesus Christ. Ford holds that victory over the presence of sin does not occur during this lifetime, so sin continues among the saints up to the return of Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|The written work of Somananda {{contains}} more than philosophical system building. It also contains {{an account of the}} rival schools of philosophy and a series of refutations based on logic. For example, Somananda <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> gross realism of the Nyaya-Vaisesika system, the subtle realism of Samkhya, and the idealism of Vedanta, or that of Vijnanavada of Buddhism. In his view, the universe is an appearance, but not of Maya (illusion) but of the free will of Shiva. In reality the universe is Shiva himself. Instead of postulating an principle of beginning-less ignorance avidya like Advaita Vedanta, he points out that it is though the free-will of Shiva, Svatantriya, that ignorance appears. Ignorance is not an ontological reality but an epistemological phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|At Roosevelt's request, Moore, Kreizler, and he {{meet the}} {{following}} morning in Roosevelt's office to discuss the case. Kreizler has examined the body and <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> official coroner's report. He connects the Santorelli killing {{to that of a}} second case he knows of in which two children, Benjamin and Sofia Zweig, were killed and had their eyes gouged out. Roosevelt announces that he knows of two more murders that match the pattern. Roosevelt decides to investigate, but because Kreizler has such a dubious reputation as an alienist, and because the investigation will become politically difficult, he establishes a base of operations for them outside the police precinct. Politically, Roosevelt cannot afford {{to be associated with the}} investigation and is not involved with the day-to-day operations.|$|E
25|$|Although Robert Barro, an American {{economist}} from Harvard University, did {{not directly}} respond to the arguments posed by the book, his research {{on the relationship between}} democracy and growth <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> argument that inclusive institutions give rise to economic growth. According to Barro's 1996 paper Democracy and Growth, the econometric analysis reveals a weak relationship between democracy and growth in a study of 100 countries from 1960 to 1990. After fixing factors like rule of law and free market, democracy has a statistically insignificant influence on economic growth. At the same time, raising the standard of living—including health service, education—will substantially raise the probability of political freedom. Barro is essentially arguing the reverse of Acemoglu and Robinson: that economic growth gives rise to better political institutions, especially when a country is poor.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the Greek word is unclear. It is {{sometimes}} held {{to be from the}} Tamil word (arisi), or rather Old Tamil arici. However, Krishnamurti <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> notion that Old Tamil arici {{is the source of the}} Greek term, and proposes that it was borrowed from descendants of Proto-Dravidian *wariñci instead. Mayrhofer suggests that the immediate source of the Greek word is to be sought in Old Iranian words of the types *vrīz- or *vrinj- (Source of the modern Persian word Berenj), but these are ultimately traced back to Indo-Aryan (as in Sanskrit vrīhí-). P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar assumed that the Sanskrit vrīhí- is derived from the Tamil arici, while Ferdinand Kittel derived it from the Dravidian root variki. However, R. Swaminatha Aiyar believes that the Sanskrit vrīhí- is derived from a Proto-Indo-Iranian root, and the Old Tamil arici is also of Indo-European origin.|$|E
