2500|$|A {{strengthening}} of the bridge was completed in 1907 to handle heavier freight trains by engineer Ralph Modjeski, of the famed bridge civil engineering firm Modjeski and Masters, who added a third line of trusses down the middle, a central girder, and interleaved columns. In 1917â€“18, the double tracks on the bridge were converted to <b>gantlet</b> <b>track</b> operation to center the weight of heavier NH 2-10-2 steam locomotives. Even so, trains were restricted to 12 miles per hour. [...] In 1959, the gantlet tracks were replaced by a centered single track.|$|E
50|$|Gauntlet track or {{interlaced}} track (also <b>gantlet</b> <b>track)</b> is an arrangement in which railway tracks run parallel {{on a single}} track bed and are interlaced (i.e., overlapped) such that only one pair of rails may be used at a time. Since this requires only slightly more width than a single track, all rails can be carried on the same crossties/sleepers. Trains run on the discrete pair of rails appropriate to their direction, track gauge or loading gauge.|$|E
