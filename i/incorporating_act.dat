You must {{be aware that the}} extremes of rude and of civilized society are, in these our days, on the point of approaching to each other. In the patriarchal period, a man is his own weaver, tailor, butcher, shoemaker, and so forth; and, in the age of Stock-companies, as the present may be called, an individual may be said, in one sense, to exercise the same plurality of trades. In fact, a man who has dipt largely into these speculations, may combine his own expenditure with the improvement of his own income, just like the ingenious hydraulic machine, which, by its very waste, raises its own supplies of water. Such a person buys his bread from his own Baking Company, his milk and cheese from his own Dairy Company, takes off a new coat for the benefit of his own Clothing Company, illuminates his house to advance his own Gas Establishment, and drinks an additional bottle of wine {{for the benefit of the}} General Wine Importation Company, of which he is himself a member. Every act, which would otherwise be one of mere extravagance, is, to such a person, seasoned with the odor lucri, and reconciled to prudence. Even if the price of the article consumed be extravagant, and the quality indifferent, the person, who is in a manner his own customer, is only imposed upon for his own benefit. Nay, if the Joint-stock Company of Undertakers shall unite with the Medical Faculty, as proposed by the late facetious Doctor G--, under the firm of Death and the Doctor, the shareholder might contrive to secure to his heirs a handsome slice of his own death- bed and funeral expenses. In short, Stock-Companies are the fashion of the age, and an <b>Incorporating</b> <b>Act</b> will, I think, be particularly useful in bringing back the body, over whom I have the honour to preside, to a spirit of subordination, highly necessary to success in every enterprise where joint wisdom, talent, and labour, are to be employed. It is with regret that I state, that, besides several differences amongst yourselves, I have not myself for some time been treated with that deference among you which circumstances entitled me to expect." ...|$|E

It has been claimed that its founder, Baden-Powell, wrote to Earl Grey, the Governor General of Canada in 1910 {{and asked him to}} organize Scouting in Canada. A branch of The Boy Scouts Association was established in Canada under The Boy Scouts Association's Overseas Department. The Canadian General Council of The Boy Scouts Association was incorporated by an Act of the Canadian Parliament on June 12, 1914. The Canadian General Council continued to be represented internationally by The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom until 30 October 1946, when the Canadian General Council became a direct member of the Boy Scout World Conference, now the World Organization of the Scout Movement. The organization continued to be a branch of The Scout Association of the United Kingdom until 2007. The Canadian General Council of The Boy Scouts Association changed its name to Boy Scouts of Canada by an amendment to its <b>incorporating</b> <b>Act</b> of Parliament. In 1976 the Scouts Canada logo was introduced and the organization, by its By-laws, adopted the name Scouts Canada. In 2007, The Boy Scouts of Canada changed its name to Scouts Canada.|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the Integrated Application of Active Controls (IAAC) Technology to an Advanced Subsonic Transport Project, established as {{one element of}} the NASA/Boeing Energy Efficient Transport Technology Program. The performance assessment showed that <b>incorporating</b> <b>ACT</b> into an airplane designed to fly approximately 200 passengers approximately 2, 000 nmi could yield block fuel savings from 6 to 10 percent at the design range. The principal risks associated with incorporating these active control functions into a commercial airplane are those involved with the ACT system implementation. The Test and Evaluation phase of the IAAC Project focused on the design, fabrication, and test {{of a system that}} implemented pitch axis fly-by-wire, pitch axis augmentation, and wing load alleviation. The system was built to be flight worthy, and was planned to be experimentally flown on the 757. The system was installed in the Boeing Digital Avionics Flight Controls Laboratory (DAFCL), where open loop hardware and software tests, and a brief examination of a direct drive valve (DDV) actuation concept were accomplished. The IAAC Project has shown that ACT can be beneficially incorporated into a commercial transport airplane. Based on the results achieved during the testing phase, {{there appears to be no}} fundamental reason(s) that would preclude the commercial application of ACT, assuming an appropriate development effort is included...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The Home Management of Malaria (HMM) {{strategy}} was developed using chloroquine, a now obsolete drug, {{which has been}} replaced by artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in health facility settings. Incorporation of ACT in HMM would greatly expand access to effective antimalarial therapy by the populations living in underserved areas in malaria endemic countries. The feasibility and acceptability of <b>incorporating</b> <b>ACT</b> in HMM needs to be evaluated. Methods A multi-country study was performed in four district-size sites in Ghana (two sites), Nigeria and Uganda, with populations ranging between 38, 000 and 60, 000. Community medicine distributors (CMDs) were trained in each village to dispense pre-packaged ACT to febrile children aged 6 â€“ 59 months, after exclusion of danger signs. A community mobilization campaign accompanied the programme. Artesunate-amodiaquine (AA) was used in Ghana and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in Nigeria and Uganda. Harmonized qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were used to evaluate CMD performance, caregiver adherence and treatment coverage of febrile children with ACTs obtained from CMDs. Results Some 20, 000 fever episodes in young children were treated with ACT by CMDs across the four study sites. Cross-sectional surveys identified 2, 190 children with fever in the two preceding weeks, of whom 1, 289 (59 %) were reported to have received ACT from a CMD. Coverage varied from 52 % in Nigeria to 75 % in Ho District, Ghana. Coverage rates did not appear to vary greatly with the age of the child or with the educational level of the caregiver. A very high proportion of children were reported to have received the first dose on the day of onset or the next day in all four sites (range 86 â€“ 97 %, average 90 %). The proportion of children correctly treated in terms of dose and duration was also high (range 74 â€“ 97 %, average 85 %). Overall, the proportion of febrile children who received prompt treatment and the correct dose for the assigned duration of treatment ranged from 71 % to 87 % (average 77 %). Almost all caregivers perceived ACT to be effective, and no severe adverse events were reported. Conclusion ACTs can be successfully integrated into the HMM strategy. </p...|$|E
