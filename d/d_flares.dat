40|$|Methanol {{and water}} vapour masers are signposts of {{early stages of}} high-mass star {{formation}} but it is generally thought that due to different excitation processes they probe distinct parts of stellar environments. Here we present observations of the intermediate-mass young stellar object G 107. 298 + 5. 639, revealing {{for the first time}} that 34. 4 <b>d</b> <b>flares</b> of the 6. 7 GHz methanol maser emission alternate with flares of individual features of the 22 GHz water maser. High angular resolution data reveal that a few components of both maser species showing periodic behaviour coincide in position and velocity and all the periodic water maser components appear in the methanol maser region of size of 360 au. The maser flares could be caused by variations in the infrared radiation field induced by cyclic accretion instabilities in a circumstellar or protobinary disc. The observations do not support either the stellar pulsations or the seed photon flux variations as the underlying mechanisms of the periodicity in the source.

40|$|We {{present an}} optical and {{infrared}} (IR) study of IC 10 X- 2, a high-mass X-ray binary {{in the galaxy}} IC 10. Previous optical and X-ray studies suggest X- 2 is a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient: a large-amplitude (factor of ∼ 100), short-duration (hours to weeks) X-ray outburst on 2010 May 21. We analyze R- and g-band light curves of X- 2 from the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory taken between 2013 July 15 and 2017 Feb 14 show high-amplitude (≳ 1 mag), short-duration (≲ 8 <b>d)</b> <b>flares</b> and dips (≳ 0. 5 mag). Near-IR spectroscopy of X- 2 from Palomar/TripleSpec show He I, Paschen-γ, and Paschen-β emission lines with similar shapes and amplitudes as those of luminous blue variables (LBVs) and LBV candidates (LBVc). Mid-IR colors and magnitudes from Spitzer/IRAC photometry of X- 2 resemble those of known LBV/LBVcs. We suggest that the stellar companion in X- 2 is an LBV/LBVc and discuss possible origins of the optical flares. Dips in the optical light curve are indicative of eclipses from optically thick clumps formed in the winds of the stellar counterpart. Given the constraints on the flare duration (0. 02 - 0. 8 d) and the time between flares (15. 1 ± 7. 8 d), we estimate the clump volume filling factor in the stellar winds, f_V, to be 0. 01 < f_V < 0. 71, which overlaps with values measured from massive star winds. In X- 2, we interpret {{the origin of the}} optical flares as the accretion of clumps formed in the winds of an LBV/LBVc onto the compact object. Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|We present Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) All-Sky Monitor {{observations}} of the X-ray binary Circinus X- 1 which illustrate the variety of intensity profiles associated with the 16. 55 <b>d</b> <b>flaring</b> cycle of the source. We also present eight {{observations of}} Cir X- 1 made with the RXTE Proportional Counter Array {{over the course of}} a cycle wherein the average intensity of the flaring state decreased gradually over ~ 12 days. Fourier power density spectra for these observations show a narrow quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) peak which shifts in frequency between 6. 8 Hz and 32 Hz, as well as a broad QPO peak that remains roughly stationary at ~ 4 Hz. We identify these as Z-source horizontal and normal branch oscillations (HBOs/NBOs) respectively. Color-color and hardness-intensity diagrams (CDs/HIDs) show curvilinear tracks for each of the observations. The properties of the QPOs and very low frequency noise allow us to identify segments of these tracks with Z-source horizontal, normal, and flaring branches which shift location in the CDs and HIDs over the course of the 16. 55 d cycle. These results contradict a previous prediction, based on the hypothesis that Cir X- 1 is a high-Mdot atoll source, that HBOs should never occur in this source (Oosterbroek et al. 1995; van der Klis 1994) ...|$|R
40|$|Context. Observations of {{the effect}} of microlensing in gravitationally lensed quasars could {{potentially}} be used to study the structure of the source on distance scales down {{to the size of the}} supermassive black hole powering the quasar activity. Aims. We search for the microlensing effect in the gamma-ray band using the signal from a gravitationally lensed blazar B 0218 + 357. Methonds. We develop a method of deconvolution of contributions of two images of the source into the gamma-ray band flaring lightcurve. We use this method to study the evolution of the magnification factor ratio between the two images throughout the flaring episodes. We interpret the time variability of the ratio as a signature of the microlensing effect and derive constraints on the physical parameters of the gamma-ray source by comparing the observed variability properties of the magnification factor ratio with those derived from numerical simulations of the microlensing caustics networks. Results. We find that the magnification factor ratio has experienced a change characteristic for a microlensing caustic crossing event during a 100 <b>d</b> <b>flaring</b> period in 2012. It has further changed between 2012 and a recent flaring episode in 2014. We use the measurement of the maximal magnification and duration of the caustic crossing event to derive an estimate of the projected size of the gamma-ray emission region in B 0218 + 357, R_γ∼ 10 ^ 14 cm. This estimate is compatible with a complementary estimate found from the minimal variability time scale. The microlensing / minimal variability time scale measurements of the source size suggest that the gamma-ray emission is produced at the base of the blazar jet, in the direct vicinity of the central supermassive black hole.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} structure function {{analysis of the}} UV variability of Q 0957 + 561. From new optical observations, we constructed normalized structure functions of the quasar luminosity at restframe wavelengths of 2100 and 2600 Å. Old optical records also allow the structure function to be obtained at 2100 Å, but 10 {{years ago in the}} observer's frame. These three structure functions are then compared to predictions of both simple and relatively sophisticated (incorporating two independent variable components) Poissonian models. We do not find clear evidence of a chromatic mechanism of variability. From the recent data, 100 -d time-symmetric and 170 -d time-asymmetric flares are produced at both restframe wavelengths. Taking into account measurements of time delays and the existence of an EUV/radio jet, reverberation is probably the main mechanism of variability. Thus, two types of EUV/X-ray fluctuations would be generated within or close to the jet and later reprocessed by the disc gas in the two emission rings. The 100 -d time-symmetric shots are also responsible for most of the 2100 Å variability detected in the old experiment. However, {{there is no evidence of}} asymmetric shots in the old UV variability. If reverberation is the involved mechanism of variability, this could mean an intermittent production of high-energy asymmetric fluctuations. The old records are also consistent with the presence of very short-lifetime (10 <b>d)</b> symmetric <b>flares,</b> which may represent additional evidence of time evolution. We also discuss the quasar structure that emerges from the variability scenario. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A (based on the brightness records at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The X-ray source 2 S 0114 + 650 =LSI+ 65 010 is {{a binary}} system {{containing}} a B-type primary {{and a low}} mass companion {{believed to be a}} neutron star. The system has three reported periodicities: the orbital period, Porb 11. 6 <b>d,</b> X-ray <b>flaring</b> with Pflare 2. 7 hr, and a "superorbital" X-ray periodicity Psuper 30. 7 d. The objective {{of this paper is to}} show that the puzzling periodicities in the system may be explained in the context of scenarios in which tidal interactions drive oscillations in the B-supergiant star. We calculate the solution of the equations of motion for one layer of small surface elements distributed along the equator of the star, as they respond to the forces due to gas pressure, centrifugal, coriolis, viscous forces, and the gravitational forces of both stars. This calculation provides variability timescales that can be compared with the observations. In addition, we use observational data obtained at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional en San Pedro Mártir (OAN/SPM) between 1993 - 2004 to determine which of the periodicities may be present in the optical region. We suggest that the tidal oscillations lead to a structured stellar wind which, when fed to the neutron star, produces the X-ray modulations. The connection between the stellar oscillations and the modulation of the mass ejection may lie in the shear energy dissipation generated by the tangential motions that are produced by the tidal interaction, particularly in the tidal bulge region. The tidal oscillation scenario weakens the case for 2 S 0114 + 650 containing a magnetar descendent. Comment: 12 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
40|$|KIC 7341653 is one {{of several}} late-type M dwarfs {{observed}} in the main mission of Kepler with peculiar infrared colors placing them in the domain of suspected young stellar objects (YSO). It is likely associated with a powerful X-ray emitter with X-ray flares. Kepler light curves reveal two distinct types of activity: frequent flares lasting from less than 30 min to a few hours and a periodic variability with a period of 0. 5463441 (7) <b>d.</b> The largest <b>flare</b> detected increased the flux in the Kepler passband by a factor of 2. 8 and released an estimated 4 × 10 ^ 34 erg of energy in the Kepler band. Segmented periodogram analysis reveals that the amplitude of the periodic variation was subject to secular changes, dropping from peak values around 20 ppt to below 5 ppt {{toward the end of the}} mission, while the phase varied periodically with an amplitude of 0. 15 radians and period 362 (3) d. Two possible interpretations of the phase periodicity are discussed: a migrating long-lived photospheric spot and a Doppler frequency shift generated by a solar-mass faint companion, such as a white dwarf.

40|$|International audienceIn 2016 September, the microquasar Cygnus X- 3 {{underwent}} a giant radio flare, which was monitored for 6  d with the Medicina Radio Astronomical Station and the Sardinia Radio Telescope. Long observations were performed {{in order to}} follow {{the evolution of the}} flare on an hourly scale, covering six frequency ranges from 1. 5 to 25. 6  GHz. The radio emission reached a maximum of 13. 2  ±  0. 7  Jy at 7. 2  GHz and 10  ±  1  Jy at 18. 6  GHz. Rapid flux variations were observed at high radio frequencies {{at the peak of the}} flare, together with rapid evolution of the spectral index: α steepened from 0. 3 to 0. 6 (with S_ν ∝ ν^−α) within 5  h. This is the first time that such fast variations are observed, giving support to the evolution from optically thick to optically thin plasmons in expansion moving outward from the core. Based on the Italian network (Noto, Medicina and SRT) and extended to the European antennas (Torun, Yebes, Onsala), very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations were triggered at 22  GHz on five different occasions, four times prior to the giant flare, and once during its decay phase. Flux variations of 2  h duration were recorded during the first session. They correspond to a mini-flare that occurred close to the core 10 d before the onset of the giant flare. From the latest VLBI observation we infer that 4 <b>d</b> after the <b>flare</b> peak the jet emission was extended over 30 mas...|$|R
40|$|Tidal {{disruption}} of main sequence stars by black holes {{has generally been}} thought {{to lead to a}} signal dominated by UV emission. If, however, the black hole spins rapidly and the poloidal magnetic field intensity on the black hole horizon is comparable to the inner accretion disk pressure, a powerful jet may form whose luminosity can easily exceed the thermal UV luminosity. When the jet beam points at Earth, its non-thermal luminosity can dominate the emitted spectrum. The thermal and non-thermal components decay differently with time. In particular, the thermal emission should remain roughly constant for a significant time after the period of maximum accretion, beginning to diminish only after a delay, whereas after the peak accretion rate, the non-thermal jet emission decays, but then reaches a plateau. Both transitions are tied to a characteristic timescale t_ Edd at which the accretion rate falls below Eddington. Making use of this timescale in a new parameter-inference formalism for tidal disruption events with significant emission from a jet, we analyze the recent flare source Swift J 2058. It is consistent with an event in which a main sequence solar-type staris disrupted by a black hole of mass ∼ 4 × 10 ^ 7 M_. The beginning of the flat phase in the non-thermal emission from this source can possibly be seen in the late-time lightcurve. Optical photometry over the first ≃ 40 <b>d</b> of this <b>flare</b> is also consistent with this picture, but is only weakly constraining because the bolometric correction is very uncertain. We suggest that future searches for main sequence tidal disruptions use methods sensitive to jet radiation as well as to thermal UV radiation.
