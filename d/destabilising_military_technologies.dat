40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} civil use from the knowledge embedded in <b>military</b> <b>technology.</b> Using forward patent citation as indicator {{and from a}} comprehensive sample of 582 military patents with both US and European protection, we analysed the citations received for a military patents in subsequent patents. The technological origin of the citing patents will determine {{the use of a}} <b>military</b> <b>technology.</b> The methodology involves a descriptive analysis and the estimation of a multilevel logit model to determine the factors explaining the civilian use of <b>military</b> <b>technology.</b> The results show a differential behaviour among countries and types of <b>military</b> <b>technology.</b> Characteristics of firms, such as the technological experience of the company or institution in using <b>military</b> <b>technology,</b> are critical for a civilian use of the <b>military</b> knowledge. <b>Military</b> <b>technology,</b> Patent citations, Dual-use, Technology flows,...|$|R

40|$|Wars {{of conquest}} and wars of {{independence}} {{are characterized by}} an asymmetric payoff structure: one party gets aggregate production if it wins, and its own production if it loses, while the other party gets only its own production if it wins, and nothing if it loses. We study a model of war with such an asymmetric payoff structure, and private information about <b>military</b> <b>technologies.</b> We characterize continuous equilibrium strategies and find that the party that gets aggregate production when winning fights aggressively only if its <b>military</b> <b>technology</b> is relatively good, while the other party fights quite aggressively even if its <b>military</b> <b>technology</b> is relatively poor. From an ex ante perspective, this other party is therefore more likely {{to win the war}} unless its expected <b>military</b> <b>technology</b> is considerably worse. Our model may thus explain why defending countries and secessionist groups often win against much larger opponents...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of human intelligence and property rights is {{positively related to}} weapons and <b>military</b> <b>technology.</b> Weapons allowed the reallocation of property rights over females, initiating a positive feedback loop between weapons and intelligence through natural selection. Weapons and <b>military</b> <b>technology</b> then extended property rights over land and produce making agriculture possible. The first economic revolution was the discovery of weapons, not agriculture. ...|$|R
