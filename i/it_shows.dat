5|$|The {{relation}} of two fields is {{expressed by the}} notion of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by Evariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle can not be done with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.|$|E
5|$|Two {{music videos}} {{were made for}} the song; the first one for the ballad version, {{and the other for}} the English version. The ballad version was {{directed}} by Felipe Niño. In the video, the group is shown performing the song along with an orchestra behind them. It is filmed on a stage where shows López singing his verses, while the others members of the group, follow up with the chorus. At the end of the video the people of the orchestra starts to applaud when the group ends to sing. In the English version of the video, the plot is completely different. The video starts in a cloudy afternoon after a storm, where the group is situated in a white room. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> López singing in a ladder when it later starts to fill with water. At {{the last part of the}} video, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> Son by Four singing out of the house after the storm has ended.|$|E

5|$|When the Italian {{physicist}} Galileo Galilei first {{observed the}} planet in the early 17thcentury, he found it showed phases like the Moon, varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa. When Venus is furthest from the Sun in the sky, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> a half-lit phase, {{and when it is}} closest to the Sun in the sky, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> as a crescent or full phase. This could be possible only if Venus orbited the Sun, and this was among the first observations to clearly contradict the Ptolemaic geocentric model that the Solar System was concentric and centred on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Along with Lou Holtz, Parseghian {{served as}} one of two honorary coaches in Notre Dame's 2007 spring game, an annual {{scrimmage}} held in April. Holtz's Gold team defeated Parseghian's Blue team, 10–6. The same year, Notre Dame unveiled a statue in Parseghian's honor by sculptor Jerry McKenna, depicting players carrying him off the field in triumph following the 1971 Cotton Bowl victory over Texas.

The video received general acclaim from critics, who commended the simplicity of the video and labeled it as Madonna's most fun video in years. The song was included on the setlist of The MDNA Tour where she performed it while playing a guitar.|$|E

Some of them even hung over these limply, moving to and fro as they swung, while others were stretched upon the benches as though they slept.

Waltzing a Courtship, an anonymous drawing, was widely circulated in various publications. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> an elegantly dressed Pig-faced Lady dancing with a hunchbacked and extremely short man bearing a strong resemblance to Kirkcudbright.|$|E
5|$|Benefits Street is a British {{documentary}} series broadcast on Channel 4. It was first aired on 6 January 2014, {{and ran for}} five episodes. The show was filmed by documenting the lives of several residents of James Turner Street, Winson Green, Birmingham, England, United Kingdom, where newspapers including the Daily Mail and The Guardian reported that 90% of the residents claim benefits. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> benefits claimants committing crimes, including a demonstration of how to shoplift, and portrays {{a situation in which}} people are dependent on welfare payments and lack the motivation to seek employment.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics of lava dome eruptions include shallow, long-period and hybrid seismic activity, {{which is}} {{attributed}} to excess fluid pressures in the contributing vent chamber. Other characteristics of lava domes include their spherical dome shape, cycles of dome growth over long periods, and sudden onsets of violent explosive activity. The average rate of dome growth {{may be used as}} a rough indicator of magma supply, but <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> no systematic relationship to the timing or characteristic of lava dome explosions.|$|E

40|$|The {{rheological}} behaviour of soft flour (maida), {{a source of}} wheat starch was studied. Without any additives, flour solution showed thixotropic behaviour and its viscosity increased {{with the increase in}} the flour concentration. The addition of additives like oil and surfactant altered the rheological properties of flour-water suspension. The rheological properties have been studied in the presence of oil. It was found that the viscosity decreased slightly with the addition of oil. <b>It</b> <b>showed</b> shear-thinning behaviour of flour. To attain the stability of flour-water-oil solution, a non-ionic surfactant was used and change in viscosity was investigated. <b>It</b> <b>showed</b> shear thinning behaviour and at constant shear rate, <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> thixotropic behaviour...|$|R
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the {{coordinate}} system in space, space inversion, and in time, time reversal. In the first case, the space coordinate axes are reversed. The latter is reversal of the time direction. This is thought of, in the passive view, as having the observer set their clock at minus what <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> and then have the clock's hands move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|E
5|$|Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, {{was well}} {{received}} by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience {{was fascinated by the}} dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay {{can be viewed as a}} national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> social stability being repeatedly challenged, and <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Hardy and versatile, B.integrifolia {{will grow}} in clay, sand, acid and even {{alkaline}} soils, and <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> good resistance to wind and salt, making it suitable for seaside planting. It is therefore highly {{regarded as a}} low-maintenance garden tree, although its large size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens. Its hardiness may however forewarn weed potential, as some evidence of weediness has been seen in Western Australia and New Zealand. When growing near bushland within its native habitat, it is recommended to obtain local provenance seed or plants if available.|$|E
