25|$|The fire burns out and all {{the cats}} help get the camp set up again. Three days before the Gathering, Ashfur asks Firestar if he can go. Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, Jayfeather, and Squirrelflight are worried {{that he is going}} to {{publicly}} announce their secret. Between then and the day of the Gathering, the three warn Ashfur that he will regret it if he reveals the secret. Although he is frightened, he refuses to listen to them. Right before the Gathering, the patrol of warriors going notices that both Ashfur and Squirrelflight are missing. On the way to the Gathering, they see Ashfur's body lying in the WindClan stream as if he had drowned. They take him back to camp and set him for vigil. Leafpool notices a slit in his neck, suggesting he was murdered. After the Gathering, Firestar announces that Ashfur's death was unknown and suspects a cat from ThunderClan may have killed him, and the three see Squirrelflight looking scared and <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> The three vow to keep the recent events involving them, Squirrelflight, and Ashfur a secret.|$|E
500|$|... "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics; {{most of which}} were positive about Houston's 'soulful' performance and vocal maturity. Jean Rosenbluth of Los Angeles Times praised the song, saying [...] "Houston's elegant 'Exhale (Shoop Shoop)' [...] exude maturity without resorting to the relentlessly big vocals that characterize so many R records aiming for adult audiences." [...] Geoffrey Himes of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Sounding like someone who has just emptied her lungs after <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> a long time, Houston brings a surprisingly mature, world-weary tone to the song." [...] Robert Hilburn, pop music critic of Los Angeles Times, noted Babyface's achievement in the song, saying [...] "he [...] brings Houston down to earth, trading her normal vocal exuberance for convincing warmth." [...] Larry Flick of Billboard called the song [...] "a surprisingly understated shuffle-ballad with soul and far more interesting vocal colors than all the shrieking can provide."

[...] Anthony Violenti of The Buffalo News gave the song a positive review, commenting that Houston's vocals were intoxicating. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, in their review of the soundtrack, viewed the song as [...] "easy and understated". Steve Knopper of Newsday wrote that the song was [...] "irresistibly catchy" [...] and irritating at the same time. However, Patricia Smith of The Boston Globe wrote that the [...] "Shoop Shoop"s were [...] "annoying". While reviewing Houston's compilation Whitney: The Greatest Hits (2000), Christine Galera of Orlando Sentinel also expressed her dislike for the song, stating the songs from Waiting to Exhale, including [...] "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" [...] and [...] "Why Does It Hurt So Bad," [...] were too mellow.|$|E
2500|$|William B. Bankhead {{was devastated}} by his wife's death, which sent {{him into a}} bout of {{depression}} and alcoholism. Consequently, Tallulah and her sister Eugenia were mostly reared by their paternal grandmother, Tallulah James Brockman Bankhead, at the family estate called [...] "Sunset" [...] in Jasper, Alabama. As a child, Bankhead was described as [...] "extremely homely" [...] and overweight, while her sister was slim and prettier. As a result, she did everything in her efforts to gain attention, and constantly sought her father's approval. After watching a performance at a circus, she taught herself how to cartwheel, and frequently cartwheeled about the house, sang, and recited literature that she had memorized. She was prone to throwing tantrums, rolling around the floor, and <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> until she was visibly blue in the face. Her grandmother often threw {{a bucket of water}} on her to halt these outbursts.|$|E

50|$|Superpower: InvisibilitySomehow {{as if it}} was {{the exact}} {{opposite}} of her personality, the super power which she discovered she had after returning to the real world from the virtual gameworld is, surprisingly, invisibility.

60|$|She lay quite still, in case {{those eyes}} came {{to look on}} her again.

However, they did marry, on 19 September 2011 at Chelsea Town Hall, London. Michael and Shakira Caine were witnesses to the ceremony.|$|R
40|$|I’d like {{to start}} off this column with {{a story about a}} friend ofmine. We’ll call my friend “Jeff. ” The story {{involves}} his daugh-ter, who we will call “Jill. ” It seems that Jill, who is an accom-plished swimmer, once had a contest with a friend of hers to see who could <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> the longest. Jill easily won the contest – a fact that had to be verified by her friend – as Jill had the endurance and willpower to <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> so long that she passed out. I also hear that ambulances were involved afterwards. You know, as a father, I would be proud to have a daughter like Jill 1. I know Jeff is! I imagine anybody with that kind of willpower is rather immune to peer pressure, and will also ulti-mately succeed in whatever she sets her mind to. She definitely is tenacious – which is a synonym for stubborn. Obviously, she has the makings of a fine engineer. I have long thought that those children who have the poten-tial to be truly gifted engineers could be identified easily i...|$|R
60|$|She paused abruptly, and {{was quite}} {{still for a}} moment, almost <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> he thought, {{as if she were}} listening.

60|$|Barbara tiptoed to the door. <b>Holding</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> {{she turned}} the knob gently. The door swung open without a sound, and an instant later she stood within the room. Again her eyes were fixed upon Eddie Shorter. She saw his nerveless fingers relax their hold upon the grip of his revolver. She saw the weapon slip farther down into his lap. He did not move, other than to the deep and regular {{breathing}} of profound slumber.|$|E
60|$|Creeping up a {{fragrant}} slope {{she spread}} her plaid again {{and lay down}} where a cool breath flowed through wide chinks in the wall. Sleep was slowly returning when the rustle of footsteps scared it quite away and set her heart beating fast, for they came toward the new couch she had chosen. <b>Holding</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> she listened. The quiet tread drew nearer and nearer till it paused within a yard of her, then some one seemed to throw themselves down, sigh heavily {{a few times and}} grow still as if falling asleep.|$|E
50|$|In The Rising, Nicole's true {{mental state}} is {{revealed}} by Sam {{to everyone in}} front of Nicole when Maya meets her at the Nasts facility. While Nicole denies this, Sam antagonizes her by insinuating that Maya and Daniel slept together, causing Nicole to become outraged and attack Maya on the spot. In her furious rants, she confesses to having killed Serena. She is revealed to be a xana, which is how she killed her, {{by being able to}} <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> long enough to drown her, as she could always <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> longer than Serena could. Later, Nicole is drugged by Dr. Inglis and released in Maya's room, where she attempts to smother her with a pillow, nearly killing her, however, Maya is able to fight back, and ends up nearly killing Nicole. She leaves the unconscious girl in the room as she tries to escape. Nicole is later seen, bound and blindfolded, being taken into a van during the evacuation of the facility. It is later confirmed that she is being treated by the Nasts, but she will never be let near Maya or her friends ever again.|$|R
50|$|A {{conscious}} {{person will}} <b>hold</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> (see Apnea) and {{will try to}} access air, often resulting in panic, including rapid body movement. This uses up more oxygen in the blood stream and reduces the time to unconsciousness. The person can voluntarily <b>hold</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> for some time, but the breathing reflex will increase until the person tries to breathe, even when submerged.|$|R
50|$|Moray (birth name unknown) was {{orphaned}} {{when her}} parents' plane {{crashed into the}} sea; the young girl was saved, and subsequently raised, by dolphins.

Both pledged themselves to protecting the sea-world from any who would threaten it. An excellent swimmer, Moray can <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> for incredibly long periods but (unlike Manta) is vulnerable to deep-water pressure. She wears a leg-baring powerful red bathing suit with white trim, and a matching headband.|$|R
6000|$|Re-entering {{the house}} by an old and {{so-called}} secret stairway that led straight to the library, she had to traverse that great dark room. There, buried in an armchair {{in front of the}} hearth she saw Miltoun with a book on his knee, not reading, but looking up at the picture of the old Cardinal. She hurried on, tiptoeing over the soft carpet, <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> fearful of disturbing the queer interview, feeling guilty, too, of her new knowledge, which she did not mean to impart. She had burnt her fingers once at the flame between them; she would not do so a second time! ...|$|E
60|$|Immediately {{a girl in}} a holland dress {{shot down}} through space; whirled round the curve with a fearless {{centrifugal}} toss of her ankle; and vanished into the darkness beneath. She was followed by a stately girl in green, intently <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> as she flew; and also by a large young woman in black, with her lower lip grasped between her teeth, and her fine brown eyes protruding with excitement. Her passage created a miniature tempest which disarranged anew the hair of the lady on the landing, who waited in breathless alarm until two light shocks and a thump announced that the aerial voyagers had landed safely in the hall.|$|E
60|$|The proud {{consciousness}} of her trust, {{and the great}} importance she derived from it, might have advertised it to all the house if she had had to run the gauntlet of its inhabitants; but as Dolly had played in every dull room and passage many and many a time, when a child, and had ever since been the humble friend of Miss Haredale, whose foster-sister she was, she was as free of the building as the young lady herself. So, using no greater precaution than <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> and walking on tiptoe as she passed the library door, she went straight to Emma's room as a privileged visitor.|$|E

Ares, who blames himself for being unable to carry her away fast enough, lays her to rest with some mice recently executed by rats.|$|R
50|$|Superhuman {{strength}}- Captain Dynamo had superhuman strength. The {{upper limit}} of this strength is unknown, but the heaviest object {{he has been}} observed lifting over his head is a bus. His daughter, Bridget Flynn (who goes by the superhero codename Scrap), inherited this power, {{and appears to be}} capable of similar strength, as she easily lifted a tank over her head and threw it the length of a city block. This strength also comes with a degree of invulnerability, as Bridget is bulletproof and has resisted various attacks including intense heat, electricity and being frozen in a block of ice. Bridget can also <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> for twenty minutes.|$|R
5000|$|She {{also has}} the ability to {{generate}} and psionically manipulate energy fields of coherent red spectrum light force. She can project the light as simple brightness, or as concussive blasts, or use it to form [...] "solid" [...] objects such as swords, force fields, shields, funnels, and more. She was even able to make a light armor covering Nightcrawler as he trained with Captain Britain. [...] Cerise can create a bubble of coherent light around herself which she can levitate through the air. She once even used this energy to fly a whole broken Sentinel <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> friends within, across the Atlantic Ocean as a means of disguise. She can also fly naturally (without use of her energy fields), and <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> for six or seven minutes.|$|R
