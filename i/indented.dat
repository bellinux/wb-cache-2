5000|$|The {{off-side}} rule (blocks {{determined by}} <b>indenting)</b> {{can be implemented}} in the lexer, as in Python, where increasing the <b>indenting</b> results in the lexer emitting an <b>INDENT</b> token, and decreasing the <b>indenting</b> results in the lexer emitting a DEDENT token.

40|$|Medication {{turnaround}} time {{is defined as}} the interval from the time a medication order is written (manually or electronically) to the time the medication was administered. Monitoring medication {{turnaround time}} in inpatient settings allows organization to measure the impact of their efficiency of patient care. Objective: To trace the delays in the order and delivery system of In-patient pharmacy and check the average total time consumed in delivering drugs and medical consumables to the patients. Method: A time motion study was done in the in- patient pharmacy at a multi specialty hospital in Jaipur. A sample size of 300 <b>indents</b> was taken by using nonprobability convenient sampling method. Out of 300 <b>indents,</b> 56. 6 % were normal <b>indents,</b> 26. 6 % were new admission <b>indents</b> and 16. 6 % were urgent <b>indents.</b> Both primary and secondary data has been used in the study.

Results: The study found that 25. 2 % of the normal <b>indents,</b> 48. 7 % of the new admission <b>indents</b> and 60 % of the urgent <b>indents</b> were delayed. In addition, the average time taken to deliver normal <b>indent</b> was found to be 1 hour 8 minutes, for new admission <b>indent</b> it was 48 mins and for urgent <b>indent</b> it was 1 hr 20 minutes i. e. more than the normal <b>indent</b> and new admission <b>indent.</b> It was also found that the peak hours of the <b>indent</b> order were 10 : 00 pm to 12 : 00 am, also the peak hours of <b>indent</b> order and the availability of work force at that time was contradicting.

5|$|Beetle remains bearing what {{appeared}} to be the marks of bird attacks have been found by the River Ouse and hardened adults often bear symmetrically <b>indented</b> elytra, interpreted as 'pinch marks' inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening. Dead beetles have also been found in the webs of spiders in a captive population. The accidental predation of C. graminis by livestock consuming the tansy plant is also possible. Predation of a larva by the scorpionfly Panorpa germanica has been observed in the field. The tachinid genus Macquartia exclusively parasitizes Chrysolmelid beetles and one species of which, Macquartia dispar, may parasitise C. graminis directly. The adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into the vicinity of the host larvae.|$|E

5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} set {{detailed requirements}} for geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, {{particularly if they}} rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and to assess the effects of tides by measurement with specially constructed gauges. FitzRoy chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival there on 1 April 1836, the entire crew set to work, first erecting FitzRoy's new design of a tide gauge that allowed readings to be taken from the shore. Boats were sent all around the island to carry out the survey, and despite being impeded by strong winds, they took numerous soundings to establish depths around the atoll and in the lagoon. FitzRoy noted the smooth and solid rock-like outer wall of the atoll, with most life thriving where the surf was most violent. He had great difficulty in establishing the depth reached by living coral, as pieces were hard to break off and the small anchors, hooks, grappling irons, and chains they used were all snapped off by the swell as soon as they tried to pull them up. He had more success using a sounding line with a bell-shaped lead weight armed with tallow hardened with lime; this would be <b>indented</b> by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of the bottom; it would also collect any fragments of coral or grains of sand.|$|E
