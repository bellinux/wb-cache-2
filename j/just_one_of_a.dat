5|$|Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes {{took on a}} more heroic character, with forms {{becoming}} {{larger and}} more prominent. A view of Bentheim Castle, dated 1653, is <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on a wooded mountain. These variations are considered by art historians to be evidence of Ruisdael's compositional skills.|$|E

At Bronna Góra 50,000 Jews died over execution pits; delivered by the Holocaust trains from the ghettos in Brześć, Bereza, Janów Poleski, Kobryń, , Antopol and other locations along the western border of Reichskommissariat Ostland. At the Sosenki Forest {{on the outskirts of}} Równe in prewar Wołyń Voivodeship, over 23,000 Jews were shot, men, women, and children. At the Górka Połonka forest (see map) 25,000 Jews forced to disrobe and lay over the bodies of others were shot in waves; most of them were delivered there via the Łuck Ghetto.|$|E

Two days later, the same storm reached cities to the east, such as Cleveland, Buffalo, Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C. That winter (1934–1935), red snow fell on New England.|$|E
25|$|Culture: For example, as {{regionalism}} {{has become}} more prominent in the UK some historians have been suggesting that the English Civil War is too Anglo-centric and that to understand the war, events {{that had previously been}} dismissed as on the periphery should be given greater prominence; to emphasise this, revisionist historians have suggested that the English Civil War becomes <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of interlocking conflicts known as Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Furthermore, as cultures develop, it may become strategically advantageous for some revision-minded groups to revise their public historical narrative in such a way so as to either discover, or in rarer cases manufacture, a precedent which contemporary members of the given subcultures can use as a basis or rationale for reform or change.|$|E

500|$|Particularly {{during the}} {{remainder}} of the nineteenth century, Metternich was heavily criticised, decried as the man who prevented Austria and the rest of central Europe from [...] "developing along normal liberal and constitutional lines". Had Metternich not stood in the way of [...] "progress", Austria might have reformed, dealt better with its problems of nationality, and the First World War might never have happened. Instead, Metternich chose to fight an overwhelmingly fruitless war against the forces of liberalism and nationalism. Heavy censorship was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> range of repressive instruments of state available to him that also included a large spy network. Metternich opposed electoral reform, criticising Britain’s 1832 Reform Bill. In short, he locked himself into an embittered battle against [...] "the prevailing mood of his age".|$|E

2500|$|Dewey was {{a pioneer}} in American {{librarianship}} and an influential figure {{in the development of}} libraries in America in the late 19th and early the 20th century. He is best known for the decimal classification system that many public and school libraries use. But the decimal system was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long list of innovations. Among these is the idea of the state library as controller of school and public library services within a state. [...] In Boston, Massachusetts, he founded the Library Bureau, a private company [...] "for the definite purpose of furnishing libraries with equipment and supplies of unvarying correctness and reliability." [...] It also had an investigative unit, devoted to studying the best practices of library loss-management, circulation and data retention, that recovered 3,000 books in its first year of existence.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "UMNO 11" [...] {{case was}} <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number which had irritated Mahathir and the government. The {{case of the}} two journalists {{mentioned}} earlier had begun when John Berthelsen and Raphael Pura authored {{a series of articles}} on financial transactions of dubious ethical and legal nature carried out by government officials. The Asian Wall Street Journal which published them was promptly banned from the country, and Mahathir in his capacity as Home Affairs Minister had Berthelsen's and Pura's work permits revoked. However, the Supreme Court overturned the cancellation of Berthelsen's work permit because he had not been given a chance to answer the charges of the government. As a result, the ban on the Asian Wall Street Journal was also lifted. In a different case, the Supreme Court used its power of judicial review, and nullified amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code which gave the Attorney-General the power to initiate criminal proceedings in the High Court without first going to a Magistrate's Court. After Operation Lalang in 1987, where the government detained several political dissidents without trial under the Internal Security Act (ISA), the High Court granted Karpal Singh's application to be released from detention due to [...] technicalities in the way he had been detained.|$|E

2500|$|The {{usefulness}} of the term has been disputed. Given its gender-specific nature and negative connotation, Lesley Kinzel described it as inherently biased, essentialist, dismissive, and a double standard. [...] Author Cathy Young called it [...] "a pejorative term for supposedly obtuse and arrogant male arguments on gender, apparently now also applied to female dissent". In a 2016 Washington Post article, Young wrote that the term [...] "mansplaining" [...] is <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of terms using [...] "man" [...] as a derogatory prefix, and that this convention {{is part of a}} [...] "current cycle of misandry." [...] As the word became more popular, some commentators complained that misappropriation and overuse had in some instances diluted its original meaning. Liz Cookman writing for The Guardian says that the term [...] "reeks of gender essentialism – the idea that specific physical, social or cultural traits are native to a particular gender" [...] and considers it degrading. Joshua Sealy-Harrington and Tom McLaughlin write [...] in The Globe and Mail that the term has occasionally been used as an ad hominem to silence debate. [...] They suggest that faulty arguments should instead be refuted. Denby Weller, writing in The Sydney Morning Herald said {{the use of the term}} is hypocritical.

She also describes her as a very feminine male character if she really is transgender. Nintendo Power listed Birdo as one of three weirdos, citing her change from being male to being a love interest for Yoshi. They described her gender as one of life's biggest questions, commenting on how she shoots eggs {{out of her mouth}} as another oddity. IGN's Lucas M.

He also commented on the relationship Yoshi and Birdo formed in Mario Tennis, stating, [...] "They were both sexually chaotic as individuals" [...] as [...] "Yoshi is supposedly a male, but lays eggs like a female.
