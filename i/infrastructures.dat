40|$|Motivation Over {{the past}} 30 years, {{within the field}} of <b>infrastructure</b> management, as <b>infrastructure</b> systems have grown more complex, the level of {{managerial}} and financial oversight has increased, and the computation power has become less expensive and more readily available, <b>infrastructure</b> managers have increasingly turned to computerized <b>infrastructure</b> management systems to aid in the management of the built <b>infrastructure.</b> An <b>infrastructure</b> management system acts as an <b>infrastructure</b> manager's 1) inspection database detailing {{the current state of the}} built <b>infrastructure,</b> 2) <b>infrastructure</b> performance simulation platform modeling the potential future <b>infrastructure</b> performance, 3) <b>infrastructure</b> deterioration and provided service estimator evaluating the equivalent financial loss associated with <b>infrastructure</b> deterioration and decreased provided levels of service, and 4) <b>infrastructure</b> maintenance action development engine formulating and scheduling technically and financially optimal <b>infrastructure</b> maintenance solutions. Historically, the performance simulation module of <b>infrastructure</b> management systems has focused primarily upon modeling gradual <b>infrastructure</b> deterioration processes, such as corrosion, and the <b>infrastructure</b> provided service estimator has employed nominal values for quantifying the public's evaluation of the provided <b>infrastructure</b> performance. These approaches have caused <b>infrastructure</b> managers to focus their attention and funding towards combating gradual <b>infrastructure</b> deterioration while giving priority maintenance status to <b>infrastructure</b> objects that place the largest nominally evaluated total performance impact on society. While this approach has helped <b>infrastructure</b> managers to more efficiently manage the built <b>infrastructure,</b> such an approach is only efficient if it is unfailingly implemented over multiple decades. Unfortunately, the current limited <b>infrastructure</b> management system scope has exposed <b>infrastructure</b> managers to two potentially disruptive forces – potential unforeseen natural hazard induced technical failures and potential political and/or financial funding support failures due to incongruent evaluation of the provided level of performance between the <b>infrastructure</b> manager's nominal evaluation measures and the experiencing society. While these two disruptive forces originate in two very different elements of an <b>infrastructure</b> management system, they both can induce the same result – undermining of the intended technically and financially optimal <b>infrastructure</b> management solution. Objective and originality To work towards rectifying both of these limitations, the current work has developed methodologies for both quantifying the long-term <b>infrastructure</b> natural hazard risk exposure and estimating an individual's experience-based evaluation of the provided level of <b>infrastructure</b> performance. The methodology for assessing natural hazard induced technical <b>infrastructure</b> failures has focused around developing an <b>infrastructure</b> component potential failure assessment procedure which employs data within existing <b>infrastructure</b> and transportation management systems and currently under development natural hazard identification maps. This failure assessment procedure is designed to identify the locations and estimate the associated consequences of potential natural hazard induced failures. This failure probability and failure consequence information is then employed to quantify an annualized and a multi-year <b>infrastructure</b> link risk exposure. The methodology for estimating an individual's experience-based evaluation of the provided level of <b>infrastructure</b> performance has been developed by employing research findings from the fields of psychology and behavioral economics to develop the affective assessment approach, a variance-based evaluation tool. This evaluation tool employs an individual's range and quality of experienced <b>infrastructure</b> performance in time to predict the individual's current induced affect and future sensitivity to the provided levels of <b>infrastructure</b> performance. As this is a constructed evaluation approach, employing the affective assessment approach directly in the third <b>infrastructure</b> management module, evaluating equivalent financial loss associated with decreased provided levels of service, can be computationally prohibitive as each potential sequence would need to be modeled. It is, therefore, proposed to use the affective assessment approach as a reality check against which the developed technically and financially optimal management solution can be assessed and solutions which provide too low or inconsistent levels of <b>infrastructure</b> performance can be identified, reevaluated or discarded. Results and benefits With this additional technical information and perspectives, <b>infrastructure</b> managers are able to actively consider an object's natural hazard risk exposure in modeling the <b>infrastructure</b> deterioration and in developing optimal maintenance actions. Furthermore, <b>infrastructure</b> managers are able to determine the annual funding that should be invested and made available to respond to current and future natural hazard induced object failures. By, calibrating and implanting the affective assessment approach, <b>infrastructure</b> managers can also study how proposed technically optimal solutions may be socially received and can select solutions which best maintain social support throughout the duration of the maintenance solution. Within the field of <b>infrastructure</b> management, the past 30 years has been invested in developing standardized and computerized <b>infrastructure</b> management systems. With these systems implemented, <b>infrastructure</b> managers are starting to observe their strengths but also their limitations. This work has focused on formulating quantitative methods to develop solutions for two of these limitations. It is hoped that these methods might be further developed, calibrated and implemented to improve existing <b>infrastructure</b> management systems and the <b>infrastructure</b> and society they manage...|$|R
