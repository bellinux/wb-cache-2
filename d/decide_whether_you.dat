When it arrived, the column found itself {{surrounded}} by men wielding machine guns; their commander said [...] "You have three minutes to <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> leave or die". They withdrew. By March, several hundred civilians lived in the camp, along with about 900 guerrillas, mostly from Fatah, and PLO leader Yasser Arafat, who had his headquarters there.|$|E
500|$|After a year, {{the coach}} was so {{impressed}} with Nowitzki's progress that he advised him: [...] "You must now <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> want to play against {{the best in the world}} or just stay a local hero in Germany. If you choose the latter, we will stop training immediately, because nobody can prevent that anymore. But if you want to play against the best, we have to train on a daily basis." [...] After pondering this lifetime decision for two days, Nowitzki agreed to enter the full-time training schedule, choosing the path to his eventual international career. Geschwindner let him train seven days a week with DJK Würzburg players and future German internationals Robert Garrett, Marvin Willoughby, and Demond Greene, and in the summer of 1994, then 16-year-old Nowitzki made the DJK squad.|$|E

2500|$|Still embittered by the {{perceived}} betrayal, Paine tried to ruin Washington's reputation by {{calling him a}} treacherous man who was unworthy of his fame as a military and political hero. He sent a stinging letter to Washington, in which he described him as an incompetent commander and a vain and ungrateful person. Paine never received a reply, so he contacted his lifelong publisher, the anti-Federalist Benjamin Bache to publish this Letter to George Washington in 1796. In this scathing publication, Paine wrote: [...] "the world will be puzzled to <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> are an apostate or an impostor; whether you have abandoned good principles or whether you ever had any." [...] He further wrote that {{without the aid of}} France, Washington could not have succeeded in the Revolution and had [...] "but little share in the glory of the final event." [...] He also commented on Washington's poor character, saying that Washington had no sympathetic feelings and was a hypocrite.|$|E
