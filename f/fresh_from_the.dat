5|$|Connery and Salomon {{eventually}} dropped out, and in September 1995, Robert Rodriguez, <b>fresh</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{success of}} Desperado, signed to direct with Antonio Banderas, {{who had also}} starred in Desperado, playing the title role. TriStar and Amblin had been surprised by Rodriguez's low-budget filming techniques for his action films, El Mariachi and Desperado, and shifted away from their initial plans with Salomon to make a big-budget version of Zorro. Spielberg had hoped Rodriguez would start filming in January 1996 for a Christmas release date, but the start date was pushed back to July. The release date was later moved to Easter 1997. Rodriguez {{pulled out of the}} film' in June 1996 over difficulties coming to terms with TriStar on the budget. The studio projected a range of $35 million, while Rodriguez wanted $45 million. They both attempted to compromise when Rodriguez lowered it to $42 million, but the studio refused and set $41 million as their highest mark. Banderas remained with the production, and Martin Campbell signed on later that month, turning down the chance to direct Tomorrow Never Dies. The finished screenplay would be written by John Eskow, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, based on a story by Elliott, Rossio, and Randall Jahnson.|$|E
5|$|Dean and Knapp {{record that}} in early 1707 Keiser {{surrendered}} the lease of the Gänsemarkt to Johann Heinrich Sauerbrey, who thus became {{responsible for the}} staging of the double opera. It may by this time have been in rehearsal, and the difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements. The consensus among experts {{is that the two}} parts were first performed on consecutive evenings in January 1708, as they are the first works in Mattheson's opera list for 1708. There are no surviving records of the public's reception, the length of the original run, or of any revivals. Whether Handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain; he may have returned from Italy, <b>fresh</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> opening of Rodrigo in Florence, to supervise the production of Florindo and Daphne in Hamburg. Dean and Knapp suggest the works may have been directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner, although Anthony Hicks in his Grove Handel biography, says that so unusual a project would not have been attempted without the composer's presence.|$|E
5|$|Slava {{was built}} by the Baltic Works at Saint Petersburg. She was laid down on 1 November 1902, {{launched}} on 29 August 1903, and completed in October 1905, too late {{to participate in the}} Russo-Japanese War. Together with the battleship , she helped to suppress the Sveaborg Rebellion in 1906. Slava was assigned to a training squadron for new officers <b>fresh</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Naval College that was formed after the Rebellion as part of the post-Tsushima naval reforms. On one of her training cruises to the Mediterranean, her crewmen rescued survivors during the 1908 Messina earthquake and the ship took casualties to Naples for medical care. She had a serious boiler accident in August 1910 and was towed by Tsesarevich to Gibraltar for temporary repairs before sailing to Toulon for repairs that required nearly a year to complete. Upon her return to Kronstadt she was relieved of her training assignment and transferred to the Baltic Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Vegetables {{have been}} part of the human diet from time immemorial. Some are staple foods but most are {{accessory}} foodstuffs, adding variety to meals with their unique flavors and at the same time, adding nutrients necessary for health. Some vegetables are perennials but most are annuals and biennials, usually harvested within a year of sowing or planting. Whatever system is used for growing crops, cultivation follows a similar pattern; preparation of the soil by loosening it, removing or burying weeds, and adding organic manures or fertilisers; sowing seeds or planting young plants; tending the crop while it grows to reduce weed competition, control pests, and provide sufficient water; harvesting the crop when it is ready; sorting, storing, and marketing the crop or eating it <b>fresh</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E

Roosevelt put pressure on the United States Congress to {{come to the aid of}} the Cuban people. He emphasized Cuban weakness and femininity to justify America's military intervention.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} {{version of}} the GT-R debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show, launching in the Japanese market on December 6, 2007.

The Canadian launch was also in July 2008. Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in March 2009. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.|$|E

25|$|Over the {{following}} week, Napoleon won all the {{battles of the}} Six Days' Campaign, inflicting very heavy casualties on Blücher's army. After his victories, the French emperor had to rush to {{the help of his}} forces defending the Seine River. These troops had been pushed back by a second Allied army led by Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. Already, Napoleon ordered MacDonald to Guignes where he arrived on the evening of 14 February with 12,000 troops, including reinforcements. Trelliard's division arrived at Guignes on 16 February, <b>fresh</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Spanish front. At this time, Kellermann's corps was not yet fully formed. Altogether there would be 4,200 horsemen in the divisions of Jacquinot, Trelliard and Roussel.|$|E
25|$|Saint-Priest, a French émigré, led the Russian 8th Infantry Corps, {{which was}} made up of the 11th and 17th Infantry Divisions. Each {{division}} consisted of four line infantry and two jäger regiments. At the beginning of 1814, the corps numbered 11,900 soldiers and formed part of Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron's 43,000-strong army corps. On 31 December 1813, the 8th Corps executed a successful assault crossing of the Rhine River near Koblenz. After this operation the corps advanced to Dinant on the Meuse River. On 15 February, Saint-Priest's corps was ordered to take over the Siege of Mainz. By early March, Saint-Priest had moved west to occupy Châlons-sur-Marne and Vitry-le-François. <b>Fresh</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> blockade of Erfurt, Jagow brought his Prussian brigade to join Saint-Priest.|$|E
25|$|The diet at Haughmond {{seems to}} have been {{relatively}} varied and less austere than in most monastic institutions. In 1280 147 sheep and a calf were supplied to the abbey. Tithes of sea fish were exacted at Nefyn and the abbey had fisheries on the Dee and Severn, but it seems unlikely that fish were supplied <b>fresh</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> further fisheries. Ranulf of Chester's grant allowed the canons to purchase annually 6000 salted herrings. These were bought at Chester on special terms. In the 12th century the abbey was granted half a swarm of bees in the woods at Hardwick: it may be that mead was made, although honey had a symbolic connection with the austere life because of its association with John the Baptist, to whom the abbey was dedicated.|$|E

25|$|The entire {{village was}} {{concealed}} in smoke; but the incessant rattle of the musketry, the crashing of burning timbers, the smashing of doors and gateways, the yells and imprecations of the combatants, which were heard through that misty veil, gave ample indication {{to the troops}} posted in reserve upon the heights, of the fierce and savage nature of the struggle beneath. In the meantime, the relieving batteries on the Prussian side, which had arrived quite <b>fresh</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear, came into full play, as did also a reinforcement, on the French side, from the artillery of the Imperial Guard. The earth now trembled under the tremendous cannonade; and as the flames, issuing from the numerous burning houses, intermingled with dense volumes of smoke, shot directly upwards through the light grey mass which rendered visibility within village very difficult.|$|E
25|$|The {{staple of}} the Parisian diet was bread; unlike rural France, where peasants ate dark bread, baked weekly, Parisians {{preferred}} a spongy white bread with a firm crust, <b>fresh</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> oven, which they commonly ate by soaking it in a meat bouillon. It {{was similar to the}} modern baguette, not invented until the 20th century, but took longer to make. Parisians ate an average of 500 grams of bread, or two loaves a day; laborers consumed four loaves a day. Napoleon wanted to avoid the popular uprisings of 1789 caused by bread shortages, so the price of bread was strictly controlled between 1800 and 1814, and was much lower than outside the city. Parisians were very attached to their variety of bread; in times of grain shortages, when the government attempted to substitute cheaper dark breads, the Parisians refused to buy them.|$|E
25|$|On 1 February, the Russian {{commander}} {{enjoyed a}} great stroke of good luck. The orders to Bernadotte {{were given to}} an officer <b>fresh</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> military academy.

Soon, Bagration came into possession of the important document, which he forwarded to his army commander. As soon as he received the news, Bennigsen ordered the army to rapidly retreat on Jonkowo. As it happened, seven other couriers also fell {{into the hands of the}} cossacks, so Bernadotte remained in total ignorance of the plan until 3 February and missed the Battle of Eylau, which occurred on 7 and 8 February. In the meantime, the advancing French and the retreating Prussians and Russians fought a series of clashes at Bergfried (Berkweda) on 3 February, at Waltersdorf (Wilczkowo) on 5 February, and at Hof (Dwórzno) on 6 February.|$|E
