Will encourages the other club members to support Artie, not only by holding a bake sale to raise funds for a handicap bus, but also by spending time in wheelchairs to experience what life is like for him. Meanwhile, Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) is struggling to cover the medical expenses of her pregnancy, and threatens to break up with Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) if he cannot pay her ultrasound bill. Puck (Mark Salling) fights with Finn, whom he feels <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> enough to support Quinn. By including cannabis in the cupcakes, Puck ensures the bake sale is a success and offers Quinn the money raised. She apologizes for previously calling him a loser, but refuses to accept the money, and is relieved when Finn is able to find a job.|$|E

2500|$|Parliamentary {{systems have}} the right to dismiss a Prime Minister at any point in time that they feel he or she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> their job to the {{expectations}} of the legislature. This is done through a Vote of No Confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the Prime Minister from office by a majority support for his or her dismissal. In some countries, the Prime Minister can also call an election whenever he or she so chooses, and typically the Prime Minister will hold an election when he or she knows that they are in good favour with the public as to get re-elected. In other parliamentary democracies extra elections are virtually never held, a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections. An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the [...] "loyal opposition". The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party (or coalition) opposes the governing party (or coalition), while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{electric}} {{pumping station}} was erected {{at a new}} outfall for the Lawyers and Andersons districts in 1949, {{to be followed by}} several more. The Fleet Haven pumping station cost £21,793 and was completed in 1958/59, and in the same year, Dawsmere pumping station cost £33,868. Lord's Drain pumping station commenced operation in 1962. Sluices were also upgraded, with that on the Holbeach River being commissioned in 1955, and the Lutton Leam outfall sluice following in 1958/59. Despite the improvements, the Fleet Fen area was found to be at risk during flood periods, and a major upgrade, funded by the government, was completed in 1971. It included a new pumping station where the Main Drain and the Fleet River meet, and used submersible pumps {{for the first time in}} a land drainage scheme. Extremely heavy rainfall on 11 July 1968, when over [...] fell on Gedney in the early morning, demonstrated that still more work was required to prevent flooding. Run-off water from Spalding was diverted into the Coronation Channel, a flood-relief bypass for the River Welland, and Clay Lake pumping station was built in 1970, which handles the run-off, but can also be used to pump the adjacent fen when it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> so. Five additional pumping stations were built throughout the district. More than half of the area served by the IDB now depends on pumping stations, although most stations still have a gravity outfall, so that power failures or breakdowns are not disastrous. A further six pumping stations have been commissioned since 1974, the latest being brought on-line in July 2003 at Lawyers Sluice, to assist when the 1949-built structure is tidelocked.|$|E
2500|$|Manichaean {{also was}} her lifelong {{struggle}} with the very {{question of how to}} deal with dualisms. At times she appears to favor the merging of opposites, for which Byzantium served as a model: [...] "church and state, love and violence, life and death, were to be fused again as in Byzantium." [...] More dominant, however, was her tendency to view the tensions generated in the space between dualistic terms as life-sustaining and creative; hence, her aversion to homosexuality and her warning not to confuse the drive for feminist emancipation with the woman's desire to become like a man. Her insistence on the fundamental difference between men and women reveals her essentialism, but it also bespeaks her innate Manichaean sensibility. She wanted respect and equal rights for women, {{but at the same time}} she required that women retain their specifically feminine qualities, notably an affinity with the life force: [...] "Men have a disposition to violence; women have not. If one says that men are on the side of death, women on the side of life, one seems to be making an accusation against men. One <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> that." [...] One reason why she does not want to make an accusation against men is that they are simply playing their assigned role in a flawed universe, which is, of course, the result of an imperfect deity. Only love can alleviate destructive aspects of the sex-antagonism: [...] "I loathe the way the two cancers of sadism and masochism eat into the sexual life of humanity, so that the one lifts the lash and the other offers blood to the blow, and both are drunken with the beastly pleasure of misery and do not proceed with love's business of building a shelter from the cruelty of the universe." [...] In addition to the operations of love, female emancipation is crucial to removing the moral, professional, and social stigma associated with the notion of the [...] "weaker sex," [...] without trying to do away altogether with the temperamental and metaphysical aspects of the gender dualism itself. Thus, the [...] "sex war" [...] described in West's early short story [...] "Indissoluble Matrimony" [...] (1914) elevates the female character, Evadne, in the end because she accepts the terms of the contest without superficially trying to [...] "win" [...] that war.|$|E
