In the event Donnier won his battle, and on 13 October de Négrier joined him with the Kep column and began to scout the Guangxi Army's defences around Chu in preparation for an assault by the united French forces. The attack was never made. The Chinese, discouraged by the heavy losses they had suffered on 10 and 11 October and by the rout of their comrades at Kep on 8 October, abandoned the entrenched camp of Chu on 19 October and fell back to Bac Le and Dong Song, to protect the approaches to Lang Son.|$|E

5000|$|Though their self-titled {{debut album}} met {{with little or}} no {{national}} success, the Doctors entered the studio to record their second album, this time with hitmaking producer Jeff Glixman, who had handled many commercial rock artists in recent years, including Kansas. Strange as it may seem, the Doctors' '80s outlook and Glixman's hard rock history created an album as exciting as the Doctors' debut, though less varied. Using the first album's [...] "I Want Her" [...] as a jumping-off point, the Doctors rock hard on 2nd Opinion without losing any of their charm or melodicism. Bassist/vocalist Cal Everett sounds more confident vocally and his songs have even more hooks than before. [...] "Breaking Rocks" [...] rocks hard with a vocal that will melt even the most hardened criminal. [...] "The Lonely Ones" [...] is equally wonderful. [...] "Dawn Patrol" [...] is the pop/rocker that Night Ranger wanted to write but was too pompous to do so. Guitarist Jeff Severson's [...] "Waiting for Roxanne" [...] is an absolute classic {{right out of the box}} and should have been the big radio hit that the Doctors were waiting for. [...] "Heart on a Chain" [...] is another classic that should not have had to wait for a radio station to play it. Only guitarist George Pittaway's [...] "Good Pretender" [...] fails to live up to the rest of the album, though it is certainly a good track. With another great album under their belts, the Doctors did what all good bands <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> in their career...they broke up.

50|$|Above ground, Pluto hears {{a strange}} thumping, while behind him, the {{caterpillar}} pops {{out of a}} new burrow he had just dug. Upon seeing Pluto's long, slender, black tail, the caterpillar who was rather grumpy from having almost been eaten immediately brightens up and starts climbing the tail. Pluto is startled that something was climbing his tail, but {{when he sees the}} caterpillar, he is curious what the caterpillar is trying to <b>do.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> the caterpillar starts singing in a deep voice again about the urgent transformation that he must undergo. When he reaches the top of Pluto's tail, which is curved horizontally, he reaches behind himself and pulls out a lasso of silk from his own tail. The caterpillar raises the lasso over his head, swings it around, and loops it across the end of Pluto's tail. The caterpillar takes a bungee leap from the tail and dangles upside-down from the silk thread tied to Pluto's tail, while Pluto becomes more confused and apprehensive at what the caterpillar was up to, but lets him continue anyway. Still singing, the caterpillar curves his body in preparation, building momentum, before suddenly twisting and gyrating his tail, creating a spinning blur that travels down towards his head, leaving a silk covering in its wake. Soon the spinning blur covers the caterpillars head, leaving him completely covered in a gray, spiraling spindle-shaped cocoon that swings slightly before hanging still. Unsure what had just happened, Pluto shakes the end of his tail, swinging the cocoon madly about, causing it to shake and rattle like a maraca. Despite all this, the caterpillar manages to finish his song just as Pluto stops shaking it and stares at the cocoon curiously.|$|E

But it feels like it's something we just have to <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> The last 7,5 years have been awesome for the most part and we're grateful for all the experiences and new friends we have made while travelling the world to show people what we're all about. We have toured places we never thought we'd get to see, such as Australia, Russia, almost the entire USA and all across Europe of course. We have made friends for life on the road. We have grown immensely as musicians and turned this band into something we are very proud of.Being in this band has been a great experience for each and everyone of us and it took us to places and opened up doors we couldn't even dream of. Being that the band started as a side project, we always stuck to the original spirit of making music that was outside of the box and therefor survived much longer than a lot of bands who were trying to be a part of certain hypes. We never cared for that, we just wanted to do our own thing and feel like we have achieved that. We want to thank everyone who's involvement made it possible for us to do what we do... you most definitely know who you are.The scene we're a part of used to be an inspiring subculture but has turned into an abortion of mainstream accessibility, with choreographies on stage and cute little matching outfits. It's frustrating to witness and really makes it less fun to go out and play with new bands sometimes. However, this is not a breakup, it's a hiatus.

5000|$|Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times, however, {{was one of}} {{the very}} few reviewers to give the season premiere a low score: [...] "A show that became a hit because it seemed so {{original}} has been so co-opted that it now looks like a cliché. The personalities on Mad Men don't change, but the times <b>do.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> the context may be more interesting than the characters." [...] On Twitter, The Hollywood Reporter critic Tim Goodman characterized Stanley's critique as a [...] "bullshit ramble-review", saying that Stanley [...] "just wants us to know she's above the material she's covering." [...] In his review, Goodman was laudatory, saying that [...] "the party, more than anything else, was a central defining moment of where we're going. Everything about it was different. Newer. We're not in 1960 anymore. And if you think about it, the show we all know and love is about to change as well. It's going to look different, above and beyond the characters changing." [...] Time writer James Poniewozik wrote a cooler review saying that, [...] "I’m glad to have Mad Men back, but “A Little Kiss” was not a great episode. Mad Men return episodes generally aren’t: they take their time and do a lot of table setting." [...] Poniewozik was simultaneously intrigued and unsettled by Megan's addition as [...] "essentially a new female lead" [...] and reasoned that Weiner used Megan's [...] "unfamiliarity as an advantage and as a storytelling device. The very fact that she is an unknown quantity among these very well-known quantities may give us a chance to see everyone we think we know differently — through the eyes of a relative stranger." [...] Chuck Barney of the Contra Costa Times said the premiere was off to a [...] "methodical start" [...] that reintroduced us to the [...] "enigmatic characters" [...] but that [...] "Eventually, it gains traction, weaving threads of heartfelt poignancy with doses of dark humor. What hasn't changed is the quality of the endeavor. Mad Men remains a show that often feels more like literature than TV. The top-notch acting is still intact, as is the attention to aesthetic detail. So, after that excruciating delay, are we still in love with this show? Truly, deeply -- madly." [...] David Weigard of the San Francisco Chronicle called the premiere a [...] "stunner" [...] and compared to the character of Don Draper to legendary American characters like Jake Barnes, Charles Foster Kane, Tony Soprano, Huck Finn, Natty Bumppo, Elmer Gantry and [...] "most of all, to F.

50|$|Official {{statement}} from the band here:After 4 years of being in The Wage of Sin, I can honestly say I have made some truly great and unforgettable memories and friends. And while I wouldn't give up the time I spent in this band for anything, {{at this point it}} does not make sense for us to keep the band going any longer. The girls have become very busy with their other bands: Rachel full time w/Most Precious Blood, Vanessa w/Infidel (formerly Rebel Alliance), and Laura w/All for Nothing. Laura is also currently getting her Masters and working part-time, Vanessa is working, and I am currently working and traveling as a TV producer. Needless to say this has left us with very little time to dedicate to The Wage of Sin. We have so many amazing, dedicated fans asking us to play shows, do interviews, and be on compilations-anything to help our band out. While we are completely grateful and flattered that people are going {{out of their way to}} support us, I feel it is unfair for us to continue the band when the fans are currently dedicating more time than the actual members. There are so many other bands working their asses off, making huge sacrifices to write and play music to as many people as possible which deserve and need your support so much more than we <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point.</b> While we do have so much fun when we do play shows, unfortunately those moments are very few and far between lately. We have been lucky to have shared some wonderful experiences and are happy about the things we have accomplished together- releasing two CDs, touring the US and Europe, having a video on Headbangers Ball and Much Music, and most importantly having built friendships with the people we have met along the way. But being that we have all committed to touring with other bands or working for the rest of the year, we feel we would just be dragging on if we continued to go out this rate of trying to squeeze in shows on those rare occasions when our four worlds happen to collide and allow us to do so. To all of our fans, friends, anyone who has booked us, played with us, shared equipment with us, given us a place to stay, or cooked for us, and to the labels that have put out our music (Immigrant Sun, Beniihana, Burial, Elephant Eye, Kablio Muzika), and all our fill-ins (Bryan, Nick, Jerry, Chino) - we thank you so much for making our time in this band so amazing and for affording us so many great opportunities! Because this band is more than just the 4 people in it, we all felt it would be very unappreciative to NOT play some final shows. We want these shows to be THANK YOUs to everyone who has supported us, and final celebrations of the fun times we have had together these past few years. There are no bad feelings between us- we just all have our hearts in different places and support each other in each of our endeavors. Since we cannot give this band our full attention any longer, it's time to end it while we are still smiling.|$|E
