5|$|In the novel's final chapters, {{the three}} storylines {{intersect}} with increasing frequency. The tone of these chapters is especially <b>dark</b> <b>as</b> they deal primarily with the horrific torture {{and death of}} the assassins {{at the hands of}} the SIM, the failure of the coup, the rape of Urania, and the concessions made to Trujillo's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country. The book ends as Urania prepares to return home, determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island.|$|E

5|$|June 12, 1899, {{was the day}} of the Gollmar Brothers Circus, {{which drew}} {{hundreds}} of visitors in addition to the town's 1,800 inhabitants.

The rain let up around 5:00 PM, and people began to head home for the day. By 6:00 PM, the streets of New Richmond were full of tourists, travelers and residents.|$|E

5|$|Based on the James Bond film, Rare's GoldenEye 007 was {{released}} in 1997, and as of 2004 it was the best-selling Nintendo 64 game in the United States. It was the first landmark console first-person shooter and was highly acclaimed for its atmospheric single-player levels and well designed multiplayer maps. It featured a sniper rifle, the ability to perform head-shots, and the incorporation of stealth elements; (and all these aspects were also used in the game's spiritual sequel Perfect <b>Dark)</b> <b>as</b> well as Virtua Cop-inspired features such as reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocents, and an aiming system allowing players to aim at a precise spot on the screen.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of July 16, 1904, a severe thunderstorm produced a strong tornado that touched down around 3:30pm EST in Chappaqua, New York. Residents reported the first indication of the thunderstorm was a large black cloud approaching the region. The sky was reportedly completely <b>dark</b> <b>as</b> torrential rain and high winds commenced. Intense lightning and loud thunder prompted people to seek shelter in their cellars. The tornado tracked directly through Chappaqua before moving towards the Hudson River. Upon reaching the river, the tornado became a waterspout that was powerful enough to uncover the river bed below it. The waterspout eventually dissipated by 4:00pm EST. The tornado was later rated as F3 on the modern-day Fujita scale.|$|E

He was {{to be part of a}} team including Shade, The Changing Man, Deadman and Madame Xanadu, known as Justice League <b>Dark.</b> <b>As</b> part of the DC universe reboot in September 2011, Peter Milligan started the title which featured an alternate version of John Constantine as a prominent part of the team. Milligan wrote eight issues of Justice League Dark, with writer Jeff Lemire taking over on issue nine.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Japanese {{forces were}} taking over Java and {{threatening}} the Allied headquarters at Bandung. On 5 March, the Allied command decided that several senior RAF and RAAF officers {{had to be}} evacuated from Bandung. Winckel {{was chosen as the}} pilot. He protested the decision, arguing that his lack of rest would hinder his chances of finding Bandung in the <b>dark</b> <b>as</b> he did not have any electronic aids. However, Winckel was seen {{to be one of the}} most experienced pilots because of his terrain knowledge as a flight instructor at Bandung and his recent refugee flights. Another factor was that his Lodestar, although it had been damaged in the attack on Broome, was considered the most suitable plane for the evacuation mission. Winckel flew to Java, where he managed to land his plane on a road lit by jeep headlights. He picked up fourteen passengers, refuelled the plane and successfully returned to Australia.|$|E

5|$|Perfect Dark is {{an action}} video game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Rare. It was exclusively released for the Game Boy Color handheld game console in August 2000, shortly {{after the release of}} its Nintendo 64 counterpart. The game takes place in the year 2022, one year prior to the events of the Nintendo 64 game, and follows the exploits of Joanna <b>Dark</b> <b>as</b> she attempts to prove herself as an agent for the Carrington Institute agency. The gameplay revolves around shooting opponents and completing objectives such as rescuing hostages or recovering items. It also features a multiplayer mode where two players may compete in several deathmatch modes.|$|E

Satellite navigation will become available as an option in the near future.|$|E
5|$|To the observatory's {{disappointment}} and surprise, Pluto showed no visible disc; it {{appeared as a}} point, no different from a star, and, at only 15th magnitude, was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted, which meant it was either very small, or very dark. Because Lowell astronomers thought Pluto was massive enough to perturb planets, they assumed that its albedo could be no less than 0.07 (meaning that it reflected only 7% of the light that hit it); about as <b>dark</b> <b>as</b> asphalt and {{similar to that of}} Mercury, the least reflective planet known. This would give Pluto an estimated mass of no more than 70% that of Earth. Observations also revealed that Pluto's orbit was very elliptical, far more than that of any other planet.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{indirect}} fire opened the fighting early the following day, falling across the Americal Division's front. In response, US artillery and mortars fired back, targeting the Muda Unit on the South Knob. Such was {{the proximity of}} their position to the US defenders on the North Knob, that the Americans there were forced to take cover from their own artillery. With supplies on the North Knob running low, efforts were made by US troops to bring ammunition, food and water forward; this required soldiers to carry the heavy loads forward under fire; this was an arduous task, {{and in order to}} offer some protection to the carrying parties, they moved forward with protection parties offering covering fire. By midday, a sufficient quantity of supplies had been brought forward for the Americans to launch an attack with one company providing support by fire while another carried out a flanking move to attack the South Knob from the west with flamethrowers and {{indirect fire}} support. After initial gains, this attack was held up and eventually the company had to be withdrawn for the night after reinforcements from the 132nd Infantry Regiment failed to reach them before <b>dark.</b> <b>As</b> local US commanders calculated the cost of continuing to hold Hill 206, the Americal Division sought permission to withdraw, but this was refused by the XIV Corps headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Maury Gertsman, {{who handled}} the {{cinematography}} for nearly all Universal Pictures films from the mid-1940s to mid-1950s, worked as director of photography on The Brute Man. Since the film focused on a disfigured serial killer, Gertsman sought to give the movie a dark, diseased look appropriate for the film's subject matter and urban setting. Although primarily a horror thriller film, Gertsman uses several film noir elements in his photography, including shadowed lighting, unbalanced compositions, and chiaroscuro contrasts between light and <b>dark.</b> <b>As</b> a result, The Brute Man features a bleak, at times dismal visual atmosphere. Hans J. Salter, who composed the scores {{for many of the}} Universal Pictures films of the 1940s and 1950s, worked as composer for The Brute Man as well. Salter's score for the film strongly resembled the music he composed for the Universal horror films Black Friday (1940) and The Invisible Man's Revenge (1944). Philip Cahn edited The Brute Man. Raymond Kessler and Ralph Slosser worked as dialogue director and assistant director, respectively, while John B. Goodman and Abraham Grossman worked as art directors. Other crew included Russell A. Gausman and Edward R. Robinson as set decorators, Joe Lapis as sound technician, Jack Pierce as make-up director, Carmen Dirigo as hair stylist, and Vera West as gowns supervisor.|$|E
