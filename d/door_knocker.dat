500|$|The first {{reference}} to a [...] "Brasenose Hall" [...] {{is found in the}} forged charter of 1219, occupying at that time only one small part of the current site. It was recorded in 1278 as having four scholars, although over the next fifty years it was to acquire some corporate strength. The name [...] "Brasenose" [...] is thought to originate from a brass–lead <b>door</b> <b>knocker</b> in the shape of leopard (or lion) head; the nose-shaped <b>door</b> <b>knocker</b> of which one version now hangs above the high table of the main hall of Brasenose College. An alternative theory is that the name is a corruption of brasenhuis (brewhouse), but this is not widely accepted, although the college did have its own brewhouse up until 1889. This theory is believed to date back only to 1837.|$|E
2500|$|Cartwheelers can {{be found}} by several fountains within the city. The most famous is Cartwheeler’s Fountain in Burgplatz with an {{inscription}} of a quote by Hans Müller-Schlösser: [...] "Radschläger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve“ (We will always remain cartwheelers, however crazy it drives people.) The fountain was designed by Alfred Zschorsch in 1954 and donated by the [...] Heimatverein Düsseldorfer Jonges, which is a club devoted {{to the maintenance of}} local and regional traditions. There are other cartwheelers that decorate storm drains and the <b>door</b> <b>knocker</b> on the Church of Lambertus, which was designed by Friedrich Becker.

5000|$|Stephen Pile {{mentions}} {{this work}} in The Book of Heroic Failures, and comments: [...] "Is {{there anything in}} conventional English which could equal the vividness of to craunch a marmoset?" [...] The original has [...] "to craunch the marmoset", an entry under the book's [...] "Idiotisms and Proverbs." [...] This is the author's attempt to translate the French slang idiomatic expression , used to indicate [...] "waiting patiently for someone to open a door", with [...] referring to the [...] "knocking" [...] or [...] "rapping" [...] sound and marmot, a term for the grotesque <b>door</b> <b>knockers</b> in vogue at the time. The term is presumably inspired by the marmot's large teeth, {{as many of the}} grotesque <b>door</b> <b>knockers</b> were figures holding the knocker clasped in their teeth.|$|R
2500|$|According to Vasari, [...] "Leonardo's {{disposition}} was so lovable that {{he commanded}} everyone's affection". He was [...] "a sparkling conversationalist" [...] who charmed Ludovico il Moro with his wit. Vasari sums him up by saying: [...] "In appearance he was striking and handsome, and his magnificent presence brought {{comfort to the}} most troubled soul; he was so persuasive that he could bend other people to his will. He was physically so strong that he could withstand violence and {{with his right hand}} he could bend the ring of an iron <b>door</b> <b>knocker</b> or a horseshoe as if they were lead. He was so generous that he fed all his friends, rich or poor.... Through his birth Florence received a very great gift, and through his death it sustained an incalculable loss." ...|$|E
2500|$|The hip hop fashion {{trends of}} the 2000s {{were all over}} the place and changed constantly, with the {{continue}} (balla) type image meaning extra baggy clothes, jerseys, and continue of bling. During these years there was a heavy celebrity influence among fashion trends. hip hop artists made brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton popular amongst the hip hop community. Throughout these years many fashion trends from the 1980s and early 1990s were made popular again, such as the <b>door</b> <b>knocker</b> earring and form fitting jeans for males. Bright colors and cartoon graphic print hoodies by Bathing Ape made popular by artist and producer Pharrell also gained popularity.

2500|$|This {{tradition}} has been kept alive by the Alde Düsseldorfer Bürgergesellschaft von 1920 e. V., a society founded in 1920, {{who organized the}} first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971 this event has been held annually {{in cooperation with the}} Stadtsparkasse (a local bank), but formerly took place in the Königsallee. Since 2006 it has taken place on the Rheinwerft, near the old part of town. This is a fixed date in the city’s calendar of events. About 500 boys regularly participate in this event and since 1971 girls have also taken part. In 2001 the art project Radschläger-Kunst (Cartwheeler Art) was called into life, in which over 100 cartwheeler sculptures have been designed by various artists. The <b>door</b> <b>knocker</b> on the Church of Lambertus functioned {{as a model for the}} sculptures that are [...] high, [...] wide and [...] deep. They were positioned around the city centre. Some of the sculptures have been auctioned off to companies and private owners.|$|E

50|$|Builders' {{hardware}} or just builders hardware is a {{group of}} metal hardware specifically used for protection, decoration, and convenience in buildings. Building products do not make any part of a building, rather they support them and make them work. It usually supports fixtures like windows, doors, and cabinets. Common examples include door handles, door hinges, deadbolts, latches, numerals, letter plates, switch plates, and <b>door</b> <b>knockers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Door</b> <b>knockers,</b> often cast in bronze, had a {{symbolic}} significance across eastern Anatolia and {{were part of}} a thematic program that was prominent in the region especially during the 12th - 13th centuries. The tradition, although evolved, survives to this day in such centers as Kemaliye. Along with the door in its entirety, they were also a distinctive feature of the palace in Diyarbakır.|$|R

It owned a copper <b>door</b> <b>knocker</b> of individual design, windows which had been altered to open outwards, hanging flower boxes filled with fuchsias, and at the back (a great feature) a little court tiled with jade-green tiles, and surrounded by pink hydrangeas in peacock-blue tubs.

How they degenerate into the British <b>door</b> <b>knocker,</b> I leave you to determine for yourselves, with such assistances as I may be able to suggest to you in my next lecture; but, as the grotesqueness of human history plans it, there is actually a connection between that last degradation of the Leonine symbol, and its first and noblest significance.|$|E
