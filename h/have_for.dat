5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Leipzig, before {{the second week of}} January 1793, Kościuszko set off for Paris, where he tried to gain French support for the planned {{uprising}} in Poland.

Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use it could <b>have</b> <b>for</b> their own cause, and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and the growing reign of terror.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{in captivity}} <b>have</b> <b>for</b> centuries {{been used for}} entertainment. They {{have been trained to}} dance, and were kept for baiting in Europe at least since the 16th century.

5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal <b>have</b> <b>for</b> centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally with guns. In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E
40|$|Competing {{interests}} {{over the}} park 2 ̆ 7 s land use between conservation and forest use result in many conflicts. The conservation group {{is interested in}} seeing more land be allocated for conservation, while the community forestry-working group is interested in seeing more land be allocated for community forestry, but both view that their utilities would be maximized if they consume {{some of the other}} 2 ̆ 7 s good. The conservation groupvalues the land based on zone because of conservation nalue, while the community forestry values the land besed on habitai because of productivity. This study optimizing preferences of both groups attempts to propose the optimal allocation of the park 2 ̆ 7 s forestland between the two interests. The result suggests that the total evergreen forest land in the general conservation zone could be allocated 2, 742 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> the conservation and 1, 871 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> community forestry and the total evergteen forest land in the managed resources zone could be allocated 237 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> conservation and 475 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> community forestry. And the total mengrove forestland in the general conservation zone could be allocated 608 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> conservation and 352 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> community forestry and the total mangrove forestland in the managed resource zone could be allocated 585 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> conservation and 1, 079 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> community forestry. For better management, it is recommended that all community forestry land should be confined in the managed resource zone only rather than in both zones. This requires some of the land in the general conservation zone be added into the managef resource zone...|$|R

Irene Sharaff was engaged to design the more than 300costumes which would be needed. The show was originally named Hercules and Juliet, but they soon changed it to Me and Juliet. The Majestic Theatre, which Rodgers and Hammerstein desired to <b>have</b> <b>for</b> Me and Juliet, was currently occupied by their South Pacific, four years into its run. Arrangements were made to shift South Pacific to the Broadway Theatre though, due to schedule conflicts, this meant moving that show to Boston for five weeks.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers <b>have</b> <b>for</b> a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E

Much time is spent on her interaction with the computer TEC, which has suffered from a glitch and has {{fallen in love with}} Peach, much to her surprise. The main antagonist of the Mario series, Bowser, tries to collect the Crystal Stars before Mario does instead of directly opposing Mario, though his attempts mostly become comedic relief. Luigi's role in the game consists of recounting his slapstick adventures in the Waffle Kingdom, and appears with party members of his own, many of whom do not like Luigi at all for unrelated reasons, juxtaposing the universal respect Mario's partners <b>have</b> <b>for</b> Mario.|$|E
