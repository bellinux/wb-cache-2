It was recorded in Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles, mixed by Dave Fortman at Ocean Way Studios, Los Angeles and mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound, New York. The programming was done by DJ Lethal. Talking about The Open Door, Lee said that lot of people expected the new songs on the album to be similar with [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2003) before adding that [...] "'Weight of the World', 'Sweet Sacrifice' and 'All That I'm Living For' are so amazing to me because of the adrenaline. <b>Especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> play them live."

[...] As another option (except in the first subset, that is, save in tragœdy and (arch)diœcese), <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> want to enunciate more clearly, we alternatively add an additional (secondary) stress on this vowel and then pronounce it as long E.|$|E

Grace Smerage, the mother of expelled student Keith Smerage, had complained to Greenough that Harvard had just graduated others her son said were as guilty as he or more so. Greenough replied {{on behalf of the}} Court: [...] "We certainly cannot be held responsible for not acting on evidence we did not possess, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> have asked all the boys we have summoned if they had anything further to tell us. If boys choose to shield those who are guilty they must accept the incomplete results of a Board acting upon information which is inadequate because the boys themselves have chosen to let it be inadequate." ...|$|E

Hocks in her journal article Feminist {{interventions}} in electronic environments {{as an example}} of a Carmen Sandiego game which [...] "included educational information in a gender-neutral way and portrayed strong, intelligent women characters" [...] such as the African-American Chief and the Hispanic Carmen Sandigo. David Colker of Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "Another plus for [...] "Where in Time" [...] is the on-screen presence of actress Lynne Thigpen, who brings a winning presence to her role as the chief of the detectives seeking Carmen". Debbie Maria Leon of the New Straits Times wrote that [...] "the urgency of the [...] voice [...] enough oomph to make [...] go scurrying to restore history". Alternatively, Providence Journal - Bulletin wrote [...] "There's a lot to learn along the way, but we spent a lot of time sitting through overblown speeches from the chief <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> would rather have gotten on with it." [...] Kristie Rohwedder of Bustle said this was her [...] "favorite Carmen Sandiego game".

50|$|As Marx notes, prices may be {{attached}} to almost anything at all ("the price of owning, using or borrowing something"), and therefore need not express product-values at all. Prices do not necessarily {{have anything to do}} with the production of tangible wealth, although they might facilitate claims to it. The prices of some types of assets are not formed by any product-values at all. This becomes <b>especially</b> important <b>when</b> <b>we</b> leave the sphere of production and the distribution of products altogether, and enter other sectors of economic life.|$|R

So we propose a decentered view about urban night.

40|$|Abstract A {{detailed}} study of the rescattering series is performed within a model, using a generalized procedure of eikonalization and fitted to the pp and ¯pp elastic scattering data. We estimate and compare the various rescattering corrections {{to be added to}} the Born contribution in the amplitude. We find that their number is finite, whereas it increases with the energy and the transfer, like does their importance. In the domain where data exist, we find also that a correct computation must include, at least, all two- and three-Reggeon exchanges and some four- and five-Reggeon exchanges. Any approximation aiming to reduce this (large) number of exchange would be hazardous, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> extrapolating. <b>We</b> extend our estimates in the domain of future experiments. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a method for}} acceleration of the real time ray tracing by using characteristic traits of visual perception. Ray tracing is a demanding rendering technique which is much slower than currently dominating scanline methods. Performance hit <b>especially</b> arise <b>when</b> <b>we</b> use huge amount of samples for anti-aliasing or other sample-based effects. We show how to decreases number of rays by increasing the perceptual size of selected pixels by using combination of eye tracking and the human gaze-dependent contrast sensitivity. Our study shows that num-ber of processed pixels can be reduced three times without perceptually noticeable quality loss. As a result, we can greatly increase performance of ray tracing. ...|$|R

However, this need not be the case, and the flexibility of designing different matrices for encoding and decoding allows us to perform image restoration in the DCT domain. This is <b>especially</b> useful <b>when</b> <b>we</b> have severe limitations on the computational power, for instance, with in-camera image manipulation for programmable digital cameras.
