2500|$|In 2005, Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil, who {{hails from}} Rajpipla in the Gujarat, {{publicly}} {{came out as}} gay. He was quickly anointed by the Indian and the world media as the first openly gay royal. He was disinherited as an immediate reaction by the royal family, though they eventually reconciled. He appeared on the American talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show on October 24, 2007, and on BBC Three's Undercover Princes. In 2008, Zoltan Parag, a competitor at the Mr. Gay International contest {{said that he was}} apprehensive about returning to India. He said, [...] "Indian media has exposed me so much that now when <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>my</b> friends back home, their parents do not let them talk to me".|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers wrote, and Miller later confirmed, that a {{recurring}} theme in the lyrics of Real Nighttime was life after college, which Miller paired with the intuition that [...] "freedom had a strong aspect of being bad news." [...] The song [...] "24" [...] placed the narrator at the cusp of a quarter-life crisis, as a self-conscious young adult whose mixed feelings established that he [...] "doesn't know where he fits, or to how to live on his own, in a post-collegiate milieu." [...] The theme continued with allusions to finding one's own direction and leaving the nest, as in [...] "Curse of the Frontier Land" [...] ("A year ago we called this a good time"), and [...] "I Mean It This Time" [...] ("Give me all the gin I need, for I may not be this strong when <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>my</b> parents and tell them they've been wrong.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Early {{during his}} stint in Cream, Clapton's first Les Paul Standard was stolen. He {{continued}} to play Les Pauls exclusively with Cream (one bought from Andy Summers was almost identical to the stolen guitar) until 1967, when he acquired his most famous guitar in this period, a 1964 Gibson SG, dubbed [...] "the Fool". Clapton used both the Les Paul and the SG to create his self-described [...] "woman tone". [...] He explained in a 1967 interview, [...] "I am playing more smoothly now. I’m developing what <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>my</b> 'woman tone.' It's a sweet sound, something like the solo on 'I Feel Free'." [...] Writer Michael Dregni describes it as [...] "thick yet piercing, overdriven yet smooth, distorted yet creamy". [...] The tone is achieved {{by a combination of}} tone control settings on the guitars and Clapton's Marshall JTM45 amplifier. [...] Vintage Guitar magazine identifies [...] "the opening riff and solo of 'Sunshine of Your Love' are arguably the best illustrations of full-blown woman tone". [...] Clapton's [...] "Fool" [...] acquired its name from its distinctive psychedelic paint job, created by the visual art collective also known as the Fool (just before Cream's first US appearance in 1967, Clapton's SG, Bruce's Fender VI, and Baker's drum head were all repainted in psychedelic designs).|$|E

5000|$|Hosea 11:1 - Matthew 2:14 states, [...] "So he got up, {{took the}} child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was {{fulfilled}} what the Lord had said through the prophet: 'Out of Egypt <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>my</b> son.'" [...] However, that passage reads, [...] "When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>my</b> son." ...|$|R
2500|$|Musically, Wilson stated {{he wanted}} to bring {{back some of the}} {{experimental}} aspects they had moved away from on Stupid Dream, stating [...] "Richard [...] and I worked on creating some unique keyboard sounds for the album – e.g. the 'fairground' on 'How is Your Life Today?' and the 'insects' at the end of 'Russia On Ice. He also spoke of the influence of metal music on the album, stating, [...] "...part of the beauty of the guitar solo on 'Where We Would Be' {{comes from the fact that}} it was played relatively straight but then fed through so many distortion and lo-fi processes that it began to fizz and disintegrate. The riffing guitars on 'Russia On Ice' are pure metal and one of the solos of 'Hatesong' <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>my</b> 'Korn solo' on account of the fact that the bottom strings on the guitar are tuned down so low that the notes can be bent several tones". Conversely, the band added more unconventional instruments to the compositions as well, such as the banjo, hammered dulcimers, and more string sections. String sections in Lightbulb Sun were arranged and produced by Dave Gregory from alternative rock band XTC at Christchurch Studios, Clifton, Bristol in January 2000, recorded by John Waterhouse.|$|E
