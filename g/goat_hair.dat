25|$|The {{construction}} material used for ab anbars were very tough and extensively used a special mortar called sarooj {{which was made}} of sand, clay, egg whites, lime, <b>goat</b> <b>hair,</b> and ash in specific proportions, depending on location and climate of the city. This mixture {{was thought to be}} completely water impenetrable. The walls of the storage were often 2 meters thick, and special bricks had to be used. These bricks were especially baked for ab anbars and were called Ajor Ab anbari. Some ab anbars were so big that they would be built underneath caravanserais such as the ab anbar of Haj Agha Ali in Kerman. Sometimes they would also be built under mosques, such as the ab anbar of Vazir near Isfahan.|$|E

500|$|The Tlingits regard Glacier Bay {{as their}} sacred {{homeland}}. The National Park Service takes {{the view that}} [...] "Glacier Bay National Park is the spiritual homeland of the Huna Tlingit, and Glacier Bay National Preserve is the homeland of the Ghunaaxhoo Kwaan unit of the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe". The tribes' oral history supports that they were pushed out and migrated south when the glacier advanced. [...] They {{moved back to the}} area when the Glacier retreated in the 1880s. There are 60 odd proto-historic or historic sites in the Glacier Bay, which are identified with Tlingit Indians or European Americans. They {{are an integral part of}} Northwest Coast people inferred to be belonging to Haida, Tlingit or Eyak clans. Their settlements existed even in the 1880s in Dry Bay, Excursion Inlet, Point Couverden and the Port Frederick area (now known as Hoonah) and Dundas Bay. A Tlingit cemetery of the period has also been located in the park area. Seasonal hunting, gathering and fishing was their way of life, woven around a central village, with shifting fishing and hunting camps. The food source of the natives was the rich Salmon fish resources of the area. A complex society evolved with rich artistic traditions. Tlingits claimed their fishing-dependent lifestyle was helped during the National Monument years, which kept out commercial fishing. [...] After the area became a National Park, their fishing and hunting activities were curtailed except for certain religious exemptions. However, the National Park administration is closely interacting with the Tlingits to foster their cultural heritage. They are allowed access to the park to [...] "harvest berries, a variety of seafoods, and traditional use items such as spruce roots and mountain <b>goat</b> <b>hair</b> (for weaving traditional blankets)". In addition the park is planning to establish a Tlingit longhouse near its main office, where Tlingit culture would be fully highlighted and also facilitate holding of cultural events.|$|E
2500|$|In most Persian rugs, {{the pile}} is of sheep's wool. Its {{characteristics}} and quality vary from each {{area to the}} next, depending on the breed of sheep, climatic conditions, pasturage, and the particular customs relating to when and how the wool is shorn and processed. Different areas of a sheep's fleece yield different qualities of wool, depending on the ratio between the thicker and stiffer sheep hair and the finer fibers of the wool. Usually, sheep are shorn in spring and fall. The spring shear produces wool of finer quality. The lowest grade of wool used in carpet weaving is [...] "skin" [...] wool, which is removed chemically from dead animal skin. Higher grades of Persian wool are {{often referred to as}} kurk, or kork wool, which is gained from the wool growing on the sheep's neck. Modern production also makes use of imported wool, e.g. Merino wool from New Zealand, because the high demand on carpet wool cannot be entirely met by the local production. Fibers from camels and goats are also used. <b>Goat</b> <b>hair</b> is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvedges, of nomadic rugs like Baluch rugs, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Persian nomadic rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel's wool turns out to be dyed sheep wool.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} was aimed to {{crossbred}} male kids of the <b>Hair</b> <b>goat</b> and Saanen x Hair kids (G 1) body condition score and compare their body size intensive, semi-intensive and extensive conditions. In the research, 30 <b>Hair</b> <b>goat</b> and 30 Saanen x <b>Hair</b> <b>goat</b> (G 1) crossbred single male kids was used. When the research findings were evaluated, in terms of body condition scores of 30, 60 and 90 th days high values in the semi-intensive were detected in fattening Saanen x <b>Hair</b> <b>goat</b> (G 1) crossbred kids. However, {{at the end of}} fattening in semi-intensive fattening group of <b>Hair</b> <b>goat</b> it is determined that the value of the highest condition score. This situation is thought to be caused by more growth of environment and width measurements in <b>Hair</b> <b>goat</b> kids in the later stages of fattening according to the Saanen x <b>Hair</b> <b>goats</b> (G 1) crossbred. In study in terms of body length during whole fattening, in terms of the height at the withers data obtained from the 60 th and 90 th day was found statistically significant. At the end of the fattening in semi-intensive fattening group of Saanen x <b>Hair</b> <b>goat</b> (G 1) crossbred it was observed to have higher body length and height at the withers value of crossbred kids. When chest width measurements between paddles in kids were examined, in all periods seems to be an increase in <b>Hair</b> <b>goat</b> kids than the Saanen x <b>Hair</b> <b>goat</b> (G 1) crossbred kids. At the end of fattening in terms of height rump <b>Hair</b> <b>goats</b> has shown higher values than Saanen x <b>Hair</b> <b>goat</b> (G 1) crossbred kids but the highest values of the semi-intensive group has shown. As a result, semi-intensive feeding group of kids of body condition score and body size was higher than intensive and extensive fattening group kids, in terms of length and height measurements Saanen x <b>Hair</b> <b>goat</b> (G 1) crossbred kids in terms of width and environmental measures has shown higher values than <b>Hair</b> <b>goat</b> kids...|$|R
5000|$|The word {{derives from}} the Latin cilicium, a {{covering}} made of <b>goat's</b> <b>hair</b> from Cilicia, a Roman province in south-east Asia Minor.

[...] This is translated as hair-cloth in the Douay Bible, and as sackcloth in the King James Version and the Book of Common Prayer ("But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth." [...] in the King James Bible). Sackcloth is often mentioned in the Bible {{as a symbol of}} mourning and penance, and probably was a form of hairshirt. Sackcloth may also mean burlap.

In 2011, the effect of goat ages were determined on average daily milk yield (ADMY) and lactation milk yield (LMY) for all goat genotypes.
