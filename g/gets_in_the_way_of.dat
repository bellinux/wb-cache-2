After Peter and Jillian spend the entire day {{together}} and greatly enjoy each other's company, Peter convinces Jillian to either force Brian to let her move in with him or leave him. An angry Brian agrees to get an apartment with Jillian. Much to his surprise, Brian has a good time living with Jillian, but he comes to the realization {{that there is no way}} he can pay the rent by himself and he decides to allow Stewie to move in with them, who now makes money with his own paper route. When Brian does not tell Jillian that Stewie is helping with the rent, Stewie quickly <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> Brian and Jillian's happiness living together. After arguing with Brian one night while he is having sex with Jillian, Stewie reveals that he is paying half the rent, prompting Brian to admit he never wanted to move in with Jillian at all. Heartbroken, Jillian leaves Brian, who blames Stewie for ruining the relationship until Stewie tells him it's himself that ruined the relationship. After many failed attempts to lift a saddened Brian's spirits, Stewie convinces Brian to try to get Jillian back. Brian goes to her apartment, only to find that she has now moved in with Mayor West. As the two go their separate ways, Brian moves back in with the Griffins, where he manages to move on with his life.|$|E

A {{fair amount of}} subtle characterization is made for Mamoru, and later extending his role within the manga as to who he is. He also is given the power of psychometry, which also {{showed up in the}} anime, but was not given a name. This manifests in his ability to see and read dreams (such as Chibiusa's), to heal people and to monitor the status of the Earth. This does not develop fully until the Black Moon arc, and is used occasionally throughout the series. Mamoru also has his left ear pierced in the manga, a trait that does not carry over to his anime counterpart.|$|E
500|$|Will Ferrell's {{character}} received {{criticism in}} the episode. White criticized Deangelo Vickers, noting {{that she did not}} have a handle on the character and that he was too [...] "downright normal" [...] and [...] "practically boring". McNutt argued that, while Ferrell [...] "is not really the problem with the role" [...] of Deangelo Vickers, the actions between Ferrell and Carell felt more like [...] "hanging out to commemorate the former’s departure from a television show" [...] rather than the two playing believable characters. He also felt that Deangelo [...] "feels disruptive to the show’s narrative" [...] because his character <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the plot. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent [...] "so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do".

[...] Sonia Saraiya of Nerve ranked Rapunzel fourth {{in her article}} [...] "Ranked: Disney Princesses From Least To Most Feminist".

[...] Tala Dayrit of Female Network included Rapunzel in her article [...] "30 Fierce and Fun Female Cartoon Characters", writing that, unlike her original fairy tale counterpart, [...] "She’s not the helpless damsel locked in a tower awaiting an unknown fate, but a strong woman capable of defending herself in a fight." ...|$|E
500|$|Unsure {{of what he}} {{is getting}} himself into, Will agrees to help Charlotte's band (later called I Can't Go On, I'll Go On) which {{includes}} Bug (Charlie Saxton) and Omar (Tim Jo), eventually expanding it with more like-minded outcasts. Against all odds, the group's sound starts {{to come together and}} their prospects for success look bright. Will starts losing his [...] "loser-status", but the band <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> completing a project {{he was going to do}} with Sa5m. After spending a day with Sa5m, Charlotte teaches Will how to properly kiss a girl, by demonstrating on him that night, which his mother sees. Will takes Sa5m to the Overlook and, after an awkward start, successfully kisses her, after which Sa5m shyly asks Will to accompany her to a movie screening, which he agrees to. However, Will stands Sa5m up, breaking the date for a concert with Charlotte. [...] After that, Sa5m starts ignoring Will at school; he visits her house, hoping to apologize. Her mom shows him a video of a younger Sa5m performing [...] "Everything I Own", leading Sa5m to be outraged and order Will to leave. As an apology, he makes a touching documentary short about her for his Human Studies project (with the song [...] "Young Folks" [...] included in it) and she eventually forgives him.|$|E
500|$|... "Novacane" [...] {{expresses a}} story through its lyrics, {{and has been}} {{described}} as [...] "nightmarish" [...] in nature. It has been called a [...] "love song of sorts", with influence taken from alternative hip hop group The Pharcyde. Lyrically the track explores a narrative in which the singer meets a girl attempting to pay her way through dental school by working in porn, or at least that's what she told him. Protagonist meets the girl at Coachella, a musical festival which takes place in Indio, California. Ocean serves as the protagonist in the song, in love with a girl [...] "so gone on drugs that Ocean, wanting to be close to her, {{has no choice but to}} get gone on those same drugs". The pair get high using dental local anesthetics. Though Ocean serves as an unreliable narrator, Pitchfork wrote that he was [...] "probably still the most reliable character in the whole song." [...] The song contains reference to film director Stanley Kubrick and his 1999 drama Eyes Wide Shut. In addition, it also makes a comparison of the numbness that drugs produce with the use of auto-tune in the music business. Summing up the song, Pitchfork also commented that [...] "Novacane" [...] "is a song about personal connection but also about all the stupid numb human shit that <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> personal connection, which means it's probably the most honest song about personal connection on the radio." [...] Rappers Joe Budden, Tyga and Prodigy have all released freestyles to [...] "Novacane".|$|E

In [...] "Fragile", Lois continues her duties under Martha Kent (Annette O'Toole), who is requested by the Governor to take Jonathan's place after he suffers a fatal heart attack. In season six's [...] "Sneeze", Lois discovers an interest in journalism after she is almost struck by a barn door that falls out of the sky while she is jogging. Her story is bought by the Inquisitor, a tabloid newspaper that gives her a job as a reporter. In [...] "Wither", she begins a romantic relationship with billionaire Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley), who, unbeknown to her, masquerades at night as the vigilante Green Arrow. Queen's [...] "job" [...] as Green Arrow often <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> their relationship.

Clark and Oliver are wise to her plan, however, and Clark dresses up as Green Arrow to throw Lois off Oliver's trail. When Oliver is forced to leave Metropolis to track down all of Lex's experimental facilities, in the episode [...] "Justice", his relationship with Lois comes to an end. In season six's [...] "Prototype", Lois discovers that Lex has been doing experimental research on army soldiers, one of which was her best friend. As a result, Lois decides in [...] "Phantom" [...] to begin looking into Lex's LuthorCorp projects.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{met with}} [...] "a crackle of {{favorable}} reviews in major papers". The New Republic hailed it as [...] "an exceptional work", both [...] "thoughtful and irrepressibly imaginative". The Houston Chronicle described Clarke as [...] "a superb character writer", and the Denver Post {{called her a}} [...] "superb storyteller". The reviews praised Clarke's [...] "deft" [...] handling of the pastiche of styles, but many criticised the novel's pace, The Guardian complaining that [...] "the plot creaks frightfully in many places and the pace dawdles". In his review for Science Fiction Weekly, Clute suggested that [...] "almost every scene in the first 300 pages should have been carefully and delicately trimmed" [...] (emphasis in original) since they do little to advance the story. He argued that, at times, Clarke's Austenesque tone <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> plot development. On the other hand, The Baltimore Sun found the novel [...] "a quick read". Complaining that the book leaves the reader [...] "longing for just a bit more lyricism and poetry", The Washington Post reviewer noted, with others, that [...] "sex plays virtually {{no role in the}} story... one looks in vain for the corruption of the innocent". The New Statesman reviewer, Amanda Craig, praised the novel as [...] "a tale of magic such as might have been written by the young Jane Austen– or, perhaps, by the young Mrs Radcliffe, whose Gothic imagination and exuberant delicacy of style set the key." [...] However, she also criticised the book: [...] "As fantasy, it is deplorable, given that it fails to embrace the essentially anarchic nature of such tales. What is so wonderful about magicians, wizards and all witches other than Morgan le Fay is not just their magical powers, but that they possess these in spite of being low-born. Far from caring about being gentlemen, wizards are the ultimate expression of rank's irrelevance to talent". However, reviewers were not in universal agreement on any of these points.

2500|$|In {{his short}} story {{collection}} A Century of Great Suspense Stories, editor Jeffery Deaver noted that King [...] "singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up. While {{there were many}} good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that 'Salem's Lot was [...] "Peyton Place meets Dracula. And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. ‘Stuff like that <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the story,' they were told.

2500|$|The Compact Cassette {{originally}} {{was intended for}} use in dictation machines. In this capacity, some later-model cassette-based dictation machines could also run the tape at half speed (15⁄16 in/s) as playback quality was not critical. The cassette soon became a popular medium for distributing prerecorded music—initially through The Philips Record Company (and subsidiary labels Mercury and Philips in the U.S.). As of 2009, one still finds cassettes used {{for a variety of}} purposes, such as journalism, oral history, meeting and interview transcripts, audio-books, and so on. Police are still big buyers of cassette tapes, as some lawyers [...] "don't trust digital technology for interviews".

2500|$|Another {{old design}} is the {{shoulder}} vise. The {{best thing about}} this design {{is that it allows}} clamping directly behind the screw. This yields unobstructed vertical clamping for cutting dovetails and similar operations. There is also typically a little play in the screw/jaw attachment that provides for clamping of tapered work. This is one vise that should be designed into the bench from the beginning, as it is difficult to retrofit into an existing bench. The primary drawback of the shoulder vise is its fragility, unless the [...] "arm" [...] is attached to the [...] "end cap" [...] using a dovetail or finger joint, usually glued or [...] "pinned" [...] to eliminate rotative movement about the joint, otherwise it is fairly easy to break it with a big steel bench screw. But one should never really have to put that much force on it. Some woodworkers say that the big vise <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> some jobs, others find it unobtrusive. Implicit in a shoulder vise is an integral planing stop, formed by the intersection of the jaw and the jaw spacer, and which allows the shoulder vise to perform multiple duties, such as jointing long boards with a [...] "bench slave" [...] to hold the opposite end. In earlier times, a crochet and a holdfast would perform the same function.|$|E

[...] Noorani refers {{to him as a}} [...] "devout Christian" [...] Armour describes Bennett as a [...] "confessing Christian" [...] while Zahniser comments that Bennett's [...] "search for Muhammad" [...] is also a [...] "struggle for interpretation." [...] Bennett [...] "combines a Christian struggle to find Muhammad with a textbook-like tour of Islam itself." [...] Shafaat's review is a 26-page detailed analysis of Bennett on Muhammad and on Jesus. [...] On the one hand, he praises Bennett for listening to Muslim voices. [...] On the other, he suggests that Bennett is hampered by his loyalty to Jesus and by his need to [...] "fit Islam into his Christian outlook", which results in his inability to [...] "properly assess evidence about the Prophet Muhammad when it calls into question what we 'know of God in Christ'". [...] On a positive note, Bennett [...] "is aware that his attempt to fit Islam into his world-view 'is not unproblematical'." [...] Theology <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> history, so Bennett fails to allow the [...] "historical Muhammad to speak for himself". Shafaat also thinks that Bennett may have [...] "felt some pressure from his peers to downgrade his estimate of Muhammad".

2500|$|To wit, {{the novel}} is deeply {{invested}} in exploring Shakespeare scholarship and the [...] "Shakespeare-Industrial Complex" [...] - in particular the work of Harold Bloom, whose books The Anxiety of Influence and Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human are explicitly referenced. The Introduction features countless references to Shakespeare plays, many of which, Phillips claims were unintentional, artifacts of [...] "things that stuck in memory" [...] from his research. The book also references the grand scope of Shakespeare's influence – the narrator claims that his writing is [...] "a nursery of titles for other, better writers" [...] going on to list Pale Fire, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Infinite Jest, The Sound and the Fury and many other texts. Furthermore, {{the novel is}} remarkably dismissive of the anti-Stratfordian (i.e., {{those who do not}} believe that a man named William Shakespeare wrote the plays attributed him) camp of Shakespeare scholarship. Phillips calls their theories [...] "a gentle, harmless madness," [...] and as plausible as the narrative of Roland Emmerich's Independence Day (Emmerich directed the 2011 anti-Stratfordian film Anonymous). He immersed himself in their argumentation in researching the book and [...] "came to the conclusion that while [...] can appreciate their passion and their willingness to hold on against a sometimes-scornful majority, they are really, really just wrong. Their approach to factual documentation and to the reading of fiction, both, require a view of the universe that [...] just can’t accept." [...] Even so, Phillips maintains that [...] "the deification <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> what [...] actually good at," [...] and that his critique of [...] "Bardolatry" [...] in the novel is equally in earnest.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 March 1985, the Jesus and Mary Chain {{played a}} gig at the North London Polytechnic {{in front of}} one of their largest crowds up to that point. The {{organizers}} had overbooked the venue, leaving hundreds of fans locked outside. When Gillespie and Hart attempted to break the locks, the police were called. Support band Meat Whiplash had stirred up violence before the Mary Chain set foot onto the stage when singer Paul McDermott threw an empty wine bottle into the audience, prompting four members of the crowd to attack him, leading to their set being abandoned. Second act The Jasmine Minks got through their set without incident, but the Jesus and Mary Chain then kept the audience waiting for over an hour before taking the stage, and then left the stage after playing for less than twenty minutes. Members of the audience began throwing cans at where the band were hiding behind the stage curtains, before mounting the stage to smash the equipment that remained there. The violence continued for some time before police eventually took control. The venue blamed the band's late appearance and two equipment breakdowns, while McGee issued a statement saying that [...] "the audience were not smashing up the hall, they were smashing up pop music", going on to say [...] "This is truly art as terrorism". The violence soon started to become a hindrance to the band, with people attending concerts simply for the violence rather than the music, William commenting [...] "I hate it, I despise it. It gets in the way in terms of getting more gigs, and it <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> our image". Many performances were cancelled during the remainder of 1985, with promoters or local councils not prepared to risk a riot. The violence flared up again at a performance at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town in September, with bottles thrown at the band while they played, and a section of the audience smashing up the amplification equipment and smashing the lights afterwards, with several people injured by flying glass. A major factor in the audience reaction was the length of the band's sets at the time, which lasted less than twenty-five minutes, Jim explaining this with [...] "there's never been a group good enough to play any longer". Lack of songs was also a factor, according to Jim: [...] "We've only got enough songs to play for that long".|$|E
