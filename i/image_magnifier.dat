We show {{the results of}} several basic calculations of diffraction properties of germanium x-ray crystal monochromators and of an analyzer-based imaging method for various asymmetry factors using an x-ray energy range from 8 to 20 keV. The important parameter of highly asymmetric monochromators as <b>image</b> <b>magnifiers</b> or compressors is the crystal surface quality. We have applied several crystal surface finishing methods, including advanced nanomachining using single-point diamond turning (SPDT), conventional mechanical lapping, chemical polishing, and chemomechanical polishing, and we have evaluated these methods by means of atomic force microscopy, diffractometry, reciprocal space mapping, and others. Our goal is to exclude the chemical etching methods as the final processing technique because it causes surface undulations. The aim is to implement very precise deterministic methods with a control of surface roughness down to 0. 1 nm. The smallest roughness (∼ 0. 3 [*][*]nm∼ 0. 3 [*][*]nm), best planarity, and absence of the subsurface damage were observed for the sample which was machined using an SPDT with a feed rate of 1 [*][*]mm/min 1 [*][*]mm/min and was consequently polished using a fine polishing 15 -min process with a solution containing SiO 2 SiO 2 nanoparticles (20 nm) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{width and}} the {{integrated}} {{intensity of the}} 220 x-ray double diffraction profile and the shift of the Bragg condition due to refraction have been measured in a channel cut Ge crystal in an angular range near the critical angle of total external reflection. The Bragg angle and incidence condition were varied by changing the x-ray energy. In agreement with the extended dynamical theory of x-ray diffraction, the integrated intensity of the double diffraction remained almost constant even for grazing incidence condition {{very close to the}} critical angle &# 61553;C for total external reflection. A broadening of the diffraction profile not predicted by the extended theory of x-ray diffraction was observed when the Bragg condition was at angles of incidence lower than 0. 6 ?. Plane wave topographs revealed a contrast that could be explained by a slight residual crystal surface undulation of 0. 3 degrees due to the etching to remove the cutting damage and the increasing effect of refraction at glancing angles close to the critical angle. These findings confirm that highly asymmetric channel cut Ge crystals can work as efficient monochromators or <b>image</b> <b>magnifiers</b> also at glancing angles close to the critical angle and that the main limitation is the crystal surface preparation...|$|R

The images have so far been {{used for this purpose}} have usually low spatial resolutions. This means that each individual pixel may contain different features with different characteristics. This may in turn decrease the quality of indices and consequently renders useful application of drought models impossible. This problem can be overcome if we find a way to increase knowledge of the surface cover features in a low spatial resolution image by using high spatial resolution images of the same region produced by sensors on board of the same platform. To implement this task, we used ASTER <b>images</b> as a <b>magnifier</b> for the MODIS images i...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of cervical preflaring on determination of the initial apical file in maxillary lateral incisors. Forty human lateral incisors with complete root formation were used. After standard access cavities, a size 06 K-file was inserted into each canal until the apical foramen was reached. The WL (WL) was set 1 mm short of the apical foramen. Four groups (n= 10) were formed at random, according to the type of cervical preflaring performed. Group 1 received the initial apical instrument without previous preflaring of the cervical and middle root canal thirds. Group 2 had the cervical and middle root canal thirds enlarged with nickel-titanium Orifice Opener instruments. Group 3 had the cervical and middle root canal thirds enlarged with Gates-Glidden drills. Titanium-nitrite treated, stainless steel LA Axxess burs were used for preflaring the cervical and middle root canal thirds of group 4. Each canal was sized using manual K-files, starting with size 08 files with passive movements until the WL was reached. File sizes were increased until a binding sensation was felt at the WL, and the instrument size was recorded for each tooth. The apical region was then observed under a stereoscopic <b>magnifier,</b> <b>images</b> were recorded digitally and the differences between root canal and maximum file diameters were recorded (in mm) for each sample. Significant differences were found between the groups regarding the anatomical diameter at the WL and the first file to bind the canal (p = 0. 01). The major discrepancy was found when no preflaring was performed (0. 1882 mm average). Canals preflared with Orifice Opener instruments (0. 0485 mm average) and Gates-Glidden drills (0. 1074 mm average) also showed great discrepancy. The LA Axxess burs produced the smallest differences between anatomical diameter and first file to bind (0. 0119 mm average). Instrument binding technique for determining anatomical diameter at WL was not accurate. Preflaring of the cervical and middle thirds of the root canal improved anatomical diameter determination; the instrument used for preflaring played a major role on determination of the anatomical diameter at the WL. Canals preflared with LA Axxess burs created a more accurate relationship between file size and anatomical diameter...|$|R
