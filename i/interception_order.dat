An initial meta-analysis of the effects of expertise on decision-making revealed stronger effects with more homogeneous results in performance contexts and when individuals were allowed to perform sport actions. Based on this conclusion, all of our empirical experiments were developed using a specific sub-phase of competitive futsal games. Analysis of ball passing performance revealed that the decision to pass a ball to a teammate was regulated by spatial constraints through the coupling of interpersonal distance values between players at the moment of pass initiation. Furthermore, the success of the pass was well predicted by a proposed variable defined as Time to Ball <b>Interception.</b> In <b>order</b> to understand how ball dynamics and goal position constrained interpersonal relations between players we also investigated how patterns of interpersonal coordination between players emerged during different sub-phases of the game. It was observed that the ball and the goal represent key performance constraints which shape the emergent patterns of coordination between players and teams.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is to {{establish}} the parameters of the L-band (1. 4 GHz) Microwave Emission of the Biosphere model (L-MEB) for grass covers, and to assess surface soil moisture retrievals in areas covered by grass. L-MEB parameters are key ancillary information for the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission (SMOS) retrieval algorithm that produces estimates of the surface soil moisture from measurements of the surface brightness temperature at L-band. L-band data sets from three ground-based experiments over grass are analysed in this paper: BARC (orchard grass and alfalfa), ELBARA-ETH (clover grass), and SMOSREX (grass and litter from a field left fallow). Modelling of the brightness temperature using the zero-th order radiative transfer model in L-MEB indicates that the vegetation appears isotropic to microwaves propagating with horizontal polarisation, and that the single scattering albedo can be neglected. At vertical polarisation, non-zero scattering is observed for all the grass data sets. Surface soil moisture is retrieved with enough accuracy for all data sets as long as the soil and litter emission are calibrated beforehand. Then surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth can be left as free parameters in the retrieval process. Finally, the study highlights the importance of detecting strong emission and attenuation by wet vegetation and litter due to rainfall <b>interception</b> in <b>order</b> to obtain accurate estimates of the surface soil moisture.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{rainfall}} interception by canopies {{plays an important}} role in the hydrological cycle. The fraction of rainfall which is intercepted is largely dependent on species-specific vegetation properties, such as leaf- and branch architecture and canopy structure and - density. Because these vegetation properties spatially vary, canopy interception is a spatially variable process. However, these species-specific vegetation properties are often not, or insufficiently included in hydrological models which focus for example on rainfall-runoff processes, soil moisture balances, transpiration and groundwater recharge from rainfall. This could lead to serious modelling uncertainties and - mistakes. This study aimed at improving an existing spatial interception mapping approach by including relations between species-specific vegetation properties and <b>interception.</b> In <b>order</b> to achieve this goal, a two-fold method was applied. First, the influence of species-specific differences of leaf-and canopy structures on the interception process was studied. Fieldwork on branch- and plot-scale was performed in a study region in Vorarlberg (Austria) to find relations between the vegetation properties and interception. Secondly, the ability of a high-resolution remote sensing imagery based model to estimate the spatial variability of canopy interception on regional scale was studied when these species-specific relations were implemented. Promising fieldwork results were gained which describe the relations between vegetation properties and interception per species. Due to these results, it was possible to model spatial variability of canopy interception for the study region in Vorarlberg, thereby taking species-specific vegetation properties into account. Although the results contribute to the improvement of the current approach to quantitatively estimate spatial variability of canopy interception on regional scale, the method needs to be improved and more research is needed in this field...|$|R

The use of {{electronic}} circuitry {{has increased in}} the recent years in many aspect of life especially in medical applications. This is due to their precise and fast results in analyzing fatal diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, which need a real time observation. The need for a real time observation raises the challenge to ﬁnd a solution, which should be power eﬃcient, high sensitive, low noise, and small enough to be attached to or injected into user body. The solution simply contains two main devices. First, the sensors network which collects data and information from the user body. The second device is the transceiver, which sends this data to an external unit for analysis and diagnoses. This work cycle repeats itself millions of times per second, which causes a high power consumption. Therefore, a power optimized system is needed to sustain a long lasting operation. This work introduces an ultra low power, low noise, and fully integrated receiver designated for short range communication systems. The system uses MOSFET weak inversion region of operation in order to decrease the supply voltage and hence, the total power consumption. In addition, the system uses an on-chip matching network for area optimization. This system consists of three main blocks: Radio frequency low noise ampliﬁer (RFLNA), mixer, and baseband ampliﬁer. This system manages to achieve a gain of 45. 85 dB while consuming 1023 µA from 0. 7 supply voltage, a single side band noise ﬁgure (SSBNF) of 8. 4 dB single side band noise ﬁgure (SSBNF), and a third <b>order</b> <b>interception</b> point (IIP 3) of - 37. 7 dBm. The system is designed using UMC 65 nm CMOS technology.

30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a cognitive radio network {{that consists of}} one cognitive base station (CBS) and multiple cognitive users (CUs) {{in the presence of}} an eavesdropper. In the cognitive radio network, CBS first detects whether there is spectrum hole through spectrum sensing and then communicates with CUs over the detected spectrum hole. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmission, the eavesdropper can overhear the cognitive transmissions between CBS and CUs and attempts to decode its overheard signals for <b>interception</b> purpose. In <b>order</b> to effectively defend against the eavesdropping attack, we propose a multiuser scheduling scheme for cognitive transmissions, where a CU with the highest instantaneous capacity to CBS is selected and scheduled to communicate with CBS. We analyze the security-reliability trade-off performance of proposed multiuser scheduling scheme for cognitive transmissions with the imperfect spectrum sensing over Rayleigh fading channels, where the security and reliability are evaluated in terms of the intercept probability and the outage probability, respectively. Numerical results illustrate that as the intercept probability requirement loosens, the outage probability of proposed multiuser scheduling scheme decreases accordingly, showing the trade-off between security and reliability. In addition, as the number of CUs increases, numerical intercept probability and outage probability of the multiuser scheduling scheme significantly improve, implying the security and reliability benefits through multiuser scheduling.|$|R

In this thesis, the focus was on the noise {{contribution in}} nonlinear systems when measuring with the nonlinear vector network analyzer (NVNA). An additional noise source together with a single sinewave signal was fed into the input of the amplifier and the performance was studied. The input power of the amplifier is considered to be the sum of the noise power and the signal power. The variation of the 1 dB compression point and the third <b>order</b> <b>interception</b> point as functions of the added noise power were studied. From the measured results in this thesis, the 1 dB compression point referred to the output power will decrease when increasing the added noise power at the input of the amplifier. The contribution of the added noise to the 1 dB compression point of an amplifier is considered dual: with the added noise the linear regression lines of the AM/AM curves are changed, and due to hard clipping the useful output power is reduced. As a result of those two effects, the added noise made the compression start at a lower power level. When the added noise reaches a certain level, the 1 dB compression point is hard to measure. Thus when performing nonlinear measurements, the noise effects should be taken into considerations and further studies are required to get better understanding of the system’s behavior in noisy environment...|$|R
