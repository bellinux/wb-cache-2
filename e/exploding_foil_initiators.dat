40|$|Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis (SHS), {{also called}} {{combustion}} synthesis is an exothermic and self-sustained reaction between the constituents, which has assumed {{significance for the}} production of ceramics and ceramic-metallic materials (cermets), because it is a very rapid processing technique without the need of complex furnaces. However, one of the drawbacks of this route is the high porosity of the final product (typically 50 %). This implies the need for a subsequent densification stage, e. g. by pressing. Combustion synthesized cermets such as TiC-based graded or TiB 2 based cermets can provide a good option for the fabrication of functionally graded material (FGM) components, e. g. to be used in armor applications (TiC based cermets) or for high and medium voltage switchgears (TiB 2 -based cermets). Self sustained High- Temperature Reactions (SHR) involve the initiation, and the subsequent propagation of a reaction front, the reaction being driven by heat release. Heat release from these reactions is potentially interesting for high temperature welding and brazing operations. Initiation of these reactions can take place by e. g. electrostatic discharge, mechanical (impact and shear) and thermal means.

30|$|<b>Exploding</b> <b>foil</b> <b>initiator</b> (EFI) {{is a type}} of {{electric}} generation pyrotechnic devices used for initiation of secondary reactions [20]. After applying an electric pulse, instantly increasing current density causes the vaporization of metal film bridge and the generation of high pressure plasma. Then, the flyer on the film bridge is sheared and accelerated to impact the explosives. With the increasing requirements for electric ignition device miniaturization and low energy initiation, the integration of nanoenergetic layers with a metal film bridge based on microelectronic and mechanical system (MEMS) technology to achieve functional nanoenergetic-on-a-chip (NOC) constitutes a promising option for the development of EFI. The combination of the reaction heat of energetic materials with the traditional electrical joule of metal film bridge make it possible to improve the electric explosion performances of EFI with low energy initiation in a compact size.|$|R

Current density increased with respect to capacitor voltage {{up to a point}} of saturation between 2400  V and 3000  V (evidenced electrically). Beyond the saturation voltage, high voltages demonstrated sustained energy delivery at a reduced current. This work indicates that control of active bridge volume or electrical supply signal may enable more closely controlled EFI flyer layer ejection behavior, and it demonstrates the relevance of using current per active bridge (specific current) as a metric to describe EFI electrical performance with relevance to dynamic response of the EFI. The impulse delivered by an EFI can be modulated via manipulation of the firing circuit input signal giving rise to system behavior variation...|$|R
5000|$|A slapper detonator, {{also called}} <b>exploding</b> <b>foil</b> <b>initiator</b> (EFI), is a {{relatively}} recent kind of a detonator developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, US Patent No. 4,788,913. It is an improvement of the earlier exploding-bridgewire detonator; instead of directly coupling the shock wave from the exploding wire, the expanding plasma from an explosion of a metal foil drives another thin plastic or metal foil called a [...] "flyer" [...] or a [...] "slapper" [...] across a gap, and its high-velocity impact on the explosive (for example, PETN or hexanitrostilbene) then delivers the energy and shock needed to initiate a detonation.

40|$|For the {{development}} of an <b>Exploding</b> <b>Foil</b> <b>Initiator</b> for Insensitive Munitions applications the following topics are of interest: the electrical circuit, the <b>exploding</b> <b>foil,</b> the velocity of the flyer, the driver explosive, the secondary flyer and the acceptor explosive. Several parameters of the EFI have influences on the velocity of the flyer. To investigate these parameters a Fabry-Perot Velocity Interferometer System (F-PVIS) has been used. The light to and from the flyer is transported by a multimode fibre terminated with a GRIN-lens. By this method the velocity of very tiny objects (0. 1 mm), can be measured. The velocity of flyer can be recorded with nanosecond resolution, depending on the Fabry-Perot etalon and the streak camera. With this equipment the influence of the dimensions of the <b>exploding</b> <b>foil</b> and the flyer on the velocity and the acceleration of the flyer are investigated. Also the integrity of the flyer during flight can be analyzed. To characterize the explosive material, to be used as driver explosive in EFI's, the initiation behaviour of the explosive has been investigated by taking pictures of the explosion with a high speed framing and streak camera. From these pictures the initiation distance and the detonation behaviour of the explosive has been analyzed. Normally, the driver explosive initiates the acceptor explosive (booster) by direct contact. This booster explosive is embedded in the main charge of the munitions. The combination of initiator, booster explosive and main charge explosive is called the detonation train. In this research the possibility of initiation of the booster by an intermediate flyer is investigated. This secondary flyer can be made of different materials, like aluminium, steel and polyester with different sizes. With the aid of the F-PVIS the acceleration of the secondary flyer is investigated. This reveals the influence of the thickness and density of the flyer on the acceleration and final velocity. Under certain circumstances the flyer breaks up in several parts and several velocities at the same time have been recorded.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This dissertation presents theoretical and experimental results from a research program that was aimed at finding practical ways of transferring energy to various loads, mainly from an inductive energy store fluxed by a primary store such as a capacitor bank. The main obj ecti ves of the work were to investigate and develop high power opening and closing switches, together with the transfer circuits needed to generate the fast (less than lOOns duration) high energy, pulses required in many applications. The study was to include a feasibility study {{of the use of}} the Plasma Erosion Opening Switch (PEOS) in such a system. To produce the large fast pulses required, an opening switch is required that: * Carry a current of the order of several kA during the inductor storage time. It should also be able to interrupt this current and to withstand the high voltage it will experience as the current is subsequently transferred to a load. * Conduct {{for as long as possible}} (up to one quarter period of the current waveform), to maximise the inductively stored energy which can be transferred to xhe load when the switch opens. * Open to an impedance that is large compared to the load impedance. This ensures that most of the inductively stored energy is transferred to the load. Open sufficiently rapidly to produce the required sharp pulse of voltage. In pulsed-power applications, energy is usually supplied from slow and relatively inexpensive power sources such as a capacitor bank, or an explosive flux-compression generator, which deliver large quantities of energy in the lO-lOO time range. Although no single switch is currently available which has such a long conduction time, together with a nanosecond opening time, the PEOS is a potential candidate. To overcome its short conduction time, while still obtaining an opening time of less than lOOns, the PEOS is used together with an additional slower stage or stages of switching. The key to this method is that each successive switching stage produces a considerably increased voltage. Various different types of switch were investigated and these are described in the thesis. Particular consideration is paid to the performance of the PEOS, as the final conditioning stage. <b>Exploding</b> <b>foils</b> are also investigated, together with a novel Automatic <b>Exploding</b> <b>Foil</b> Change-Over Switch, since an <b>exploding</b> <b>foil</b> opening switch is needed to condition the output of the capacitor bank before the PEOS. The initial resistance of the PEOS is very low, and the change-over switch is required to ensure that the current transfer takes place when the voltage across the fuse approaches its peak value. An important part of the investigation was to develop a mathematical model of the PEOS, as a part of the power condi tioning circuit, in order to simulate the system for different load conditions. The thesis explains the design, operation and performance characteristics of the various pulsed-power components, such as capacitor banks, closing and opening switches, pulse transformer, the vacuum system required for a PEOS, and high voltage and current measurement techniques...|$|R

To date, the quality of the electron beams produced with the widely used scheme employing a gas-jet system and a single femtoscond laser pulse is very poor, the energy spread being of the order of 100 % and the angular divergence usually exceeding several degrees. The Intense Laser Irradiation Laboratory (ILIL, IPCF-CNR) in Pisa, Italy, is currently deeply involved, both on the experimental and theoretical sides, in studies devoted to increase the beam quality of the LWFA produced electron beams. Here we report on the two parallel activities of ILIL in this field. The first achieved its main results started with an experiment held at the LOA facility, based on LWFA in preformed plasmas obtained with the <b>exploding</b> <b>foils</b> technique and demonstrating the production of a relativistic electron bunch with a record value of angular divergence (less than one degree) but still with a large energy spread. The second activity is presently at the theoretical/numerical stage and is aimed to produce electron bunches with both small transverse and longitudinal emittances by taking advantage of the partial nonlinear, longitudinal wave-breaking of the Langmuir wave behind the pulse crossing a sharp density downramp. In this way {{a large amount of}} electrons can be injected in a controlled way in the accelerating region of the wake. PIC simulations (3 D in the fields and 2 D in the coordinates) demonstrate that, once concurring trappin...|$|R
