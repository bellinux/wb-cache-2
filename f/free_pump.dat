40|$|For {{particle}} free vacuum systems, as e. g. systems containing superconducting cavities to {{be operated}} at high gradients, special care {{needs to be taken}} during pump down and venting. Neither should be particles introduced into the vacuum system, nor should particles already present within the system be moved. A series of measurements to study the movement of particles in long tubes during pump down and venting using an in-situ vacuum particle counter has been performed. Based on these measurements a set-up using flow controllers, diffuser and pressure gauges has been developed to avoid introducing particles into the vacuum system as well as moving existing particles during pump down and venting. This set-up can be operated manually as well as via a control unit. The electronics unit is an in-house development at DESY. It is usually connected to an oil <b>free</b> <b>pump</b> station.

In this case study, an attempt has been made to optimize the production of grey cast pump adapter castings using Box- Behnken design of experiments (DOE) approach in a foundry producing grey cast iron components. Process parameters like Clay percentage, Moisture percentage and Mold hardness were found to be dominant factors to control during the production process. Three different levels of each factor were considered for experimentation using BBD. Experimental trials were conducted using the design matrix and response in each experiment was measured and the results were tabulated.

40|$|AbstractThe {{peristaltic}} {{flow analysis}} in a tapered asymmetric channel {{has been made}} for a Johnson–Segalman fluid.

Two-dimensional equations of a Johnson–Segalman fluid have been simplified by treating a long wavelength and low Reynolds number approximations. The reduced equations are then solved for the stream function, axial velocity and axial pressure gradient using a regular perturbation technique. The expressions for the pressure rise, axial velocity and stream function are sketched and the reasons for the variations observed in various physical parameters are interpreted with valid theory.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was {{to better understand the}} patterns of IV-pump use throughout the hospital in order to provide guidance to the hospital on alternative pump management methods. In the current system, when the number of available pumps in a department was fewer than the number of pumps required for patient care, the department encountered shortage. In most cases, the personnel were not clear on where available pumps might be stored and had to search for <b>free</b> <b>pumps</b> throughout the hospital. The system was thoroughly studied and the necessary data were collected. A model reflecting the current flow of patients and pumps was developed. This model was operationalized by constructing a simulation model. The model presented the flow through the hospital on a daily basis. The output of the simulation model provided the daily number of pumps in use in each of the departments and the distribution of pump use for each department, separately, and overall. Using these distributions, the number of pumps required in each department if maintaining a supply of pumps was quantified to meet certain service levels. In addition, the number of pumps required in the system if the pumps were all shared, was also obtained. It was concluded that the actual number of pumps required in the system is fewer than the number of pumps existing in the hospital. This conclusion confirmed that long searches for <b>free</b> <b>pumps</b> were not due to insufficient quantity of pumps, but were solely due to the behaviour of hoarding extra pumps when available. The simulation also provided the number of pumps short per day and the number of pumps in excess per day, by department. Two pump management alternatives were suggested to the hospital. The first alternative was to utilize a centralized pool to keep all shared pumps when not in use. The second alternative was to install RFID technology throughout the hospital and equip all pumps with RFID tags so that they could be easily located.

In {{order to reduce}} the mixing lengths, advective flow can be induced by varying the channel geometry.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study of}} microvascular non-Newtonian blood flow is conducted incorporating the electro-osmosis phenomenon. Blood is {{considered as a}} Bingham rheological aqueous ionic solution. An externally applied static axial electrical field is imposed on the system. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for electrical potential distribution is implemented to accommodate the electrical double layer (EDL) in the microvascular regime. With long wavelength, lubrication and Debye-Hückel approximations, the boundary value problem is rendered non-dimensional. Analytical solutions are derived for the axial velocity, volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient, volumetric flow rate, averaged volumetric flow rate along one time-period, pressure rise along one wavelength and stream function. A plug width is featured in the solutions. Via symbolic software (MathematicaTM), graphical plots are generated for the influence of Bingham plug flow width parameter, electrical Debye length (thickness) and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity (maximum electro-osmotic velocity) on the key hydrodynamic variables. An increase in plug flow width is observed to accelerate the axial flow, enhance volumetric flow rate and has a varied influence on the pressure rise {{depending on whether the}} flow is in the <b>free</b> <b>pumping</b> or pumping region.

The slip boundary conditions given by Beavers-Joseph and Saffman type are considered in obtaining {{solutions for the}} flow and resulting pumping characteristics are compared. Trapping and reflux phenomena are discussed for various parameters of interest governing the flow like Da Darcy number, alpha Beavers-Joseph constant and n the fluid behavior index. The novel feature arising in pumping due to a straight section dominated (SSD) wave form other than sinusoidal wave is discussed. The time mean flow becomes negative in <b>free</b> <b>pumping</b> for a shear thickening fluid or shear thinning fluid for an expansion or contraction SSD wave, respectively.
