The {{electrical}} characteristics and {{the reliability of}} different oxides on the 4 H-SiC Si-face for gate oxide application in MOS devices are compared under MOSFET operation conditions at room temperature, at 100 °C and at 130 °C. The oxides are either an 80 nm thick <b>deposited</b> <b>oxide</b> annealed in NO or an 80 nm thick grown oxide in diluted N 2 O. The <b>deposited</b> <b>oxide</b> shows significant higher QBD- and lower Dit-values {{as well as a}} stronger decrease of drain current under stress than the grown oxide. Although for the <b>deposited</b> <b>oxide,</b> the leakage current below subthreshold increases more than one order of magnitude during constant circuit stress at room temperature, for the thermal oxide it is quite constant, but at higher level for higher temperatures...|$|E

We also used the optical beam induced current method to represent the depleted zone at the surface around a reverse-biased device. We show that phenomena as the diameter-dependent current for low reverse and forward biases, the specific value for the energy activation of current under low bias equal to 0. 65 eV, the reverse current-voltage characteristics evolution with time, or the anomalous spread of the depleted layer around a reverse-biased diode can be correlated {{with the presence of}} the <b>deposited</b> <b>oxide</b> as a passivation layer. A study of the current-time characteristic, obtained for a set reverse bias, is used to prove the presence of charges in the oxide and interface states responsible for an eventual inversion channel along the mesa.
