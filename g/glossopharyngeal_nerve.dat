5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve.</b> This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve</b> (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E
25|$|The <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve</b> innervates a {{third of}} the tongue {{including}} the circumvallate papillae. The facial nerve innervates the other two thirds of the tongue and the cheek via the chorda tympani.|$|E

40|$|The {{case of a}} 20 -year-old {{woman with}} a carotid body tumor of Shamblin class III is reported. Ten hours after {{preoperative}} direct intralesional embolization with 20 mL Onyx (ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer; Micro Therapeutics, Irvine, Calif), the patient showed symptoms of Horner syndrome and deficits of the hypoglossal and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves.</b> Intraoperative examination 12 hours after Onyx embolization revealed a massive swelling of the hypoglossal and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves.</b> The patient's tongue motility and glossopharyngeal function improved after surgery, but Horner syndrome was still present. Owing to the delayed occurrence of these adverse effects, the optimal time of surgical intervention after Onyx embolization should be discussed and perhaps expedited...|$|R
50|$|Below the {{inferior}} fovea, {{and between the}} trigonum hypoglossi and {{the lower part of}} the area acustica is a triangular dark field, the vagal trigone, which corresponds to the sensory nucleus of the vagus and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
25|$|Parasympathetic {{innervation}} to the {{salivary glands}} is carried via cranial nerves. The parotid gland receives its parasympathetic {{input from the}} <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve</b> (CN IX) via the otic ganglion, while the submandibular and sublingual glands receive their parasympathetic input from the facial nerve (CN VII) via the submandibular ganglion. These nerves release acetylcholine and substance P, which activate the IP3 and DAG pathways respectively.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{the sense}} of taste is {{conveyed}} via three of the twelve cranial nerves. The chorda tympani is responsible for taste sensations from the anterior {{two thirds of the}} tongue, the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve</b> (IX) is responsible for taste sensations from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the vagus nerve (X) carries some taste sensations {{from the back of the}} oral cavity.|$|E
25|$|All sensory {{information}} from the face, both touch-position and pain-temperature, {{is sent to the}} trigeminal nucleus. In classical anatomy most {{sensory information}} from the face is carried by the fifth nerve, but sensation from parts of the mouth, parts of the ear and parts of the meninges is carried by general somatic afferent fibers in cranial nerves VII (the facial nerve), IX (the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve)</b> and X (the vagus nerve).|$|E
50|$|The tensor veli palatini is {{innervated by}} the medial pterygoid nerve, {{a branch of}} mandibular nerve, the third branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3) - the only muscle of the palate not innervated by the {{pharyngeal}} plexus, which is formed by the vagal and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
5|$|Taste is {{generated}} from receptors {{on the tongue}} and passed along the facial and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves</b> into the solitary tract in the brainstem. Some taste information is also passed from the pharynx into this area via the vagus nerve. Information is then passed from here through the thalamus into the gustatory cortex.|$|R

25|$|The <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve</b> (CN IX) sends fibers to {{the upper}} {{epiglottis}} {{that contribute to the}} afferent limb of the gag reflex. (The gag reflex is variable in people from a limited to a hypersensitive response.) The superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve (CN X) sends fibers to the lower epiglottis that contribute to the efferent limb of the cough reflex. This initiates an attempt to try to dislodge the food or liquid from the windpipe.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} sulcus is {{a shallow}} groove that runs forward as a shallow groove in a V shape from the foramen cecum, forwards and outwards to the margins (borders) of the tongue. The terminal sulcus divides the tongue into a posterior pharyngeal part and an anterior oral part. The pharyngeal part is {{supplied by the}} <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve</b> and the oral part is suppled by the lingual nerve (a branch of the mandibular branch (V3) of the trigeminal nerve) for somatosensory perception and by the chorda tympani (a branch of the facial nerve) for taste perception.|$|E
25|$|Xerostomia, {{also known}} as dry mouth syndrome, can {{precipitate}} dysgeusia because normal salivary flow and concentration are necessary for taste. Injury to the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve</b> can result in dysgeusia. In addition, damage done to the pons, thalamus, and midbrain, all of which compose the gustatory pathway, can be potential factors. In a case study, 22% of patients who were experiencing a bladder obstruction were also suffering from dysgeusia. Dysgeusia was eliminated in 100% of these patients once the obstruction was removed. Although it is uncertain what the relationship between bladder relief and dysgeusia entails, {{it has been observed}} that the areas responsible for urinary system and taste in the pons and cerebral cortex in the brain are close in proximity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vascular}} {{supply to}} the laryngopharynx includes the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery. The primary neural supply is from both the vagus and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves.</b> The vagus nerve provides a branch termed [...] "Arnolds Nerve" [...] which also supplies the external auditory canal, thus laryngopharyngeal cancer can result in referred otalgia. This nerve is also responsible for the ear-cough reflex in which stimulation of the ear canal results in a person coughing.|$|R
50|$|Avellis {{syndrome}} is a neurological disorder {{characterized by a}} peculiar form of alternating paralysis. There is paralysis of the soft palate and vocal cords {{on one side and}} loss of pain sensation and temperature sense on the other side, including the extremities, trunk, and neck. It usually results from occlusion of the vertebral artery in lesions of the nucleus ambiguous and pyramidal tract. Horner's syndrome may be associated. In the original description, the vagus and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves</b> were involved; concomitant involvement of the neighbouring cranial nerves was observed later.|$|R
5000|$|The {{response}} to stimulation of chemoreceptors {{on the heart}} rate is complicated. Chemoreceptors in the heart or nearby large arteries as well as chemoreceptors in the lungs can affect heart rate. Activation of these peripheral chemoreceptors from sensing decreased O2, increased CO2 and a decreased pH is relayed to cardiac centers by the vagus and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves</b> to the medulla of the brainstem. This increases the sympathetic nervous stimulation on the heart and a corresponding increase in heart rate and contractility in most cases. [...] These factors include activation of stretch receptors due to increased ventilation {{and the release of}} circulating catecholamines.|$|R
25|$|Abnormalities of the {{cranial nerves}} are present 50-70% of cases. The most common {{abnormality}} is {{involvement of the}} facial nerve, which may lead to reduced power on one or {{both sides of the}} face (65% resp 35% of all cranial nerve cases), followed by reduction in visual perception due to optic nerve involvement. Rarer symptoms are double vision (oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve or abducens nerve), decreased sensation of the face (trigeminal nerve), hearing loss or vertigo (vestibulocochlear nerve), swallowing problems (<b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve)</b> and weakness of the shoulder muscles (accessory nerve) or the tongue (hypoglossal nerve). Visual problems may also be the result of papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) due to obstruction by granulomas of the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{relatively}} superficial at its start, {{where it is}} contained in the carotid triangle of the neck, and lies behind and medial to the external carotid, overlapped by the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and covered by the deep fascia, the platysma, and integument: it then passes beneath the parotid gland, being crossed by the hypoglossal nerve, the digastric muscle and the stylohyoid muscle, the occipital artery and the posterior auricular artery. Higher up, it is separated from the external carotid by the styloglossus and stylopharyngeus muscles, {{the tip of the}} styloid process and the stylohyoid ligament, the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve</b> and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve. It is in relation, behind, with the longus capitis, the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk, and the superior laryngeal nerve; laterally, with the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve, the nerve lying on a plane posterior to the artery; medially, with the pharynx, superior laryngeal nerve, and ascending pharyngeal artery. At the base of the skull the glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory, and hypoglossal nerves lie between the artery and the internal jugular vein.|$|E
500|$|The <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve</b> (IX) innervates the stylopharyngeus {{muscle and}} {{provides}} sensory innervation to the oropharynx {{and back of}} the tongue. [...] The <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve</b> also provides parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland. Unilateral absence of a gag reflex suggests a lesion of the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve</b> (IX), and perhaps the vagus nerve (X).|$|E
40|$|Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) is a sensory {{disorder}} {{which results}} in constant, bilateral burning pain of the tongue, lips, and other oral mucous membranes. Atypical odontalgia (AO) is another sensory disorder, usually defined as a toothache-like pain for which no dental cause can be identified. Previous literature has suggested that AO {{is often associated with}} a concomitant temporomandibular disorder (TMD). This hypothesis paper explores the possibility that BMS, AO and TMD can be related through hyperactivity of both the sensory and motor components of the trigeminal nerve following loss of central inhibition as a result of taste damage in the chorda tympani and/or the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{sense of}} smell is {{generated}} by receptor cells in the epithelium of the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity. This information passes through a relatively permeable part of the skull to the olfactory nerve. This nerve transmits to the neural circuitry of the olfactory bulb from where information is passed to the olfactory cortex.Taste is generated from receptors on the tongue and passed along the facial and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves</b> into the solitary tract in the brainstem.

500|$|Most typically, {{humans are}} {{considered}} to have twelve pairs of cranial nerves (I–XII). They are: the olfactory nerve (I), the optic nerve (II), oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV), trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII), vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve</b> (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI), and hypoglossal nerve (XII). (There may be a thirteenth cranial nerve, the terminal nerve (nerve O or N), which is very small and {{may or may not}} be functional in humans) ...|$|E
5000|$|The chorda tympani nerve carries its {{information}} to {{the nucleus of the}} solitary tract, and shares this area with the greater superficial petrosal and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves.</b> When the greater superficial petrosal and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves</b> are cut, regardless of age, the chorda tympani nerve takes over the space in the terminal field. This takeover of space by the chorda tympani {{is believed to be the}} nerve reverting to its original state before competition and pruning. The chorda tympani, as part of the peripheral nervous system, is not as plastic in early ages. In a study done by Hosley et al. and a study done by Sollars, it has been shown that when the nerve is cut at a young age, the related taste buds are not likely to grow back to full strength. [...] In a bilateral transection of the chorda tympani in mice, the preference for sodium chloride increases compared to before the transection. Also avoidance of higher concentrations of sodium chloride is eliminated. The amiloride-sensitive channels responsible for salt recognition and response is functional in adult rats but not neonatal rats. This explains part of the change in preference of sodium chloride after a chorda tympani transection.The chorda tympani innervates the fungiform papillae on the tongue. According to a study done by Sollars et al. in 2002, when the chorda tympani has been transected early in postnatal development some of the fungiform papillae undergo a structural change to become more “filliform-like”. [...] When some of the other papillae grow back, they do so without a pore.|$|R
5000|$|The TAS1R2+TAS1R3 {{heterodimer}} receptor {{functions as}} the sweet receptor by binding {{to a wide}} variety of sugars and sugar substitutes.

[...] These cells are shown to synapse upon the chorda tympani and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves</b> to send their signals to the brain. The TAS1R3 homodimer also functions as a sweet receptor in much the same way as TAS1R2+3 but has decreased sensitivity to sweet substances. Natural sugars are more easily detected by the TAS1R3 receptor than sugar substitutes. This may help explain why sugar and artificial sweeteners have different tastes.|$|R

500|$|A {{cranial nerve}} exam begins with {{observation}} of the patient because some cranial nerve lesions may affect the symmetry of the eyes or face. [...] The visual fields are tested for nerve lesions or nystagmus via an analysis of specific eye movements. The sensation of the face is tested, and patients are asked to perform different facial movements, such as puffing out of the cheeks. Hearing is checked by voice and tuning forks. The position of the patient's uvula is examined because asymmetry in the position could indicate a lesion of the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve.</b> [...] After {{the ability of the}} patient to use their shoulder to assess the accessory nerve (XI), and the patient's tongue function is assessed by observing various tongue movements.|$|E
500|$|The cell {{bodies of}} many of the neurons of most of the cranial nerves are {{contained}} in one or more nuclei in the brainstem. [...] These nuclei are important relative to cranial nerve dysfunction because damage to these nuclei such as from a stroke or trauma can mimic damage to one or more branches of a cranial nerve. [...] In terms of specific cranial nerve nuclei, the midbrain of the brainstem has the nuclei of the oculomotor nerve (III) and trochlear nerve (IV); the pons has the nuclei of the trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII); and the medulla has the nuclei of the <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerve</b> (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI) and hypoglossal nerve (XII).

40|$|Pseudorabies {{virus was}} inoculated intratracheally into sheep to {{investigate}} the pathogenesis of pseudorabies virus infection. Clinical signs of pyrexia, depression, frequent swallowing, facial fasciculations, chorea, excessive salivation, mild tympanites, labored breathing and focal pruritus were followed by death Macroscopic lesions were severe focal facial trauma, petechiae in cervicothoracic ganglia and dilated esophaguses. The medulla oblongata and the trigeminal, cranial cervical, cervicothoracic and parabronchial ganglia contained pseudorabies virus and pronounced nonsuppurative inflammatory changes. The neural distribution of lesions and virus suggests that the virus travelled from the respiratory mucosa to the central and sympathetic nervous system by two routes: 1) in the vagus and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves</b> to the medulla oblongata and 2) in the postganglionic fibers to the sympathetic ganglia. The presence of virus in the nasal mucus indicated that horizontal transmission of pseudorabies virus may occur among sheep...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{molecules}} of the collapsin/semaphorin gene family have been thought {{to play an}} essential role in axon guidance during development. Semaphorin III/D is a member of this family, has been shown to repel dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons in vitro, and has been implicated in the patterning of sensory afferents in the spinal cord. Although semaphorin III/D mRNA is expressed {{in a wide variety of}} neural and nonneural tissues in vivo, the role played by semaphorin III/D in regions other than the spinal cord is not known. Here, we show that mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in semaphorin III/D show severe abnormality in peripheral nerve projection. This abnormality is seen in the trigeminal, facial, vagus, accessory, and <b>glossopharyngeal</b> <b>nerves</b> but not in the oculomotor nerve. These results suggest that semaphorin III/D functions as a selective repellent in vivo...|$|R
