25|$|The new {{cellular}} resident {{quickly became}} an advantage, providing {{food for the}} <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>host,</b> which allowed it to live within it. Over time, the cyanobacterium was assimilated, {{and many of its}} genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host. From genomes that probably originally contained over 3000 genes only about 130 genes remain in the chloroplasts of contemporary plants. Some of its proteins were then synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and imported back into the chloroplast (formerly the cyanobacterium). Separately, somewhere around 100 million years ago, it happened again and led to the amoeboid Paulinella chromatophora.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{no obvious}} amino acid {{sequence}} similarity from pathogen to host factors, structural studies have revealed that mimicry can still occur at the host level. In some cases, pathogenic mimics can possess a structural architecture that differs markedly {{from that of the}} functional homologues. Therefore, proteins of dissimilar sequence may have a common structure which elicits an autoimmune response. It has been hypothesized that these virulent proteins display their mimicry through molecular surfaces that mimic host protein surfaces (protein fold or three-dimensional conformation), which have been obtained by convergent evolution. It has also been theorized that these similar protein folds have been obtained by horizontal gene transfer, most likely from a <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>host.</b> This further supports the theory that microbial organisms have evolved a mechanism of concealment similar to that of higher organisms such as the African praying mantis or chameleon who camouflage themselves so that they can mimic their background as not to be recognized by others.|$|E

40|$|International audienceProkaryote-eukaryote {{interactions}} are primordial, but host selection of its bacterial community remains poorly understood. Because eukaryote evolution affects numerous traits shaping {{the ecology of}} their microbiome, we can expect that many evolutionary changes in the former will {{have the potential to}} impact on the composition of the latter. Consequently, the more phylogenetically distant the <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>hosts,</b> the more distinct their associated bacterial communities should be. We tested this with plants, by comparing the bacterial communities associated with maize genotypes or other Poaceae. 16 S rRNA taxonomic microarray analysis showed that the genetic distance between rhizobacterial communities correlated significantly with the phylogenetic distance (derived from chloroplastic sequences) between Poaceae genotypes. This correlation was also significant when considering specific bacterial populations from all main bacterial divisions, instead of the whole rhizobacterial community.

50|$|Metaviridae are {{a family}} of viruses which exist as retrotransposons in a <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>host’s</b> genome.

50|$|Vesicular {{exocytosis}} in prokaryote {{gram negative}} bacteria {{is a third}} mechanism and latest finding in exocytosis. The periplasm is pinched off as bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) for translocating microbial biochemical signals into <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>host</b> cells or other microbes located nearby, accomplishing control of the secreting microbe on its environment - including invasion of host, endotoxemia, competing with other microbes for nutrition, etc. This finding of membrane vesicle trafficking occurring at the host-pathogen interface also dispels the myth that exocytosis is purely a eukaryotic cell phenomenon.|$|E
40|$|Several {{features}} of the biology of mitochondria suggest that mitochondria might be susceptible to Muller’s ratchet {{and other forms of}} evolutionary degradation: Mitochondria have predominantly uniparental inheritance, appear to be nonrecombining, and have high mutation rates producing significant deleterious variation. We demonstrate that the persistence of mitochondria may be explained by recent data that point to a severe “bottleneck” in the number of mitochondria passing through the germline in humans and other mammals. We present a population-genetic model in which deleterious mutations arise within individual mitochondria, while selection operates on assemblages of mitochondria at the level of their <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>hosts.</b> We show that a bottleneck increases the efficacy of selection against deleterious mutations by increasing the variance in fitness among <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>hosts.</b> We investigate both the equilibrium distribution of deleterious variation in large populations and the dynamics of Muller’s ratchet in small populations. We find that {{in the absence of the}} ratchet, a bottleneck leads to improved mitochondrial performance and that, over a longer time scale, a bottleneck acts to slow the progression of the ratchet. ...|$|R

50|$|Through a {{comprehensive}} phylogenetic analysis, researchers proposed {{that among the}} 11 DGAT-2s, one gene might originate from the red algae related secondary endosymbiont, four from green algae related endosymbiont, and the other six from the <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>host</b> genome. In addition, a large proportion (15.3%) of TAG biosynthesis related genes were acquired by Nannochloropsis via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from bacteria. Therefore, multiple genome pooling and horizontal genetic exchange, together with selective inheritance of lipid synthesis genes and species-specific gene loss, {{have led to the}} enormous genetic apparatus for oleaginousness and the wide genomic divergence among present-day Nannochloropsis spp.|$|E
50|$|Rickettsia is a genus of nonmotile, gram-negative, nonspore-forming, highly pleomorphic {{bacteria}} {{that can be}} present as cocci (0.1 μm in diameter), rods (1-4 μm long), or thread-like (10 μm long). The term rickettsia, named after Howard Taylor Ricketts, is often used interchangeably for {{any member of the}} Rickettsiales. Being obligate intracellular parasites, the Rickettsia survival depends on entry, growth, and replication within the cytoplasm of <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>host</b> cells (typically endothelial cells). Rickettsia cannot live in artificial nutrient environments and is grown either in tissue or embryo cultures; typically, chicken embryos are used: a method developed by Ernest William Goodpasture and his colleagues at Vanderbilt University in the early 1930s.|$|E
50|$|CyanoBase: Cyanobacteria carry a {{complete}} set of genes for oxygenic photosynthesis, which is the most fundamental life process on Earth. This organism is also interesting from an evolutionary viewpoint, for it arose in a very ancient age and has survived in various environments. The algal and land plant chloroplast evolved from cyanobacterial ancestors which developed an endosymbiontic relationship with a <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>host</b> cell. CyanoBase provides an easy way of accessing the sequences and all-inclusive annotation data on the structures of the cyanobacterial genomes. This database was originally developed by Makoto Hirosawa, Takakazu Kaneko and Satoshi Tabata, and the current version of CyanoBase has been developed and maintained by Yasukazu Nakamura, Takakazu Kaneko, and Satoshi Tabata at Kazusa DNA Research Institute.|$|E

40|$|SummaryDuring {{the course}} of the {{evolution}} of endosymbiotic organelles, mitochondria and plastids, numerous genes were transferred from ancestral organelles and other bacteria to the host genome. This process required, firstly, incorporating DNA fragments encoding intact genes into the host genome, secondly, acquiring the expression signals such as eukaryotic promoters and regulatory elements that enable their transcription in <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>hosts,</b> and thirdly, in many cases, evolving a dedicated targeting system to transport and import their protein products into the endosymbiotic organelles [1]. The advent of this protein-targeting machinery is commonly assumed to be the most crucial step, at which point an endosymbiont becomes an organelle [2, 3]. Bacterial lineages have repeatedly evolved intimate symbioses with <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>hosts,</b> but the establishment of the protein translocation system has been shown only in the cases of bona fide organelles and the photosynthetic symbiosis in a cercozoan amoeba [3]. Here, we report that an aphid gene that was horizontally acquired from a bacterium produces protein, which is transported to an obligate intracellular bacterial symbiont. To our knowledge, this is the first report of integration between multicellular eukaryotes and bacteria to the extent of ‘organellogenesis’...|$|R

Indeed, many species of obligate intracellular bacteria represent pathogens capable of significant negative impact on worldwide human health. This link to human disease and the fascinating infection biology exhibited by these parasites render them exquisite subjects for investigation. Despit...|$|R
5000|$|Specific {{pathogens}} {{possess a}} wide array of virulence factors. Some are chromosomally encoded and intrinsic to the bacteria (e.g. capsules and endotoxin), whereas others are obtained from mobile genetic elements like plasmids and bacteriophages (e.g. some exotoxins). Virulence factors encoded on mobile genetic elements spread through horizontal gene transfer, and can convert harmless bacteria into dangerous pathogens. Bacteria like Escherichia coli O157:H7 gain the majority of their virulence from mobile genetic elements. Gram-negative bacteria secrete a variety of virulence factors at host-pathogen interface, via membrane vesicle trafficking as bacterial outer membrane vesicles for invasion, nutrition and other cell-cell communications. It has been found that many pathogens have converged on similar virulence factors to battle against <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>host</b> defenses. These obtained bacterial virulence factors have two different routes used to help them survive and grow: ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{homologous}} to conjugation {{machinery of}} bacteria. It {{is capable of}} transporting both DNA and proteins. It was discovered in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which uses this system to introduce the T-DNA portion of the Ti plasmid into the plant host, which in turn causes the affected area to develop into a crown gall (tumor). Helicobacter pylori uses a type IV secretion system to deliver CagA into gastric epithelial cells, which is associated with gastric carcinogenesis. Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, secretes the pertussis toxin partly through the type IV system. Legionella pneumophila, the causing agent of legionellosis (Legionnaires' disease) utilizes a type IVB secretion system, known as the icm/dot (intracellular multiplication / defect in organelle trafficking genes) system, to translocate numerous effector proteins into its <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>host.</b> The prototypic Type IVA secretion system is the VirB complex of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.|$|E
50|$|The infective form of microsporidia (E. cuniculi) is a {{resistant}} spore {{which can}} survive {{for a long}} time in the environment. The spore extrudes its polar tubule and infects the host cell. The spore injects the infective sporoplasm into the <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>host</b> cell through the polar tubule. Inside the cell, the sporoplasm undergoes extensive multiplication. This multiplication occurs either by merogony (binary fission) or schizogony (multiple fission). Microsporidia develop by sporogony to mature spores in the cytoplasm or inside parasitophorous vacule. During sporogony, a thick wall is formed around the spore. The thick wall formed provides resistance to adverse environmental conditions. Once the spores increase in number and completely fill the cytoplasm of the host's cell, the cell membrane is disrupted and releases the spores to the surroundings. These free mature spores can infect new cells thus continuing the cycle.|$|E
