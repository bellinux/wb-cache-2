5|$|Echmarcach's hold on Dublin was {{short-lived}} as the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach records that Ímar replaced him as King of Dublin in 1038. This annal-entry {{has been interpreted}} to indicate that Ímar drove Echmarcach from the kingship. There is reason to suspect that Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065) extended his presence into the Isles and the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> region at about this period. The evidence of Þórfinnr's power in the Isles could suggest that he possessed an active interest in the ongoing struggle over the Dublin kingship. In fact, Þórfinnr's predatory operations in the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> region {{may have contributed to}} Echmarcach's loss of Dublin in 1038.|$|E

5|$|The {{catalyst}} for this Norwegian intervention {{may have been}} the extension of Muirchertach's influence into the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> region following the death of Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles (died 1095). The region itself appears to have degenerated into chaos following Gofraid's demise, and Magnús seems to have taken it upon himself to reassert Norwegian authority. Magnús made two expeditions into the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> region. One arrived in 1098; the other in 1102. The focus of the second overseas operation appears to have been Ireland itself. Following an apparent Norwegian conquest of Dublin, Magnús and Muirchertach negotiated a peace agreement, sealed through the marriage of Magnús' son, Sigurðr (died 1130), and Bjaðmunjo herself.|$|E

5|$|Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065) was a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} eleventh-century <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> region. At his height, he reigned as king over Dublin, the Isles, and perhaps the Rhinns of Galloway. The precise identity of Echmarcach's father, Ragnall, is uncertain. One possibility is {{that this man was}} one of two eleventh-century rulers of Waterford. Another possibility is that Echmarcach's father was an early eleventh-century ruler of the Isles. If any of these identifications are correct, Echmarcach may have {{been a member of the}} Uí Ímair kindred.|$|E
5|$|In Ireland, Flann Sinna, {{married to}} Constantine's aunt Máel Muire, was dominant. The years around 900 {{represented}} {{a period of}} weakness among the Vikings and Norse-Gaels of Dublin.

In 894 one group left Dublin, perhaps settling on the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> coast of Britain between the River Mersey and the Firth of Clyde. The remaining Dubliners were expelled in 902 by Flann Sinna's son-in-law Cerball mac Muirecáin, and soon afterwards appeared in western and northern Britain.|$|E

50|$|The {{assimilation}} of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered {{the aspirations of}} Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so chattel slavery diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and <b>Irish</b> <b>Seas</b> diminished markedly.|$|R
5|$|Offshore oil and {{gas from}} North Sea and <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea,</b> and more {{recently}} offshore wind, are significant components in Northern England's energy mix.
