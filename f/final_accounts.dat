Let them look at his place upon the poll. There had been a time in the day when twenty votes this way or that might be necessary to Sir Thomas. He had been told that it was so. On the day of the election his own position on the poll had been so certain to him, that he should not have cared,--that is, for himself,--had he heard that Glump was buying votes against him. He considered it to be quite out of the question that Glump should have bought votes for him,--with any purpose of serving him. And so Mr. Griffenbottom escaped from the adverse counsel and from the judge.|$|E

40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} and then evaluate perceived risk factors influencing variability between contract sum and final count, and to develop a fuzzy risk assessment model for evaluating the overall impact of established critical risk factors impacting on variability between contract sum and <b>final</b> <b>account</b> in government-funded construction projects. Construction projects are characterised by risk factors that significantly impact on variability between the contract sum and <b>final</b> <b>account.</b> Design/methodology/approach– A research approach integrating questionnaire survey, mean scoring ranking and principal component factor analysis (PCFA) methods was adopted to evaluate and classify the critical risk factors. A fuzzy synthetic evaluation method was sequentially applied to compute the overall risk impact (ORI) of eight critical risk factors’ impact on variability between contract sum and <b>final</b> <b>account.</b> Findings– Initial results showed that eight critical risk factors have high impact on variations between contract sum and <b>final</b> <b>account,</b> namely (in order) : project funding problems, underestimation of quantities, variations by client, change in scope of works, inadequate specification, change in design by client, defects in design and unexpected site (ground) conditions. PCFA produced two factor solutions: “professional-related factors” and “client factors”. The fuzzy model further showed that the ORI is 5. 48, indicating that these risk factors have a high impact on variability between contract sum and <b>final</b> <b>account</b> in public construction projects. The client factors have a very high impact (5. 59), while the professional-related factors indicated a high impact (5. 41) on project cost variability. Originality/value– A practical model is proposed to evaluate the key risks associated with cost overruns in public projects. By giving effective and sustained attention to these factors, variability between contract sum and <b>final</b> <b>account,</b> a common situation in Ghana, can be controlled to achieve cost savings in public infrastructure projects.

60|$|Lady Eustace did {{not leave}} the house during the Saturday and Sunday, and engaged herself {{exclusively}} with preparing for her journey. She had no further interview with Mrs. Carbuncle, but there were messages between them, and even notes were written. They resulted in nothing. Lizzie was desirous of getting back the spoons and forks, and, if possible, some of her money. The spoons and forks were out of Mrs. Carbuncle's power,--in Albemarle Street; and the money had of course been spent. Lizzie might have saved herself the trouble, {{had it not been}} that it was a pleasure to her to insult her late friend, even though in doing so new insults were heaped upon her own head. As for the trumpery spoons, they,--so said Mrs. Carbuncle,--were the property of Miss Roanoke, having been made over to her unconditionally long before the wedding, {{as a part of a}} separate pecuniary transaction. Mrs. Carbuncle had no power of disposing of Miss Roanoke's property. As to the money which Lady Eustace claimed, Mrs. Carbuncle asserted that, when the <b>final</b> <b>accounts</b> should be made up between them, it would be found that there was a considerable balance due to Mrs. Carbuncle. But even were there anything due to Lady Eustace, Mrs. Carbuncle would decline to pay it, as she was informed that all moneys possessed by Lady Eustace were now confiscated to the Crown by reason of the PERJURIES,--the word was doubly scored in Mrs. Carbuncle's note,--which Lady Eustace had committed. This, of course, was unpleasant; but Mrs. Carbuncle did not have the honours of the battle all to herself. Lizzie also said some unpleasant things,--which, perhaps, were the more unpleasant because they were true. Mrs. Carbuncle had come pretty nearly to the end of her career, whereas Lizzie's income, in spite of her perjuries, was comparatively untouched. The undoubted mistress of Portray Castle, and mother of the Sir Florian Eustace of the day, could still despise and look down upon Mrs. Carbuncle, although she were known to have told fibs about the family diamonds.|$|E

40|$|The report Improved <b>final</b> <b>accounting</b> is {{produced}} in cooperation with Holmen Skog. The thesis comprises 15 credits at C level in the subject forest management. With a holding of 1. 3 million hectares Holmen Skog {{is one of the}} largest actors on the Swedish timber market. Besides felling in own forest holdings, Holmen Skog acquires about 11. 4 million (2014) m 3 wood from external sources. The large amount of external purchase of wood inevitably results in large amount of transactions that should be presented, what was the outcome from the final felling/thinning? Both economical and per square meter/assortments is supposed to be presented. The origin of this study comes from Holmen Skog´s striving to increase their wood supplier’s total satisfaction and experience after the finished deal. <b>Final</b> <b>accounting</b> after finished <b>final</b> felling and thinning has for a long time been an area with a great deal of opinions from both forest owners and Holmen employees. The purpose of this report is to clarify if there are any problems with the <b>final</b> <b>accounting</b> and if so, what can be done better or different. Through two surveys, one to forest owners and one to Holmen employees information was collected and complied. The frequency of response among forest owners was about 31 percent and within Holmen employees about 71 percent. In total this is equivalent to almost 500 unique answers. The results show that there are several areas where improvements are possible, for example the presentation of volumes, incomes and costs.
