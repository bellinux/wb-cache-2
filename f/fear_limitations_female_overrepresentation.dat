40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} trends in gender gaps in education, their causes and {{potential}} policy implications. I show that female educational attainment has surpassed, or {{is about to}} surpass, male educational attainment in most industrialized countries. These gaps reflect male overrepresentation among secondary school drop-outs and <b>female</b> <b>overrepresentation</b> among tertiary education students and graduates. Existing evidence suggests that this pattern {{is a result of}} a combination of increasing returns to education and lower female effort costs of education. Widening gender gap in education combined with recent wage and employment polarization will likely lead to widening inequalities and is linked to declining male labor force participation. The paper discusses evidence on educational policies that both widen and reduce gender gaps in educational outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) {{is caused}} by antibodies against a "self" protein-platelet factor 4 -bound to heparin. We observed an <b>overrepresentation</b> of the <b>female</b> gender in 290 patients who developed HIT after cardiac or orthopedic surgery compared with the representation found in national databases (study 1). Therefore, we investigated gender imbalance in HIT by logistic regression analysis of a randomized controlled trial of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (study 2), and we analyzed individual patient data from 7 prospective studies comparing HIT frequency between UFH and LMWH, evaluating effects of gender, heparin (UFH vs LMWH), and patient type (surgical vs medical) (study 3). All 3 studies showed <b>female</b> <b>overrepresentation,</b> which for study 3 was a common odds ratio (OR) of 2. 37 (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 1. 37 - 4. 09; P = 3 D. 0015). Study 3 also showed an interaction between gender, heparin, and patient type. Although UFH was more likely than LMWH to cause HIT (P <. 0001), this effect was predominantly seen in women compared with men (common OR, 9. 22 vs 1. 83; P = 3 D. 020) and in surgical patients compared with medical patients (common OR, 13. 93 vs 1. 75; P = 3 D. 005).

5000|$|The Finnish {{national}} quota law, {{introduced in}} 1995, mandates that among all indirectly elected public bodies (at both a national {{and a local}} level), neither sex in the governing body can be under 40%. The 1995 laws was a reformed version of a similar 1986 law. Unlike other countries' quota laws, which affect party structure or electoral candidate lists, the Finnish law addresses indirectly elected bodies (nominated by official authorities)—the law does not address popularly elected bodies. The Finnish law heavily emphasizes local municipal boards and other subnational institutions. From 1993 (pre-quota law) to 1997 (post-quota law), the proportion of women on municipal executive boards increased from 25% to 45%. The quota law also affected gender segregation in local governance: before {{the passage of the}} law, there had been a gender imbalance in terms of <b>female</b> <b>overrepresentation</b> in [...] "soft-sector" [...] boards (those concerned with health, education, etc.) and female [...] "underrepresentation" [...] in [...] "hard-sector" [...] boards (those concerned with economics and technology). In 1997, the boards were balanced horizontally. However, areas not subject to quota laws continue to be imbalanced. In 2003, it was determined that only 16% of the chairs of municipal executive boards are female—chair positions in this area are not quota-regulated. Presidential elections were held in Finland on 16 January 2000, with a second round on 6 February; the result was a victory for Tarja Halonen of the Social Democratic Party, who became the country's first female President.|$|R

40|$|Aim: This paper {{reports a}} study that {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} nurse researchers internationally disproportionately include females as participants in their research. Background: A bias toward predominantly male samples has been well-documented in medical research, but recently a gender bias favoring women in nursing research has been identified in studies published in four North American journals. Method: We extracted information about study samples and characteristics of the studies and authors from a consecutive sample of 834 studies published in eight leading Englishlanguage nursing research journals in 2005 - 2006. The primary analyses involved onesample t-tests that tested the null hypothesis that males and females are equally represented as participants in nursing studies. Studies from different countries, in different specialty areas, and with varying author and methodologic characteristics were compared with regard to the key outcome variable, percent of participants who were female. Results: Overall, 71 % of participants, on average, were female, including 68 % in clientfocused research and 83 % in nurse-focused studies (all p <. 001). Females were significantly overrepresented as participants in client-focused research in almost all specialty areas, particularly in mental health, community health, health promotion, and geriatrics. The bias favoring female participants in client-focused studies was especially strong in the United States and Canada, but was also present in European countries, most Asian countries, and in Australia. <b>Female</b> <b>overrepresentation</b> was persistent, regardless of methodological characteristics (e. g., qualitative versus quantitative), funding source, and most researcher characteristics (e. g., academic rank). Studies with male authors, however, had more sex-balanced samples. The mean percentage female in client-focused studies with a female lead author was 70. 0, compared to 52. 1 for male lead authors. Conclusion: Nurse researchers not only in North America but around the globe need to pay attention to who will benefit from their research and to whether they are adequately inclusive in studying client groups about which there are knowledge gaps.

40|$|Introduction: The {{potential}} role {{of genetic}} testing in families with an inherited pattern of melanoma {{is a complex}} issue, and yet limited data exist on perceptions of predictive genetic testing for mutations among individuals {{at high risk of}} melanoma. Methodology: Forty semi-structured interviews were undertaken with affected and unaffected individuals at either high or average risk of developing melanoma due to family history. Interviews addressed key issues such as: the role of genetics in causal attributions for melanoma; genetic testing intentions and motivations; perceived accuracy of genetic testing in predicting melanoma onset, and the impact of varied accuracy on testing intentions; views on the testing of children; perceived benefits and limitations of testing; and information needs and communication preferences. Results: In-depth thematic analysis revealed a number of important qualitative differences between groups at varying risk of melanoma, and genders. Specifically, participants with a family history of melanoma believed genetic factors {{play an important role in}} melanoma causation; conveyed strong intentions to pursue genetic testing; and viewed the benefits of genetic testing as outweighing the <b>limitations.</b> <b>Females</b> appeared to endorse the testing of children more firmly than males, and males` intentions to pursue testing appeared more contingent on penetrance than females`.

[...] 11 pages, 5 figuresPlanktonic copepods are a very successful group in marine pelagic environments, with {{a key role in}} biogeochemical cycles. Among them, the genus Oithona {{is one of the more}} abundant and ubiquitous. We report here on the effects of caloric (food) restriction on the ageing patterns of the copepod Oithona davisae. The response of O. davisae to caloric restriction was sex dependent: under food <b>limitation,</b> <b>females</b> have lower age-specific mortality rates and longer lifespans and reproductive periods; male mortality rates and life expectancy were not affected. Males are more active swimmers than females, and given their higher energetic demands presumably generate reactive oxygen species at higher rates. That was confirmed by starvation experiments, which showed that O. davisae males burn through body reserves much faster, resulting in shorter life expectancy. Compared with common, coastal calanoid copepods, the effects of caloric restriction on O. davisae appeared less prominent. We think this difference in the magnitude of the responses is a consequence of the distinct life-history traits associated with the genus Oithona (ambush feeder, egg-carrier), with much lower overall levels of metabolism and reproductive effortThis research was funded by projects CTM 2011 - 23480 and CGL 2014 - 59227 -R of the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (co-financed with FEDER funds, EU) Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|In many animals, {{females are}} fed by males during {{courtship}} or incubation (mate-feeding). According to the mate appraisal hypothesis, females may evaluate the parental capacity of males, whereas the pair bond hypothesis suggests that feeding may strengthen the pair bonds with them. Following the nutrition hypothesis, by contrast, females obtain direct nutritional benefits from being fed by males {{during periods of}} high-energy expenditure, such as egg formation and incubation. However, there is little support for these hypotheses at an interspecific level. We tested predictions from these hypotheses in a dataset of 170 species of passerine birds. As predicted by the nutrition hypothesis, we found that mate-feeding has evolved more often in species in which the female incubates and builds the nest alone and have noncarnivorous diets. This suggests that mate-feeding is a behavioral strategy that compensates for nutritional <b>limitations</b> of <b>females</b> during breeding, as both incubation and nest building are energetically costly processes, and noncarnivorous diets are deficient in proteins. We also found that incubation feeding has evolved more often in species that place nests at elevated sites, suggesting that these species face low predation risk that allows males to feed females. In the particular case of incubation feeding, we found that species that have evolved this behavior produce larger clutch size and have higher hatching success. Our results support the nutrition hypothesis from an interspecific perspective, suggesting that mate-feeding is a strategy to compensate for nutritional <b>limitations</b> of <b>females</b> during reproduction {{and that it has}} fitness consequences.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{risk factors}} associated with exacerbation frequency in primary care. Information on exacerbations of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) has mainly been generated by secondary care-based clinical cohorts. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Electronic medical records database (England and Wales). Participants: 58 589 patients with COPD aged ≥ 40 years with COPD diagnosis recorded between 1 April 2009 and 30 September 2012, and with at least 365 days of follow-up before and after the COPD diagnosis, were identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Mean age: 69 years; 47 % female; mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s 60 % predicted. Outcome measures: Data on moderate or severe exacerbation episodes defined by diagnosis and/or medication codes 12 months following cohort entry were retrieved, together with demographic and clinical characteristics. Associations between patient characteristics and odds of having none versus one, none versus frequent (≥ 2) and one versus frequent exacerbations over 12 months follow-up were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models. Results: During follow-up, 23 % of patients had evidence of frequent moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations (24 % one; 53 % none). Independent predictors of increased odds of having exacerbations during the follow-up, either frequent episodes or one episode, included prior exacerbations, increasing dyspnoea score, increasing grade of airflow <b>limitation,</b> <b>females</b> and prior or current history of several comorbidities (eg, asthma, depression, anxiety, heart failure and cancer).

40|$|Although {{there is}} {{widespread}} agreement {{that the cost of}} oviposition underlies selective oviposition in insects, there is no consensus regarding which factors mediate the cost of oviposition. Models have suggested that egg costs are often paramount in those insects that do not continue to mature eggs during the adult stage (pro-ovigenic insects). Here we address the hypothesis that egg costs are generally less significant in synovigenic insects, which can replenish oocyte supplies through continuous egg maturation. A dynamic optimization model based on the biology of a highly synovigenic parasitoid, Aphytis aonidiae, suggests that the maximum rate of egg maturation is insufficient to balance the depletion of eggs when opportunities to oviposit are abundant. Transient egg limitation therefore occurs, which imposes opportunity costs on reproducing females. Thus, whereas the most fundamental constraint acting on the lifetime reproductive success of pro-ovigenic species is the fixed total number of eggs that they carry at eclosion, the most fundamental constraint acting on a synovigenic species is the maximum rate of oocyte maturation. Furthermore, the ability of synovigenic species to reverse the flow of nutrients from the soma to oocytes (i. e. egg resorption) has a dramatic influence on the cost of oviposition. Whereas females in hostrich environments may experience oviposition-mediated egg <b>limitation,</b> <b>females</b> in host-poor environments may experience oosorption-mediated egg limitation. Both forms of egg limitation are costly. Contrary to initial expectations, the flexibility of resource allocation that typifies synovigenic reproduction actually appears to broaden the range of conditions under which costly egg limitation occurs. Egg costs appear to be fundamental in mediating the trade-off between current and future reproduction, and therefore are an important factor favouring selective insect oviposition...|$|R
40|$|Indicators of {{temperament}} appear early in infancy and remain relatively stable over time. Despite {{a great deal}} of interest in biological indices {{of temperament}}, most studies of infant temperament rely on parental reports or behavioral tasks. Thus, the extent to which commonly used temperament measures relate to potential biological indicators of infant temperament is still relatively unknown. The current experiment examines the relationship between a common parental report measure of temperament – the Infant Behavior Questionnaire – Revised (IBQ-R) – and measures of frontal EEG asymmetry in infants. We examined associations between the subscales of the IBQ-R and frontal EEG asymmetry scores recorded during a combined series of neutral attentional and putatively emotional recording conditions in infants between 7 and 9 months of age. We predicted that approach-related subscales of the IBQ-R (e. g., Approach, Soothability) would be related to greater left prefrontal asymmetry, while withdrawal-related subscales (e. g., Distress to <b>Limitations,</b> <b>Fear,</b> Falling Reactivity, Perceptual Sensitivity) would be related to greater right prefrontal asymmetry. In the mid- and lateral-frontal regions, Approach, Distress to <b>Limitations,</b> <b>Fear,</b> Soothability, and Perceptual Sensitivity were generally associated with greater left frontal activation (rs$. 23, ps, 0. 05), while only Falling Reactivity was associated with greater right frontal activation (rs# 2. 44, ps, 0. 05).

50|$|In {{a context}} where a vast {{majority}} of prisoners (or even all) are male, hiring women to watch male prisoners can be seen as problematic. Many actions performed in correctional facilities, such as shower patrol, strip searches, and many other normal prison activities, are seen as <b>limitations</b> for <b>female</b> workers.

Close proximity to inmates during these instances is shame-inducing for them and can add various levels of frustration and powerlessness to what was already a shameful and powerless situation (being in prison). Problems with female security may range from common privacy to invasion of privacy, and further with experiences of sexual assault from the guard or the inmates.|$|R

We have recently discovered male sterility in populations of Kallstroemia grandiflora from northwestern Mexico. Here we describe the development of anther and pollen grains in hermaphrodite and female plants and explore whether females experience any compensatory advantage over hermaphrodites. The major difference in anther development between morphs was the early disintegration of tapetal cells in anthers of pistillate flowers. Abnormalities in developing pollen grains in pistillate flowers were seen in the microspore mother cells, microspore tetrads, and young and mature pollen grains.

The fruit set is constant, although its winter-flowering period might decrease pollen transfer. Nevertheless, the lower competition for pollinators with neighbouring plants and the longlasting anthesis may offset its reproductive success.
