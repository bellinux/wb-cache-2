The HA-induced enhancement of aromatic, nitrogenous, and lipid exudation was previously reported [35].

This enabled the retention/detection of apolar molecules preventing the evaluation of polar compounds, such as sugars, organic acids, and amino acids [35]. Here, we applied a protocol designed to isolate primary plant metabolites and identify them through the BinBaseLibrary.

The postulate that asparagine synthesis is not conditioned {{primarily by the}} presence of excess free ammonia and hence is not a detoxication mechanism has been experimentally confirmed in the lupin. Isolated embryos, when supplied with adequate carbohydrate and nitrogen in the medium, are unable to absorb and convert succinic, malic, pyruvic, lactic, and <b>glyceric</b> <b>acids,</b> and glycerol and succinmonamide to asparagine. Under similar conditions of carbohydrate and nitrogen supply fumaric, maleic, aspartic, exalacetic, and glutamic acids, and succindiamide are effective in stimulating the synthesis of asparagine.

Combinations of glutamic acid with aspartic and oxalacetic acids in the absence of ammonia are likewise not effective in the stimulation of asparagine synthesis. An extract of embryo tissue is able to oxidize glutamic acid in the presence of boiled yeast juice. Amide formation has been demonstrated in such an extract to which was added glutamic and aspartic acids and ammonia. An attempt has been made to unify the above observations, and to explain the role of glutamate as an energy source in asparagine synthesis, with the energy transfer possibly taking place through the intermediation of a pyridine coenzyme. The unsatisfactory status of the postulated conversion of aspartic acid to asparagine has been pointed out and a scheme proposed to explain the introduction of energy into the system. ...|$|R
