40|$|Abstract. The {{automatic}} vibration {{screening of}} the insects is the important part in the image recognition of the stored-grain insects. A screening detection device of the stored-grain insects was developed to analyze the vibration screening properties of Coleopteran insects. The main structure of the device included a vibration screening unit, a <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> <b>unit</b> of the grain insects, a binocular machine vision unit and an automatic transporting unit. The adults of Sitophilus Oryzae were taken as the screening objects. Full factorial design was used {{in order to find}} out the better vibration screening parameters. Then orthogonal experiment was designed to optimize the screening parameters further, and distinguish between the primary factors and the secondary factors. The optimal vibration screening parameters of the detection device for the stored-grain insects were determined by a series of experiments. The best parameters were that the amplitude of the vibration sieve was 3. 5 mm, the vibrating direction angle was 30 ºand the crank plate speed was 600 r/min...|$|E

30|$|To improve mine {{air quality}} and dust {{collection}} performance, an enclosed cyclone passageway (ECP) dust-collecting fan {{has been designed}} and developed. This is a novel dust-collecting fan, which separates dust by the centrifugal force exerted by a driven spiral airflow. Its <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> mechanism is thus {{different from those of}} existing dust collectors. In this study, a general equation for <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> in the centrifugal <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> section (CDRS) of ECP fan is deduced by applying the classic force equilibrium principle, which states that the centrifugal force on a dust particle should be equal to the aerodynamic resistance of the corresponding spiral airflow at a given spatial point. The equation is then simplified, and case studies are conducted for the ECP fan using the simplest form of the equation. Finally, the effects of structural and operating parameters on centrifugal <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> in the CDRS are analysed through an engineering case study.|$|R
30|$|An {{enclosed}} cyclone passageway (ECP) dust-collecting fan is discussed. The ECP fan separates dust by {{centrifugal force}} originating from a driven spiral airflow, and its design takes {{the constraints of}} Chinese underground coal mines into consideration. Using the force equilibrium law, a general equation for <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> in the centrifugal <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> section (CDRS) of the ECP fan is deduced. This general equation is simplified using the CDRS structure and the fan operating parameters and is analysed numerically. The attractive results show that increases in the airflow rate of the fan, the structural ratio of the ECPs and the radius of the extended axis can improve the <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> performance of the CDRS. Furthermore, {{the effects of the}} structural ratio and the radius on <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> dominate over that of the flow rate, and the effect of the structural ratio is more significant than that of the radius.|$|R

To reduce the dust deposition, a kind of automatic <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> system is designed and its efficacy is simulated. Based on FLUENT module of ANSYS Workbench, as well as standard k-ε turbulence model and DPM model, simulation analysis of the influence of 3 inlet pressures (0. 25, 0. 30, 0. 35) of working medium (N 2) in <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> system and 2 different valve plate jaw openings (45 °, 90 °) on the dust deposition trajectory in butterfly valve region are conducted, and the influence mechanism of inlet pressure on the dust deposition is analyzed.

30|$|In {{order to}} meet {{engineering}} needs of Chinese underground coal mines, a new dust-collecting fan, a device of dust separated by centrifugal force in driven cyclone passageway (DCCP) was designed. In centrifugal <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> section (CDRS) of DCCP, a general equation {{is derived from the}} principle of force equilibrium. According to CDRS structure parameters and fan running parameters, the general equation is simplified, and the simplest equation is calculated numerically by MATLAB. The calculation results illustrate that increasing quantity of air current is against <b>dust</b> <b>removal,</b> but it is beneficial to <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> by increasing the radius of driven spiral blade and increasing the particle diameter of coal dust. The conclusions show that the dust-collecting structure parameters coupled with the fan running parameters is a novel optimization approach to dust-collection fan for working and heading faces, which is especially suitable for Chinese underground mines.|$|R

The particle size distributions before and after four different <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> devices in six coal-fired power plants were measured, including the hybrid ESP/BAGs {{that have not been}} measured previously. The influence of different <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> devices on PM 2.5 emission characteristics was also analyzed.

In particular, the influence of hybrid ESP/BAG operating conditions on <b>dust</b> <b>removal</b> performance was explored. The concentrations and distributions of particulate matter before and after desulfurization devices were also measured in three coal-fired power plants. The results were used to analyze the cleaning effect of wet desulfurization devices on PM 2.5.
