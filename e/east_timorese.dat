5|$|While the Force 2020 {{plan has}} proven controversial, {{it appears to}} have been adopted by the <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> government. The plan was criticised by the United Nations and the governments of Australia and the United States as {{unaffordable}} and in excess of East Timor's needs. <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> President José Ramos-Horta defended the plan, however, arguing that its adoption will transform the F-FDTL into a professional force capable of defending East Timor's sovereignty and contributing to the nation's stability. <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> defence officials have also stressed that Force 2020 is a long-term plan and does not propose acquiring advanced weapons for some years.|$|E
5|$|<b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> animist {{belief systems}} {{did not fit}} with Indonesia's {{constitutional}} monotheism, resulting in mass conversions to Christianity. Portuguese clergy were replaced with Indonesian priests and Latin and Portuguese mass was replaced by Indonesian mass. Before the invasion, only 20 percent of <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> were Roman Catholics, and by the 1980s, 95 percent were registered as Catholics. With over 90 percent Catholic population, East Timor is currently {{one of the most}} densely Catholic countries in the world.|$|E
5|$|A {{detachment}} of Hercules from Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons supported INTERFET operations in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000. When violence broke out following the East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum on 30August 1999, C-130H sorties were flown into the then-Indonesian province from 6 to 14September to evacuate United Nations personnel {{as well as}} other foreign citizens and <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> refugees. Four C-130E sorties were also conducted to drop food and other humanitarian supplies to refugees on 17 and 18September. On 19September a C-130 dropped a Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) team near the <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> capital of Dili ahead of the arrival of the main INTERFET force the next day. From 20September, thirteen RAAF Hercules (designated No.86 Wing DetachmentB) and transport aircraft from several other countries flew troops and supplies into East Timor. These aircraft also dropped humanitarian supplies to refugees who had fled to mountainous regions. The poor condition of most <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> airfields and the potential threat of being fired upon by pro-Indonesian militia were constant dangers throughout this operation.|$|E
50|$|At {{a special}} session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in 1999, Lopes spoke about the {{problems}} he and other <b>East</b> <b>Timoreses</b> were encountering during Indonesia's occupation of East Timor. Lopes explained that Indonesian supported militia destroyed his home and office in September 1999. Lopes mentioned that he had also been receiving death threats because of his position as a human rights lawyer.|$|R

5|$|As groups {{supporting}} {{autonomy and}} independence began campaigning, {{a series of}} pro-integration paramilitary groups of <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> began threatening violence—and indeed committing violence—around the country. Alleging pro-independence bias {{on the part of}} UNAMET, the groups were seen working with and receiving training from Indonesian soldiers. Before the May agreement was announced, an April paramilitary attack in Liquiça left dozens of <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> dead. On 16 May 1999, a gang accompanied by Indonesian troops attacked suspected independence activists in the village of Atara; in June another group attacked a UNAMET office in Maliana.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia kept East Timor {{shut off}} from the rest of the world, except for a few years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{claiming}} that the vast majority of <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> supported integration. This position was followed closely by the Indonesian media such that an <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> acceptance of their integration with Indonesia was taken for granted by, and was a non-issue for, the majority of Indonesians. East Timor came to be seen as a training ground for the officer corps in tactics of suppression for Aceh and Papua, and was pivotal in ensuring military sector dominance of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL {{was formed}} from the {{national}} liberation movement guerrilla army known as FALINTIL (Portuguese acronym for Forças Armadas de Libertação de Timor-Leste or Armed Forces for the Liberation of East Timor). During the period before 1999 some <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> leaders, including the current President José Ramos-Horta, proposed that a future <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> state {{would not have a}} military. The widespread violence and destruction that followed the independence referendum in 1999 and the need to provide employment to FALINTIL veterans led to a change in policy, however. Following the end of Indonesian rule, FALINTIL proposed the establishment of a large military of about 5,000 personnel.|$|E

500|$|The mass killings {{continued}} unabated as Indonesian forces advanced on the Fretilin-held mountain {{regions of}} <b>East</b> Timor. A <b>Timorese</b> guide for a senior Indonesian officer told former Australian consul to Portuguese Timor James Dunn {{that during the}} early months of the fighting TNI troops [...] "killed most Timorese they encountered." [...] In February 1976 after capturing the village of Aileu - to the south of Dili - and driving out the remaining Fretilin forces, Indonesian troops machine gunned most of the town's population, allegedly shooting everyone over the age of three. The young children who were spared were taken back to Dili in trucks. At the time Aileu fell to Indonesian forces, the population was around 5,000; by the time Indonesian relief workers visited the village in September 1976 only 1,000 remained. In June 1976, TNI troops badly battered by a Fretilin attack exacted retribution against a large refugee camp housing 5-6,000 Timorese at Lamaknan near the West Timor border. After setting several houses on fire, Indonesian soldiers massacred as many as 2,000 men, women and children.|$|R
5|$|When <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> {{political}} parties were first legalised in April 1974, three groupings emerged as {{major players in}} the postcolonial landscape. The União Democrática Timorense (Timorese Democratic Union, or UDT), was formed in May by a group of wealthy landowners.|$|E
5|$|East Timor {{ratified}} the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and Chemical Weapons Convention in 2003. The <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> Government {{has no plans}} to acquire nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. The country also became a party to the Ottawa Treaty, which bans anti-personnel mines, in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal began {{a process}} of decolonisation and began a {{withdrawal}} from Portuguese Timor (later East Timor). Australians had long taken {{an interest in the}} colony; the nation had sent troops to the region during World War II, and many <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> had fought the Japanese as guerrillas. In September 1974, Whitlam met with President Suharto in Indonesia and indicated that he would support Indonesia if it annexed East Timor. At the height of the Cold War, and {{in the context of the}} American retreat from Indo-China, he felt that incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia would enhance the stability of the region, and reduce the risk of the <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> FRETILIN movement, which many feared was communist, coming to power.|$|E
5|$|Later, in May 2006 a {{commando}} {{company group}} was deployed to Timor Leste {{as part of}} Operation Astute, after relations between the <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> government and military forces broke down. The commandos operated alongside the SASR {{as part of the}} Special Forces Component and were tasked with advanced force operations in preparation for the arrival of follow-on forces, focusing on Dili Airport. In March 2007, the commandos, along with elements of the SASR, took part in the Battle of Same during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the rebel leader, Alfredo Reinado. After the battle, the commandos and SASR elements were withdrawn {{at the request of the}} <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> government in order to start negotiations with the rebels.|$|E
5|$|Successive Australian governments saw good {{relations}} {{and stability in}} Indonesia (Australia's largest neighbour) as providing an important security buffer to Australia's north, but the East Timor issue complicated co-operation between the two nations. Australia provided important sanctuary to <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> independence advocates like José Ramos-Horta (who based himself in Australia during his exile).|$|E
5|$|Major {{investment}} by the Indonesian government to improve East Timor's infrastructure, {{and health and}} education facilities since 1975, did not end <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> resistance to Indonesian rule. Although by the 1980s Fretilin forces had dropped to a few hundred armed men, Fretilin increased its contacts with young Timorese especially in Dili, and an un-armed civil resistance seeking self-determination took shape.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 2008 East Timor {{signed a}} {{contract}} for two new Chinese-built 43-metre Type-62 class patrol boats. These ships were to replace the Albatroz-class vessels and {{to be used to}} protect East Timor's fisheries. The contract for the ships also involved 30 to 40 <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> personnel being trained in China. The two new patrol boats arrived from China in June 2010, and were commissioned as the Jaco-class on the eleventh of the month. In November 2010 it was reported that East Timor would order a further two patrol boats from South Korea. In the event, three ex-Republic of Korea Navy Chamsuri class patrol boats were donated, and these entered service with the naval component on 26 September 2011. The <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> government also ordered two fast patrol boats from the Indonesian company PT Pal in March 2011 for the price of $US40million.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{first arrived}} in Timor in the 16th century, and in 1702 East Timor came under Portuguese colonial administration. Portuguese rule was tenuous until the island was divided with the Dutch Empire in 1860. A {{significant}} battleground during the Pacific War, East Timor was occupied by 20,000 Japanese troops. The fighting helped prevent a Japanese occupation of Australia, but resulted in 60,000 <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> deaths.|$|E
5|$|The fear of {{national}} disintegration were played upon military leaders close to Suharto and remained {{as one of}} Indonesia's strongest justifications for refusing to entertain the prospect of <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> independence or even autonomy until the late 1990s. The military intelligence organisations initially sought a non-military annexation strategy, intending to use APODETI as its integration vehicle.|$|E
5|$|East Timor and Indonesia {{have sought}} to build {{friendly}} relations since 2002. While movements of people and drug smuggling across their international border has caused tensions, both countries have worked with the UN to improve the security situation in the region. The <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> and Indonesian governments signed a defence agreement in August 2011 which aims to improve co-operation between their national militaries. The Timor Leste-Indonesia Defense Joint Committee was also established {{at this time to}} monitor the agreement's implementation.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL has {{suffered}} from serious morale and disciplinary problems since its establishment. These problems have been driven by uncertainty over the F-FDTL's role, poor conditions of service due to limited resources, tensions arising from FALINTIL's transition from a guerrilla organisation to a regular military and political and regional rivalries. The F-FDTL's morale and disciplinary problems have resulted in large numbers of soldiers being disciplined or dismissed. The <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> Government was aware of these problems before the 2006 crisis but did not rectify the factors that were contributing to low morale.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL {{is still}} in the process of {{rebuilding}} from the events of 2006. It remains under-strength and is yet to reform its training and discipline standards. Tensions within the F-FDTL also continue to threaten the stability of the force. However, the <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> government places a high priority on re-establishing the F-FDTL and developing it into a force capable of defending the country. In 2015 the Australian Defence Intelligence Organisation reported that little progress has been made in implementing the Force 2020 plans.|$|E
5|$|The former-Portuguese {{colony of}} East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975, however, {{following}} years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President B.J. Habibie subsequently {{agreed to allow}} the <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> to vote on autonomy in 1999. The United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) was established to organise and conduct the vote, which {{was held at the}} end of August 1999 and resulted with 78.5% of voters deciding in favour of independence. However, following the announcement of the results pro-Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military, launched a campaign of violence, looting and arson and many <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> were killed, while perhaps more than 500,000 were displaced. Unable to control the violence, Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force. Australia, which had contributed police to UNAMET, organised and led an international military coalition, known as the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET), a non-UN force operating in accordance with UN resolutions. The total size of the Australian force committed numbered 5,500 personnel, and included a significant ground force, supported by air and naval forces, in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since 1945.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{broke out}} between the {{remnants}} of the <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> security forces and the rebels and gangs in late May. On 23 May Reinado's rebel group opened fire on F-FDTL and PNTL personnel in the Fatu Ahi area. On 24 May F-FDTL personnel near the Force's headquarters were attacked by a group of rebel police officers, petitioners and armed civilians. The attack was defeated when one of the F-FDTL naval component's patrol boats fired on the attackers. During the crisis the relationship between the F-FDTL and PNTL had deteriorated further, and on 25 May members of the F-FDTL attacked the PNTL's headquarters, killing nine unarmed police officers.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL has an {{authorised}} {{strength of}} 1,500 regular personnel and 1,500 reservists. It has never reached these totals as funding shortfalls {{have prevented the}} reserve component from being formed and the Army's two regular battalions have remained under-strength. While all the F-FDTL's personnel were initially FALINTIL veterans the force's composition has changed over time and few soldiers from the insurgency remain due to the force's narrow age requirement. After the F-FDTL's 1st Battalion was established in 2001 recruitment was opened to all <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> above the age of 18, including women. Few women have joined the F-FDTL, however, and as at February 2010 only seven percent of new recruits were female.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the invasion, Portugal cut {{diplomatic}} ties with Indonesia {{and went on to}} support UN resolutions condemning the invasion. However, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Portuguese government appeared reluctant to push the issue; American Indonesia specialist, Benedict Anderson suggests this stemmed from uncertainty at the time over its application to the European Community. Portugal's criticism mounted sharply from the mid-1980s, and due to public pressure, the country became one of the highest profile campaigners in international forums for <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> self-determination. Throughout the 1990s, Portugal took part in UN-brokered mediations with Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The testimonies {{of foreigners}} at the {{cemetery}} were quickly reported to international news organisations, and video footage of the massacre was widely broadcast internationally causing outrage. In response to the massacre, activists around the world organised in solidarity with the <b>East</b> <b>Timorese,</b> and a new urgency was brought to calls for self-determination. TAPOL, a British organisation formed in 1973 to advocate for democracy in Indonesia, increased its work around East Timor. In the United States, the East Timor Action Network (now the East Timor and Indonesia Action Network) was founded and soon had chapters in ten cities around the country. Other solidarity groups appeared in Portugal, Australia, Japan, Germany, Malaysia, Ireland, and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|While East Timor's {{decision}} {{to form a}} military has been criticised by some commentators, the <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and security reasons. Critics of the F-FDTL's establishment argue that as East Timor does not face any external threats the government's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL. While East Timor's political leadership recognises that the country does not currently face an external threat, they {{believe that it is}} necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression. The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as an effective means of integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} the results, {{paramilitary}} groups had begun attacking people and setting fires around the capital Dili. Foreign journalists and election observers fled, {{and tens of thousands}} of <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> took to the mountains. Islamic gangs attacked Dili's Catholic Diocese building, killing two dozen people; the next day, the headquarters of the ICRC was attacked and burned to the ground. Almost one hundred people were killed later in Suai, and reports of similar massacres poured in from around East Timor. The UN withdrew most of its personnel, but the Dili compound had been flooded with refugees.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{problems}} that have affected the F-FDTL throughout its existence were caused by the process used to establish the force. A key flaw in this process was that FALINTIL's high command was allowed to select candidates for the military from members of FALINTIL without external oversight. As a result, the selection was conducted, to a large degree, on the basis of applicants' political allegiance. This led to many FALINTIL veterans feeling that they had been unfairly excluded from the military and reduced the force's public standing. Furthermore, UNTAET failed to establish adequate foundations for the <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> security sector by developing legislative and planning documents, administrative support arrangements and mechanisms for the democratic control of the military. These omissions remained uncorrected after East Timor achieved independence on 20 May 2002.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} F-FDTL and PNTL have also reduced the {{effectiveness}} of East Timor's security services. During 2003 and 2004, members of the police and F-FDTL clashed {{on a number of}} occasions, and groups of soldiers attacked police stations in September 2003 and December 2004. These tensions were caused by the overlapping roles of the two security services, differences of opinion between members of East Timor's leadership and the fact that many members of the PNTL had served with the Indonesian National Police prior to East Timor's independence while the F-FDTL was based around FALINTIL. In 2003, the <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> Government established three new paramilitary police forces equipped with modern weapons. The formation of these units led to dissatisfaction with the Government among some members of the F-FDTL.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2000 the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) {{invited a}} team from King's College London to conduct a study of East Timor's {{security}} force options. The team's report identified three options for an <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> military. Option1 was based on FALINTIL's preference for a relatively large and heavily armed military of 3,000–5,000 personnel, option2 was a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 conscripts and option3 was for a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 volunteer reservists. The study team recommended option3 as being best suited to East Timor's security needs and economic situation. This recommendation was accepted by UNTAET in September 2000 and {{formed the basis of}} East Timor's defence planning. The plan was also accepted by all the countries that had contributed peacekeeping forces to East Timor. The King's College report has been criticised {{on the grounds that it}} led East Timor to establish a large police force and a large Army when its security needs may have been better met by a single smaller paramilitary force.|$|E
5|$|A small {{ministry}} of defence (which was renamed the Ministry of Defence and Security in 2007) was established in 2002 to provide civilian oversight of the F-FDTL. A lack of suitable staff for the ministry and the close political relationship between senior F-FDTL officers and government figures rendered this oversight largely ineffectual and retarded the development of East Timor's defence policy up to at least 2004. The failure to institute effective civilian oversight of the F-FDTL also limited {{the extent to which}} foreign countries are willing to provide assistance to the F-FDTL and contributed to the 2006 crisis. As at early 2010 the Ministry of Defence and Security was organised into elements responsible for defence (including the F-FDTL) and security (including the PNTL), each headed by their own secretary of state. At this time the <b>East</b> <b>Timorese</b> Government was working to expand the ministry's capacity with assistance from UNMIT, but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited {{the extent to which the}} ministry could provide civilian oversight to the security sector. Moreover, elements of the F-FDTL were continuing to resist civilian control over the security forces at this time, and the force had not opened itself to international scrutiny.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of Indonesian {{intelligence}} influential with Suharto {{had initially}} envisaged that invasion, subdual of Fretilin resistance, and integration with Indonesia would be quick and relatively painless. The ensuing Indonesian campaigns up through 1976 were devastating for the <b>East</b> <b>Timorese,</b> an enormous drain on Indonesian resources, were severely damaging to Indonesia internationally, and ultimately a failure. The wanton, wholesale killings by the TNI near the coastal regions {{during the opening}} months of the invasion had driven {{a large portion of}} the population and most of the remaining Falintil into the central regions. This proved counterproductive as it left Indonesian troops fighting against an enemy which was well equipped and had access to agricultural resources and population. The civilian population came to see the Falintil as a buffer against the excesses of the Indonesian forces, which led to heightened support for the resistance. From 1975 to 1977, the Fretilin protected at least 40% of the population who had fled the coastal regions, in inhospitable conditions, with the active support of rallied communities. Schwarz suggests the fact that Indonesian military's power base remained barely dented by the mid-1970s intelligence miscalculations and ongoing failures, was a measure of the military's dominance of Indonesian affairs.|$|E
