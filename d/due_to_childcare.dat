50|$|In the new era, women {{restricted}} the 'spatial reach' {{of their job}} searches <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>childcare</b> responsibilities. The open employment for middle class women catalyzes the growing use of domestic workers for household cleaning and childcare. There has been a complexity in the modern economics with women's responsibility {{at home and at}} work. Cultural theories maintain that lower wages in female-dominated occupations are the product of societal bias against the work typically carried out by women and that the sex-composition of occupations affects wages directly. In contrast, recent human capital theories maintain that the wage-penalties associated with working in female-dominated occupations result from different requirements in specialised training and that the effect is indirect. Many feminist scholars insist that sexual difference is the primary reason for differences between both sexes in the labour market outcomes.|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze how Czech mothers {{perceive}} the consequences for their careers of interruptions in their participation in the labour market <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>childcare.</b> In particular, these women's perceptions of the impact of breaks in employment on their further career are examined in light of whether they had their children prior to or after the fall of the socialist regime The analyses are based on the European Social Survey data from 2004 and were conducted in two steps. In the first step, the paper examines patterns of labour market interruptions <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>childcare</b> in different time periods as a function of existing maternity and parental leave legislation. In the second step, the paper analyses how the regime change affected the perceptions of consequences of such career. The analyses reveal that the patterns of career interruptions <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>childcare</b> and their perception by women have changed over time depending on the institutional and legal context, and that the fall of the socialist regime had a significant impact on both behaviour and perceptions of Czech mothers. employment interruptions; childcare; regime change...|$|E

40|$|The paper aims {{to examine}} the effect of the {{transition}} from a socialist regime to democracy and liberal economy on women’s perceptions of the consequences of breaks in labour market participation <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>childcare</b> on their further careers in seven post-socialist countries. More precisely, it investigates whether women in Central and Eastern Europe who gave birth to at least one child after 1987 were more likely to experience negative consequences for their further professional life as a result of career interruptions <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>childcare</b> than women who had their children during the socialist era. The analysis is conducted in two steps. In the first step, the effect of the political transition is examined in the Central European region as a whole, thus on the pooled data including all the seven countries. In the second step, the paper tests whether the effect of the transition varies significantly from country to country, and if yes, in which countries it had the biggest impact. In both steps, the effect of the transition is examined while controlling for selected individual characteristics that are mentioned in the literature as possible predictors of subjective evaluation of consequences of career breaks on women’s further professional development. In the paper we use data from the 2004 European Social Survey. female emloyement; labour market inactivity; child care; subjective indicators...|$|E
40|$|A Thesis Submitted In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Science-Psychology Industrial/OrganizationalDue to {{the recent}} trend that older workers are delaying {{retirement}} {{and that there is}} an increasing need for caring for the elderly, work-family conflict could be expected to expand into workers' preretirement years. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine work-family conflict (WFC) across the lifespan to determine if work-family conflict <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>childcare</b> demands experienced early in life is similar to the work-family conflict due to eldercare demands experienced later in life. Data for the study came from the sibling sample of the 1994 wave of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Participants completed a 1 hour telephone interview and were mailed a 20 page self-administered mail back questionnaire. Participants included in the analyses were divided into two subsamples where 1, 096 men and women were identified as having childcare responsibilities and 300 men and women were identified as having eldercare responsibilities. A series of hierarchical multiple regressions and hierarchical moderated multiple regressions were used to test the hypotheses. The hypothesis examining the relationship between childcare demands and WFC was supported, but the hypothesis examining the relationship between eldercare demands and WFC was not. In addition, the hypotheses examining how WFC <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>childcare</b> demands (experienced early in life) is similar to WFC due to eldercare demands (experienced later in life) were not supported.

40|$|I jointly {{estimate}} the causal effects of childcare and parental investment on the pro-duction of cognitive skills, using experimental {{data from a}} large-scale, randomized, high-quality early education program in the US. To do so, I rely on two sources of variation: random treatment assignment at birth and the interaction of treatment as-signment and being a twin. The first provides access <b>to</b> <b>childcare.</b> The second reduces parental investment when parents have twins instead of a singleton, arguably <b>due</b> <b>to</b> additional resource constraints. This allows me to decompose the total treatment effect of the program on cognitive skills, as measured by an IQ test at age 3 : 73 % corresponds <b>to</b> <b>childcare,</b> 47 % <b>to</b> parental investment, and- 20 % to a residual.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question whether}} geographical access <b>to</b> institutionalised <b>childcare</b> influences mothers' labour-force participation in the Netherlands. The conceptual framework of the paper {{is based on a}} time-geographic perspective of female labour-force participation. According to this perspective, women are faced with severe day-to-day space-time constraints that form a spatial barrier to labour-force participation. It is argued that, for many mothers with pre-school-age children, access to employment opportunities is partly determined by geographical access <b>to</b> <b>childcare</b> facilities. Using data from the Netherlands Housing Demand survey and a detailed measure of geographical access <b>to</b> <b>childcare,</b> it is shown that, for mothers with young children, the probability of being engaged in paid employment increases as the number of day-care slots per 100 children in the residential area increases. In the regression model, the effect of access <b>to</b> <b>childcare</b> on mothers' labour-force participation is estimated after individual, household, and local labour market characteristics are controlled for.

The models are dynamic in that main covariate effects are allowed to vary smoothly with working experience. The intention of the paper is to demonstrate with state of the art statistical models how wages are affected by labour market experience, employment interruptions and other covariates. The educational level of the mother and the time off the job influence the amount of wageloss and the wage profile afterwards.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the question why desired and actual sharing of market {{work and family}} duties among parents with young children in Germany fall apart. Potential explanations include financial incentives favoring the single-earner model, as well as constraints in choosing working hours <b>due</b> <b>to</b> lack of <b>childcare</b> or labor demand restrictions. In order to analyze these explanations, we extend the standard model of labor supply by different types of constraints. We estimate preferences based on desired instead of actual working hours and specify restrictions as a double hurdle model with the first stage representing the risk of involuntary unemployment. The second step pertains the probability of being constrained in specific hours categories. We apply this model to simulate a recent reform proposal that subsidizes parents who both work around 30 hours per week. We find that taking into account constraints in working hours is crucial: The pure incentive effect is almost cut by half. Our approach also allows to simulate the removal of hours constraints which almost triples the labor supply reaction. Hours constraints are thus {{even more important than}} adverse incentives in explaining the asymmetric division of work and care within families...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{performed}} {{an analysis of}} the cost-effectiveness of pandemic intervention strategies using a detailed, individual-based simulation model of a community in Australia together with health outcome data of infected individuals gathered during 2009 – 2010. The aim was to examine the cost-effectiveness of a range of interventions to determine the most cost-effective strategies suitable for a future pandemic with H 1 N 1 2009 characteristics. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using transmissibility, age-stratified attack rates and health outcomes determined from H 1 N 1 2009 data, we determined that the most cost-effective strategies involved treatment and household prophylaxis using antiviral drugs combined with limited duration school closure, with costs ranging from $ 632 to $ 777 per case prevented. When school closure was used as a sole intervention we found the use of limited duration school closure to be significantly more cost-effective compared to continuous school closure, a result with applicability to countries with limited access to antiviral drugs. Other social distancing strategies, such as reduced workplace attendance, were found <b>to</b> be costly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> productivity losses. Conclusion: The mild severity (low hospitalisation and case fatality rates) and low transmissibility of H 1 N 1 2009 meant that health treatment costs were dominated by the higher productivity losses arising from workplace absence <b>due</b> <b>to</b> illness and <b>childcare</b> requirements following school closure.

30|$|A {{specific}} {{feature of}} the German Hartz IV basic income system is that recipients {{have to be able}} to work at least three hours per day. As a consequence, long-term basic income recipients that are not registered as unemployed (e.g. single parents <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>childcare)</b> may receive Hartz IV. In 2013, the annual average of Hartz IV basic income recipients totalled 4.42 million, of which 2.52 million were not unemployed, 1.02 million were short-term unemployed and 881, 000 were long-term unemployed. For our discussion: The Public Employment Service defines Hartz IV long-term basic income receipt slightly different: In the same year, 3.123 million were long-term basic income recipients who had been receiving Hartz IV for at least 21  months in the last 2  years. Therefore, the policy relevant group are not just the long-term unemployed but the larger group of long-term basic income recipients. Note that there is still a basic income system for disabled people who are not able to work at least three hours per day.|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that {{long periods of}} childcare at home deteriorate mothers’ occupational careers. This study examined mothers’ experiences regarding negative career consequences of full-time care of children at home, and of part-time work <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>childcare.</b> The focus was on Finland, a country that provides all mothers a financially compensated, longer-term childcare leave linked with unrestricted access to day care services. Experiences of Finnish mothers were compared with experiences of mothers in 11 other European countries. The data were based on European Social Survey (ESS) round 2, conducted in 2004 and 2005. In all of the studied countries, the majority of mothers assessed that taking care of children at home had not harmed their occupational careers. There was, however, a clear cross-country variation. Perceived career consequences for both types of care at home were least common in Finland. In most of the investigated countries, longer times spent with children at home increased the probability to perceive negative career consequences. In Finland, the difference was relatively small. Thus, {{as long as the}} focus is on mothers’ perceptions, the longer-term childcare leave does not seem to markedly deteriorate Finnish mothers’ careers...|$|E
40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} why women {{are less likely}} than men to hold a position of workplace authority and why countries differ in this respect. We focus on the importance of investments in different types of human capital and the returns on them. Whether leave policies, the availability of part-time work, and gender desegregation in education contribute to the explanation of cross-national differences in the gender gap in authority is also investigated. Data from the European Social Survey 2004 / 05 and country-specific information were used to estimate several hierarchical models. Looking at Europe as a whole, we find evidence that overall work experience, experience with the current employer, and working hours help explain the gender gap in authority. In contrast, educational specialization and career interruptions <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>childcare</b> demands or unemployment appear to matter less. Lower returns on human capital for women are found only for the experience with the current employer. Human capital composition in different countries does not explain cross-national differences in the authority gender gap, nor do leave arrangements and gender segregation in education. We do find, though, that the gender gap in authority is smaller in countries where working part-time is common. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved...|$|E

Wage inequality and interrupted working lives <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>childcare</b> responsibilities are contributing factors and have meant that women, especially single women, have a decreased capacity to acquire housing equity or retirement savings in their own right. In addition, social changes that permit women to choose {{whether or not they}} marry and which also enable serial monogamy means there has been significant growth in the number and proportion of single, older women in the population. These social changes mirror the lives of the post-Second World War baby boomers and the cumulative impacts are now being felt as this generation approaches retirement.

It documents evidence generated by semi‐structured interviews with project staff and participants of the program. Renewal SA’s Works Program at Playford Alive requires private contractors and service providers to deliver either work experience and longer term placements or training {{to a number of}} local unemployed people as a condition of being awarded the contract. Key findings from this report include: 	Early pessimism based upon ideological objections to ‘government interference’ in business decisions proved to be ill‐founded and contractors appear to have embraced the program. 	There exists a diverse range of physical and psychological barriers to the unemployed entering the labour market and this justifies the eclectic nature of the Works Program. 	The ‘three tiered’ structure of the Works Program means that the unique circumstances and support requirements of individuals can be best addressed. 	The Works Program was viewed as particularly useful by women who had taken time out of the labour market <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>childcare</b> responsibilities as it enabled them to retrain, build human capital and change career trajectories. 	Both the work experience placement and onsite training offered participants the opportunity to ‘showcase’ themselves and ‘get a foot in the door’. 	The Works Program recruits through multiple entry points, both private sector and public institutions, and has succeeded in creating awareness of the program throughout the community. 	All three streams incorporated within the Works Program have been well used. These streams include: 1) classroom training 2) Live Site training and 3) work experience placements. 	The Works Program generates quantifiable and measureable outcomes, for example new jobs and formal qualifications, however it also generates a range of subjective outcomes which are more likely to encourage longer term employment and other social benefits...|$|E
30|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, {{the reason}} for higher perceived accessibility reported by males could be <b>due</b> <b>to</b> men and women having different needs and criteria to assess accessibility. Similarly, older age is already associated with more participation in childcare (Geoffroy et al. 2012), which could be the reason why older people reported higher accessibility. Not being at work would decrease the acute need for childcare, {{which may be the}} reason why non-employed respondents reported higher accessibility compared to employed respondents. Although previous research revealed that access <b>to</b> <b>childcare</b> is more difficult in rural areas (Habibov 2012; Liu 2015), however, this argument is not supported by our results. In some countries, it is easier <b>to</b> access <b>childcare</b> in rural areas <b>due</b> <b>to</b> lower demand, while in others, provision is limited in rural areas which leads to difficulty in access (Eurydice 2014). In this research, the respondents from urban areas reported lower accessibility probably <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the high demand in cities. Respondents with higher education reported higher accessibility only marginally, which is not completely in line with previous research that revealed higher use of formal childcare by higher educated people (Geoffroy et al. 2012; Tang et al. 2012). Not surprisingly, respondents who reported higher income than average, also found <b>childcare</b> <b>to</b> be more accessible compared to people with average or low-income levels. Finally, users of services reported higher accessibility compared to respondents who do not use childcare, as non-user respondents may be unable to access the services in the first place.|$|R

30|$|This dataset is {{compiled}} {{annually from}} 2005 to 2013. It consists of 4  % {{of the population}} registered with the Social Security (SS) system either as workers, unemployed receiving benefits, or pensioners for at least 1  day of the current year of the sample (over a million work histories). The complete labor market history is reported for all individuals. This database provides highly detailed information about their past and present labor activities, including monthly wages, type of contract, receipt of unemployment insurance benefits, reasons for job termination, and several characteristics of hiring firms such as size, age, ownership, location, and sector of activity. Individual characteristics such as age, gender, residence, and nationality and household characteristics such as gender and date of birth of household members are also provided in the database—they are obtained from census records. Every individual in the sample is followed if they maintain any relationship (working, being unemployed receiving benefits or as pensioners) with Social Security records. There are several characteristics that make the CSWH an appropriate database for this aim. Firstly, it is an administrative dataset that provides highly accurate information on employment for {{a random sample of}} 4  % of all Social Security records. The data can be combined with census information on each year so {{that it is possible to}} obtain information about family members. Secondly, it is longitudinal so it is possible to obtain information on the worker’s entire labor market history. Furthermore, it assigns an employer identification code that enables firms, sectors, numbers of workers, and locations to be identified. Type of contract, entry and leaving date, and hours worked are also known. We pool all the information registered in CSWH from 2005 to 2013. Hence, any individual who is included in this dataset for at least 1  day from 2005 to 2013 appears in our sample. The fact that this dataset is compiled only from 2005 onwards disregards it to evaluate the immediate impact of the law, which is the aim of the first part of the paper.
