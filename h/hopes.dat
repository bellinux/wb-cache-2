40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{longitudinal}} {{study was to explore}} 10 patients’ experiences of the meaning they attribute to the substance of <b>hope</b> and the process of <b>hoping</b> during the first 3 to 4 years following a spinal cord injury. This qualitative study is a synthesis of three empirical studies of <b>hope</b> and the overall aim was to deepen the understanding of the phenomenon of <b>hope,</b> based on the text representing the main contextual findings, to develop a theoretical framework on <b>hope</b> within a context of spinal cord injury, illustrated in the conceptual model. In correspondence with Ricoeur, this conceptual model, which was developed from a new understanding, based on a new text of the phenomenon of <b>hope,</b> develops a new and deeper understanding of the meaning of <b>hope.</b> Findings revealed 9 themes: universal <b>hope,</b> uncertain <b>hope,</b> <b>hope</b> as a turning point, the power of <b>hope,</b> boundless creative and flexible <b>hope,</b> enduring <b>hope,</b> despairing <b>hope,</b> body-related <b>hope,</b> and existential <b>hope.</b> The conceptual model was derived from these themes, illustrated as The Battle between Hoping and Suffering and The Road of <b>Hope.</b> The interpretations also revealed a distinction between being in <b>hope</b> and having <b>hope,</b> and having a <b>hope</b> of improvements was the main focus at the early stage of rehabilitation, whereas being in <b>hope</b> as being just fine was the main focus after 3 to 4 years of rehabilitation.

40|$|<b>Hope</b> is a {{neglected}} topic in philosophy. This article tries {{to show that}} <b>hope</b> belongs to the human form of life.

Secondly, we put forward five characteristics of hope: the possibility of that which is <b>hoped</b> for, the temporality of the object of <b>hope,</b> the connection of <b>hope</b> and action, <b>hope</b> and passivity, and <b>hope's</b> connection to language. Finally, we address the main counterarguments against the value of <b>hope</b> and argue that <b>hope</b> {{plays an important role in}} the ability to lead a human life, despite all the criticism it has received in philosophical thinkin...|$|R
5000|$|Snyder {{proposed}} a [...] "Hope Scale" [...] which considered that a person's determination {{to achieve their}} goal is their measured <b>hope.</b> Snyder differentiates between adult-measured <b>hope</b> and child-measured <b>hope.</b> The Adult <b>Hope</b> Scale by Snyder contains 12 questions; 4 measuring 'pathways thinking', 4 measuring 'agency thinking', and 4 that are simply fillers. Each subject responds to each question using an 8-point scale. Fibel and Hale measure <b>hope</b> by combining Snyder's <b>Hope</b> Scale with their own Generalized Expectancy for Success Scale (GESS) to empirically measure <b>hope.</b> Snyder regarded that psychotherapy can help focus attention on one's goals, drawing on tacit {{knowledge of how to}} reach them. Similarly, there is an outlook and a grasp of reality to <b>hope,</b> distinguishing No <b>Hope,</b> Lost <b>Hope,</b> False <b>Hope</b> and Real <b>Hope,</b> which differ in terms of viewpoint and realism.|$|R

40|$|<b>Hope</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in all individuals’ lives both today and in the future. While <b>hope</b> and hopelessness are important concepts and the subjects of much theorizing in psychology, theology, philosophy, political science, nursing, as well as in literature and the arts, it is absent from economics. This silence on <b>hope</b> is notable since <b>hope</b> is fundamentally at the centre of choice, especially intertemporal choice, which is at the centre of economic analysis. To place <b>hope</b> at the centre of intertemporal choice, it is important to clearly define what <b>hope</b> is and what it is not. What <b>hope</b> is not is constant. <b>Hope</b> is not optimism; <b>hope</b> is not unfounded dreams divorced from reality; <b>hope</b> is not irrational. I distil what <b>hope</b> is from its characterization in a number of different disciplines. A comparison of characterizations identifies a number of commonalities and common definitions. Using the derived set of definitions, I incorporate <b>hope</b> into economic analysis, consider what implications <b>hope</b> has for the modelling of choice and for economic behaviour, and discuss whether <b>hope</b> is implicitly imbedded in or has been abandoned, to our eternal cost, by economics. <b>Hope,</b> rational choice, goal orientation, expectations, faith...|$|R
