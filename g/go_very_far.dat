25|$|The {{origins of}} street rail {{transport}} in the Twin Cities {{are not entirely}} known. Some sources state that it dates back to 1867, when businessman and mayor Dorilus Morrison began building rails in downtown Minneapolis. He quickly joined forces with Colonel William S. King and other Minneapolis businessmen to create the Minneapolis Street Railway. However, the lines didn't <b>go</b> <b>very</b> <b>far</b> and the railway was useless for a time. There are some indications that a streetcar was purchased but never used, collecting dust for several years.|$|E
500|$|During that {{championship}} season, Speaker {{is credited}} with introducing the platoon system, which attempted to match right-handed batters against left-handed pitchers and vice versa. Sportswriter John B. Sheridan was among the critics of the system, saying, [...] "The specialist in baseball is no good and won't <b>go</b> <b>very</b> <b>far...</b> The whole effect of the system will be to make the players affected half men... It is farewell, a long farewell to all that player's chance of greatness... It destroys young ball players by destroying their most precious quality – {{confidence in their ability}} to hit any pitcher, left or right, alive, dead, or waiting to be born." [...] Baseball Magazine was supportive, pointing out that Speaker had results that backed up his system.|$|E
500|$|Philippe {{was able}} to get an {{emergency}} loan of $250,000 from a Lebanese company, but this did not <b>go</b> <b>very</b> <b>far</b> to completing the work on the project. [...] He got some help in redrawing his budget and a larger loan of $500,000 from a large Paris bank through J. Jay Frankel, a financier on Wall Street. [...] Philippe's investors believed that the re-budgeting and additional loan would complete {{at least half of the}} resort and allow it to open for business, but Philippe continued to make expensive changes in the project such as adding more windows to all of the suites. [...] When it was evident that the project was once again in financial trouble, one of the investors in the property offered Philippe a loan for an additional $750,000, provided that the project would now result in a more modest resort. [...] Philippe was highly insulted and told the investor offering the additional funding, [...] "I have created a Cadillac. [...] You want to put into it a Chevrolet engine." ...|$|E

500|$|During the season, Scott {{played in}} 12 of 13games, {{including}} 11starts, and recorded 1,133rushing yards and eight touchdowns. In {{the first game}} of the 2008 season against Delaware, Scott ran for 197yards in his first career start, which was enough to place sixteenth on the list for school all-time single-game rushing. The following week, underdog Middle Tennessee stunned Maryland, 24–14, but Scott set the game-high for rushing with 123yards. He tallied his career-first rushing touchdown with a 63-yard run on the second play of the game. Scott [...] "dominated early" [...] against 23rd-ranked California with 19carries for 87yards and two touchdowns, but in the third quarter, he suffered a game-ending shoulder injury. His first-half effort helped Maryland take a quick lead and eventually upset California, 35–27. Scott sat out the next game against Eastern Michigan, but returned for the road game at 20th-ranked Clemson. Scott made 23carries but gained only 39yards, a mark that was surpassed by receiver Heyward-Bey on one reverse that gained 76yards to spark a second-half comeback. Head coach Friedgen said:"I told Da'Rel he needed to run a little more north–south. Clemson has such good team speed. If you go east–west on them, you're not going to <b>go</b> <b>very</b> <b>far.</b> I thought he had a couple runs when he tried to bounce it outside. Normally, Da'Rel can do that. Not against this team... I told him this is a game where three yards is a good running play... I don't know if Da'Rel has been in a game like this, playing the whole game that way in a tough environment. He came out in the second half and said 'I'm going to go, coach.' He patted me on the butt. 'Just get me the ball.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, Action Park {{opened up}} a , two-station bungee jumping tower near the alpine slide off which patrons could jump for a fee.

2500|$|On April 15, 1985, Hagler and Thomas Hearns met in {{what was}} billed as The Fight; later it would become known as [...] "The War." [...] Hagler, despite a cut to the head and being covered in blood, managed to {{overpower}} Hearns {{in the third round}} after a glancing right hand followed by two more rights and a left, scoring a decisive knockout. The first round of Hagler vs. Hearns is often considered to be among the best three minutes in boxing in middleweight history as the two fighters stood toe-to-toe trading blows. Rounds two and three couldn't live up to the first, as Hearns broke his hand in the first round, but were still very competitive. The fight only lasted eight minutes but it is rightly regarded as a classic and is considered to this day to be Hagler's greatest achievement. Commentator Al Michaels uttered the now-immortal line, [...] "It didn't <b>go</b> <b>very</b> <b>far,</b> but it was a beauty!" [...] The fight was named [...] "Fight of the Year" [...] by The Ring.|$|E
