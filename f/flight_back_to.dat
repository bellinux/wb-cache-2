5|$|After {{signing the}} Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942 on 26 May Molotov left for Washington, D.C., United States. Molotov met with Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, and {{ratified}} a Lend-Lease Treaty between the USSR and the US. Both the British and the United States government, albeit vaguely, promised {{to open up}} a second front against Germany. On his <b>flight</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the USSR his plane was attacked by German fighters, and then later by Soviet fighters.|$|E
5|$|Rigoberto Herrera, {{a member}} of the Cuban {{national}} team who had retired and accompanied the team from Cuba as a guest, defected to the United States during the visit. Though six retired players overslept the day after the game in Baltimore and missed their <b>flight</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Cuba, no other members of the delegation defected.|$|E
5|$|Operation Grand Slam commences, and {{it turns}} out that Leiter has indeed found and acted on Bond's message. A battle commences, but Goldfinger escapes. Tilly, a lesbian, hopes that one of the gang leaders, Pussy Galore (leader of a gang of lesbian burglars), will protect her, but she is killed by Oddjob. Goldfinger, Oddjob and the mafia bosses all escape in the melee. Bond is drugged before his <b>flight</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> England and wakes to find he has been {{captured}} by Goldfinger, who has managed to hijack a BOAC jetliner. Bond manages to break a window, causing a depressurisation that blows Oddjob out of the plane; he then fights and strangles Goldfinger. At gunpoint, he forces the crew to ditch in the sea near the Canadian coast, where they are rescued by a nearby weathership.|$|E
50|$|Airline flights {{ended in}} 1966 when United, TWA, Eastern, North Central, Mohawk and Lake Central moved to Metro Airport. USA Jet, a charter airline, has brought <b>flights</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Willow-Run, on DC-9s and MD-82s.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the short}} runway at Trenton-Mercer Airport, the airline served Philadelphia for a short time, but {{consolidated}} its <b>flights</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Trenton, New Jersey in early 1999 when Delta Air Lines terminated their contract to handle ground services.|$|R
5|$|Swift died, aged 44, in the Munich air {{disaster}} after {{reporting on}} Manchester United's European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade in Belgrade, Yugoslavia for the News of the World. On 6 February 1958, the <b>flight</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Manchester carrying the Manchester United team and journalists made a refuelling stop at Munich-Riem Airport in poor weather. Two take-off attempts were abandoned due to engine problems, {{with the weather}} continuing to deteriorate. On the third attempt, slush on the runway prevented the aircraft from reaching the required speed for take-off. The plane veered off the runway and crashed into a house. One of 23 victims of the disaster, Swift {{was one of two}} journalists pulled alive from the wreckage but died on his way to hospital, as his seat belt had cut into his aorta.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} 15 September {{followed}} {{a series of}} raids conducted against Tirpitz by Royal Navy aircraft carriers between April and August 1944 that sought to sink or disable the battleship at her anchorage in Kaafjord in the far north of German-occupied Norway, so that she no longer posed a threat to Allied convoys travelling {{to and from the}} Soviet Union. While the first of these raids was successful, the other attacks failed due to shortcomings with the Fleet Air Arm's strike aircraft and the formidable German defences. As a result, the task of attacking the battleship was transferred to the RAF's Bomber Command. Avro Lancaster bombers from the Command's two elite squadrons flew to their staging airfield in the Soviet Union on the night of 11/12 September, and attacked on 15 September using heavy bombs and air-dropped mines. All of the British aircraft returned to base, though one of the Lancasters later crashed during its <b>flight</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{established}} a new archaeological journal, Ancient India, planning {{for it to}} be published twice a year. He had trouble securing printing paper and faced various delays; the first issue was released in January 1946, and he would release three further volumes during his stay. Wheeler married Kim Collingridge in Simla, before he and his wife took part in an Indian Cultural Mission to Iran. The Indian government had deemed Wheeler ideal to lead the group, which departed via train to Zahidan before visiting Persepolis, Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Pasargadae, and Kashan. Wheeler enjoyed the trip, and was envious of Tehran's archaeological museum and library, which was far in advance of anything then found in India. Crossing into Iraq, in Baghdad the team caught a <b>flight</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Delhi. In 1946, he was involved in a second cultural mission, this time to Afghanistan, where he expressed a particular interest in the kingdom of ancient Bactria and visited the archaeology of Balkh.|$|E
5000|$|The Kosovo Foreign Ministry urged Kosovars {{to leave}} Egypt. In {{the absence of}} {{diplomatic}} {{relations between the two}} states, citizens in distress were instructed to seek help from the Turkish embassy. The chairman of the New Kosovo Alliance Behgjet Pacolli organised <b>flights</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Kosovo for some 160-odd Kosovas at his own expense.|$|R
25|$|The second prong of the American {{approach}} to containment {{has been to}} maintain strict entry controls to the country for people with HIV or AIDS.

50|$|The C-47 {{took the}} craft to an {{altitude}} of 12,000 ft, where free <b>flights</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Rogers Dry Lake began. Pilot for the first series of flights of the M2-F1 was NASA research pilot Milt Thompson. Typical glide flights with the M2-F1 lasted about two minutes and reached speeds of 110 to 120 mph.|$|R
5|$|The quartet never competed {{as a unit}} {{after the}} Moscow Olympics. Tonelli retired {{immediately}} after the Games, while Kerry took an extended break. The backstroker attempted a comeback in the leadup to the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, but his abbreviated preparation before the selection trials was not enough and he was defeated by other swimmers. This left Evans and Brooks as the only members of the 1980 team to participate in Australia's medley relay victory at the Commonwealth Games. In 1984, Kerry secured a recall to the team as Australia's preferred backstroker, while Brooks was surpassed by Mark Stockwell as the leading freestyler. Australia came third in the 1984 Summer Olympics in the medley relay as the Americans returned to the Olympic fold; Evans and Kerry swam in the final, while Brooks did the freestyle leg in the heats. Evans and Kerry retired after the Olympics, and Brooks was not the first-choice swimmer in 1986, meaning that a totally different quartet competed in the medley relay at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. Brooks was suspended for drunken behaviour on the <b>flight</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Australia, and then retired, and all {{four members of the}} Quietly Confident Quartet had departed the Australian swimming scene.|$|E
5|$|Returning to North America, Sweatt {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with the Vancouver Canucks on May 31, 2010. Nearly three months later, the Canucks also signed Sweatt's brother, Bill, from Colorado College. Following the pre-season, the Canucks assigned both Sweatt brothers to their AHL affiliate, the Manitoba Moose. Joining the Moose, Lee and Bill became the first pair of brothers in the team's history {{to play for the}} club at the same time. After recording 14 points in 41 AHL games, the Canucks recalled him on January 23, 2011. Filling in for injured defenseman Alex Edler, he made his NHL debut three days later against the Nashville Predators. He scored his first NHL goal that night, a game-winner in the third period against goaltender Pekka Rinne; the Canucks won the game 2–1. The following shift, he blocked a shot from Predators defenseman Shea Weber with his foot; a post-game X-ray diagnosed him with severe bruising. After resting the foot over the All-Star break, he played in two more games for the Canucks, before being reassigned to the Moose. On the morning of his scheduled <b>flight</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Manitoba, he blocked another shot during a Canucks practice, breaking his foot. Sweatt was consequently retained on the NHL team's roster and placed on the long-term injured reserve list (injured players are not eligible to be sent down to the minors). Unable to skate on his injured foot until mid-June, Sweatt was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E

This set up a winner take all showdown back in St. Louis three days later.|$|E
25|$|On 24 July 2012, an 11-year-old boy went {{straight}} through security {{and managed to}} board the nearest boarding flight from security in T1, which was a Jet2 flight to Rome.

The C4 was actually first flown on 9 April 2015. The initial flight data showed that it met its design performance goals and had benign approach to stall characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Against Luidinga's argument, {{the troop}} ship Khedive Ismail survived whereas the destroyers Diamond and Wryneck were sunk. And had the convoy been 20 {{nautical}} miles further south, Vendetta, Waterhen and Wryneck could have met it at 0800 instead of 0915 hrs, increasing both its anti-aircraft fire and capacity to rescue survivors. The distance from Almyros allowed the same Stukas to make repeated attack runs, although on the <b>flight</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> base one stopped at Corinth to refuel. Increasing their round trip by 40 nautical miles might have marginally reduced the aircraft's ability to attack repeatedly.|$|E
25|$|Fernandes met Leila Kabir, the {{daughter}} of educationist and former Union minister Humayun Kabir on a <b>flight</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Delhi from Calcutta.
