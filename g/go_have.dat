5|$|Physical {{limitations}} of computer hardware aside, in principle {{it is possible}} to solve any game under the condition that the complete state is known and there is no random chance. Strong solutions, i.e. algorithms that can produce perfect play from any position, are known for some simple games such as Tic Tac Toe/Noughts and crosses (draw with perfect play) and Connect Four (first player wins). Weak solutions exist for somewhat more complex games, such as checkers (with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw, but it is not known for every position created by less-than-perfect play what the perfect next move would be). Other games, such as chess (from the starting position) and <b>Go,</b> <b>have</b> not been solved because their game complexity is too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions. To reduce the game complexity, researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board, or the number of pieces, or both.|$|E

500|$|After {{surviving}} a thunderstorm, {{the flying}} house lands on a tepui opposite Paradise Falls.

Russell encounters a tall, colorful flightless bird, known as the mythical [...] "Snipe", whom he names [...] "Kevin". They then meet a Golden Retriever named Dug, who wears a special collar {{that allows him to}} speak and who vows to take the bird to his master. The next day, they encounter a pack of aggressive dogs led by Alpha, a Doberman Pinscher, and are taken to their master, who turns out to be Charles Muntz. Muntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his dirigible, where he explains to them that he is searching for a giant bird. When Russell notes the bird's similarity to Kevin, Muntz becomes hostile, believing they are attempting to capture the bird themselves. Carl flees with Kevin and Dug, but Muntz captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath Carl's house, forcing him to choose between saving it or Kevin. After Carl saves the house, he and Russell eventually reach the falls, though Russell is upset at Carl for abandoning Kevin. Carl looks through Ellie's childhood scrapbook and is surprised to find that she has filled in the blank pages with photos of their marriage, along with a note thanking him for the [...] "adventure" [...] and encouraging him to <b>go</b> <b>have</b> a new one.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the book}} Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests, Chevy Chase recalls being confronted by Murray shortly before an SNL {{broadcast}} in which Chase {{had returned to}} guest host. The issue, likely to do with Chase's insistence on doing the [...] "Weekend Update" [...] segment that had {{been taken over by}} Jane Curtin, led to Murray and Chase trading insults, with Murray telling Chase to <b>go</b> <b>have</b> sex with Jacqueline Carlin, Chase's wife at the time, while Chase commented that Murray's face looked [...] "like something Neil Armstrong had landed on." [...] The argument eventually turned physical. Murray later said of the incident, [...] "It was an Oedipal thing, a rupture. Because we all felt mad he had left us, and somehow I was the anointed avenging angel, who had to speak for everyone. But Chevy and I are friends now. It’s all fine.” The two later starred together in Caddyshack in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|Sun News Network, as a {{compulsory}} condition of its broadcast licence, held {{membership in the}} Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC), and had {{to adhere to the}} CBSC's member-written Code of Ethics. A violation of the Code occurred on December 22, 2011, when Ezra Levant, in a commentary on The Source, blasted Chiquita Brands International and its ethical record after the company stated it would discontinue using oil produced from the Alberta oil sands. Speaking in Spanish, Levant told an Hispanic Chiquita executive to <b>go</b> <b>have</b> sexual relations with his mother. The CBSC received 22 complaints about Levant's use of the slur, a few noting that {{it is one of the}} nastiest insults in the Spanish language. Though Sun News and Levant went on to argue that the phrase can have several meanings, Levant later admitted he intended to use the term in its literal, most vulgar sense. With that, the CBSC determined in June 2012 that, though Levant had his right to criticize Chiquita and its management, his use of the Spanish vulgarity violated Clause 6 of the Code of Ethics, which requires [...] "full, fair and proper presentation of news, opinion, comment and editorial" [...] content; as a result, Sun News was required to issue an on-air announcement of the CBSC decision.|$|E
2500|$|Reviews of the PSP <b>Go</b> <b>have</b> been mixed. It {{was mainly}} criticized for its initial pricing, with Ars Technica calling it [...] "way too expensive" [...] and The Guardian stating that cost is the [...] "biggest issue" [...] facing the machine. Engadget {{points out that}} the Go costs only $50 less than the PlayStation 3, which comes {{equipped}} with a Blu-ray player. Wired {{points out that the}} older PSP 3000 model is cheaper, while supporting UMDs and IGN states that the price increase makes it a [...] "hard sell". The lack of support for UMDs and the inability to transfer games bought on UMD onto the Go and the placement of the analog stick next to the d-pad has also been criticized. Reviewers also commented on how the change from a mini-USB port to a proprietary port means that hardware and cables bought for previous incarnations of the PSP are not compatible. The Go's screen has been positively received with Ars Technica calling the image [...] "brilliant, sharp and clear", T3 state that [...] "pictures and videos look great". The controls have received mixed reviews with The Times describing them as [...] "instantly familiar" [...] whereas CNET and Stuff call the position of the analog stick [...] "awkward". The ability to use a PS3 controller was praised by The New Zealand Heraldbut Ars Technica criticized the need to connect the controller and Go to a PS3 for initial setup.|$|E

2500|$|As an illustration, the {{strategy}} board-games chess and <b>Go</b> <b>have</b> rigorous rules {{in which no}} information (such as cards' face-values) is hidden from either player and no random events (such as dice-rolling) happen within the game. Yet, chess and especially Go with its extremely simple deterministic rules, can still have an extremely large number of unpredictable moves. When chess is simplified to 7 or fewer pieces, however, there are endgame tables available which dictate which moves to play to achieve a perfect game. [...] The implication {{of this is that}} given a less complex environment (with the original 32 pieces reduced to 7 or fewer pieces), a perfectly predictable game of chess is possible to achieve. [...] In this scenario, the winning player would be able to announce a checkmate happening in at most a given number of moves assuming a perfect defense by the losing player, or fewer moves if the defending player chooses sub-optimal moves as the game progresses into its inevitable, predicted conclusion. By this analogy, it is suggested, the experience of free will emerges from the interaction of finite rules and deterministic parameters that generate nearly infinite and practically unpredictable behavioural responses. In theory, if all these events could be accounted for, and there were a known way to evaluate these events, the seemingly unpredictable behaviour would become predictable. Another hands-on example of generative processes is John Horton Conway's playable Game of Life. Nassim Taleb is wary of such models, and coined the term [...] "ludic fallacy".|$|E
