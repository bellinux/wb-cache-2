5|$|In Tan Eng Hong, the Court of Appeal {{stated that}} the same test for {{standing}} applies to both declarations and prerogative orders, and read the statements from Chan Hiang Leng Colin quoted above as an implicit acceptance that an applicant must demonstrate the violation of a right personal to him or <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> standing.|$|E
5|$|Aged 18, Dot married Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock). The {{following}} year, {{he forced}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an abortion; threatening {{to leave her}} if she did not, but left anyway {{because it was a}} bigamous marriage. While Dot was giving birth to their son, Nick (John Altman), Charlie {{was having an affair with}} her sister, Rose, in Liverpool. She raised Nick alone, but was not an affectionate mother.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Alfonso XIII {{finally was}} {{completed}} on 18 May 1900, {{and she was}} commissioned the same day. Her shortcomings in seaworthiness led <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> a short career, and she was soon stricken and scrapped.|$|R
50|$|As an {{only child}} Gray {{spent most of her}} time {{participating}} in extra curriculars such as Art, Drama, Math and Science Extension classes along with Karate, Dance and Singing lessons which led <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>her</b> love of arts from a young age.|$|R
5|$|All five {{songs on}} the {{extended}} play (EP) were written and produced by Chana and Chan. The pair worked on Manos Arriba for roughly two years and recorded it in Chan's recording studio in the garage of his home in Echo Park, Los Angeles. They initially created the material {{as a way to}} secure a record deal, but later decided to release it independently. Chana later said that the decision allowed <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more creative input on her music and image. They completed eighteen tracks and chose five for the EP.|$|E
5|$|An {{inventory}} {{drawn up}} at the Hôtel de la Reine after Catherine's death shows <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a keen collector. Listed works of art included tapestries, hand-drawn maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, ebony furniture inlaid with ivory, sets of china, and Limoges pottery. There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by Jean Clouet (1480–1541) and his son François Clouet (1572). François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of {{many members of the}} court. After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Sing was {{contacted}} by the World Wrestling Federation to help their ailing women's division. She, however, was repackaged as Bertha Faye, a comedic character {{who lived in a}} trailer park and dated Harvey Wippleman. (in an OWW radio interview Wippleman revealed that the two never got along well) WWF management originally wanted <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an on-screen feud with Bull Nakano, but there was a change of plans after Nakano was charged with cocaine possession.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} how strong Matilda's {{personal}} piety was, although contemporaries praised her lifelong preference to be buried at the monastic site of Bec rather than the grander but more worldly Rouen, and believed <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> substantial, underlying religious beliefs. Like {{other members of the}} Anglo-Norman nobility, she bestowed considerable patronage on the Church. Early on in her life, she preferred the well-established Benedictine monastery of Cluny alongside some of the newer Augustinian orders, such as the Victorines and Premonstratensians. As part of this patronage, she re-founded the abbey of Notre-Dame-du-Vœu near Cherbourg.|$|E
5|$|R {{married his}} wife in August 1984 but the {{marriage}} became strained, and his wife moved back to her parents' house in October 1989, leaving a letter expressing her intention to seek a divorce. A few weeks later, in November 1989, R broke into the house while his wife's parents were out, and attempted to force <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sexual intercourse with him against her will. He also assaulted her, squeezing his hands around her neck.|$|E
5|$|She was {{the only}} child from her parents' {{marriage}} but had several half-brothers and sisters from their new relationships. In her early life, she lived in various Surrey towns, including Walton-on-Thames, Weybridge, Esher and Cobham. Her father wanted <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a good education so, despite the family's Protestant religion, sent her to various Catholic convent schools around the county. One was St Maur's Convent School in Weybridge, which she attended with Liza Tarbuck. Ripley did not feel academically challenged there, and later declared the school mediocre.|$|E

5|$|After he {{was married}} in December 1933, Cooper {{remained}} faithful to his wife until the summer of 1942, when he began an affair with Ingrid Bergman during the production of For Whom the Bell Tolls. Their relationship lasted through the completion of filming Saratoga Trunk in June 1943. In 1948, after finishing work on The Fountainhead, Cooper began an affair with actress Patricia Neal, his co-star. At first they kept their affair discreet, but eventually it became an open secret in Hollywood, and Cooper's wife confronted him with the rumors, which he admitted were true. He also confessed {{that he was in}} love with Neal, and continued to see her. Cooper and his wife were legally separated in May 1951, but he did not seek a divorce. Neal later claimed that Cooper hit her after she went on a date with Kirk Douglas, and that he arranged for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an abortion when she became pregnant with Cooper's child. Neal ended their relationship in late December 1951. During his three-year separation from his wife, Cooper was rumored to have had affairs with Grace Kelly, Lorraine Chanel, and Gisèle Pascal.|$|E
5|$|By tradition, Anna {{is said to}} {{have had}} a fourth daughter, Wihtburh, an abbess at Dereham (or {{possibly}} West Dereham), where there was a royal double monastery. She may never have existed: Bede fails to mention her and she first appears in a calendar in the late 10th century Bosworth Psalter. She may have been a character specifically created by the religious community at Ely, where her remains were supposed to have been taken after being stolen from Dereham and subsequently used as visual proof of the incorruptibility of a saint's body, a substitute for her sister Æthelthryth, whose body had to remain unexamined in her tomb. Manuscript F of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which dates from about 1100, mentions Wihtburh's death when it records that her body was found uncorrupted in 798, 55 years after she died. The resulting date for her death of 743 is too far too late for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a sister of Æthelthryth, who was born in 636.|$|E
5|$|Clara and Merry flee {{back to the}} {{ceremony}} and the Doctor faces the creature, realising it feeds off memories, stories, and feelings. He tries to overfeed it by offering {{the sum total of}} his Time Lord memories; Merry also leads the citizens in a song of hope, confusing Akhaten who then disappears. However, the Doctor's memories are not enough to sate the creature and Akhaten reappears. Clara returns to help, offering Akhaten the leaf that blew into her father's face on the day he met her mother, which contains an infinite amount of untold potential that Clara's mother never saw because she died early. Akhaten, overwhelmed by the infinite potential it has consumed, implodes on itself and the Rings are saved. The Doctor returns Clara to her home on the same day they left and gives her back her mother's ring, telling her that all the creatures she saved wanted <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it back. Suddenly Clara remembers seeing the Doctor at her mother's funeral and asks why he was there. He tells her that she reminds him of someone who died and she rebukes him for using her as a replacement, but he assures her she is not a replacement and Clara leaves. However, the moment she is gone, the Doctor's expression becomes grim and closes the TARDIS door from which Clara left.|$|E

5|$|Ellet and Stephens {{continued}} {{writing to}} Griswold's ex-wife, urging <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the divorce repealed. Myers was finally convinced and filed in Philadelphia on September 23, 1853. The court, however, had lost {{records of the}} divorce and had to delay the appeal. Adding to Griswold's troubles, that fall, a gas leak in his home caused an explosion and a fire. He was severely burned, losing his eyelashes, eyebrows, and seven of his finger nails. That same year, his 15-year-old daughter, Emily, nearly died in Connecticut. A train she was riding on had fallen off a drawbridge into a river. When Griswold arrived he saw 49corpses in a makeshift morgue. Emily had been pronounced dead when pinned underwater but a doctor was able to revive her. On February 24, 1856, the divorce appeal went to court, with Ellet and Stephens providing lengthy testimony against Griswold's character. Neither Griswold nor Myers attended and the appeal was dismissed. Embarrassed by the ordeal, McCrillis left Griswold in New York and moved in with family in Bangor, Maine.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) {{shows up}} in Scranton after Robert California (James Spader) allows <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a job there. She is invited to take an open desk, and she takes Andy's manager desk, as he is absent. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) says she cannot take Andy's job, but Robert is {{interested}} in her spontaneous behavior. As acting manager, Nellie decides to give everyone performance reviews. Both Jim and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) refuse to let her proceed, as she is unfamiliar with the other employees. To counter this, Nellie offers Dwight a raise on the spot, and eventually, {{he and the other}} employees relent, except for Jim. When it is Jim's turn, Jim still refuses. Everyone in the office, except for Jim and his wife, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), applaud her. Nellie promptly begins rearranging the office.|$|E
5|$|Naomi {{lives with}} her hippy mother Gina (Olivia Colman) and fifteen other people in a {{communal}} living arrangement. This {{is a source of}} annoyance to Naomi, whose privacy is invaded when she wakes up one morning, naked, to discover that a male hippy is sleeping in her bed. At college, she avoids Emily to meet with her politics teacher Kieran instead. In the students' common room, they are informed of the upcoming elections for Student President. Emily encourages Naomi to run for president, but Naomi refuses. She later comes across Cook, who tries to persuade <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex with him. She jokingly tells him that he has a better chance of winning the student elections, which he sees as a challenge and decides to register. Kieran walks her {{home at the end of}} the day and urges her to run in the elections, giving her a registration form. When she arrives at her house, she finds Emily waiting in her bedroom with another registration form. Emily starts to leave when Naomi is rude and standoffish to herdespite taking Emily's advice to enter the electionsbut returns and confronts her. She coldly tells her that she is not obsessed with pursuing a sexual relationship with her, and Naomi suggests she stay the night with her.|$|E

5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to throw out the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E
5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities {{should not be}} limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E

Ste and Wayne push Josh and Fletch into rebelling, which they go along with in order to impress them. Amy becomes pregnant by a stranger, but does not tell Ste. Afterwards, Ste confides in Amy about the abuse he had to deal with from his stepfather. Ste takes Fletch, Amy, Josh and Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes) joyriding and causes a car accident, after which he flees. Following a confession to the police from Fletch, Ste is sent to a young offender's institute.|$|E
