25|$|In 1814 Kingsmill {{became the}} first vessel to sail to India under a license from the EIC after the EIC lost its {{monopoly}} on trade with India. She sailed after George Canning wrote on 16 May 1814 to Secretary of the Admiralty John Wilson Croker requesting an exemption for her from the requirement that vessels travel in convoy. She had missed the convoy and Croker argued that Gladstone would suffer a substantial financial loss <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> await the next convoy. Croker further argued that Kingsmill was well-armed and so would not be vulnerable to attacks from most privateers.|$|E

25|$|Saint Mechtilde of Helfta (d.1298) {{became an}} ardent devotee and {{promoter}} of Jesus’ heart {{after it was}} the subject of many of her visions. The idea of hearing the heartbeat of God was very important to medieval saints who nurtured devotion to the Sacred Heart. Mechtilde reported that Jesus appeared to her in a vision and commanded her to love Him ardently, and to honor his sacred heart in the Blessed Sacrament as much as possible. He gave her his heart as a pledge of his love, as a place of refuge during her life and as her consolation at the hour of her death. From this time Mechtilde had an extraordinary devotion for the Sacred Heart, and said that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> write down all the favors and all the blessings which she had received by means of this devotion, a large book would not contain them.|$|E
500|$|Years later, Wintour {{admitted}} the photo {{had never been}} planned as the cover shot. In 2011, when Vogue put its entire archive online, Wintour was quoted as saying, [...] "I just said, 'Well, let's just try this.' And off we went. It was just very natural. To me it just said, 'This is something new. This is something different.' [...] The printers called {{to make sure that}} was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made." [...] In 2015 she said <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pick a favorite of her covers, it would be that one. [...] "t was a leap of faith and it was certainly a big change for Vogue." ...|$|E

Shanina was appointed a commander of that platoon. Three days later, southeast of Vitebsk, Shanina killed her first German soldier. In Shanina's own words, recorded by an anonymous author, her legs gave way after that first encounter and she slid down into the trench, saying, [...] "I've killed a man." [...] Concerned, the other women ran up saying, [...] "That was a fascist you finished off!" [...] Seven months later, Shanina wrote in her diary that she was now killing the enemy in cold blood and saw the meaning {{of her life in}} her actions. She wrote that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do everything over again, she would still strive to enter the sniper academy and would go to the front again.|$|E

2500|$|In 1994 McLachlan was sued by Uwe Vandrei, an obsessed fan from Ottawa, who {{alleged that}} his letters to her {{had been the}} basis of the single [...] "Possession". The lawsuit was also {{challenging}} for the Canadian legal system: Vandrei was an admitted stalker whose acknowledged goal in filing the lawsuit was to be near McLachlan. Consequently, precautions were taken to ensure McLachlan's safety <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be in the same location as Vandrei. Before the trial began however, Vandrei was found dead in an apparent suicide. Vandrei's preoccupation with McLachlan was explored at length in Canadian author Judith Fitzgerald's book, Building a Mystery: The Story of Sarah McLachlan & Lilith Fair.|$|E
2500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance {{said that}} Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters {{and the truth}} of the situation. [...] "She doesn't act," [...] said Camille co-star Rex O’Malley; [...] "she lives her roles." [...] Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer [...] "Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> look at one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her expression. You could see it in her eyes as she looked from one to the other. And nobody else has {{been able to do that}} on screen." [...] Director George Sidney adds [...] "You could call it underplaying but in underplaying she overplayed everyone else." ...|$|E

2500|$|The tenth {{match was}} between The Total Package and Sting (accompanied by Elizabeth). Prior to the match, Sting was shown handing Elizabeth {{a can of}} what he said was spray, and told her to use it <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to.</b> [...] The Total Package {{attacked}} Sting as he entered the ring, and continued to have the advantage. Elizabeth climbed onto the apron, and this allowed Sting to fight back. After they knocked down each other with a clothesline, Elizabeth came into the ring, and revealed her alliance with The Total Package by attempting to use the spray on Sting. [...] Unfortunately for her, it was actually a can of silly string, revealing that Sting anticipated being betrayed by his confidante (a common occurrence in Sting's career). Sting performed a Stinger splash to The Total Package, and attempted to apply the Scorpion Deathlock. Elizabeth hit Sting with a baseball bat, and Sting won the match by disqualification. After the match, The Total Package attacked Sting's right arm with a steel chair and the bat.|$|E
2500|$|When Pitt died on 23 January 1806, Fox was {{the last}} {{remaining}} great political figure of the era, and {{could no longer be}} denied a place in government. When Grenville formed a [...] "Ministry of All the Talents" [...] out of his supporters, the followers of Addington and the Foxites, Fox was once again offered the post of Foreign Secretary, which he accepted in February. Fox was convinced (as he had been since Napoleon's accession) that France desired a lasting peace and that he was [...] "sure that two civil sentences from the Ministers would ensure Peace". Therefore, peace talks were speedily entered into by Fox and his old friend Talleyrand, now French foreign minister. However, by July the mood had completely changed and Fox was forced to acknowledge that his assessment of Napoleon's pacific intentions were wrong. Negotiations over Hanover, Naples, Sicily, and Malta faltered and Talleyrand vetoed Russian participation in the negotiations. King George believed this was a ploy to divide Britain and Russia as French interests would suffer <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> deal with an Anglo-Russian alliance, with Fox forced to agree that the King's belief was [...] "but too well founded".|$|E
