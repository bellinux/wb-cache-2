5|$|Kingdom Plantae {{belongs to}} Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is {{separately}} classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species. The scientific {{name of a}} plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet. The combination {{is the name of}} the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it <b>is</b> <b>proper</b> to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} the masque within the play deals with hiding one's identity. Fielding, like many other playwrights, focuses on how the masque genre deals with the social {{acceptability}} of altering identities within the format. However, Fielding extends the image to discuss society and those who impersonate social and gender roles {{that they do not}} fill. Fielding also has a problem with those who act viciously with license even though he is willing to accept some of the lesser libertine actions. Merital, for instance, is a sexual type of libertine and is treated differently than those like Sir Positive Trap, Lord Formal, and Sir Apish Simple who are criticised as being part of the corrupted order. Trap and Formal are part of old families, and their attachment to the age of their families and their attempts to use that to justify their beliefs over what <b>is</b> <b>proper</b> is ridiculed within the play. In particular, Merital is the one able to point out their flaws.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — For several semirings S, two {{weighted}} finite automata with multiplicities in S are equivalent if {{and only}} if they can be connected by a chain of simulations. Such a semiring S is called “proper”. It is known that the Boolean semiring, the semiring of natural numbers, the ring of integers, all finite commutative positively ordered semirings and all fields <b>are</b> <b>proper.</b> The semiring S is Noetherian if every subsemimodule of a finitely generated S-semimodule is finitely generated. First, it is shown that all Noetherian semirings and thus all commutative rings and all finite semirings <b>are</b> <b>proper.</b> Second, the tropical semiring is shown not to <b>be</b> <b>proper.</b> So far there has not been any example of a semiring that <b>is</b> not <b>proper...</b>|$|R

25|$|The most {{effective}} method for preventing CDI <b>is</b> <b>proper</b> antimicrobial prescribing. In the hospital setting, where CDI is most common, nearly all patients who develop CDI {{are exposed to}} antimicrobials. Although proper antimicrobial prescribing is highly recommended, about 50% of antimicrobial use is considered inappropriate. This is consistent whether in the hospital, clinic, community, or academic setting. A decrease in CDI by limiting antibiotics or by limiting unnecessary antimicrobial prescriptions in general, both in an outbreak and non-outbreak setting has been demonstrated to be most strongly associated with reduced CDI. Further, reactions to medication may be severe: CDI infections were the most common contributor to adverse drug events seen in U.S. hospitals in 2011. In some regions of the UK, reduced used of fluoroquinolone antibiotics seems to lead to reduced rates of CDI.|$|E
25|$|In the 1919 Cost Accounting Nicholson and Rohrbach again {{deal with}} the admittedly {{controversial}} {{question as to whether}} it <b>is</b> <b>proper</b> to treat normal interest return on passive investment as a part of manufacturing costs, the position is taken that interest on fixed assets should be so charged, but not interest on floating capital investment. The charging of some interest item is considered necessary to the successful distribution of overhead. Or, more exactly, normal return on passive investment is regarded as overhead to be distributed among the factory products. The authors in chapter IV considers that the opposition argument is directed chiefly at the practice of making these charges as part of the regular costs, not at the mere calculation thereof for use in statistical report form in the quotation of prices. He therefore suggests (p.140) an accounting procedure supposed to meet this objection.|$|E
