40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of structural wide flange steel sections introduces residual stresses in the material. These stresses due to hot-rolling or welding influence the <b>inelastic</b> <b>buckling</b> response of structural steel members {{and need to}} be taken into account in the design. Based on experimental data standardized residual stress models have been proposed for inclusion in <b>inelastic</b> <b>buckling</b> analyses.

Roller bent wide flange sections are manufactured by curving straight members at ambient temperature. This manufacturing technique, which is also known as roller bending, stresses the material beyond its yield stress, thereby overriding the initial residual stresses prior to bending and generating an entirely new pattern. This paper proposes a residual stress model for roller bent wide flange sections, based on earlier conducted numerical investigations which were validated by experimental research performed at Eindhoven University of Technology.

40|$|Attempts {{to extend}} {{practical}} advanced {{analyses of the}} in-plane behaviour of 2 -D steel frames under in-plane loading to out-of-plane behaviour have been largely unsuccessful because of difficulties in modeling the effects of yielded zones, load heights, interactions between twist and axial force and moments, and end warping restraints. Advanced analyses {{need to be able}} to account for the influences of moment and axial force distributions, load heights, and end restraints on elastic and <b>inelastic</b> lateral <b>buckling,</b> and to be consistent with the code formulations of beam and column out-of-plane strengths. This paper reviews extensions of methods of advanced analysis beyond those for the in-plane behaviour of 2 -D frames for which local buckling is prevented towards the behaviour of 3 -D frames under general loading. An early step towards this goal is the development of an advanced analysis for the out-of-plane behaviour of 2 -D frames under in-plane loading. It has been proposed that this should be simplified by first carrying out an in-plane analysis using one of the presently available plastic hinge methods, and then by using a practical advanced analysis of the out-of-plane behaviour which is based on an <b>inelastic</b> lateral <b>buckling</b> analysis which includes allowances for residual stresses and initial crookednesses and twists. This paper discusses some of the difficulties to be overcome in the development of such a method, so that future attempts to develop advanced analyses for the lateral buckling of 2 -D frames for which local buckling is prevented can systematically assess these difficulties and develop methods of overcoming them.

In typical structural engineering problems, such as <b>inelastic</b> local <b>buckling</b> of beams and plastic collapse of plates, a shell formulation based on finite displacements and finite rotations but small strains gives a sufficiently accurate representation of the kinematics, whereas the material is often well described by an elastic-plastic constitutive model. In prior studies, geometrically nonlinear problems involving linear elastic materials have been investigated [1, 2]; but in ultimate load analysis the inelastic material behavior has to be taken into account, and therefore error estimates and adaptive strategies for elastic-plastic materials are required.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} <b>inelastic</b> local <b>buckling</b> of I-beam flanges made of steel. The main {{focus is on}} the {{theoretical}} description of the buckling process, and the influence of various parameters, e. g. the plastic modulus, yield plateau, yield stress etc., on the buckling process. In the thesis, discussion on the relevancy of different constitutive models for the inelastic behaviour of steel are discussed, and a theoretical model for the <b>inelastic</b> local flange <b>buckling</b> is presented. In the theoretical models of the <b>inelastic</b> local <b>buckling</b> problem presented in the past, there has been quite some confusion about what constitutive model is applicable. The incremental theory has been applied by some, the deformation theory of plasticity has been used by others also relatively recently, and the theory of Lay has been used by others. In this thesis, it is concluded that the incremental theory of plasticity based on an isotropically hardening von Mises yield surface in combination with the associated flow rule is applicable for the modelling of <b>inelastic</b> local flange <b>buckling.</b> The theory of Lay is concluded nonvalid. A simple slip plane theory which in distinction to the mathematical theory of plasticity is based on the physical mechanism of plastic deformation, and in its present form valid for a subspace of stress containing shear and normal stress, has been developed in the thesis. This slip plane theory is in good agreement with the incremental theory of plasticity. For the modelling of the flange buckling, the buckling process is assumed to consist of three phases without any distinct borders in between. The first phase is considered related to mainly torsional deformations and can hence be seen as a torsional buckling phase. The second phase is associated with progressively lesser shear stiffness of the material and plate bending is introduced. In the third phase, the shear stiffness is wiped out and plate bending is assumed to resist the buckling entirely. The first phase is modelled as the <b>inelastic</b> torsional <b>buckling</b> of a thin plate, restrained so as to avoid any other instability mode. This includes the description of the inelastic torsion of a thin plate. For that purpose, the plate is assumed to be composed of an infinite number of rectangular hollow cross sections. This first phase mainly governs the buckling stress and the ductility of the flange. Herein, the term ductility is used for deformation capacity in general, and hence by ductility of a compressed flange is ment the amount of axial shortening during which the flange is able to resist a compressive mean stress equal to or exceeding the yield stress. The second phase is not considered in the modelling. Instead, the first phase is directly followed by the third phase in the model. In this third phase, the flange buckle is considered as a yield line mechanism. In this yield line buckle model, the effect of stress redistribution is accounted for. The two models are linked together to a unified model and hence this model is able to approximately describe the mean stress-mean strain relation of a locally buckling flange. Using this model, a parametric study is performed in order to investigate the dependence of the flange buckling behaviour on various parameters. It is concluded that parameters like the plastic modulus, length of yield plateau, initial imperfections, and residual stresses have only a relatively moderate effect on the buckling process. Quite naturally, the parameters that has the most effect on the buckling behaviour is the width to thickness ratio and the yield stress. However, according to the procedure in the codes, these parameters are combined in the definition of a so called slenderness parameter, defined as the square root of the yield stress over the critical stress. Hence this parameter is in the codes assumed as the only governing parameter with respect to local buckling. The parameter study however reveals this approach as not entirely correct. From the theoretical model, it seems like this approach is unfavourable to high strength steel. In order to verify the conclusions from the theoretical modelling, experiments were made on crusiform stub columns. In all 22 specimen were compressed and the specimen were made of two materials, namely Weldox 700, with a nominal lower yield strength of 700 MPa and hence representing high strength steel, and SS 1312, with a nominal lower yield strength of 220 MPa thereby representing the ordinary steel grades. Hence for each material 11 stub columns with varying slenderness with respect to flange buckling were tested. The experimental results agreed fairly well with the results from the theoretical model.

For columns, <b>inelastic</b> flexural <b>buckling</b> loads can be obtained using LBA with appropriate stiffness reduction, while GNA with stiffness reduction is required to determine an accurate prediction of beam-column failure. The accuracy and practicality of the proposed method is shown in several examples, including regular and irregular members. For the latter case in particular, it is found that the proposed approach provides more accurate capacity predictions than traditional design methods, when compared to results generated by means of nonlinear finite element modelling...|$|R
