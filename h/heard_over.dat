The following day, the king was brought before a public session of the commission, declared guilty and sentenced. Fifty-nine of the commissioners signed Charles's death warrant.|$|E

5|$|La Grange draws {{attention}} to the notably high tessitura for the sopranos, for soloists and for choral singers. He characterises the alto solos as brief and unremarkable; however, the tenor solo role in PartII is both extensive and demanding, requiring on several occasions to be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> the choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular challenges to the bass soloist.|$|E

5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|The sonorous {{sound of}} the bell was also used to warn of {{impending}} typhoons and as a general alert. Because the ringing of a temple bell could be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> considerable distances, it was also sometimes used for other signalling purposes; there are records of temple bells being used for military communication from {{as far back as}} the Genpei War (1180–1185 CE). Smaller versions were subsequently cast for battlefield use, as the large temple bells were too heavy and unwieldy to transport. These smaller bonshō were used primarily as alarms to warn of enemy attacks; commands were given using drums and conches.|$|E

5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> the engines.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{acquired}} the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, {{he could barely}} be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> {{the sound of the}} group. After about three months, he realized that he needed an electric guitar in order to continue. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When someone stole his guitar after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.|$|E
5|$|Theophilus, {{through his}} father, {{applied to the}} Lord Chamberlain during the summer asking {{to have a new}} license issued, but he was refused. Following this, he applied to Charles Lee, the Master of the Revels, and {{received}} a license to perform theatrical shows in return for payment even though the license had no legal authority. This brought about criticism against Lee in the Daily Post dated 29 September 1733 over issuing the licence and called it just a ploy by the actors. On 30 October, the management of the Theatre Royal sent a letter to veteran actor John Mills and other rebels threatening further legal action regarding their unlicensed theatre. After Theophilus responded with a claim that he was acting within the law, the management and John Rich, manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, demanded the courts to shut down the unlicensed theatres. A 5 November hearing set a date for a trial, but the case fell apart before it was ever <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> the technical wording of a law that conflicted with the original request by the licensed theatre managers.|$|E

25|$|The {{station has}} played a {{significant}} role in the promotion of hyphy music in the San Francisco Bay Area by playing tunes from many of the local artists associated with hyphy. KMEL's mixshows have long contained exclusive hyphy music which can seldom be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> the airwaves elsewhere in the country. Because the station broadcasts live via streaming audio from their website, it gives the genre a platform for possible worldwide exposure.|$|E
