It has long been her defining characteristic. If it occasionally makes her into a caricature, it has also unquestionably established {{that she would have}} an abortion in this circumstance." [...] Talking about Yang's abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes explained she intended Yang to have an abortion already in the second season but changed it with an ectopic pregnancy at the suggestion of one of her writers because [...] "that was so much more interesting, story-wise". As for the abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes commented: [...] "I really wanted Cristina Yang to stay true to who Cristina Yang is. And <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> is a character who has never really wanted to be a mother. The idea that this woman would have a child that she did not want and resented for ruining her career and resented Owen for making her have [...] would have been hideous. [...] made sense for the character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pierre {{has since}} looked back on Go with mixed emotions; he later cited {{it as his}} {{personal}} least favorite album by the band. He remembered the band were [...] "burnt out and miserable" [...] while recording, noting that drummer Thaxton left the band a year later due to depression. He personally was struggling with dark thoughts as well: [...] " [...] I was thinking about death a lot and {{had a lot of}} back pain and was grumpy and it was winter. [...] A {{lot of people who were}} close to me died around that time and I just felt this strange floating sensation like I was sleepwalking through life. It wasn't bad or good, it was just weird and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> somehow translated to that record." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio {{hailed the}} group for their song [...] "Kiss Them for Me". Sitek stated: [...] "I've always {{tried to make a}} song that begins like [...] "Kiss Them for Me". I think songs like [...] "I Was a Lover" [...] or [...] "Wash the Day Away" [...] came from that element of {{surprise}} mode where all of a sudden this giant drum comes in and you're like, what the fuck?! That record was the first one where I was like, okay, even my friends're going to fall for this. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> transition into that record was a relief for me. Really beautiful music was always considered too weird by the normal kids {{and that was the first}} example where I thought, we've got them, they're hooked! I watched people dance to that song, people who had never heard of any of the music that I listened to, they heard that music in a club and went crazy." ...|$|E
5000|$|On October 18, 2012, Miley Cyrus {{spoke about}} the song with Ryan Seacrest. When asked if she thought the song was about her, she responded, “I don’t know who else is getting married…so <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that’s</b> pretty blatant, it’s whatever.” ...|$|R

"Anyway, all of {{us still}} hang out, and its like nothing is {{different}} at all. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that's</b> how you know that you've made a friend that {{will be there for}} the rest of your days.

30|$|I added art {{in there}} because <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that’s</b> important. Turning it into STEAM. But like {{literally}} every single thing is intermingled. Like it’s a melting pot. All of it just goes together. Basically no matter what assignment, project, anything you pick you can connect {{every single one of}} these STEM or STEAM aspects into one another. (Brittany interview, November 10, 2014).|$|R
2500|$|One notable {{unfavorable}} opinion {{appeared in}} the Daily Mail. In the piece, the plot of The Fault in Our Stars was described as [...] "mawkish at best, exploitative at worst" [...] and the book was characterized as belonging to the [...] "sick-lit" [...] young adult genre, together with other young-adult novels such as Never Eighteen and Before I Die. This entire genre, {{as well as the}} genre of young-adult novels dealing with suicide and self-harm (the piece mentions Thirteen Reasons Why, By the Time You Read This, I'll Be Dead, [...] The Lovely Bones, and Red Tears) was criticized as being [...] "distasteful" [...] and inappropriate for their target audience of teens. The Guardian criticized the piece, pointing out in particular that The Fault in Our Stars was chosen by The Guardian as that month's [...] "teen book club choice" [...] because [...] "it's a gripping read, featuring two compelling characters, that deals sensitively and even humorously with a difficult situation without descending into mawkishness." [...] In general, The Guardian faulted the Daily Mail for suggesting that the issues of illness, depression, and sexuality are inappropriate precisely [...] "in the one place where difficult subjects have traditionally been most sensitively explored for teens: fiction written specifically for them." [...] For his part, in an interview for The Guardian, John Green said: [...] "The thing that bothered me about The Daily Mail piece was that it was a bit condescending to teenagers. I'm tired of adults telling teenagers that they aren't smart, that they can't read critically, that they aren't thoughtful, and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> article made those arguments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father Sebastian {{agreed that}} he was, and I haven't much doubt. He {{said the man}} was evil and I think evil's the proper word. He gives me a strange nervous shrinking.

5000|$|The part of Urban Dictionary that I {{love the}} most and that I want to protect is its personality. People write really witty definitions, and they aren’t taking it very seriously ... <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that’s</b> what distinguishes Urban Dictionary from other {{dictionaries}} and Wikipedia. It’s {{not trying to be}} the authority, and it’s not trying to be without an opinion.|$|R

500|$|An 'It Girl' to me {{is someone}} who is selfless, someone who's always {{thinking}} about others before she thinks about herself. You know, my mom is a very charitable woman, so I'd want someone who {{is in line with}} that kind of thought process. I also like a girl who's polite. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that's</b> a lost art, and just saying 'please' and 'thank you' goes a very long way with me. That's just so lost these days. So, ladies, it's OK to say 'thank you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is a shade awkward," [...] said Dunstable thoughtfully. [...] "You {{must have}} tied it up jolly rottenly. It must have slipped away and gone down-stream. This {{is where we}} find {{ourselves}} in the cart. Right among the ribstons, by Jove. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> Frenchman in the story, who lost his glasses just as he got {{to the top of the}} mountain, and missed the view.

6000|$|... "And why did <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> Comrade Brady? I {{will tell}} you. Because {{my faith in}} you was justified. Because there before me stood the ideal fighting-editor of Cosy Moments. It is not a post that any weakling can fill. There charm of manner cannot qualify a man for the position. No one can hold down the job simply by having a kind heart or being good at {{farmyard}} imitations. No. We want a man of thews and sinews, {{a man who would}} rather be hit on the head with a half-brick than not. And you, Comrade Brady, are such a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear no!" [...] and Jacinta laughed. [...] "I, for one, {{would begin}} to look for flaws in the thing, {{whatever}} it was, and wonder if it wouldn't be wiser to change it for something else. In fact, I don't mind telling you <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to-night. You see, for a year at least, I {{have been trying to}} bring a certain thing about, and--now I have succeeded--I wish I hadn't. Of course, you won't understand me, and I don't mean you to; but you may as well remember that it's a somewhat perilous thing to keep on giving people good advice. Some day they will probably act upon it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Grey {{explained}} that she thought her stage name [...] "represents the unknowns in life. People seem {{to be afraid of}} the unknowns, but I’m the complete opposite. I dive into the unknown because <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that’s</b> where all your possibilities come from." [...] She explained to Beatweek that she chose [...] "grey" [...] with an e rather than an a because [...] "I like to do things the original way" [...] and because [...] "it’s more masculine. I'm not a very feminine person." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Marilla," [...] said Anne in a {{burst of}} confidence, [...] "I want to tell you {{something}} and ask you what you think about it. It has worried me terribly--on Sunday afternoons, that is, when I think specially about such matters. I do really want to be good; and when I'm with you or Mrs. Allan or Miss Stacy I want it more than ever and I want to do just what would please you and what you would approve of. But mostly when I'm with Mrs. Lynde I feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the very thing she tells me I oughtn't to do. I feel irresistibly tempted to do it.

6000|$|... "But I'm {{going to}} give it up, Anne dear," [...] she wrote, [...] "and go to college next year. As I took the third year at Queen's I can enter the Sophomore year. I'm tired of {{teaching}} in a back country school. Some day I'm going to write a treatise on 'The Trials of a Country Schoolmarm.' It will be a harrowing bit of realism. It seems to be the prevailing impression that we live in clover, and have nothing to do but draw our quarter's salary. My treatise shall tell the truth about us. Why, if a week should pass without some one telling me that I am doing easy work for big pay I would conclude that I might as well order my ascension robe 'immediately and to onct.' 'Well, you get your money easy,' some rate-payer will tell me, condescendingly. 'All {{you have to do is}} to sit there and hear lessons.' I used to argue the matter at first, but I'm wiser now. Facts are stubborn things, but as some one has wisely said, not half so stubborn as fallacies. So I only smile loftily now in eloquent silence. Why, I have nine grades in my school and I have to teach a little of everything, from investigating the interiors of earthworms to the study of the solar system. My youngest pupil is four--his mother sends him to school to 'get him out of the way'--and my oldest twenty--it 'suddenly struck him' that it would be easier to go to school and get an education than follow the plough any longer. In the wild effort to cram all sorts of research into six hours a day I don't wonder if the children feel like the little boy who was taken to see the biograph.

5000|$|When {{asked of}} TR {{asked to be}} {{released}} from his contract, Rhimes said, [...] "I absolutely am {{not going to talk about}} any private conversations I had with the actors. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> invades their privacy."

6000|$|... 'I wish <b>I</b> could <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> old top,' <b>I</b> said, and I {{took another}} glance at a cable that had arrived {{half an hour}} ago from Aunt Agatha. I had been looking at it at {{intervals}} ever since.|$|R
5000|$|... "It says, 'I want {{to leave}} my {{footprints}} in the sands of time' and it basically is all of our dreams.

2500|$|Samantha Barks as Éponine, the Thénardiers' daughter. Having {{previously}} {{played the}} role at the 25th Anniversary concert and in the West End production, Barks said [...] "there was similarities in playing the role—they're the same character—but Eponine in the novel and Eponine in the musical are two kind of different girls, so {{to me it was}} the thrill of merging those two together, to get something that still had that heart and soul that we all connect to in the musical, but also the awkward, self-loathing teenager that we see in the novel, trying to merge those two together." [...] She found Jackman [...] "fascinating to learn from, and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that's</b> {{the way it should be}} done".|$|R
5000|$|Karlsson has said: [...] "We {{always start}} with the song. We use guitar, piano, and bass lines we don't keep {{to figure out which}} clothes we're going to put on each melody and lyric. I think that's {{different}} than a lot of others in the dance scene. They have a beat they love and then force a top line on top of it. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> makes it sound like a remix. I'd rather do it our way, it's more fun too." ...|$|E
5000|$|What {{influences}} {{my music}} is the musical desegregation of all styles Austin. It has a blank music identity that is like, 'We are the live music capital.' It isn’t just blues music or rap music — there’s no specific flag that it waves for a genre. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> blend is pretty important for me regard tonot having as much respect for what a genre is — in a good way.

5000|$|In August 2016, Katmis {{was interviewed}} by TV Line about a {{potential}} revival of the series. He said:“It would start {{at the moment when}} I feel like I have a story to tell,” he admitted. “But the whole thing about Parenthood is the kids get a little older and their lives change and then there’s more story to tell. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> will happen at some point.

5000|$|Regarding Terry's kiss with Stan Larsen, Jamie Anne Allman stated: [...] "I {{think this}} is her feeling guilt about giving Rosie her ID, which she opened a bank account with, and that Rosie found out about Beau Soleil through Terry, being on her {{computer}} in her bedroom, and the guilt that she has from that. And the guilt that she has from all those things, that she wants forgiveness {{for the things that}} she’s done, and the secrets that she has...She just needs some kind of comfort. I think that’s where, for both of them, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that’s</b> what was stemming from that.

5000|$|In the CR Fashion Book, Scott stated {{his life}} was like a circus or rodeo and he <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> {{he is trying to}} stay on a bucking animal. [...] "It's like a Beyoncé concert.

5000|$|A 2015 {{article in}} 89.3KPCC covered {{the story of}} Korean adoptee Nicky Sa-eun Schildkraut.
