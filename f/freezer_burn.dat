5000|$|Suspect Zero is {{revealed}} {{to be a man}} who drives cross-country in a refrigerated truck. He targets children, whom he abducts and transports to his ranch to be killed. Mackelway pieces together evidence linking these crimes by recognizing that victims had signs of <b>freezer</b> <b>burns</b> while being transported. Mackelway chases one truck driver to a carnival, only to find that the child he saw in his vision as [...] "captured" [...] is free. O'Ryan suddenly appears and captures Mackelway. After refusing to be frightened, O'Ryan spares Mackelway. Eventually, the two men track Suspect Zero to his ranch and find numerous shallow graves. Chasing him, both vehicles crash off the road. Kulok manages to free a child in the truck while Mackelway kills Suspect Zero. O'Ryan then tries to convince Mackelway to end his suffering by killing him. When Mackelway refuses, O'Ryan pretends to attack him, prompting Kulok to shoot him to defend her partner.|$|R
40|$|Thirty-six weaned rabbits {{were used}} to test the effect of floor type (wire net vs straw bed) and {{stocking}} density (8 vs 12 vs 16 rabbits/m 2) on meat quality, according to a balanced 2 x 3 experimental design. Rabbits were slaughtered at 11 weeks of age and both parts of M. Longissimus dorsi were dissected and used for sensory evaluation (tenderness, “rabbit flavour”, off-flavours), cooking losses, Warner-Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF) and Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) parameters. Sensory evaluation was performed by eighteen trained panelists according to a ranking test of intensity level of each descriptor. Each sample was evaluated by 3 panelists (108 observations). The panelists were asked to judge positively or negatively the “rabbit flavour” and to define each off-flavour perceived on a descriptors scale. Experimental factors didn’t affect the analysed variables. WBSF was significantly correlated (P< 0. 01) with TPA-hardness (R= 0. 66), moderately correlated (P< 0. 05) with tenderness (R= - 0. 37) and “rabbit flavour” (R= - 0. 34). Tenderness was correlated with TPA-hardness and TPA-gumminess with R= - 0. 38 and P< 0. 05. The high rabbit’s flavour intensity was considered positive by the 72 % of panelists. Off-flavours were detected on 46 % of observations, judging <b>freezer</b> <b>burned</b> the 16 %, livery the 13 % and rancid the 11 % of them. The off-flavour evaluation was independent to the “rabbit flavour” judgment, underlying the discrimination power of the selected off-flavours descriptors...|$|R
500|$|Within ten years, over 200 {{bald eagles}} were visiting during winter and early spring each day, {{and the job}} of feeding them became more involved. To have enough fish to last through the winter, she would begin in August to {{stockpile}} fish scraps and <b>freezer</b> <b>burned</b> fish donated by her employer and by other local companies. The fish was sometimes supplemented by moose meat that Keene salvaged when she heard of a road-killed moose on the highway. She began feeding the eagles at about December 1 of each year, a job that took up to three hours' work each morning. Keene obtained permission from her employer to use a company forklift to move the large containers of stockpiled fish scraps and freezer-burned salmon, halibut, rockfish, cod, and herring out of the company's large freezers. She then transferred the fish by hand into barrels or garbage cans, which she loaded up in her pickup truck. Then she would drive the load to her motorhome, [...] about [...] from the Seward Fisheries plant, and cut the fish into fist-sized pieces to be thrown out to the eagles. If the fish was fully frozen, she would use an axe, chainsaw, or blowtorch to break the fish down into smaller chunks, or might even have to lug the large garbage cans into her motorhome to thaw. [...] "I don't know if anyone else would do this," [...] she told a reporter in 1986. [...] "My motorhome smells like fish. My yard is fish. My truck is fish. I am fish. It gets kind of gross sometimes, especially when you're handling a lot of slimy carcasses." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{immature}} plant tops can be {{topped off}} (cut) when {{the plant is}} young {{and they are still}} tender, as can be done with onions, and chives, along with the very immature flower bud, and are called scapes. They can be pickled, lactofermented, stir fried, added to soups, etc. The scapes (whether elephant garlic, garlic, onion, chive, or garlic chive) can also be frozen without any cooking, and generally remain fresh for a year or so without <b>freezer</b> <b>burn,</b> to be added to any soup, stew, stir-fry, etc. Topping the plants off also helps more of the plant's energy to be directed toward the bulb. Since seed is not generally gathered from elephant garlic, this is the best use of resources and helps the bulb, though it does detract from the aesthetic value. A few scapes can be left to mature to into stalks to flower.|$|E

40|$|In {{the second}} part of the study of the quality {{evaluation}} of pollock roe by image analysis, methods to quantify the color defects (green spots, dark strips, dark color, and uneven coloring due to <b>freezer</b> <b>burn)</b> were developed. Dark roes can be detected by their average L* value. Dark strips can be detected by quantifying the percentage of pixels that have an L* value below an L * threshold. Since there is wide variation among the average colors of the roes, this L * threshold value must be auto-adjusting to the color of the individual roe. Green spots can be detected by their darker color and by ignoring red blood vessels by setting an upper a * threshold. In this study, identifying pixels with L* values less than the L * threshold = 66 % of the L * average of the roe, and a* values less than an a * threshold = 20 successfully detected dark strips and green spots. Detection and quantification of uneven color and <b>freezer</b> <b>burn</b> required a smoothing of the roe colors to reduce details. The color primitives method was used, with a setting of a color threshold (CT) = 75. The resulting images were analyzed by setting L * threshold values of 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 % of L * average of individual roes. More surface area of the roe was judged as defective with increasing L * threshold. With proper selection of L * threshold, a * threshold, and CT value, image analysis can accurately quantify the color defects of pollock roe. Practical Application Abstract: Automation of pollock roe sorting by color would streamline the operation, reduce error rates, and help with standardization of quality. Combined with other capabilities of machine vision such as sorting by weight, this technology can be used for multiple purposes simultaneously. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{shelf life}} of a food {{can be defined as}} the time period within which the food is safe to consume and/or has an {{acceptable}} quality to consumers. Just like any other food, frozen foods deteriorate during storage by different modes or mechanisms, as summarized in Table 1. Microbes usually are not a problem since they cannot grow at freezing temperatures unless subjected to extensive temperature abuse above the freezing point. Enzymes are a big concern for frozen foods, which can cause flavor change (lipoxygenase) in non-blanched fruits and vegetables and accelerated deterioration reactions in meat and poultry (enzymes released from disrupted membranes during precooking). Cell damage or protein and starch interactions during freezing cause drip and mushiness upon thawing. Discoloration could occur by nonenzymatic browning, bleaching, and <b>freezer</b> <b>burn.</b> Vitamin C loss is often a major concern for frozen vegetables. Physical changes, such as package ice formation, moi...|$|E
40|$|Storing {{foods in}} the freezer {{is a great way}} to {{maintain}} their quality, freshness, and nutritional value. The recommended freezer temperature (0 degrees Fahrenheit) will keep food safe to eat indefinitely. Depending on the food, the color, flavor, and texture will eventually deteriorate. Be careful. Harmful bacteria are not killed by freezing temperatures and could begin to grow once the food is thawed. The Colder, the Better Freezers should be kept at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. There are a few extra things you can do in addition to turning down the dial to ensure a cold freezer. Keeping cool is all about air flow, so reduce the number of items {{in the freezer}} and add shelf space. This will allow the air to circulate in the freezer more efficiently for a more thorough freeze. Keep foods away from the back vent. Blocking this vent means blocking the air circulation and a warmer freezer. Packaging Remember these three rules when wrapping for freezer storage: wrap tightly, wrap again, and wrap individual portions separately. Wrapping tightly and double wrapping help to maintain quality and prevent <b>freezer</b> <b>burn.</b> Wrapping individual portions separately lets you remove some of the food to prepare without thawing food that is not needed for your meal. Use only moisture- and vapor-proof materials for storing solid foods. Good choices are polyethylene bags, freezer film wraps, and aluminum foil over a layer of plastic film next to the food. Acid foods may react to the aluminum if in direct contact. For liqui...|$|E
