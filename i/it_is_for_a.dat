500|$|Bruno Bettelheim {{remarks that}} [...] "the more simple and {{straightforward}} a good {{character in a}} fairy tale, the easier <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> child to identify with it and to reject the bad other." [...] The child identifies with a good hero because the hero's condition makes a positive appeal to him. If the character {{is a very good}} person, then the child is likely to want to be good too. Amoral tales, however, show no polarization or juxtaposition of good and bad persons because amoral tales such as [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] build character, not by offering choices between good and bad, but by giving the child hope that even the meekest can survive. Morality is of little concern in these tales, but rather, an assurance is provided that one can survive and succeed in life. Small children can do little on their own and may give up in disappointment and despair with their attempts. Fairy stories, however, give great dignity to the smallest achievements (such as befriending an animal or being befriended by an animal, as in [...] "Puss in Boots") and that such ordinary events may lead to great things. Fairy stories encourage children to believe and trust that their small, real achievements are important although perhaps not recognized at the moment.|$|E

Pompeo was pregnant during the episode, so the filming crew had to work around it. In the episode, Lexie advocated for Meredith to donate her liver, because she was unable to. Bans commented on this: [...] "It was REALLY {{easy for me to}} understand Lexie in this episode – 'cause that's how I imagine she grew up with [...] and Thatcher. There was taco night, and movie night, and if she had homework issues, one of them was always around to help. So now that her Dad needs some of her liver, recovering alcoholic or not, she’s gonna do it. She's not even thinking about the Chief's upcoming merger – and the fact that recovering from a major surgery will put her on the bench, out of the game, for at least a month. Lexie doesn't blink, because family isn't an obligation to her like <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lot of people - [...] it's a gift." [...] The scene in which Meredith offers her liver to Thatcher was originally intended to rekindle their relationship.

2500|$|As there usually exist {{multiple}} Pareto optimal {{solutions for}} multi-objective optimization problems, {{what it means}} to solve such a problem is not as straightforward as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> conventional single-objective optimization problem. Therefore, different researchers have defined the term [...] "solving a multi-objective optimization problem" [...] in various ways. This section summarizes some of them and the contexts in which they are used. Many methods convert the original problem with multiple objectives into a single-objective optimization problem. This is called a scalarized problem. If scalarization is done neatly, Pareto optimality of the solutions obtained can be guaranteed.|$|E

[...] According to A History of Wittenberg College, [...] "the 'trial' of Professor L. A. Gotwald at Wittenberg, in 1893, arose from fear that the liberal traditions of the college were threatened by a rising 'exclusive and conservative spirit' symbolized by Gotwald." [...] As the Gotwald heresy trial book put it, [...] "The 1890s were times when Lutheran were choosing between two identities—Lutherans who were adapting their teachings and practices to Protestant America following the lead of Dr. Samuel Simon Schmucker; and those who sought their role as maintaining the understandings of the Lutheranism of the Sixteenth Century Reformer Martin Luther. Both sides maintained they were true." [...] Professor Gotwald was defended at this trial by Judge Joseph W. Adair of Noble County, Indiana. At the conclusion of the trial, even the prosecutors joined in the unanimous vote for his acquittal.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{elements}} of game design, {{areas such as}} gameplay, mechanics, and similar features {{have been described as}} gender neutral, however presentational aspects of games have been identified as strongly gender-linked. Specifically, gaming is often seen as fantasy and escapism in which empathy and identification with the character is much more easily achieved if the character shares the same gender as the player. Gamers of both genders tend to crave realism and the more realistic the gender of the character, the easier <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> player to identify with the character. A 2009 academic study published in New Media & Society, however, found that 85% of playable characters in video games are male. Erin Hamilton argues that part of the problem comes from the difficulty in [...] "juxtaposing femininity and feminism in a good video game." [...] When female characters do appear in video games, they are often regarded as presenting unhealthy messages concerning unrealistic body images and provocative sexual and violent behaviors for players of both genders. Stereotypical female behaviors such as giggling or sighing are often presented non-ironically, and this leads young children (especially girls who identify with the female character) to think that this is how girls are supposed to look and act. Furthermore, over-sexualized depictions of scantily clad female video game characters such as Tomb Raiders Lara Croft are not appealing to some girls.|$|E
