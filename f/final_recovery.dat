60|$|On {{the morning}} in {{question}} most of the resident clergymen who constituted the chapter, and some few others, were here assembled, and among them as usual the archdeacon towered with high authority. He {{had heard of the}} dean's fit before he was over the bridge which led into the town, and had at once come to the well-known clerical trysting place. He had been there by eleven o'clock, and had remained ever since. From time to time the medical men who had been called in came through from the deanery into the library, uttered little bulletins, and then returned. There was, it appears, very little hope of the old man's rallying, indeed no hope of anything like a <b>final</b> <b>recovery.</b> The only question was whether he must die at once speechless, unconscious, stricken to death by his first heavy fit, or whether by due aid of medical skill he might not be so far brought back to this world as to become conscious of his state and enabled to address one prayer to his Maker before he was called to meet Him face to face at the judgement seat.|$|E

40|$|Shape memory {{polymers}} {{have been}} much researched in recent years. In the work reported, moisture-sensitive shape memory effects (SMEs) of novel pyridine-containing shape memory polyurethanes (Py-SMPUs) were investigated systematically. The {{results show that the}} strain recovery start immersion time (t s), strain recovery immersion time (t r) and <b>final</b> strain <b>recovery</b> immersion time (t e) are prolonged with a decrease of relative humidity as well as a decrease of temperature. The <b>final</b> strain <b>recovery</b> decreases with a decrease of relative humidity as well as an increase of temperature. The key component affecting the moisture-sensitive SME is the N,N-bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) isonicotinamide (BINA) unit. The lower limit of BINA content for Py-SMPUs to exhibit a good moisture-sensitive SME is 30 wt%. The addition of diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and 1, 4 -butanediol (BDO) enhances the moisture-sensitive shape <b>recovery.</b> The <b>final</b> shape <b>recovery</b> decreases with a decrease of BINA content or an increase of MDI-BDO content.

60|$|The {{statement}} {{has been}} {{repeated over and}} over again, and has been as often vehemently denied, among others by Bonaparte himself. It still remains, and always will remain, doubtful. There {{can be no doubt that}} the transport of plague-stricken men would have been a source of danger to the whole army; and as very few of those once attacked by the plague ever recovered, but few would have benefited by the operation, while the condition of the great majority would have been rendered still more hopeless and painful by the journey. Upon the other hand, had they been left behind they would assuredly have been massacred by the inhabitants, who had suffered so terribly at the hands of the French. Rather than be so left, the unfortunate men would assuredly have vastly preferred some painless form of death at the hands of their friends. The probabilities are that all the sick, whose <b>final</b> <b>recovery</b> was considered by the surgeons as within the limits of probability, were taken on, and that those whose cases were absolutely hopeless were not allowed to fall alive into the hands of their foes.|$|E
6000|$|What else {{relates to}} myself, I will write on Monday. Would to heaven {{you were going}} with me to Malta, if it were but for the voyage! With all other things I could make the passage with an unwavering mind. But without cheerings of hope. Let me mention one thing; Lord Cadogan was brought to {{absolute}} despair, and hatred of life, by a stomach complaint, being now an old man. The symptoms, as stated to me, were strikingly like yours, excepting the nervous difference of the two characters; the flittering fever, etc. He was advised to reduce lean beef to a pure jelly, by Papin's digester, with as little water as could secure it from burning, and of this to take half a wine glass 10 or 14 times a day. This and nothing else. He did so. Sir George Beaumont saw, {{within a few weeks}} a letter from himself to Lord St. Asaph, in which he relates the circumstance of his perseverence in it, and rapid amelioration, and <b>final</b> <b>recovery.</b> [...] "I am now," [...] he says, [...] "in real good health; as good, and in as cheerful spirits as I ever was when a young man." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{process of}} Lapham's {{financial}} disintegration {{was like the}} course of some chronic disorder, which has fastened itself upon the constitution, but advances with continual reliefs, with apparent amelioration, and at times seems not to advance at all, when it gives hope of <b>final</b> <b>recovery</b> {{not only to the}} sufferer, but to the eye of science itself. There were moments when James Bellingham, seeing Lapham pass this crisis and that, began to fancy that he might pull through altogether; and at these moments, when his adviser could not oppose anything but experience and probability to the evidence of the fact, Lapham was buoyant with courage, and imparted his hopefulness to his household. Our theory of disaster, of sorrow, of affliction, borrowed from the poets and novelists, is that it is incessant; but every passage in our own lives and in the lives of others, so far as we have witnessed them, teaches us that this is false. The house of mourning is decorously darkened to the world, but within itself it is also the house of laughing. Bursts of gaiety, as heartfelt as its grief, relieve the gloom, and the stricken survivors have their jests together, in which the thought of the dead is tenderly involved, and a fond sense, not crazier than many others, of sympathy and enjoyment beyond the silence, justifies the sunnier mood before sorrow rushes back, deploring and despairing, and making it all up again with the conventional fitness of things. Lapham's adversity had this quality in common with bereavement. It was not always like the adversity we figure in allegory; it had its moments of being like prosperity, and if upon the whole it was continual, it was not incessant. Sometimes there was a week of repeated reverses, when he had to keep his teeth set and to hold on hard to all his hopefulness; and then days came of negative result or slight success, when he was full of his jokes at the tea-table, and {{wanted to go to the}} theatre, or to do something to cheer Penelope up. In some miraculous way, by some enormous stroke of success which should eclipse the brightest of his past prosperity, he expected to do what would reconcile all difficulties, not only in his own affairs, but in hers too. [...] "You'll see," [...] he said to his wife; [...] "it's going to come out all right. Irene'll fix it up with Bill's boy, and then she'll be off Pen's mind; and if things go on as they've been going for the last two days, I'm going to be in a position to do the favours myself, and Pen can feel that SHE'S makin' a sacrifice, and then I guess may be she'll do it. If things turn out as I expect now, and times ever do get any better generally, I can show Corey that I appreciate his offer. I can offer him the partnership myself then." ...|$|E

40|$|Built on {{literature}} {{views and}} formulation of oil recovery characteristics, three cases of numerical simulation {{have been performed}} on core scale which are gravity drainage(GD) individually, capillary pressure driven spontaneous imbibition(SI) only and the interaction of them. Simulations are performed on 1 dimension with different boundary conditions, namely topopened(TO), bottom-opened(BO) and both-surface-opened(BSO). Significant oil recovery is obtained from the gravity drainage in absence of capillary pressure, while rate of oil recovering is distinctive for various parameters, for instance, peremability,height and so on. Spontaneous imbibition is sensitive to wettability and interfacial tension(IFT). The interplay of capillary pressure and gravity force under varying wettabilities and boundary conditions are differential. For boundary condition of top-opened, gravity prompts oil recovery rate at different wettabilities. In contrast, the bottom-opened cases decrease the recovery rate due to downwards gravity. In terms of <b>final</b> oil <b>recovery,</b> wettabilites and boundary condition also the determination factors for that. The <b>final</b> oil <b>recovery</b> is not sensitive to the gravity for the strongly water-wet in case of top-opened. In contrary, bottom-opened condition give rise to negative effect from gravity force, the oil recovery is reduced at smaller range of capillary pressure;while as the water wettability reduce to neutral or even oil-wet, the <b>final</b> oil <b>recovery</b> is enhanced or reduced to some extent,manifestly.

40|$|Abstract. Bioleaching of {{the copper}} flue dust emanating from {{smelters}} at Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex has been studied. At the present, the dust is {{sent back to}} the smelter, which reduces its efficiency. In this study, a continuous system including a feed tank and two-stage aerated stirred tank bioreactors was established. Mixed mesophile bacteria with different amounts of the dust containing 35 % of copper mainly in the form of sulfide minerals were used. The effects of pulp densities, residence times and temperatures on the <b>final</b> copper <b>recovery</b> and redox potential were experienced. Despite the copper concentrates bioleaching, the process of dust bio-treating was net acid consuming. Lower pulp densities resulted in a stable redox potential in both reactors. However, increasing the pulp density to 7 %, was created an unstable redox potential in the first bioreactor especially at lower temperatures. <b>Final</b> copper <b>recoveries</b> were calculated for pulp densities of 2 %, 4 % and 7 %, were 91. 8 %, 90. 3 % and 87. 6 % with residence times of 2. 7, 4 and 6 days respectively.

Consequently, similar were the results for protein recoveries (higher at acidic conditions) and lipid elimination (higher at alkaline conditions), indicating higher solubility of molecules in alkaline solutions. Lightness and whiteness index improved due to washing cycles, the thermal process further increased them and this was more evident in the samples washed at acidic conditions (p < 0. 05). Kamaboko gels washed at acidic conditions showed higher values in firmness and more cohesive and elastic texture (p< 0. 05).

50|$|Hydrometallurgy is {{concerned}} with processes involving aqueous solutions to extract metals from ores. The {{first step in the}} hydrometallurgical process is leaching, which involves dissolution of the valuable metals into the aqueous solution and/or a suitable solvent. After the solution is separated from the ore solids, the extract is often subjected to various processes of purification and concentration before the valuable metal is recovered either in its metallic state or as a chemical compound. This may include precipitation, distillation, adsorption, and solvent extraction. The <b>final</b> <b>recovery</b> step may involve precipitation, cementation, or an electrometallurgical process. Sometimes, hydrometallurgical processes may be carried out directly on the ore material without any pretreatment steps. More often, the ore must be pretreated by various mineral processing steps, and sometimes by pyrometallurgical processes.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{is focused}} on the {{performance}} of three types of coal-oil agglomerates on recovery of liberated gold from gold bearing materials. Pre-formed agglomerates developed using bio-diesel, castor oil and mineral diesel as liquid hydrophobic phases were used in the study. The influence of the type of liquid hydrophobic phase on the degree of gold recovery and the effect of factors such as gold particle concentration, viscosity, agglomerate size, agglomerate/ore ratios and particle penetration into agglomerates have been studied as a function of time. It is shown that gold recovery rate can be increased by an increase in agglomerate loading, surface area and the viscosity of the hydrophobic phase and high recoveries are attained up to 98. 5 %. Increase in concentration of gold particles per unit volume of slurry increased attachment rate but did not change the <b>final</b> <b>recoveries</b> attained. It is shown that gold particle penetration occurs mainly in the coarse agglomerates if contact is prolonged beyond 60 minutes. Examination of sections of gold-loaded agglomerates under reflected light microscope showed gold and some silicate particles penetrated in few cracked agglomerates and only gold particles were observed inside the uncracked agglomerates suggesting the possibility of gold selectivity during particles penetration.
