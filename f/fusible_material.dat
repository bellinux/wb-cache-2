40|$|A {{review of}} experimental/computational studies {{to enhance the}} thermal {{conductivity}} of phase change materials (PCM) that were conducted over many decades is presented. Thermal management of electronics for aeronautics and space exploration {{appears to be the}} original intended application, with later extension to storage of thermal energy for solar thermal applications. The present review will focus on studies that concern with positioning of fixed, stationary high conductivity inserts/structures. Copper, aluminum, nickel, stainless steel and carbon fiber in various forms (fins, honeycomb, wool, brush, etc.) were generally utilized as the materials of the thermal conductivity promoters. The reviewed research studies covered a variety of PCM, operating conditions, heat exchange and thermal energy storage arrangements. The energy storage vessels included isolated thermal storage units (rectangular boxes, cylindrical and annular tubes and spheres) and containers that transferred heat to a moving fluid medium passing through it. A few studies have focused on the marked role of flow regimes that are formed due to the presence of thermally unstable fluid layers that in turn give rise to greater convective mixing and thus expedited melting of PCM. In general, it can be stated that due to utilization of fixed high conductivity inserts/structures, the conducting pathways linking the hot and cold ends must be minimized. <b>Fusible</b> <b>materials</b> Melting Phase Change materials PCM/Metal composites Phase transformation Solidification Thermal conductivity enhancers...|$|R

30|$|To {{enhance the}} {{mechanical}} properties of CF, copolymerization of hardwood kraft lignin with polyacrylonitrile was attempted [226]. Moreover, {{to increase the}} resistance towards thermal degradation, the oxidative pretreatment of kraft lignin with air was proposed [227]. Similar to kraft lignin, acetic acid lignin {{can be used in}} the production of CFs. Acetic acid lignin from hardwood lends facilitates the preparation of CFs more so than that from softwood. Hardwood acetic acid lignin could be spun via fusion spinning without any chemical modifications [228], while softwood acetic acid was infusible. The condensed and aryl-ether structure of acetic acid could hinder the thermal mobility [220]. To convert softwood acetic acid lignin into a <b>fusible</b> <b>material,</b> the removal of the high molecular weight fraction or re-cooking with aqueous acetic acid was effective [220, 229]. CFs from softwood acetic acid could be prepared by direct carbonization without thermal stabilization [229]. Thermal hydrogenolysis [230] or phenolysis [231] of steam-exploded lignin from birch was conducted to improve the softening and melting properties. Olganosolv lignin also can be used for the production of CF [232].|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} {{functional}} materials with complex properties {{is very important}} for different applications, such as coatings, microelectronics, biotechnologies and medicine. It is also crucial that such kinds of materials have a long service lifetime. Unfortunately, cracks or other types of damages may occur during everyday use and some parts of the material should be changed for the regeneration of the initial properties. One of the approaches to avoid the replacement is utilization of self-healing materials. The aim of this thesis was to design a self-repairable material with superhydrophobic and switchable properties using colloidal particles. Specific goals were the synthesis of colloidal particles and the preparation of functional surfaces incorporated with the obtained particles, which would exhibit a repairable switching behavior and repairable superhydrophobicity. In order to achieve these goals, first, methods of preparation of simple and functional colloidal particles were developed. Second, the behavior of particles at surfaces of easy <b>fusible</b> solid <b>materials,</b> namely, paraffin wax or perfluorodecane, was investigated...|$|R

60|$|XX. Thus {{in the use}} of brick; {{since that}} is known to be {{originally}} moulded, {{there is no reason why}} it should not be moulded into diverse forms. It will never be supposed to have been cut, and therefore, will cause no deception; it will have only the credit it deserves. In flat countries, far from any quarry of stone, cast brick may be legitimately, and most successfully, used in decoration, and that elaborate, and even refined. The brick mouldings of the Palazzo Pepoli at Bologna, and those which run round the market-place of Vercelli, are among the richest in Italy. So also, tile and porcelain work, of which the former is grotesquely, but successfully, employed in the domestic architecture of France, colored tiles being inserted in the diamond spaces between the crossing timbers; and the latter admirably in Tuscany, in external bas-reliefs, by the Robbia family, in which works, while we cannot but sometimes regret the useless and ill-arranged colors, we would by no means blame the employment of a material which, whatever its defects, excels every other in permanence, and, perhaps, requires even greater skill in its management than marble. For it is not the material, but the absence of the human labor, which makes the thing worthless; and a piece of terra cotta, or of plaster of Paris, which has been wrought by human hand, is worth all the stone in Carrara, cut by machinery. It is, indeed, possible, and even usual, for men to sink into machines themselves, so that even hand-work has all the characters of mechanism; of the difference between living and dead hand-work I shall speak presently; all that I ask at present is, what it is always in our power to secure--the confession of what we have done, and what we have given; so that when we use stone at all, since all stone is naturally supposed to be carved by hand, we must not carve it by machinery; neither must we use any artificial stone cast into shape, nor any stucco ornaments of the color of stone, or which might in anywise be mistaken for it, as the stucco mouldings in the cortile of the Palazzo Vecchio at Florence, which cast a shame and suspicion over every part of the building. But for ductile and <b>fusible</b> <b>materials,</b> as clay, iron, and bronze, since these will usually be supposed to have been cast or stamped, it is at our pleasure to employ them as we will; remembering that they become precious, or otherwise, just in proportion to the hand-work upon them, or to the clearness of their reception of the hand-work of their mould.|$|R

40|$|A new {{database}} of 70 U–Pb zircon ages (mostly determined by SHRIMP) {{indicates that the}} South Patagonian batholith resulted from the amalgamation of subduction-related plutons from the Late Jurassic to the Neogene. Construction of the batholith began with a voluminous, previously undetected, Late Jurassic bimodal body mainly composed of leucogranite with some gabbro, emplaced along its present eastern margin within a restricted time span (157 to 145 Ma). This episode is, at least in part, coeval with voluminous rhyolitic ignimbrites of the Tobífera Formation, deposited in the deep Rocas Verdes Basin east of the batholith; {{this was the last}} of several southwestward-migrating silicic volcanic episodes in Patagonia that commenced in an Early Jurassic extensional tectonic regime. The quasi-oceanic mafic floor of the basin was also contemporaneous with this Late Jurassic batholithic event, as indicated by mutually cross-cutting field relationships. Changes in subduction parameters then triggered the generation of earliest Cretaceous plutons (Cretaceous 1 : 144 – 137 Ma) west of the Late Jurassic ones, a westward shift that culminated at 136 – 127 Ma (Cretaceous 2) along the present western margin of the batholith. Most mid- to Late Cretaceous (Cretaceous 3 : 126 – 75 Ma) and Paleogene (67 – 40 Ma) granitoids are represented by geographically restricted plutons, mainly emplaced between the previously established margins of the batholith, and mostly in the far south; no associated volcanic rocks of similar age are known at present in this area. During the final Neogene stage of plutonism (25 – 15 Ma) a recurrence of coeval volcanism is recognized within and east of the batholith. Typical εNdt values for the granitoids vary from strongly negative (− 5) in the Late Jurassic, to progressively higher values for Cretaceous 1 (− 4), Cretaceous 2 (− 0. 7), Cretaceous 3 (+ 2) and the Paleogene (+ 5), followed by lower and more variable ones in the Neogene (− 1 to + 5). These variations may reflect different modes of pluton emplacement: large crustal magma chambers developed in the early stages (Late Jurassic to Cretaceous 1), leading to widespread emplacement of plutons with a crustal signature, whereas the Cretaceous 2, Cretaceous 3 and Palaeogene parts of the batholith resulted from incremental assembly of small plutons generated at greater depths and with higher εNdt. This does not in itself justify the idea of a reduction in crustal character due to progressive exhaustion of <b>fusible</b> <b>material</b> in the crust through which the magmas passed...|$|E

Petrography {{and mineral}} chemistry [...] 6. Zircon chemistry and isotropic composition [...] 7. Whole-rock chemistry and isotopic composition [...] 8. Conclusions. The Barberton Greenstone Belt (BGB) and Ancient Gneiss Complex (AGC), {{located in the}} eastern part of the Kaapvaal Craton (Swaziland and adjacent South Africa), represent some of the best-preserved and most-studied Early- to Mid-Archaean (3. 6 – 3. 2 Ga) crustal remnants. The extensively-studied granite-greenstone belt is surrounded and overlain by several large granitoid bodies (Mpuluzi, Piggs Peak, Nelspruit, and Heerenveen batholiths), all emplaced at ~ 3. 1 Ga, which coincides with the end of TTG magmatism and regional metamorphism in the area. This study focuses on the Mpuluzi batholith as a case study to constrain the prevailing conditions at 3. 1 Ga that led to the generation and emplacement of these granitoids, and subsequent cratonisation. The granitoids were emplaced as extensive, km-thick sheets and extend over more than 20, 000 km 2. Zircon U-Pb ages vary from ~ 3. 16 to ~ 3. 09 Ga; the presence of inherited cores in some grains suggests the involvement of an older crustal component (~ 3. 5 Ga) in the magma generation. This is confirmed by the Hf isotopic data, which show clear indications of mixing between an older crustal component and juvenile material. The Hf isotopic data also provide a good estimate of the age of extraction of the inherited component, with one sample showing a well-defined evolution trend back to ~ 4. 1 Ga. The Hf data also suggest that the juvenile material may have been extracted from the mantle very close to the time of emplacement of the batholith, with the mixing trend intersecting the depleted mantle line in some samples. Whole-rock Sr and Nd isotopic data yield tight isochrons for both systems (MSWD < 1), and calculated isochron ages are within error of each other, and of the U-Pb ages (Sr: 3113 ± 84 Ma; Nd: 3027 ± 520 Ma). The close agreement between ages from the three isotopic systems strongly suggests that the whole mass formed and cooled together. The isotopic evidence for mixing between an older crustal component and juvenile material suggests that the mantle may have both provided the heat for melting and contributed material to the magma itself. The variation within the batholith thus represents variable proportions of mixing between these components, and perhaps also a build-up of heat over time. These 3. 1 Ga granitoids therefore represent the final stage in the cratonisation of the region; this could represent the “draining” of <b>fusible</b> <b>material</b> from the lower crust, increasing its rigidity and limiting further tectonism.

40|$|The {{origin of}} various {{patterns}} seen in Galápagos magmatism is investigated using numerical simulations of mantle plume-ridge {{interaction with the}} realistic geometry and evolution of the Galapágos Spreading Center (GSC). Models predict magma generation and composition from a mantle composed of <b>fusible</b> veins of <b>material</b> enriched in incompatible elements, and a more refractory depleted matrix. Model 1 simulates a low-viscosity plume, owing to a temperature-dependent mantle rheology; Model 2 includes the added dependence on water content, which leads to high viscosities in the dehydrated, shallow upper mantle. Model 1 produces the most favorable results. It shows how a modest crustal thickness anomaly observed along the Western GSC can arise from a plume with large excess temperatures (greater than 100 °C). Model 1 also predicts geographic patterns in magma isotopic compositions broadly resembling those observed along the GSC as well as around the Galapágos Archipelago. These patterns are predicted to arise out {{of the differences in}} melting depths between the enriched veins and depleted matrix, coupled with spatial variations in the rate of mantle upwelling and decompression melting. The results provide an alternative to traditional explanations involving the plume mixing with or entraining the ambient mantle. The models are still missing some essential factors, as indicated by the predicted increases, rather than the observed decrease in incompatible element concentration away from the hotspot along the GSC. Possible factors include a regional-scale zoning in incompatible element and water content within the plume, or melt migration that delivers a larger flux of incompatible-element-rich melts to the GSC...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the original work carried {{out into the}} novel application of high intensity ultrasound to the de-inking of waste papers printed with digitally printed inks. These inks include fused toners, Indigo inks (ElectroInks) and UV cured coatings. They were previously considered to be ‘difficult to de-ink’ when present in conventional recycling de-inking plants because they are difficult both to detach from paper fibres and to break down into particle sizes that can be removed by conventional flotation techniques. The significance of this work is that for all the systems investigated {{it was possible to}} both detach and reduce the size of ink particles down to a desired flotatable size range of between 20 to 120 microns. Thus digitally printed papers that had been seen as presenting a treat to effective paper recycling can be recycled using the techniques described. Temperature was found {{to play a role in}} heat <b>fusible</b> toner printed <b>materials.</b> De-inking of the tough films produced by UV curing inks showed no temperature dependence. Indigo ink that had been feared to present problems to the recycling industry was found to be relatively easy to de-ink using these techniques. The general conclusions are that the application of ultrasound can be used to aid the de-inking of waste paper and reduce the number of chemicals used.
