5|$|After soccer practice, Bart {{waits for}} Homer {{to pick him}} up, though his father has forgotten. When Homer finally remembers, he reasons to an angered Bart that they should just both admit they are wrong and try to put the issue behind them. Later, Bart views a {{commercial}} for a mentor program called The Bigger Brothers, which pairs up fatherless boys with positive male role models. Still angry at Homer, Bart goes to the agency {{pretending to be a}} young boy whose father was a drunken gambler who abandoned him. Bart's story is so sad that the receptionist pairs <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> their best Bigger Brother, a military test pilot named Tom. The two spend time together doing a variety of activities, though Bart begins to feel guilty over taking up Tom's time despite not actually being fatherless. Eventually, Homer finds out about Bart's Bigger Brother and confronts Bart for it. Homer then decides to go to the Bigger Brothers Agency to get revenge by being assigned with a replacement son; a young poor boy named Pepi. Just like Tom and Bart, Homer and Pepi spend time together doing activities.|$|E
5|$|He then {{falls in}} love with Delilah in the valley of Sorek. The Philistines {{approach}} Delilah and induce her with 1,100 silver coins to find the secret of Samson's strength so that they can capture their enemy, but Samson refuses to reveal the secret and teases her, telling her that he will lose his strength if he is bound with fresh bowstrings. She does so while he sleeps, but when he wakes up he snaps the strings. She persists, and he tells her that he can be bound with new ropes. She ties <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> new ropes while he sleeps, and he snaps them, too. She asks again, and he says that he can be bound if his locks are woven into a weaver's loom. She weaves them into a loom, but he simply destroys the entire loom and carries it off when he wakes.|$|E
5|$|When Locke {{leaves the}} island to bring the {{survivors}} back to the island, Ben tracks him down. He gets Locke to reveal what he knows about returning to the island, then kills him and stages it as a suicide. Ben visits Jack in the funeral home housing Locke's body, telling Jack he will help him return to the island, {{but the only way}} to get back is to bring everyone who had left it, including Locke's corpse. Ben boards Ajira Airways Flight 316 with the rest of survivors, which then crashes on the island. Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid are transported to 1977, while Sun and Ben remain in 2007 with a resurrected Locke. The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him in the back of the head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including Locke. After Ben regains consciousness and finds Locke to be alive, he convinces Locke he knew bringing him to the island would resurrect him, and he stopped Locke's suicide attempt merely to gain information. Locke travels with Ben, who is to be judged by the Monster. After they fail to find the Monster at the Barracks, they head to the Temple. As Ben and Locke travel through a series of tunnels beneath the Temple, Ben falls through the floor, so Locke leaves to get something that he can pull <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>with.</b> The Monster flows out of a grate below and surrounds Ben, showing flashes of decisions he made in his life involving Alex. The Monster takes the form of Alex and pushes Ben against a wall. She says she knows Ben is planning to kill Locke again, and if he does she will hunt him down and destroy him. She orders him to follow Locke and do whatever he asks, then disappears. They return to the Others' camp, where Locke gathers the group together and announces he is taking them to see Jacob. As they are walking, Ben relates his experience with the Monster and his promise to do whatever Locke asks, so Locke convinces Ben to kill Jacob. Richard leads them to the base of the statue, where Jacob lives. Within, they are met by Jacob (Mark Pellegrino). Jacob greets Locke and observes Locke has found a loophole. It is revealed that Locke was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of Locke. Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him - and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.|$|E

25|$|The semi-final {{match of}} the night was a {{continuation}} of the storyline between the two rudo factions (also called stables) Los Perros del Mal ("The Bad Dogs") and Los Guerreros del Infierno ("The Soldiers from the Inferno") that had been going on since the inception of Los Perros a couple of years prior. The Los Guerreros team of Atlantis, Tarzan Boy and Último Guerrero faced and defeated the Los Perros team of Perro Aguayo Jr., Héctor Garza and Shocker at the CMLL 73rd Anniversary Show to win the vacant CMLL World Trios Championship. Part of the reason Los Guerreros del Infierno won the tournament final was due to Shocker turning on Los Perros, causing Los Perros to demand a rematch for the championship. CMLL agreed and booked the champions to face Los Perros representatives Héctor Garza, Damián 666 and Halloween at the Sin Piedad event. The fourth match {{of the night}} would be the in-ring debut of the ring character Ephesto, who would team up with Averno and Mephisto to form a trio called La Triada del Terror ("The Triangle of Terror"). While Ephesto was a new character in CMLL the man under the mask had been with CMLL in the early 1990s under the ring name Pantera del Ring, and later on as Safari and Hombre Sin Nombre ("Man with no name") until CMLL decided to given him a new ring character and mask to team <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Averno and Mephisto. Their opponents for the match were the then reigning CMLL World Tag Team Champion Místico, who along with co-champion Negro Casas had defended the title against Averno and Mephisto at least once before. Místico would be joined by Último Dragón and Volador Jr. for the match. Both wrestlers had worked extensively with Averno and Mephisto and both had aspirations for Averno's CMLL World Middleweight Championship.|$|E

25|$|While {{a college}} student at Ivy University, Phoenix is accused of murder and {{successfully}} defended by a defense attorney named Mia Fey. After passing the bar exam, Phoenix becomes a defense attorney himself under Mia's law firm, Fey & Co. Following Mia's murder, Phoenix takes over the law firm, naming it Wright and Co., and also takes Mia's little sister, a spirit medium named Maya, under his wing. Maya becomes Phoenix's assistant and legal aide, assisting him by setting <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> clients, and by searching for information and clues during cases. As the years pass, Phoenix takes on several cases to prove the innocence of those wrongly accused of murder, developing a name and reputation for himself.

However, in one case, he inadvertently presents forged evidence to the court, not knowing it was forged {{until it was too}} late, and is forced to turn in his attorney's badge. Adopting a young girl named Trucy Enigmar as his daughter, Phoenix sets up the Wright Talent Agency, turning to playing piano and poker games for a source of income. Seven years later, Phoenix is accused of murdering a man named Shadi Smith, who has no known past and is simply a wanderer. Phoenix hires a rookie defense attorney named Apollo Justice, who works for Phoenix's friend, Kristoph Gavin, a renowned defense attorney. During the trial, Apollo and Phoenix reveal that Phoenix had been set up, and Kristoph was the real murderer.

Phoenix continues to work behind the scenes, helping to bring the truth behind his disbarment to light, as well as implement a jury system to the fictional justice system.
