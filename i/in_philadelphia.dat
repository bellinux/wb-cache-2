5|$|By early 1933, Bell's {{opinion on}} the NFL had changed, {{and he wanted to}} become an owner of a team based <b>in</b> <b>Philadelphia.</b> After being advised by the NFL that a {{prerequisite}} to a franchise being rendered <b>in</b> <b>Philadelphia</b> was that the Pennsylvania Blue Laws would have to be mollified, he was the force majeure in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated. He borrowed funds from Frances Upton, partnered with Wray, and he procured the rights to a franchise <b>in</b> <b>Philadelphia</b> which he christened as the Philadelphia Eagles.|$|E

5|$|A statewide {{referendum}} on the ballot that day continued the work begun by the new city charter in asking voters to consolidate {{the city and county}} governments <b>in</b> <b>Philadelphia.</b> In 1854, all of the municipalities <b>in</b> <b>Philadelphia</b> County had been consolidated into one city, but many county offices still existed, duplicating the efforts of city officials. The merger would also bring county offices under the civil service protections of the new city charter. Merging the city and county governments had been defeated in a 1937 referendum, but in 1951 the question was overwhelmingly approved. Two other ballot proposals authorized the city to borrow $17 million for municipal improvements and $14 million for the gas works; both passed by a five-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|After her graduation, Simone {{spent the}} summer of 1950 at the Juilliard School, as a student of Carl Friedberg, {{preparing}} for an audition at the Curtis Institute of Music <b>in</b> <b>Philadelphia.</b> Her application, however, was denied.
