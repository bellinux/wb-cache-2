5|$|By 1860, Smith was <b>doing</b> <b>very</b> well; he {{had moved}} to Leonard Street within the Fifth Ward and had a mansion built by white workmen. His total real {{property}} was worth $25,000. His household included a live-in servant, Catherine Grelis from Ireland. Listed as a separate household at his address were Sara D. Williams, 57, and Mary Hertell (should be Hewlitt, as above), 50. (These were likely the same Sara and Mary as in the 1850 census, although their ages did not change.) No one on this census page had a racial designation. By the conventions of the time, this means that they were classified as white by the census enumerator; totals of white persons only are given {{at the bottom of}} the page.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Nakashima, Francois Sammer (a Czech {{architect}} {{who had worked}} for Le Corbusier in Russia) and Chandulal (a devotee who had trained as an engineer), built a full-scale model of the dormitory in order to test the feasibility of the design, and then used it as a laboratory to further refine the construction methods. Nakashima's duties included <b>doing</b> <b>very</b> explicit detail drawings showing, for example, the design of the concrete formwork. Devotees even donated brass utensils so that they could be melted down to make door handles and hinges.|$|E
5|$|Shilts {{praised the}} Public Health Department of San Francisco's {{handling}} of the new communicable disease as they tracked down people who were sick and linked them to other people who had symptoms, although {{some of them were}} living {{in different parts of the}} country. He criticized the New York City Public Health Department for <b>doing</b> <b>very</b> little, specifically when Public Health Director David Sencer refused to call AIDS an emergency and stated that the Public Health Department need not do anything because the gay community was handling it sufficiently.|$|E

5|$|When {{this episode}} was being produced, The Bachelorette was a {{bigger and more}} {{prolific}} program than when this episode was originally broadcast. In addition, ABC was not <b>doing</b> <b>very</b> well {{at the time of}} this episode's production. The production staff encountered some trouble when deciding what Peter would be doing in the lobby with Cleveland during his Bachelorette audition; although the series could never come up with ideas they deemed to be suitable, they intended for Peter to put his buttocks in an aquarium tank in order to embarrass Cleveland and make him want to leave. This scene was not used, and the production staff used a scene of Peter putting his naked buttocks on Cleveland's naked buttocks; they also shortened this more detailed version and used the less-detailed current version.|$|E

25|$|All {{this work}} was done secretly. The public face of Blue Book {{continued}} to be the official Air Force investigation of UFOs, but the reality was it had essentially been reduced to <b>doing</b> <b>very</b> little serious investigation, and had become almost solely a public relations outfit with a debunking mandate. To cite one example, {{by the end of}} 1956, the number of cases listed as unsolved had dipped to barely 0.4 percent, from the 20 to 30% only a few years earlier.|$|E

25|$|The {{brothers}} {{decided to}} complete Lily van Java (Lily of Java), a film {{which had been}} partially worked on by South Sea Film in Batavia (modern day Jakarta); South Sea had reportedly booked an American named Len Ross to direct, but after shooting several scenes he left the country. Reports differ {{on the success of}} the film: the reporter Leopold Gan described it as <b>doing</b> <b>very</b> well, to the point its reels were damaged from overuse, while Joshua Wong recalled it as having been a commercial failure. After the film, David Wong backed out and the brothers were left without a financier.|$|E
25|$|Once wasps {{emerge as}} mature adults, they spend the first 2–3 {{days on the}} nest <b>doing</b> <b>very</b> little. After the first 3 idle days, workers can be told from non-workers because workers stay on the nest longer. A wasp that leaves the nest for any reason {{immediately}} after those 3 days is considered a non-worker. Lifetime in the nest, then, seems directly dependent on ones role: queens lived an average of 61 days, workers lived about 31 days, non-workers survived for about 5 days, and males only survived about 4.8 days. This is considered evidence that the caste system determines the individual wasp’s life course. Note that these numbers are based entirely {{on the number of}} days that a wasp is seen in the nest. In some cases, including males, the wasps live the majority of their lives outside of the nest.|$|E
500|$|Corporations are {{increasingly}} recognizing {{the benefits of}} green marketing, although {{there is often a}} thin line between doing so for its own benefit and for social responsibility reasons. The term “greenwashing” refers to all industries that adopt outwardly green acts with an underlying purpose to increase profits. The primary objective of greenwashing is to provide consumers with the feeling that the organization is taking the necessary steps to responsibly manage its ecological footprint. In reality, the company may be <b>doing</b> <b>very</b> little that is environmentally beneficial ...|$|E

500|$|Coxon {{struggled}} with drinking problems and, in {{a rejection of}} the group's former Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. In the 2010 documentary on the band, No Distance Left to Run, Coxon stated that he was getting more influenced by American guitarists as [...] "a lot of them were <b>doing</b> <b>very</b> interesting stuff with guitars and I needed to be nourished. I suppose as a guitar player and there was none of that happening in English music although English music was now more popular [...] I started listening to more stuff from the States from smaller labels." ...|$|E
500|$|At the fort, Moultrie {{ordered his}} men to {{concentrate}} their fire on the two large man-of-war ships, Bristol and Experiment, which took hit after hit from the fort's guns. Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the main- and mizzenmasts. One round hit her quarterdeck, slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh. The shot also tore off part of his britches, leaving his backside exposed. By mid-afternoon, the defenders were running out of gunpowder, and their fire was briefly suspended. However, Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland, and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day, telling Colonel Moultrie, [...] "I see you are <b>doing</b> <b>very</b> well here, you have no occasion for me, I will {{go up to the}} town again." [...] Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort's walls with persistent broadside cannonades. This strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions; the structure would quiver, and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering. [...] The exchange continued until around 9:00 pm, when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities, and the fleet finally withdrew out of range.|$|E
500|$|Parma {{had gone}} to Neuss {{prepared}} for a major assault, and the resources of Spain's Army of the Netherlands quickly changed the balance in favor of Ernst. In 1586, Ernst's allies had secured Vest Recklinghausen, {{even though they had}} failed to catch the elusive Schenck, and they had reduced Neuss to a pile of rubble, proving their overwhelming fire-power. In 1587, they encircled and took the fortified towns in the Oberstift, recapturing Bonn, Godesberg, and Linz am Rhein, and dozens of smaller fortified towns, villages and farmsteads throughout the countryside. Throughout, soldiers from both parties marauded and plundered throughout the countryside, searching either for important officials, booty, or other valuables. On 12 November 1587, one of Walsingham's informants wrote, the [...] "soldiers of Vartendonc (Martin Schenck) go out daily on excursions, <b>doing</b> <b>very</b> great harm in all places, for they have free passage every where. The other evening they went with 180horse to above Bonn, between Orchel and Linz (am Rhein), to make prisoner Count Salatin d'Issemburg (Salentin von Isenburg), but their design did not succeed, as he withdrew into a castle." [...] In early 1588, Gebhardt's supporters once more acquired Bonn; one of Walsingham's observers in the Palatinate, in Heidelberg, reported that the Prince of Taxis had been slain outside of Bonn, with 300Spanish soldiers.|$|E

SVM’s however <b>do</b> <b>very</b> well when the number of documents returned in the preliminary search is low and the number of relevant documents is small.
