5|$|Jolin {{spent most}} of 1918 in Copenhagen, where he showed his {{paintings}} at an art gallery at Nikolaiplads. They sold well <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stay in Denmark almost a year. Jolin enjoyed life in the Danish capital, the social life was more spontaneous than in Stockholm and people from different professions, or social standings, mixed {{with each other in}} a way that appealed to him.|$|E
5|$|This was <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be {{selected}} in the Australian XI for a match against the Englishmen, in what was effectively a Test dress rehearsal. Rain curtailed the match, and the game did not reach the second innings; Harvey made 22 in his only opportunity.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Sanders {{took over}} the lease of the Pure Oil filling station {{on the other side}} of the road, due to its greater {{visibility}} for motorists. He then began to sell fried chicken. To improve his skills, Sanders took an eight-week restaurant-management course at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration. By 1936, his business had proved successful <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon. In 1937, Sanders expanded his restaurant to 140 seats, and in 1940 purchased a motel across the street, the Sanders Court & Café.|$|E

5|$|Ring's {{performances}} were not <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take McCool's place in Bradman's first-choice team. Instead, Bill Johnston, {{who had taken}} 10/40 against Yorkshire and 11/117 against Hampshire on damp surfaces, was given the place on the opening morning of the First Test when rain appeared likely. Johnston then took nine wickets in Australia's victory, cementing his position in the team. This left Ring jostling with the other spinnersJohnson and McCoolfor one spot in the Test team.|$|E
5|$|Rockslide and X-23 later try to {{convince}} Anole to cut off his other arm in order to generate a stronger replacement. When he refuses, Rockslide calls him a sissy, which Anole finds offensive <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> reveal his sexual identity to Rockslide and attack him. Rockslide apologizes, swearing {{that he did not}} know. Later, in a misguided attempt at group bonding, Rockslide voices his acceptance of Anole's sexuality, outing him to some of the other students, though Loa states that she was already aware and that everyone already knew.|$|E
5|$|By {{the next}} day, Mackay {{realised}} {{that the position}} could not be held. He personally kept the enemy at bay with his rifle while new barricades were constructed. When he was satisfied with {{the security of the}} new position he reported to the battalion commander, who sent him to have his wounds dressed. Mackay's injuries were severe <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be evacuated to Malta and then England, and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916, by which time it had been withdrawn to Egypt. For his actions at Lone Pine, Mackay was nominated for the Victoria Cross. He was overlooked for the award, although he was later mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|White {{kept his}} job with Short Brothers and {{wrote in the}} evenings, as his stories did not make <b>enough</b> money <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> become a {{full-time}} author. In 1980 he taught a literature course at a Belfast branch of the Workers Educational Association.|$|R

50|$|Winning Appliances {{was founded}} in 1906 by Richard William Winning. He {{believed}} the carriage, hardware and saddlery trade was a substantial <b>enough</b> industry <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> establish his own business, incorporating R.W. Winning Pty Ltd. The company was initially registered as R.W. Winning & Co., Manufacturers Representative, after securing agency agreements with agencies in England.|$|R
5|$|His {{allegiance}} to the Lancastrian regime remained strong <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take arms against the House of York, and eventually cost him his life. Commanding the central battle of the king's army he fell, with the duke of Buckingham and Lord Egremont whilst forming a human shield in defence of the king, against the victorious Yorkists {{in the battle of}} Northampton on 10 July 1460. Even though the king had fallen into Yorkist hands, Beaumont was not attainted, and his son was allowed to enter into his inheritance. Presumably in an attempt to reconcile his family to the new regime. This failed, and Beaumont's second son (but who was his heir) – the by now second Viscount fought against the victorious army of the Yorkist king, Edward IV at the battle of Towton in April the next year.|$|E
5|$|Karthik was not {{selected}} for the ODIs against Pakistan and returned to action in one-dayers for Tamil Nadu in the meantime, but managed only 59 runs at 19.66 in three matches. Karthik returned to India after Zimbabwe tour in 2006 and made 26 and 11 in the Challenger Trophy for India A, which was not <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> force his way into India’s squad for the home ODIs against Sri Lanka and South Africa. In the meantime, {{he played in the}} Duleep Trophy and had the chance to make his case for Test retention. However, he scored only 106 runs at 26.50 in two matches and South Zone lost both of these and were eliminated, and Karthik spent the next month on the sidelines.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{had a more}} {{productive}} campaign during the 1952–53 season, scoring 470 runs at 33.57 and taking 23 wickets at 26.26 in nine matches. He broke through for his first first-class century in three years when he made 169 against New South Wales, {{but it was not}} enough to prevent an innings defeat. He scored 60 and took a match total of 5/102 in a match for Victoria against the touring South Africans early in the season, but this was not <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> regain his Test position. He bowled with steady results throughout the season, never taking more than three wickets in an innings and five in a match.|$|E
50|$|These victories, however, did {{not provide}} <b>enough</b> income <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> earn a living. His first paying job was as a $10-an-hour sheet metal worker in a Brooklyn factory, where he worked for three years. He did not enjoy the {{dangerous}} work, and left after a friend and co-worker accidentally cut off his own hand one day.|$|R
50|$|Despite selling well (receiving Gold {{certification}} in Finland) Kirka later resumed with his easy listening material, mainly because performing for younger audiences wasn't providing <b>enough</b> revenue <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{make a living}} for himself. It would also be Kirka's final all English album until 1995's Sadness in your Eyes, which was musically more close to Kirka's romantic and easy listening material.|$|R
50|$|The Arm & Hammer logo, {{which dates}} back to the 1860s, is often {{incorrectly}} claimed to have originated with tycoon Armand Hammer. Hammer was so often asked about the Church & Dwight brand, however, that he attempted to buy the company. While unsuccessful, Hammer's Occidental Petroleum in 1986 acquired <b>enough</b> stock <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> join the Church & Dwight board of directors.|$|R
5|$|Loxton {{retired after}} {{playing in the}} 1957–58 season. With the Test players in South Africa, he made 331 runs at 41.37 {{including}} 2 centuries, and took 9 wickets at 26.33 in 8 matches. He made 107 in an innings triumph over Queensland and 106 in a drawn match against South Australia. It was not <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> win a third Sheffield Shield title; New South Wales won for the fifth successive time, defeating Victoria in both of their matches. Loxton made little impact in his final match; although the Victorians defeated Queensland, his only participation was to score five runs in the first innings. His highest score remained the 232 not out he had made on his first-class debut.|$|E
5|$|Pathan's {{performances}} in the IPL were <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> retain his position in the national T20 team after his {{performances in}} New Zealand, and he then proceeded to the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England in June, where India were seeking to defend their title. He struggled in the warm-up matches, totalling 1/49 in five overs, {{and again in the}} first round of matches, bowling five overs and conceding 42 runs without success. Nevertheless, India defeated both Bangladesh and Ireland to move into the next round. He took 1/9 from two overs in the loss to the West Indies in the Super 8 round, and was left out for the remaining two matches, which India lost to be eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Patroclus was {{a leading}} {{official}} and admiral under Ptolemy II, {{best known for his}} activity during the Chremonidean War (267–261 BC). His early career is obscure, but it must have been distinguished <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> rise to the chief priesthood of Alexander and the Theoi Adelphoi in 271/270 BC. After the outbreak of the Chremonidean War, he led a diplomatic and military expedition to the Aegean Sea that expanded Ptolemaic control by establishing bases at Crete, Ceos, Thera, Attica and the Argolid. From these bases he tried, without much success, to aid the Athenians against Antigonus II Gonatas, King of Macedon. He may have been the defeated Ptolemaic commander at the Battle of Cos, which marked the end of Ptolemaic thalassocracy.|$|E

By 2007, Carter's MySpace singles ("Pause" [...] and [...] "Get It Girl") had accumulated <b>enough</b> buzz <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> prepare a possible album, however the idea was scrapped and Carter went on to embark on other musical opportunities.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes, {{when she}} herself wearied of love-talk, {{she tried to}} open her heart seriously <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> She saw him listen deferentially, but without understanding. This killed her efforts at a finer intimacy, and she had flashes of fear. Sometimes he was restless of an evening: it was not <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> just <b>to</b> be near her, she realised. She was glad when he set himself to little jobs.|$|R
50|$|Rosberg, after briefly trading {{places with}} Prost, {{who had gotten}} by Lauda and de Angelis, finally forced Mansell into a big <b>enough</b> mistake <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take the lead. Within three laps, Mansell, whose front tires were quickly fading, had dropped three more places before pitting on lap 38. Piquet became the ninth car to retire because of contact with the wall, and Arnoux moved into the top five.|$|R
5|$|Reaching {{their first}} semi-final in 24 years, Spain {{went on to}} face Russia {{for the second time}} during the tournament, though during {{the early stages of the}} match, Villa {{sustained}} a thigh injury after taking a free kick and was replaced by Cesc Fàbregas. The injury meant that he could not participate in the final where Spain beat Germany 1–0 to claim their second win at the European Football Championships. Despite missing the final and the majority of the semi-final, Villa's four goals in the four games he played were <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be top scorer of the tournament and was awarded the Golden Boot. He also made the UEFA Euro 2008 Team of the Tournament alongside striking partner Torres.|$|E
5|$|The Longhorns {{were led}} on offense by quarterback James Brown, who {{completed}} 163 of 322 passes (50.6%) for 2,447yards, 19touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. These figures were <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> set the Texas single-season records for passing yards and passing touchdowns. Brown finished {{the season with}} a passer rating of 177, No. 1 in the NCAA in 1995. He was limited in practices prior to the Sugar Bowl because of a sprained ankle suffered in Texas' final regular-season game. Brown's favorite receiver was Mike Adams, who led the Southwest Conference by catching 53 passes for 876 yards and three touchdowns during the regular season. Adams was assisted by Justin McLemore, a sixth-year senior who caught 30 passes for 488 yards, including a 161-yard game against Houston. McLemore's 30 receptions were tied by tight end Pat Fitzgerald, who had eight touchdowns, No. 2 in the country for tight ends.|$|E
5|$|The Man's {{aircraft}} crash lands at night. The following morning he continues on foot. The Brute {{returns to the}} hospital with a new box of items, though this time he constructs a device that will keep the door open long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> enter the building. The plan works, however, once back inside the building The Doctor pulls a lever which closes a secondary iron bar gate preventing The Brute from entering. The Man finds an abandoned bar, get himself heavily intoxicated and passes out. When he awakes, he ventures outside where he is amazed that it is raining fish. While searching for a way to cook the fish, The Man encounters The Brute. A fight ensues; the Brute gains the upper hand though The Man is able to escape.|$|E
5000|$|It's also a {{story about}} a [...] James has almost spitefully decided to hate Ireland and idealize America. As he's just 16, he's lived only 10 years in the U.S. and 6 in Ireland, hardly <b>enough</b> time <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> really relate to either. Additionally, in the 6 years there, he's {{inadvertently}} developed an Irish accent. It's clear to us that he's much more Irish than he'd like to admit.|$|R

5|$|There is {{a casting}} {{department}} at Elstree Studios which casts actors for Holby City {{as well as}} Casualty, EastEnders and Doctors. The programme also has two dedicated casting directors who bring in a shortlist of actors for the producer and director to audition. Some cast members who play main characters have made previous appearances in Holby City in minor roles. Mealing appeared {{as the mother of}} a paediatric patient in the show's fourth series, Roberts appeared as the son of a medical professor in Holby City seventh series, and Dhillon appeared as anaesthetist Sunil Gupta in 2001. Roberts believes that his single scene in series seven was <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be called in for the part of Joseph, while in contrast, Dhillon does not believe that his role contributed to his casting as Michael, but instead worried that it would work against him.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Æthelberht's influence in other kingdoms was <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> convert any other kings to Christianity, although this is partly {{due to the lack of}} sources—nothing is known of Sussex's history, for example, for almost all of the seventh and eighth centuries. Æthelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the Severn valley, on the northwestern borders of Wessex, however, and this may be an indication of the extent of his influence in the west. No evidence survives showing Kentish domination of Mercia, but it is known that Mercia was independent of Northumbria, so it is quite plausible that it was under Kentish overlordship.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's {{father taught}} her to play the piano, which she {{mastered}} well <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> believe that she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician. Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music, but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer. After finishing school in 1915 as head girl, she {{moved out of the}} family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at Seckford Hall near Woodbridge in Suffolk. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing. At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at Ipswich High School, and suggested that she train as a teacher. Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school, and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916. By this time she had almost ceased contact with her family.|$|E
50|$|Osborne {{was born}} in Solihull, West Midlands. He began his career with Hednesford Town {{as a member of}} the club's youth system in the under-18s team. He scored on his full debut in a 3-0 win at Didcot Town, running at pace took him away from his marker, making just <b>enough</b> space <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> strike a breathtaking curling shot from fully thirty yards that swerved past the goalkeeper and into the top far corner of the net.|$|R
25|$|While not {{directly}} related to the issue of legality, the incident also raised questions about the citing process itself. Under the protocol applying to the Lions Tests, the citing commissioner had to make any decisions on whether to cite players within 12 hours {{of the end of the}} game. This, it was suggested, did not allow <b>enough</b> time <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> gather video evidence and properly analyse it. Subsequently, the citing 'window' has been extended to 24 hours for most matches.|$|R
50|$|Bellamy was apprenticed to Samuel Dockham, a {{furniture}} maker in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in his youth. In 1857, {{at the age}} of 21, Bellamy worked with the well known ship's carver Laban Beecher in Boston. Beecher is the carver responsible for the Andrew Jackson figurehead of USS Constitution that was very controversial and ended up being decapitated by vandals. Later in 1857, Bellamy left Beecher's shop and enrolled in school, possibly because there was not <b>enough</b> work <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> remain on.|$|R
