40|$|I analyse how patent {{litigation}} {{outcome in}} Germany affects {{the performance of}} the disputing firms by interpreting changes in a firm's credit rating as a proxy for changes in firm performance. The results match theoretical considerations on the functioning of the bifurcated German patent litigation system: The separation of litigation and invalidity decisions, resulting in invalidity decisions taking much longer than <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>infringement,</b> provides patent holders with a window of opportunity to enforce patents that may later be invalidated. This shifts a major share of the immediate risk to the defendant and allocates bargaining power to the plaintiff. The estimation results provide support for this incongruity. Plaintiffs on average profit from litigation while defendants agreeing upon a settlement deal lose as much as defendants losing in trial. I further show that small, inexperienced defendant firms are at a disadvantage when dealing with litigation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{doctrine}} of equivalents {{began as a}} tool creating judicial flexibility to shield patent holders from piracy through minor variations on their inventions. Over time, two trends have transformed it from shield to sword. First, plaintiffs have persuaded courts to allow claims of infringement by equivalents even {{where there is no}} evidence of copying or other fraud. Second, as juries have decided more and more infringement cases, their sympathy for patent holders has had a greater impact on equivalents cases. Together, these trends have worked a gross distortion on the {{doctrine of}} equivalents. The doctrine should not be used to extend patent coverage, leaving the public unable to determine the exact scope of a patent 2 ̆ 7 s claims. Instead, application of the doctrine should be limited to cases where fraud or other equitable factors justify departure from the patent 2 ̆ 7 s terms. Further, <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>infringement</b> by equivalence should be made by judges in their equitable capacity, not by juries...|$|R
50|$|The {{main task}} of the court is {{judicial}} review. It may therefore declare the acts of the Seimas unconstitutional and thus render them ineffective. As such, it is somewhat similar to the Supreme Court of the United States. However, it differs from it and other supreme courts {{in that it is}} not part of the regular judicial system, but more a unique judicial branch. Most importantly, it does not serve as a regular court of appeals from lower courts or as a sort of “superappellate court” on any violation of national laws. Its jurisdiction is focused on constitutional issues, the integrity of the Constitution. Moreover, it adjudicates on the conformance of the acts of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania to the laws, compliance with the Constitution of international agreements, as well as their ratification, and takes a final <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> voting <b>infringements.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Steven Salaita {{controversy}} was {{the result}} of a decision by University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Chancellor Phyllis M. Wise to withdraw an offer of a tenured faculty position to English professor Steven Salaita because of a series of controversial tweets he had made in regards to Israel, Zionism and anti-Semitism. Wise’s action prompted a national debate about academic freedom. From the beginning the decision was supported by Wise and by the University's board of trustees. Salaita quickly fought the <b>decision</b> declaring <b>infringement</b> <b>on</b> his academic freedom and insisted the university reinstate its offer rather than search for a financial settlement. This began a long process of litigation. In August 2015, Chancellor Phyllis Wise resigned her role after accusations came forth she was hiding emails that involved the rescinding of Salaita's job offer. These emails included conversations regarding the Salaita Controversy. Shortly after Wise's resignation, 41 department heads, chairs and directors published an open letter calling [...] "Acting Chancellor Barbara Wilson and President Timothy Killeen should call for the reinstatement of Steven Salaita at the September 2015 board meeting. The Salaita case received national attention on academic freedom for faculty.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} investigate kinds of offences that motivate {{the characters in}} the movie "Revolutionary Road" to deliver their apology and to describe the way the characters express their apologies. The study used Trosborg's apology strategies and Holmes' social dimensions of communication and kinds of offences finding, Hymes' ethnography of communication with SPEAKING formula. The data of the research were taken from apology expressions employed in the movie entitled "Revolutionary Road". The corpus included the sentences containing apology expressions following an offence, and other supporting expressions employed by {{the characters in the}} movie "Revolutionary Road". The dialogues containing apology expressions and the types of offenses from the apology expressions were transcribed. The result showed that the kinds of offenses were <b>infringement</b> <b>on</b> space, <b>infringement</b> <b>on</b> talk, <b>infringement</b> <b>on</b> time, <b>infringement</b> <b>on</b> possession and social behavior offence. The characters in the movie “Revolutionary Road” expressed their apologies with the simple and complex form of apology strategies both directly and indirectly. They also delivered their apologies in high tone and low tone. They also showed nonverbal expressions in apologizing. The apology strategies were influenced by the degree of severity of the offence and the response given by the addressee. The employing of apology strategy in apologizing was influenced by the social distance, the formality of the situation, and the social status of the participants. It is implied that the speech act of apology in different contexts including movies should be regarded and considered by sociolinguistics...|$|R
