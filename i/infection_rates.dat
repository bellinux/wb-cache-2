5|$|The viral load of an {{infected}} person {{is an important}} risk factor in both sexual and mother-to-child transmission. During the first 2.5months of an HIV infection a person's infectiousness is twelve times higher due to this high viral load. If the person is in the late stages of <b>infection,</b> <b>rates</b> of transmission are approximately eightfold greater.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{raccoons}} in the Southeast {{have yielded}} <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> ranging from 47% to {{as low as}} 15.5%. Armadillo prevalence studies have been described in Louisiana, and range {{from a low of}} 1.1% to 28.8%. Additionally, small rodents, including squirrels, mice, and rats, are important in the sylvatic transmission cycle because of their importance as bloodmeal sources for the insect vectors. A Texas study revealed 17.3% percent T. cruzi prevalence in 75 specimens representing four separate small rodent species.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} the opsonic glycoprotein fibronectin in the host defense of the peritoneum in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory pen-toneal dialysis (CAPD). Fibronectin concentration in penitoneal dialysate from hight <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> CAPD patients (> 1. 50 episodes peritonitis per year) was significantly less than from low <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> CAPD patients (< 0. 55 episodes peritonitis per year). In vitro secretion of fibronectin by cultured penitoneal macrophages from patients with high <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> was less than from low <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> patients (P < 0. 05) and controls (P < 0. 01). In vitro secretion of the second component of complement, however, was similar in both high and low <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> patients. Plasma fibronectin concentration and in vitro fibronectin secretion by cultured peripheral blood monocytes was not different between high <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> patients and low <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> patients, but was less than normals.

The overall <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> was 13.6  %, with 4.3  % deep infections and 9.3  % superficial. The deep <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> before the change in the policy was 8.5  %. The improvement in the deep <b>infections</b> <b>rate</b> was not affected by the change in the antibiotics policy. We have not yet analysed our data for other outcomes, such as ultimate healing of the fracture, number of subsequent operations or outcome for the limb, but we are able to suggest that delaying the surgery in order to maximize the whole operative team has not resulted in an increased deep <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> and would support continued application of the BOA/BAPRAS guidelines.|$|R
5|$|Despite these {{barriers}} to access, health services {{have shown a}} trend toward improvement {{over the past twenty}} years. Child immunizations against such diseases as hepatitis B, diphtheria and measles increased an average of 60percent in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth. In 2010 the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup. The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births, with an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births. Schistosomiasis, malaria and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar, although <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> of AIDS remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa, at only 0.2percent of the adult population. The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8.5 deaths per 100,000people, in part due to the highest frequency use of insecticide treated nets in Africa. Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67years for women.|$|E
5|$|In {{their native}} habitat, all Amylostereum species have a minor {{importance}} as forest pests. The infestation through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is, {{compared with other}} pests, almost insignificant. The <b>infection</b> <b>rates</b> are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies, as the wasps do not {{play a part in}} the process. Furthermore, the Amylostereum fungi are alone often incapable of infesting healthy trees. They thus mostly act as saprobiontics. Pine monocultures in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America were shown to be susceptible to the Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio), which was introduced there and which is associated with A.areolatum. The wasp's phytotoxic secretion, its larvae and the fungus combine very effectively with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to 80%. This is mainly owing to the poor water and nutrient supply of the trees, which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation. S.noctilio was detected in North America in the 2000s (decade); in Canada alone, the total economic loss to the forestry industry caused by the Sirex–Amylostereum symbiosis could be as high as $254 million per year for the next 20 years.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objective: Sarcocyst {{infection}} {{is one of}} the most common zoonotic protozoan diseases caused by different Sarcocystis spp. Given the importance of this infection in public health, the <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> of macroscopic and microscopic sarcocysts in slaughtered goats was determined in Jahrom abattoir. Materials and Methods : Between April and June in 2011, six tissues including the esophagus, tongue, diaphragm, shoulder muscles, thigh muscles, and heart of 4925 slaughtered goats were inspected to detect macroscopic sarcocysts in Jahrom abattoir. To detect microscopic cysts, four tissue samples (esophagus, tongue, diaphragm, and heart) from 400 goats free of macroscopic cysts were investigated randomly via impression smear and digestion method. Results: The <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> of macroscopic cysts was 9. 48 % and the highest <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> was observed in the esophagus (91. 1 %). There was no significant relationship between the <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> of macroscopic cysts and the age or gender (p value > 0. 05). The <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> of microscopic cysts was 59. 5 % and 100 % via impression smear and digestion method, respectively. There was a significant relationship between the <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> of microscopic cysts and age (p value = 0. 002), whereas the relationship between the <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> and age did not constitute statistical significance (p value = 0. 700). Conclusion: The results showed that digestion method was the most sensitive method for the detection of sarcocystis in goats and 100 % of the goats were infected by this method.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} plantar puncture wound infections. METHODS: Ambulatory emergency patients were surveyed with regard to a previous history of plantar puncture wounds and any subsequent infections. RESULTS: 200 questionnaires were analysed.

40|$|Background: We {{conducted}} {{a survey of the}} infection burden associated with the implantation of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) in Japan. Methods: The institutes were selected using annual device implantation data provided by Medtronic Japan Co., Ltd. The data sampling period was from January 1 to December 31, 2013. Institutes were classified into Group P, at which only pacemakers were implanted, and Group A, at which other CIEDs were implanted. Group P was further classified into three sub-groups by implantation number. The <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> was compared between groups using logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 129 of 138 institutes responded. The annual <b>infection</b> <b>rate</b> was 1. 12 % for overall CIEDs.
