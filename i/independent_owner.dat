40|$|The role of {{ownership}} heterogeneity in influencing {{the extent and}} nature of innovation has been neglected but is an important omission as ownership differences can influence the goals, time horizons, and governance mechanisms relating to innovation. In this article I develop a novel framework that explores the potential impact and future research avenues in firms with a variety {{of ownership}} forms based on whether the organizational form in which innovation takes place is either a new venture or an existing business, and whether ownership involves new <b>independent</b> <b>owners</b> or existing <b>independent</b> <b>owners</b> of the organization. With respect to organizational form, new ventures are effectively locked into innovation by definition, while existing businesses may find a balance between investing in innovation and exploiting previous innovations, and engaging in more incremental innovation. Existing <b>independent</b> <b>owners</b> may be expected to take a more sustained view of innovation over time while new owners may be time delimited in their innovation. On the basis of this framework I analyze the following ownership types: academic spin-offs, private equity backed management buyouts, family firms and firms owned by habitual entrepreneurs. I identify the need for research to explore other ownership forms and the interaction between ownership types and different contexts...|$|R
