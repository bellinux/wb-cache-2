50|$|<b>Dimetindene</b> (trade name Fenistil; {{other name}} dimethindene maleate) is an {{antiallergic}} drug. <b>Dimetindene</b> is an antihistamine/anticholinergic {{that is a}} selective H1 antagonist. As <b>dimetindene</b> only minimally passes across the blood-brain barrier, it is classified as a second generation antihistamine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dimetindene</b> is used orally and topically as an antipruritic. [...] It is used topically {{to treat}} skin irritations, such as insect bites. Dimentidene is also {{administered}} orally to treat allergies, such as hay fever. Unlike first generation antihistamines, it causes only minimal drowsiness.|$|E
40|$|Background, To date, {{no single}} method has been {{successful}} in eliminating peritoneal adhesion formation after major abdominal surgery. This study evaluated the individual and possible synergistic effect of a local intraperitoneal barrier, 4 per cent icodextrin, and an intravenously administered antihistamine drug, <b>dimetindene</b> maleate, in the prevention of adhesion development following surgical trauma. Methods: De novo experimental adhesions were induced by standardized trauma of the peritoneum and large bowel in 120 New Zealand White rabbits. The animals were randomized into four groups receiving intraperitoneal saline, intraperitoneal 4 per cent icodextrin (60 ml), intravenous <b>dimetindene</b> maleate (0. 1 mg/kg) and 4 per cent icodextrin-dimetindene in combination (n = 30 per group). Ten days later, adhesion scores and incidence were assessed by two independent surgeons. and surface area by computer-aided planimetry. Results: Treatment with either icodextrin or <b>dimetindene</b> maleate significantly reduced adhesion scores and increased the incidence of adhesion-free animals in an equipotent manner. The effect of combined treatment on seventy, incidence and surface area of adhesions was more pronounced than that of each drug administered separately. Conclusion: Combined administration of 4 per cent icodextrin and <b>dimetindene</b> maleate may be used safety and efficaciously to prevent surgically induced adhesions...|$|E

Analytical column Supelco Discovery® Cyano (100 x 4 mm; 5 μm) and mobile phase composed of acetonitrile:ammonium secondary phosphate buffer 50 mM, pH 5. 5, with addition of 0. 5 ml of triethylamine in 100 ml buffer, 40 : 60 (v/v) {{were used for the}} chromatography. The flow-rate was 0. 7 mL/min and the UV detection was accomplished at 258 nm. Diltiazem hydrochloride was used as internal standard. Substances were eluted in the following order: 2 -ethylpyridine, diltiazem hydrochloride, <b>dimetindene</b> maleate. Validation parameters precision, accuracy, linearity, robustness, selectivity, limit of detection and limit of quantication were calculated. The system suitability test data (number of theoretical plates, asymmetry, resolution and repeatability of area and retention time) were tested...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} if histamine induces electrochemical alterations {{in the normal}} and post-traumatic peritoneum. Peritoneal rabbit specimens were obtained before surgery and 10 days post-operatively and were mounted in Ussing chambers. Histamine solutions were added facing the intra-peritoneal and outer-peritoneal surface. <b>Dimetindene</b> maleate-, cetirizine-, and ranitidine-pretreated specimens were used {{to investigate}} histamine receptor involvement, whereas amiloride- and ouabain-pretreated specimens were used to investigate ion transportation blockage involvement. Trans-mesothelial resistance (R (TM)) was determined. Histamine-increased R (TM) intra-peritoneally and decreased it outer-peritoneally. A less intense effect was induced in post-traumatic specimens. <b>Dimetindene</b> maleate, cetirizine, amiloride, and ouabain totally inhibited this effect, whereas ranitidine only had a partial effect. Histamine induces electrochemical alterations in the normal and post-operative peritoneum. This effect is mediated by interaction with histamine receptors, hindering the normal process of ion trans-mesothelial transportation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Histamine is {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases and regulates the permeability of different tissues. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of histamine on the electrophysiology of human parietal pleura and the underlying mechanisms involved. Materials and methods: Pleural specimens were obtained from patients subjected to thoracic surgery and were mounted in Ussing chambers. Histamine solutions (1 mu M to 1 mM) were applied in native and pretreated specimens with <b>dimetindene</b> maleate, cetirizine, ranitidine, amiloride and ouabain. Transmesothelial resistance was determined (R(TM)). Results: Histamine induced a rapid R(TM) increase on the mesothelial (p = 0. 008) and a decrease on the interstitial surface (p = 0. 029). This effect was dose-dependent and was totally abolished by <b>dimetindene</b> maleate, cetirizine and amiloride and partially by ranitidine and ouabain. Conclusions: Histamine induces acute electrochemical changes in human pleura mainly via interaction with the H(1) and partially with the H(2) histamine receptors. It also interferes with trans-cellular permeability and therefore may participate in pleural fluid recycling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Based on the chiral {{separation}} of several basic drugs, <b>dimetindene,</b> tetryzoline, theodrenaline and verapamil, the liquid pre-column capillary electrophoresis (LPC-CE) technique was established. It {{was used to}} determine free concentrations of drug enantiomers in mixed solutions with human serum albumin (HSA). To prevent HSA entering the CE chiral separation zone, the mobility differences between HSA and drugs under a specific pH condition were employed in the LPC. Thus, the detection confusion caused by protein was totally avoided. Further study of binding constants determination and protein binding competitions was carried out. The study proves that the LPC technique could be used for complex media, particularly the matrix of protein coexisting with a variety of drugs...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} whether surgical trauma in a rabbit adhesion formation {{model and the}} administration of normal saline (N/S), icodextrin (ID) and/or <b>dimetindene</b> maleate (DM) changes the permeability of the normal rabbit parietal peritoneum. Materials and Methods: A total of 45 female rabbits were operated on for adhesion formation and were euthanized 10 days later. In some rabbits, ID or N/S was instilled intraabdominally during operation, whereas in others DM was infused intravenously. In others, ID plus DM or no agent was used. Specimens were obtained postoperatively and were mounted between Ussing chambers. Amiloride was used to investigate Na(+) channels. Transmesothelial resistance (R(TM)) was determined as a permeability indicator. Results: Amiloride increased the R(TM) of both surfaces. Surgical trauma increased R(TM) and partially inhibited the effect of amiloride. ID and N/S increased R(TM) and inhibited the effect of amiloride. Use of DM did not change R(TM) and did not inhibit the effect of amiloride. Use of ID plus DM slightly increased R(TM), but the effect of amiloride was blocked. Conclusions: Surgical trauma impairs the permeability of the normal rabbit parietal peritoneum. ID or N/S surmounted this effect, but DM did not, suggesting that surgical trauma is a diffuse process.

40|$|According to {{the model}} of Wren and Rowe, the {{separation}} between two enantiomers in capillary electrophoresis (CE) decreases if an organic modifier {{is added to the}} run buffer containing a neutral cyclodextrin (CD) in a concentration below its optimal value in a solvent-free system. In previous work, however, it was observed that the addition of methanol to the background electrolyte (BGE) containing not charged carboxymethyl-beta-CD in a concentration below its optimal value, increased the enantioresolution of <b>dimetindene</b> maleate. The enantioresolution decreased when other organic modifiers (ethanol, isopropanol or acetonitrile) were added and/or when other neutral (beta-CD, hydroxypropyl-beta-CD) or chargeable (carboxyethyl-beta- and succinyl-beta-CD) CDs were used. In this CE study further attempts are made to elucidate the observed phenomena through investigating other basic drugs. The effect of organic modifier and CD concentration on the enantioseparation was studied by means of central composite designs. It is shown that obtaining this increase in enantioresolution depends upon the type of CD, the type of organic modifier, and the structure of the analytes. It was also observed that small differences {{in the structure of the}} analytes or the CD could have an influence on the enantioresolution. The addition of methanol also resulted in different effects on the resolution of closely related analytes. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A prospective, randomized, {{double-blind}} study {{was performed in}} 40 patients (ASA class I-III) treated with atracurium to ascertain whether histamine release caused hemodynamic or cutaneous changes. The treated group of 20 patients was premedicated with the H 1 antagonist <b>dimetindene</b> (0. 2 mg/kg) and the H 2 antagonist ranitidine (1. 25 mg/kg); the control group of 20 patients received saline. Six minutes after the induction of anesthesia with thiopental/fentanyl, patients received atracurium 0. 5 mg/kg over 5 s. Plasma histamine levels were measured fluorometrically 5 min after administration of thiopental/fentanyl and 2 and 5 min after atracurium. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were recorded every 2 min. Histamine levels (0. 24 ng/mL) did not change significantly after thiopental/fentanyl. In the control group, 2 min after injection of atracurium, plasma histamine levels were 0. 76 +/- 0. 76 ng/mL, and in the antihistamine-treated group, 0. 39 +/- 0. 24 ng/mL (P < 0. 05 control versus treated), suggesting that pretreatment with antihistamines may attenuate atracurium-induced histamine release. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both groups after thiopental (P < 0. 05), but did not decrease further after the administration of atracurium. There were cutaneous manifestations in 7 of 20 patients {{in the control group}} and in none of the 20 patients treated with H 1 and H 2 antagonists (P < 0. 0005). We conclude that atracurium caused modest histamine release in our patients but that the decrease in arterial blood pressure may have been due, in part, to thiopental. Cutaneous manifestations of histamine release did not correlate with hemodynamic events or with plasma histamine levels, but were prevented with antihistamine pretreatment...|$|E
40|$|Although {{histamine}} {{release is}} recognised {{as a common}} event during anaesthesia and surgery, few clinicians judge the resultant cardiorespiratory disturbances serious enough to warrant prophylaxis with antihistamines. We have assessed the incidence and importance of histamine release in a randomised 2 x 2 factorial study. 240 patients representing a routine throughput of major general surgery were studied during a standardised induction of anaesthesia and preoperative loading of the circulation with either Ringer solution or Haemaccel- 35, with or without antihistamine prophylaxis with <b>dimetindene</b> (H 1) plus cimetidine (H 2). Cardiorespiratory disturbances were graded as detectable, clinically relevant, or life-threatening from observers' records of the anaesthesia and the actions taken by the anaesthetists. Disturbances that were accompanied by significant rises in plasma histamine were further designated histamine-related, and those that were not were designated histamine-unrelated. Anaesthetists, observers, and designators were blinded {{to whether or not}} the patients had received antihistamines and to which solution was used for circulatory volume loading. Clinically relevant or life-threatening histamine-related disturbances occurred in 8 % of the patients who after induction of anaesthesia received Ringer without antihistamines, in 26 % of those who received Haemaccel without antihistamines, and in 2 % or less of those who received antihistamines (p < or = 0. 0001). There were 4 life-threatening histamine-related disturbances, all in patients who received Haemaccel without antihistamines (p < 0. 01). Histamine-unrelated disturbances occurred in 16 % overall, with no obvious effect of Haemaccel or antihistamines. The histamine-related disturbances under anaesthesia were remarkable for their severity (even with small rises in histamine concentrations), for the prevalence of bradycardia, and for the absence of skin signs. Their likelihood and severity were increased in patients with tumours. The results of the trial make a case for routine prophylaxis with antihistamines as part of anaesthetic management...|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an established experimental organism {{for the study}} of adaptive and protective cellular stress responses is attributed to the evolutionary conserved physiological, biochemical, cellular and molecular processes. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of the pharmacologically modified yeast microenvironment and the actions of chemotherapeutic agents, modulators of hypersensitivity reactions and the drugs for the treatment of gastric ulcers under modified conditions, on the heat shock (HS) response. The agents were administered in yeast cultures, either chronically through to or acutely during the post-logarithmic phase of growth, prior to exposure to potentially lethal HS. The response to HS was evaluated by the determination of cell viability and occasionally of the growth potential after HS. Microenvironmental modifications were performed by chronic incubation of yeast cells with hormonal or immunomodulatory agents. The results demonstrated that chronic administration of the thyroid hormones 3 and 4 increased cell viability, in constrast to 17 #-oestradiol and the immunomodulatory agents prednisolone, histamine, <b>dimetindene</b> and ranitidine. Regarding 4, the data obtained following incubation with cycloheximide, omeprazole, pantoprazole, amiodarone, dronedarone, C 48 / 80, cromolyn, geldanamycin, 17 -allylamine- 17 -dimethoxy-geldanamycin, irinotecan, suramin and doxorubicin, pointed to the involvement of de novo protein synthesis, + and Ca 2 + homeostasis, hsp 90 and topoisomerases #, ##, in the induction of the thermotolerant phenotype. Besides the variability observed in the chronic and acute administration of chemotherapeutic agents, modulators of hypersensitivity reactions and the drugs for the treatment of gastric ulcers, as well as amongst agents belonging to the same category, depending on the dose, duration of administration and combination of drugs; modifications with T 4 influenced differentially the action of these agents on the cellular stress response. In conclusion, upon pharmacological modification, mostly via chronic incubation with thyroid hormones, alterations in the cellular stress response to drugs were of particular significance and provided data on the emergence of the resistant phenotype and the ‘behaviour’ of microorganisms during drug administration in the absence or presence of underlying disorders. In addition, although these data could not be extrapolated directly to mammals, the homology in many evolutionary conserved cellular processes between S. cereviciae and higher eukaryotes and the reliability of the experimental model in the cellular stress response research, provided preliminary information on the potential adjustment of drug action under pathological conditions and offered a lead for the re-evaluation of therapeutic interventions...|$|E
40|$|The {{plethora of}} {{histamine}} (HI) actions in inflammatory processes {{is attributed to}} its binding on four receptors Η 1, Η 2, Η 3 and Η 4. The recent discovery of the Η 4 receptor and its distribution in immune system cells led to the reassessment of the immunoregulatory role of HI. Aiming at investigating the immunopharmacological interplay of HI and cytokines in physiological and inflammatory conditions and the therapeutic potential of new drug targets, the cartilaginous and conjunctival HI and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) -α levels and conjunctival HI levels were determined in a rat model of experimental arthritis (EA) and experimental conjunctivitis following in vivo systemic or local administration of selective HI receptor antagonists and other related pharmacologically active substances at various dosages. HI was quantified fluorometrically in the rat cartilage and conjunctiva, while cartilaginous TNF-α levels were determined by ELISA. The induction of EA using complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) and the effects on extra-articular cartilage were confirmed by the clinical signs of arthritis on the rat paws and by the alterations of cartilaginous HI and TNF-α levels. Furthermore, the reduction of cartilage HI levels and the partial alleviation of the arthritic signs after systemic administration of the selective Η 1 receptor antagonist <b>dimetindene</b> in rats with EA pointed to the contribution of HI in the arthritic phenotype and in the rat extra-articular cartilage alterations through its action on Η 1 receptors. On the contrary, the action of TNF-α {{did not seem to}} be mediated through Η 1 receptors. The increase of HI levels in the normal cartilage, their reduction in the conjunctiva after systemic administration of the selective Η 4 receptor antagonist JNJ 7777120 and the increases in the conjunctiva upon local administration suggest a direct or indirect autoregulatory action of HI mediated through the Η 4 receptor and the route of administration-dependent effects of the antagonist. Moreover, neither antagonistic nor synergistic actions between JNJ 7777120 and CFA were observed and the Η 4 antagonist showed no anti-inflammatory effects, concerning at least the HI levels of the extra-articular cartilage. Additionally, JNJ 7777120 and sodium cromoglycate (CRM) might be acting on common molecular targets, given that upon mast cell membrane stabilization, JNJ 7777120 showed a biphasic effect, while in experimental conjunctivitis the antagonist did not reverse the reduction in conjunctival HI levels. In conclusion, in the normal cartilage, HI was shown to interact with ΤΝF- α in a Η 1 -dependent manner and to exert its autoregularory action via Η 4 receptors. On the other hand, HI appeared to exert pro-inflammatory effects in CFA-induced arthritis, while its autoregularory action and the role of ΤΝF-α in inflammatory conditions need elucidation. ...|$|E
