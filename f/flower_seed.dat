60|$|I {{know it is}} very {{difficult}} to believe that. It has been always difficult; and for this reason. Our souls and minds are disorderly; and therefore order does not look to us what it is, the likeness and glory of God. I will explain. If God, at any moment, should create a full-grown plant with stalk, leaves, and flowers, all perfect, all would say, There is the hand of God! How great is God! There is, indeed, a miracle!--Just because it would seem not to be according to order. But the tiny seed sown in the ground, springing up into root-leaf, stalk, rough leaf, <b>flower,</b> <b>seed,</b> which will again be sown and spring up into leaf, flower, and seed;--in that perpetual miracle, people see no miracle: just because it is according to order: because it comes to pass by regular and natural laws. And why? Because, such as we are, such we fancy God to be. And we are all of us more or less disorderly: fanciful; changeable; fond of doing not what we ought, but what we like; fond of showing our power, not by keeping rules, but by breaking rules; and we fancy too often that God is like ourselves, and make him in our image, after our own likeness, which is disorder, and self-will, and changeableness; instead of trying to be conformed to his image and his likeness, which is order and law eternal: and, therefore, whenever God seems (for he only seems to our ignorance) to be making things suddenly, as we make, or working arbitrarily as we work, then we acknowledge his greatness and wisdom. Whereas his greatness, his wisdom, are rather shown in not making as we make, not working as we work: but in this is the greatness of God manifest, in that he has ordained laws which must work of themselves, and with which he need never interfere: laws by which the tiny seed, made up only (as far as we can see) of a little water, and air, and earth, must grow up into plant, leaf, and flower, utterly unlike itself, and must produce seeds which have the truly miraculous power of growing up in their turn, into plants exactly like that from which they sprung, and no other. Ah, my friends, herein is the glory of God: and he who will consider the lilies of the field, how they grow, that man will see at last that the highest, and therefore the truest, notion of God is, not that the universe is continually going wrong, so that he has to interfere and right it: but that the universe is continually going right, because he hath given it a law which cannot be broken.|$|E

50|$|The {{study of}} plant organs is {{referred}} to as plant morphology, rather than anatomy, as in animal systems. Organs of plants can be divided into vegetative and reproductive. Vegetative plant organs are roots, stems, and leaves. The reproductive organs are variable. In flowering plants, they are represented by the <b>flower,</b> <b>seed</b> and fruit. In conifers, the organ that bears the reproductive structures is called a cone. In other divisions (phyla) of plants, the reproductive organs are called strobili, in Lycopodiophyta, or simply gametophores in mosses.|$|E
50|$|In late-1947, the Columbia III Planter {{had been}} {{introduced}} along with a fertilizer attachment. According to a December 18, 1947 advertisement, the new Columbia III Planter was a power-agitated attachment which had two adjustable opening shoes. The fertilizer was sowed in two bands with the seeds planted in-between the fertilizer bands. Roths Industries stated that this eliminated the danger of damaging the seeds during germination. The planter accurately planted all types of seeds from the smallest <b>flower</b> <b>seed</b> to the largest seed, including Spanish Peanuts in the shell. Any desired seed spacing could be obtained. Roths Industries also had special seed cylinders that could be furnished to suit {{a wide range of}} requirements.|$|E

50|$|Comfrey is a {{particularly}} valuable source of fertility to the organic gardener. It is very deep rooted and acts as a dynamic accumulator, mining a host of nutrients from the soil. These are then made available through its fast-growing leaves (up to 1.8 - 2.3 kg per plant per cut) which, lacking fibres, quickly break down to a thick black liquid. There is also no risk of nitrogen robbery when comfrey is dug into the soil as the C:N ratio of the leaves is {{lower than that of}} well-rotted compost. Comfrey is an excellent source of potassium, an essential plant nutrient needed for <b>flower,</b> <b>seed</b> and fruit production. Its leaves contain 2-3 times more potassium than farmyard manure, mined from deep in the subsoil, tapping into reserves that would not normally be available to plants.|$|E
5000|$|Hayden kept a {{considerably}} lower national profile than conventional wisdom would suggest {{for someone who}} spent {{more than half a}} century in Washington, including 42 years in the Senate. This came in part due to a conversation he had with Maryland Congressman Fred Talbott soon after he arrived in Washington in 1912. Talbott told him, [...] "Son, there are two kinds of Congressmen—show horses and work horses. If you want to get your name in the papers, be a show horse. But if you want to gain the respect of your colleagues, don't do it. Be a work horse."Hayden quickly earned a reputation as a [...] "service congressman" [...] who faithfully responded to constituent mail, inserting vegetable or <b>flower</b> <b>seed</b> packets in his replies.

5000|$|The {{characteristics}} of water hemlock include its stem which is 0.5-2 meters tall with purplish spots, thick roots, and leaves that are compound pinnate and alternate. [...] The leaflets are usually 5-8 cm long and 1-2 cm wide with jagged edges. [...] The flowers on it are compound umbellate inflorescences with many small, white flowers. [...] There are two seeds for each <b>flower.</b> <b>Seed</b> dispersal for water hemlock seeds comes from means of wind, water, machinery, on clothing, and through transported soil. [...] The seeds germinate in spring, and flowers mature {{near the end}} of June and beginning of July. [...] In addition to sprouting new plants from seeds, rootstocks can also product new plants. These are formed in the fall from the basal meristem, and when they detach the following spring, they may form a new plant.|$|E

50|$|In 1978 Michigan State University {{was asked}} by All-America Selections and {{professional}} seed producers to begin participating in the network of trial gardens scattered across the United States. Lowell Ewart took responsibility for the Michigan State University Trial Gardens. Trial gardens allow plant companies to see what varieties do well in different climates. <b>Flower</b> <b>seed</b> companies decide what plants would be tested and submit thousands of varieties for testing in Michigan. Bedding plants would be started in the Horticulture Teaching Greenhouse around March and April and then would be transplanted in May. Each variety was assigned a number and evaluated by a judge three times a summer, and information about those evaluations was published {{at the end of}} every growing season. Bedding plant producers met at the site in early August to evaluate the trials and decide what to grow in the trials what next season. The trial garden consisted of about half an acre containing 30,000 plants. The trial gardens were moved to the current site in the late 1980s and the current manager is Katie Carver.|$|E
50|$|Baretha is {{situated}} 30 km West of Katihar and 12 km west of Korha. It is culturally a rich village. Place where Mahatma Ganghi visited and stayed during different movement during the freedom struggle. Jawaharlal Nehru {{and many more}} prominent freedom fighter visited this place. Thus this place carries within itself the glorious past. Farming and business is {{the main source of}} living. People here have more economical senses and thus focus more on cash crop like Banana Plantation, Sun <b>Flower</b> <b>Seed,</b> Maize, etc.. Trading in all kind of stuffs like cloths, wheat, rice and others are primary. Though this village is a small one but it is quite very advanced. Literacy rate is also good, having high tech High School and other middle and primary schools. The business and farming in Baretha is being done by every section of the society. The place itself is worth visiting as it full of natural beauty and pleasant climate all around the year. In winter places are full with the migrant birds from around the globe. There are many spiritual places attached with the sentiments of the people. The nearest sub urban area is Falka which stations the block office and the police station. The area is connected to NH-31 and the nearest railway station is Katihar and Bagdogra being the nearest airport (190 km). But to maintain the current status of the area the government should focus on this area. And in near future this village will come out as model village of India with the help of social economic approach from all section of the society.|$|E
50|$|Ready for Math with Pooh is a {{separate}} game {{that is similar to}} Ready to Read with Pooh but the subject is based on math, most state-ably 1-30. Most of the gameplay is still the same but there are only seven activities and the Home path is replaced with a path called Garden. The game starts in an empty field where Pooh accidentally crushes a patch of thistles and decides to turn the field into a garden. Gopher then arrives with a wheelbarrow that the player types their name on. While Pooh's honey pot is still found on the bottom-right corner, it will be located at the bottom-middle of the garden. Also, the player can move the camera left and right to view the entire garden. If the player comes back later after completing some games, the garden will now have small areas where they can plant seeds and water them to make the plants grow, three <b>flower</b> <b>seed</b> packs in the wheelbarrow (sunflowers, petunias, and pansies), a watering can used to water plants, a shrub that can trimmed to a certain shape and can be returned to normal by watering it, and a basket near the North path. When returning to the garden, Gopher (who is unseen) may pull some of the plants underground and eat them before leaving, but the player can still replant them. A note may be found on the fence near the North path. After reading the letter, it will be blown away by the wind. If it says that someone has left something in the basket for another character, they will come down from the North path (except Owl, who descends from the sky) once the note is blown away and collect the unseen object(s) in the basket before thanking the player and departing. Optionally, the player can use the watering can to revive the thistles that Pooh had crushed {{at the start of the}} game.|$|E
