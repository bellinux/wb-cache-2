The paper {{describes}} an experimental verification of a previously proposed formula establishing {{the relationship between}} the crystallographic parameters of a rolled sheet and the anisotropy index in a <b>hot-rolled</b> aluminum alloy. The main texture components were identified in the <b>hot-rolled</b> 3104 alloy using the X-ray structure analysis. The crystallographic parameters and anisotropy indices were then calculated both for the entire workpiece and for each individual texture component. The earing level of the <b>hot-rolled</b> workpiece was determined using the process of cylindrical cup drawing. Cup formation was also simulated using the finite element software package PAM STAMP.

5000|$|The {{competitive}} {{power rating}} span of standardized CCVs ranges from few megawatts up to many tens of megawatts. CCVs {{are used for}} driving mine hoists, rolling mill main motors, ball mills for ore processing, cement kilns, ship propulsion systems, slip power recovery wound-rotor induction motors (i.e., Scherbius drives) and aircraft 400 Hz power generation. The variable-frequency output of a cycloconverter can be reduced essentially to zero. This means that very large motors can be started on full load at very slow revolutions, and brought gradually up to full speed. This is invaluable with, for example, ball mills, allowing starting with a full load rather than the alternative of having to start the mill with an empty barrel then progressively load it to full capacity. A fully loaded [...] "hard start" [...] for such equipment would essentially be applying full power to a stalled motor. Variable speed and reversing are essential to processes such as <b>hot-rolling</b> steel mills. Previously, SCR-controlled DC motors were used, needing regular brush/commutator servicing and delivering lower efficiency. Cycloconverter-driven synchronous motors need less maintenance and give greater reliability and efficiency. Single-phase bridge CCVs have also been used extensively in electric traction applications to for example produce 25 Hz power in the U.S. and 16 2/3 Hz power in Europe.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{determine}} the influence of <b>hot-rolling</b> conditions on structure of new-developed high-manganese austenitic steels. Design/methodology/approach: Flow stresses during continuous and multi-stage compression tests were measured using the Gleeble 3800 thermo-mechanical simulator. To describe the hot-working behaviour, the steels were compressed to the various amount of deformation (4 x 0. 29, 4 x 0. 23 and 4 x 0. 19). The microstructure evolution in different stages of <b>hot-rolling</b> was determined in metallographic investigations using light microscopy as well as X-ray diffraction. Findings: The steels are characterized by different microstructure in the initial state. Steel with higher Al concentration has stable microstructure of austenite with annealing twins, while steel with higher Si concentration consists of certain portion of ε martensite in form of plates. The flow stresses are in the range of 200 - 430 MPa for the applied conditions of hot-working and are up to 40 MPa lower compared to continuous compressions. Results of the multi-stage compression proved that applying the true strain 4 x 0. 29 gives the possibility to refine the austenite microstructure as a result of dynamic recrystallization. In case of applying the lower deformations 4 x 0. 23 and 4 x 0. 19, the process controlling work hardening is dynamic recovery. On the basis of analysis of thermo-mechanical treatment carried out in continuous axisymetrical compression test and multi-stage compression test using the Gleeble 3800 simulator allowed to work out a schedule of three different variants of <b>hot-rolling</b> for each of investigated steels 26 Mn- 3 Si- 3 Al-Nb-Ti and 27 Mn- 4 Si- 2 Al-Nb-Ti. Research limitations/implications: To fully describe the <b>hot-rolling</b> behaviour of the new-developed steels, further investigations in wider temperature and strain rate ranges are required. Practical implications: Various conditions of <b>hot-rolling</b> for advanced high-manganese austenitic steels can be useful to determine influence of microstructure on mechanical properties obtained in static and dynamic tensile test. Originality/value: Microstructure evolution in various conditions of <b>hot-rolling</b> for advanced high-manganese austenitic steels were investigated...|$|E

40|$|A sandwich-structured {{bimetallic}} blank containing high chromium {{cast iron}} (HCCI) and {{low carbon steel}} (LCS) claddings was newly prepared by composite casting, and then the blank was <b>hot-rolled</b> into composite plate. The evolution of microstructures, phase constituents and texture components of <b>hot-rolled</b> HCCI was analyzed. During hot rolling, the eutectic carbides of M 7 C 3 were broken and partly dissolved into the austenitic matrix, resulting in the precipitation of secondary carbides of M 2 C during air cooling. Significant refinement of austenitic grains and carbides are discovered in <b>hot-rolled</b> HCCI specimens. The hardness of <b>hot-rolled</b> HCCI increases from around 600. 5 to 850 – 900 HV due to the large carbides volume fraction, indicating a high strength and good wear resistance of <b>hot-rolled</b> HCCI.

40|$|Between 1996 and 2001 {{the world}} steel {{industry}} filed several hundred antidumping (AD) complaints, almost one hundred of which involved <b>hot-rolled</b> steel alone. Because <b>hot-rolled</b> steel {{is a relatively}} homogenous product that nearly all steel firms can produce, trade is highly sensitive to such trade impediments. Moreover, these characteristics make <b>hot-rolled</b> steel an ideal case study for examining whether other potential AD-induced trade effects [...] trade diversion and trade deflection [...] explain why the initial cases on <b>hot-rolled</b> steel were not a typical trade spat, but rather an AD outbreak of historic proportion. To identify the trade effects we create a detailed database of bilateral trade at the six-digit HS level of <b>hot-rolled</b> steel during the 1996 - 2001 period involving 142 exporters and 112 importers. On a global basis, we find strong evidence of trade depression, somewhat weaker evidence of trade deflection, and little evidence of trade diversion.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve the nonsmooth surface drag {{reduction}} structure on the inner polymer coating {{of oil and gas}} pipelines and improve the efficiency of pipeline transport, a structural model of the machining robot on the pipe inner coating is established. Based on machining robot, an experimental technique is applied to research embossing and coating problems of rolling-head, and then the molding process rules under different conditions of rolling temperatures speeds and depth are analyzed. Also, an orthogonal experiment analysis method is employed to analyze the different effects of <b>hot-rolling</b> process apparatus on the embossed pits morphology and quality of rolling. The results also reveal that elevating the rolling temperature or decreasing the rolling speed can also improve the pit structure replication rates of the polymer coating surface, and the rolling feed has little effect on replication rates. After the rolling-head separates from the polymer coating, phenomenon of rebounding and refluxing of the polymer coating occurs, which is the reason of inability of the process.

In {{order to}} carry out {{automatic}} transformation to the two-roll reversible <b>hot-rolling</b> mill of a aluminum plate production factory, firstly a series of mathematical models of aluminum plate <b>hot-rolling</b> parameters are established, then a new optimization algorithm which is suitable for aluminum plate rolling production combined with the various constraints in the rolling process is proposed, and rolling schedule optimization software system is developed. Finally, by measuring the process parameters in rolling production site and applying the optimized rolling schedule to the rolling production, many test data are obtained. The analysis of test results and evaluation of the practical production show that the mathematical models established have high accuracy compared with the old rolling schedule.
