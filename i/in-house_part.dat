Confronted with these antitheses, this paper presents a test of the exclusivity presumptions of the F/ 5 P model based on a survey of buyer-supplier relationships in the automotive sector.

50|$|The {{lessons learned}} with the CJ-2 {{led to the}} {{development}} of the first full-production CJ, the 1945-1949 Willys-Overland CJ-2A. The CJ-2A looked very much like a civilianized MB with a tailgate and side-mounted spare tire. One major difference between the MB and the CJ-2A was the grilles of the two vehicles. The MB had recessed headlights and nine-slot grilles while the CJ2A had larger headlights flush-mounted in a seven-slot grille. In place of the MB's T-84 transmission, the CJ-2A was equipped with the beefier T-90 three-speed transmission. The CJ-2A was still powered by the reliable L-134 Go-Devil engine. Many of the early CJ-2As were produced using surplus military Jeep parts such as engine blocks and, in a few cases, modified frames. Some of the use of surplus parts was due to strikes at suppliers such as Autolite. Since Willys produced few <b>parts</b> <b>in-house</b> and relied heavily on suppliers, it was vulnerable to strikes. Unfortunately for Willys, strikes were common postwar. This undoubtedly contributed to low production totals in 1945 and early 1946.|$|R

Neither where there any false compliant results for {{four out of five}} compounds. These data proved the procedure to be robust and an excellent means of controlling misuse of the banned antibacterial growth promoters. During a small feed survey, a selection (n = 614) of animal feed samples were screened with a multi-antibiotic ELISA method [2] that was developed in the same EU project and non-compliant samples were submitted to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) confirmation. The results from this confirmatory analysis indicated that the LC-MS/MS method will be a valuable tool in helping to determine the origin of the detected antibacterial compounds and that animals are still receiving tylosin in concentrations that are in the same range as the now banned AGP concentrations. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the Internet as a cluster of related innovations, along with the staged {{approach}} to organisational learning exhibited by SMEs in other domains, suggest that e-commerce {{is likely to be}} adopted in a sequence of stages. This exploratory survey, carried out by means of a postal questionnaire with 678 respondents, uses cluster analysis to derive a grouped classification of e- commerce adoption. Four groups of organisations emerge, which we term developers, communicators, promoters and customer lifecycle managers. Through inductive analysis of these groups we are able to suggest that they represent four stages in the adoption of e-commerce. Five factors found to influence this adoption are top management support, management understanding of business benefits, presence of IT skills, availability of consultancy, and prioritisation of e-commerce. In addition to these factors, several other factors influence the value of e-commerce to the enterprise for any given adoption level, notably perceived risk and customer demand. Further research is encouraged to validate and extend the stage model: further stages are hypothesised, for example, termed supply chain managers and virtual value deliverers. Implications for practitioners include the need to include customer demand information and a risk assessment in decisions on adoption, and the importance of building <b>in-house</b> skills as <b>part</b> of the adoption plan...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for optimal outsourcing of products. Outsourcing of products {{can have the}} advantage of reducing the production cost, but often causes a risk that important technology may leak and get used by competitors. To help reduce the risk of intellectual property (IP) leakage, a model proposed in this paper assumes {{that it is possible to}} separate some of the important geometrical features on some of the product parts that are outsourced, and then manufacture them in-house. The model estimates the fraction of IP-value that is subject to risk of leakage based on patent claims and how they relate to the outsourced parts and/or features. Production cost is modelled by assuming a base cost for manufacturing <b>parts</b> <b>in-house,</b> and then a discount rate is applied if the decision to outsource is made. Separation of geometrical features from manufactured parts introduces additional cost, which is modelled as an overhead if the decision to separate features is made. The outsourcing management process is then viewed as a two-objective problem, with the objectives being the minimization of both the fraction of IP-value at risk of leakage, as well as the production cost. A case study of an auto-slide-hinge mechanism is presented, in which the two-objective optimization problem is transformed into a single-objective constrained problem. Genetic algorithm is then applied iteratively on the problem in order generate the Pareto-plot that visualizes the trade-offs between the two objectives...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: As this Summit {{addresses}} {{the value of}} the school of dentistry to its parent institution, clearly this value cannot be assessed by cost alone. However, as extraordinary expenditures are required to meet infrastructure and equipment needs of the school, the need for change is inevitable. As long as we continue {{to think in terms of}} the traditional four-year curriculum with its heavy staffing requirements to deliver information, and in terms of clinical practice programs conducted for the most <b>part</b> <b>in-house,</b> there is little opportunity to better manage the cost of dental education. Alternatives are discussed based on revenue and expense analyses from the most recently published financial statistics for dental education from both the American Dental Association and American Association of Dental Schools. Strategies are presented as either changes in the first two years of the predoctoral program or changes in the clinical component of the predoctoral program, with emphasis placed on partnerships with other dental schools and with organized dentistry, as suggested by Machen. It is concluded from a review of previous studies that approaching the task of reducing the cost of dental education within paradigms that allow for only marginal changes would be an exercise in micro-management and could be accomplished by simply rearranging what had been written. By extending our thoughts beyond the limitations of the traditional four-year curriculum, we have attempted to present strategies that could potentially have a significant effect upon the cost of academic dentistry.

From 2001 onwards, Heineken, a multinational brewing company, implemented a comprehensive HIV prevention and treatment program for employees and their dependents of its African subsidiaries. Confidential <b>in-house</b> VCT is <b>part</b> of this program. VCT uptake dynamics over time, and factors associated with early uptake were studied. Between September 2001 and December 2007, 9723 adult beneficiaries were tested for HIV in 14 company sites in five African countries. Three hundred and seventy (3. 8 %) of tested persons were infected with HIV- 1. During the first 12 months 1412 tests were done, compared to 8311 tests in the subsequent years. The annual average uptake of testing among eligible persons varied between 15 and 32 %. The coverage was higher among female compared to male employees, and higher among female compared to male spouses. Distinct peaks in uptake were linked to specific local events. HIV- 1 infected persons {{were significantly more likely to}} be tested in the early period. The proportion of HIV- 1 infected persons among testees was 8. 8 % in the first 12 months compared to 3. 0 % in the subsequent period (p < 0. 001). HIV- 1 infected persons diagnosed in the early period were in a more advanced clinical stage, and had a significantly lower CD 4 count than those tested later (median CD 4 count 227 vs. 314 cells/microl; p= 0. 002). In this workplace program, HIV- 1 infected individuals came earlier for an HIV test than uninfected people, and people with advanced infection came earlier than those with less advanced disease.
