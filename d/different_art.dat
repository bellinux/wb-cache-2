25|$|Yuan poetry {{refers to}} those types or styles of poetry {{particularly}} {{associated with the}} era of the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368), in China. Although the poetic forms of past literature were continued, the Yuan period is particularly known {{for the development of the}} poetic aspects included in the complex mix of <b>different</b> <b>art</b> forms which characterize Chinese opera, namely the qu or fixed-tone pattern type of verses that were delivered by the actors of these shows. Although the language of Yuan poetry is still generally considered to be Classical Chinese, a certain vernacular aspect reflecting linguistic changes can be seen in some of the fixed-rhythm verse forms, such as Yuan ci and qu. Certain aspects of Yuan poetry can be understood in the context of the social and political changes which took place as part of the process of the Mongol conquest of the Jin and Song Dynasties and their subsequent establishment of the Yuan dynasty.|$|E

500|$|Halo Legends had {{origins in}} the 2006 Marvel Comics tie-in, The Halo Graphic Novel; O'Connor said {{that the idea of}} an anime {{compilation}} existed for years before there was momentum for the project. Wanting to tell smaller stories in a different format than video games and novels and in <b>different</b> <b>art</b> styles, O'Connor said that anime was a natural fit. An additional consideration was that 343 Industries felt that the Japanese style of narrative fit the stories well. Most of the animation studios Microsoft approached were available for the project. Most studios were [...] "afraid" [...] of creating their own stories, even if they were familiar with the series, so O'Connor sent them possible story treatments. Microsoft was deeply involved in making sure story details were correct and writing the scripts for the stories—O'Connor estimated that 50% of the dialogue in the final products were verbatim from the original scripts. While all the stories save one are considered canon, O'Connor noted that some discrepancies were the cause of artistic interpretation.|$|E
500|$|Mirror's Edge has a {{distinct}} visual style, with the outdoor environments predominantly featuring white and distinctively lacking in green (for example, trees and foliage would appear completely white instead of in their natural colors), punctuated by deliberate use of strong primary colours. According to Senior Producer Owen O'Brien, the stylistic choice allows the player {{to focus on the}} Runner Vision guidance, as well as serving as a health meter; the colours become less saturated as Faith starts to take damage. Because development of Mirror's Edge began before DICE's own Frostbite was completed, the game uses Epic's Unreal Engine 3. A lighting system called [...] "Beast" [...] was developed for the Unreal Engine by Illuminate Labs in association with DICE. The new software would accentuate the <b>different</b> <b>art</b> style of Mirror's Edge, by allowing for the reflection of colours as well as light. In order {{to address the issue of}} simulation sickness associated with the free movement of the camera in first-person view, a small reticle was placed in the centre of the screen. The reticle serves as an aiming and focal point, preventing dizziness in similar fashion to the dance technique called spotting. Aside from this reticle (which can be hidden by the player), no heads-up display exists in the game.|$|E

MTV News' James Montgomery, while writing {{an article on the}} pop culture references of Britney Spears' [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] music video (2011), claimed that [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] was an ultra artistic video, influencing Spears' one. Corinna Herr wrote in the book Madonna's Drowned Worlds that [...] "Visual references to surreal paintings seem to be a key to Madonna's world of images" [...] and listed [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] as one of these videos. In the same book, author Santiago Fouz-Hernández added that videos like Bedtime Story" [...] included alchemical and hermeticist traditions, in particular the concepts of androgyny and masquerade. Herr also wrote regarding the video's new age influences and concept of an idealised world, one [...] "which she is not necessarily a part, but to which she nevertheless seems to be attracted". Rettenmund commented that the video was rife with mystical and Sufi traditions, and described it as a [...] "singular creation in Madonna's oeuvre".|$|E
