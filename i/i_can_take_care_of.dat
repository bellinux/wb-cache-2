2500|$|In the post-fight, Angulo stated how he {{was unhappy}} with the stoppage, [...] "I told Tony he did the wrong job tonight. The referee tells us {{to take care of}} {{ourselves}} at all times. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself. My plan was to work harder in the final four or three rounds. I had good preparation for this fight." [...] His trainer Virgil Hunter was also unhappy with referee Tony Weeks, [...] "I'm very upset. I told the referee and the doctor that if Canelo put two or three shots together that I would stop the fight. He landed one punch. Everyone knows Alfredo was coming on strong, everyone knows that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you for nothing," [...] {{interrupted}} Golly gayly, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> {{myself and}} follow out my mission like John Gale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> God <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> of us,' said Johnnie, wistfully, as if {{striving to}} understand, {{as he felt}} the {{pressure}} redoubled on hand and head, as if to burn in what was uttered with such difficulty and danger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] demanded Hal. [...] "I {{can get a}} {{pass for}} him, and between us <b>I</b> guess we <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of him. It won't cost him a cent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he doesn't {{interest}} {{me a great}} deal, and I can't say Miss Leighton does, either. <b>I</b> think she <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of herself. She has herself very well in hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you are {{not strong}} enough for such work as this," [...] he declared. [...] "Better let things drift. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you. It {{is kind of}} you to give me this warning. But I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself. I come, you see, of a {{military}} family.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, uncle George," [...] said Rollo, [...] "that will be {{the best}} plan. Josie and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> Mrs. Gray, and you can go where you please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you go on, then," [...] put in Jack quickly. [...] "There {{are five}} of us, and <b>I</b> guess we <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of ourselves, {{especially}} {{as we have}} our guns with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] {{he said to}} {{the leader}} of the soldiers, at the same time giving him a piece of money. [...] "There is no further {{occasion}} for your services, all danger of rescue being past. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> now <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of them myself, being armed, as you see, while they are bound. Convey my thanks and compliments to your commanding officer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are joking!" [...] cried Bernard. [...] "When did {{you ever}} hear of my 'taking care' of any one? It 's as much as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You go and {{get that}} bag of mine ready," [...] said Lapham sullenly. [...] "I guess <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself. And Milton K. Rogers too," [...] he added.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you for the}} warning," [...] she said, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself. I do {{not feel}} even obliged to deny myself the {{pleasure}} of your society." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Never mind me, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself,' she said, {{while the}} muscles of her throat ached and quivered with emotion. 'I would not detain him to be pitied and forgiven.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{something}} <b>I</b> reckon Cummings <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of. If {{he has made}} such elaborate preparations for entering, when it is so near where he was living we can be pretty certain {{there will be no}} very grave mistake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "White Buffalo {{assures me}} that, for the present, the war hatchet has been buried everywhere, Lucy. To be sure, {{there is no}} telling when it will be dug up again. But <b>I</b> reckon we <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of {{ourselves}} should trouble come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of {{the dear}} child otherwise?--Lay your arm out upon {{the back of}} the sofa, my dear boy, and I'll sit down here, and get the bandage off so {{gradually}} that you shall not know when it comes. I was speaking of Provis. Do you know, Handel, he improves?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Clutches!" [...] I {{hated the}} way we were talking. [...] "Thank you very much. You forget you are {{speaking}} of one of my friends. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself." [...] He made no answer.|$|E
6000|$|Thus confronted they stayed; and then, as he {{saw with}} a contentment that came up from deeper still, it was indeed she who, with her worn fine face, would conclude. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself pretty well, miss, and I am not alone. I {{think most}} of the men here are of the same opinion, and will be glad to see the camp freed of these ruffians.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll do what I can,' said Undy. 'Mrs. Val is {{inclined}} to {{have a way of}} her own in most things; but if anybody <b>can</b> lead her, <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> Charley must <b>take</b> <b>care</b> that Val himself doesn't take his part, that's all. If he interferes, it would be all up with us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what it is," [...] he said, after {{studying}} the matter in silence several moments. [...] "It won't do to strip her entirely, for then we couldn't keep steerage-way on. The jib, foretopsail, and mainsail won't be more'n enough to steady her, and if the wind don't come any stronger, <b>I</b> reckon we <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the helm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about his trades; it's all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of my own, an' work 'em through accordin' to the agreement, when there's so much questionin' goin' on," [...] Nathan replied quite sharply, and his mother, who was evidently as prudent as himself in financial matters, desisted from pressing him further.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, grandfather," [...] I said, [...] "I didn't {{want any}} of this. All I wanted was a loan of, say, two hundred pounds. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself; I have {{prospects}} and opportunities, good friends in the States--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Tremayne {{looked at}} her kindly. This {{apparent}} concern for himself touched him. [...] "My dear Una, I hope <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself, even against so formidable a fellow; and after all a man must take his chances a soldier especially." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle George," [...] said he, [...] "you can go {{just as well}} as not. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> Rosie {{down the}} {{mountain}} to the Hermitage, and then we shall have nothing to do but to get into the carriage and ride home." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If you'll {{excuse me}} for saying something, Major, I don't think I'd take the matter to Captain Dale--at least not just yet," [...] put in Jack. This {{conversation}} {{took place during the}} cadets' off time, and the young captain felt he could talk freely to his superior officer. [...] "If we find that Stowell really tried to injure us, <b>I</b> guess we <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of him," [...] and he smiled suggestively.|$|R
50|$|Kirkman's first book, <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Barely <b>Take</b> <b>Care</b> of Myself: Tales From a Happy Life Without Kids, was {{published}} in hardcover on April 16, 2013, and was listed on the New York Times Non-Fiction Best Seller list.

6000|$|... 'Unfortunate Lavvy!' cried Mrs Wilfer, {{in a tone}} of commiseration. 'She {{always comes}} for it. My poor child!' But Lavvy, with the suddenness of her former desertion, now bounced over to the other enemy: very sharply remarking, 'Don't patronize ME, Ma, because <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|At this, all {{the little}} birds shuddered and cuddled deeper in the nest; only Tip-Top in his heart disbelieved it. [...] "I'm too old a bird," [...] said he to himself, [...] "to believe THAT story; mother is {{chaffing}} me. But I'll show her that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{struggle}} had begun. With desperate courage Lee fought, standing {{squarely in}} the rut of her mother's daily habit. [...] "You must not hive up here any longer," [...] she insisted; [...] "you must get out and walk and ride. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the house--at least, till we can sell it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{weight of}} {{condemnation}} {{was for the}} Little Flock, but there remained discomfort for the Herd of the Lost. [...] "And you," [...] the Squire turned to them, [...] "you let these folks worship any stock or stone they're a mind to; and you find out the true God if you can, and stick to Him, and don't bother the idolaters. <b>I</b> reckon He <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of Himself. <b>I</b> command you all to disperse. Go home! Get out! Put!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Annie rather blankly. Then {{she added}} impetuously: [...] "Because I {{love her and}} want her. I don't--I won't--pretend that it's for her sake. It's for my sake, though <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> better <b>care</b> of her than you can. But I'm all alone in the world; I've neither kith nor kin; nothing but my miserable money. I've set my heart on the child; I must have her. At least let me keep her a while. I will be honest with you, Mr. Peck. If I find I'm doing her harm and not good, I'll give her up. I should wish you to feel that she is yours as much as ever, and if you will feel so, and come often to see her--I--I shall--be very glad, and--" [...] she stopped, and Mr. Peck rose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Harry must be fatigued," [...] said Rose, kindly, [...] "and must want sleep. The wind is so light, and {{the weather}} appears to be so settled, that I {{think it would be}} better for him to `turn in,' as he calls it;"--here Rose laughed so prettily that the {{handsome}} mate wished she would repeat the words,--"better that he should `turn in' now, and we can call him, should there be need of his advice or assistance. I dare say Jack Tier and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> very good <b>care</b> of the schooner until daylight." ...|$|R
