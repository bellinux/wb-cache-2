Case studies from different rural contexts and landscapes are provided, <b>illustrating</b> <b>tools</b> and options to make the advocated integration operational. Recommendations and guidance to policy making are proposed. The case studies presented cover 1) the use of visual assessment techniques to support landscape planning in rural areas; 2) participative applications of landscape assessment techniques in peri-urban areas; 3) multi-scale approaches to landscape management in Alpine areas; and 4) the application of landscape economic evaluation to foster rural development strategie...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{perturbation}} of thiol-disulfide homeostasis is {{an important}} consequence of many diseases, with redox signals implicated in several physio-pathological processes. A prevalent form of cysteine modification is the reversible formation of protein mixed disulfides with glutathione (S-glutathionylation). The abundance of glutathione in cells and the ready conversion of sulfenic acids to S-glutathione mixed disulfides supports the reversible protein S-glutathionylation as a common feature of redox signal transduction, able to regulate the activities of several redox sensitive proteins. In particular, protein S-glutathionylation is emerging as a critical signaling mechanism in cardiovascular diseases, because it regulates numerous physiological processes involved in cardiovascular homeostasis, including myocyte contraction, oxidative phosphorylation, protein synthesis, vasodilation, glycolytic metabolism and response to insulin. Thus, perturbations in protein glutathionylation status {{may contribute to the}} etiology of many cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy and atherosclerosis. Various reports show the importance of oxidative cysteine modifications in modulating cardiovascular function. In this review, we <b>illustrate</b> <b>tools</b> and strategies to monitor protei...|$|R

40|$|A {{shortcoming}} {{of design}} patterns {{is that they}} are only applicable at the design phase, offering no support during the implementation phase of program development. Part {{of the problem is that}} a pattern must be adapted to the problem, a characteristic that cannot be captured by a single reusable implementation. To solve this problem, this paper develops a generative design pattern form called a design pattern template. A pattern template is a pattern form that can be customized using a set of template parameters, to adapt it to the problem. The customized template is used to generate object–oriented framework code, providing implementation support. These pattern templates lead to a process for creating pattern–based programming systems that can be the target of tool support. As an example of such a tool, we present CO 2 P 3 S, one implementation of the process. We further argue the need for meta–templates to create extensible tools that allow users to add new pattern templates. To <b>illustrate</b> <b>tool</b> support for meta–templates, we also present MetaCO 2 P 3 S. All of the pattern templates in the latest versions of CO 2 P 3 S have been created using MetaCO 2 P 3 S. ...|$|R
