50|$|Top predators must {{coordinate}} their activities with their immediate lower prey on the trophic exchange. A {{good example of}} arising mismatch is the winter moth which has a rather unusual life cycle that is highly in tuned with its environment. As an adult, it awakes in the cold hardy month of November, mates, and then crawls back up the oak tree that it was undergoing its metamorphosis in to lay eggs that will then enter a state of diapause (Visser & Holleman 2001). Those eggs will begin developing in February and continue for several months before they hit a crucial point where they will want to hatch. This <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatching</b> is very important, because if they hatch as little as 5 days too early, they will starve to death (Visser & Holleman 2001). Also, if they hatch two weeks too late, {{the leaves of the}} oak tree that they so desperately rely on will have achieved tannin concentrations so high that it will not properly nourish the animals (Visser & Holleman 2001). This may seem like a trivial difference, but it will draw out the animals’ duration of which it is forced to feed and leaves it susceptible to further predation and parasitization risk. In recent years this is exactly what has been observed and the mechanisms relied upon for the phenology of each organism’s respective issues is being altered by a change in the weather pattern and which aspect each responds to (Visser & Holleman 2001).|$|E

The number of growing degree days (GDD) required for larval eclosion declined {{with the number of}} days chilled in the laboratory and number of days below freezing in the field, confirming the findings of previous studies.

40|$|Blue Tits exhibit extreme {{variation}} in clutch size and hatching asynchrony, {{which is the}} focus of this study. This paper reports an in-depth study of breeding Blue Tits showing that {{variation in}} Blue Tit hatching asynchrony can be explained by a number of phenological variables including particularly, date of bud burst in the local oak tree, which signals caterpillar emergence (34 %), also date of first egg (14 %) and female weight (8 %). Hatching asynchrony explained 9 % of the variation in brood mortality in this southern English population. Early incubation relative to clutch completion (incubation asynchrony) in Blue Tits explained 85 % of the variation in hatching asynchrony, differs between years and advanced hatching in early and fledging in late laid eggs. Consequently, because fledging is usually synchronous, hatching asynchrony shortens the total time spent in the nest and explained 28 % of the variation in nesting time from clutch completion to fledging. I present experimental evidence that brood reduction resulting from hatching asynchrony may be particularly adaptive {{towards the end of the}} breeding season, with 91 % of the variation in the productivity of asynchronously-hatched broods being explained by, and increased with, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatching.</b> About one fifth of birds delayed daytime incubation until after clutch completion, probably in wait for caterpillars to appear. Although the delay period was variable and extended total nesting time it always resulted in synchronous hatching.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a case study}} of applying machine learning tools to build a predictive model of annual infestations of grasshoppers in Eastern Oregon. The {{purpose of the study was}} two-fold. First, we wanted to develop a predictive model. Second, we wanted to explore the capabilities of existing machine learning tools and identify areas where further research was needed. The study succeeded in constructing a model with modest ability to predict future grasshopper infestations and provide advice to farmers about whether to treat their croplands with pesticides. Our analysis of the learned model shows that it should be able to provide useful advice if the ratio of treatment cost to crop damage cost is 1 to 1. 67 or more. However, there is some evidence that the model is not able to make good predictions in years with extremely high levels of grasshopper infestation. To arrive at this successful model, three critical steps had to be taken. First, we had to properly formulate the prediction task both in terms of exactly what we were trying to predict (i. e., the probability of infestation) and the spatial area over which we could make predictions (i. e., areas within 6. 77 kms radius of a weather station). Second, we had to define and extract a set of features that incorporated knowledge of the grasshopper life cycle. Third, we had to employ evaluation metrics that were able to measure small improvements in the quality of predictions. The study identified important directions for future research. In the area of grasshopper ecology, there is a need for improved data gathering tools including a much denser and more widespread network of weather stations. These stations should also measure subsoil temperatures. Recording <b>of</b> the <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatching</b> <b>of</b> grasshopper nymphs would also be very valuable. In machine learning, methods are needed for automating the definition and extraction of features guided by qualitative knowledge of the domain, such as our qualitative knowledge of the grasshopper lifecycle...|$|R
40|$|Sex {{allocation}} theory {{predicts that}} mothers should adjust their sex-specific reproductive investment {{in relation to}} the predicted fitness returns from sons versus daughters. Sex allocation theory has proved to be successful in some invertebrate taxa but data on vertebrates often fail to show the predicted shift in sex ratio or sex-specific resource investment. This is likely to be partly explained by simplistic assumptions of vertebrate life-history and mechanistic constraints, but also because the fundamental assumption of sex-specific fitness return on investment is rarely supported by empirical data. In short-lived species, the time of hatching or parturition can have a strong impact on the age and size at maturity. Thus, if selection favors adult sexual-size dimorphism, females can maximize their fitness by adjusting offspring sex over the reproductive season. We show that in mallee dragons, Ctenophorus fordi, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatching</b> is positively related to female reproductive output but has little, if any, effect on male reproductive success, suggesting selection for a seasonal shift in offspring sex ratio. We used a combination of field and laboratory data collected over two years to test if female dragons adjust their sex allocation over the season to ensure an adaptive match between time of hatching and offspring sex. Contrary to our predictions, we found no effect of laying date on sex ratio, nor did we find any evidence for within-female between-clutch sex-ratio adjustment. Furthermore, there was no differential resource investment into male and female offspring within or between clutches and sex ratios did not correlate with female condition or any partner traits. Consequently, despite evidence for selection for a seasonal sex-ratio shift, female mallee dragons do not seem to exercise any control over sex determination. The results are discussed in relation to potential constraints on sex-ratio adjustment, alternative selection pressures, and the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. dissertation. October 2011. Major: Conservation biology. Advisor: Dr. Peter Sorensen. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 81 pages, appendices 1 - 6. Recent {{studies have shown}} that recruitment of the common carp in many lakes of the Upper Mississippi Basin is limited to areas that experience an ecological disturbance that alters the fish community. It has been hypothesized that recruitment of carp is limited by native predatory fish and that carp are only able to recruit in habitats where these native species have been excluded due to winter hypoxia. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the survival of carp eggs and larvae in the presence and absence of native predatory fishes in three experiments. First, we sampled fish diets and carp egg abundance on a daily basis in lakes where wild carp had spawned to identify fish predators and track carp egg abundance in the environment. We simultaneously estimated the date of carp egg hatching using eggs raised in the lab at water temperatures that represented lake temperatures. We found that the bluegill sunfish was the main predator of carp eggs (94 % of egg predators were bluegill sunfish), and that egg abundance declined before the estimated <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatching</b> in areas where bluegill sunfish were present. In our second experiment, carp egg survival was tested in the presence and absence of bluegill sunfish in the laboratory. Carp eggs were fertilized in the laboratory, placed on artificial vegetation in 70 liter aquaria that contained a bluegill sunfish or no fish, and counted twice daily until hatching. We found that the survival to hatching of carp eggs in aquaria decreased from 74 % to 15 % in the presence of bluegill sunfish (p-value < 0. 001). In our third experiment, carp larval survival was tested in the presence of bluegill and green sunfish in the laboratory. Larval carp were raised from eggs fertilized in the laboratory until they reached their free swimming stage and introduced into 1, 600 liter tanks with five individuals of a single species of predatory fish or no fish. Larvae were then sampled twice daily for two days. Both bluegill and green sunfish reduced larval carp survival to zero percent after 34 hours (p-value < 0. 001). These results suggest that the bluegill sunfish is a voracious predator of the early life stages of common carp and is likely responsible for reducing the recruitment of common carp through predation on its eggs and larvae...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} factors {{influence}} the expression of an individual's sexually selected traits. These include genes, environmental factors, parental effects, and the individual's condition. Parental effects can also affect offspring condition. This dissertation considers factors influencing offspring condition, and how genes and parental effects contribute to {{the expression of the}} sexually selected wing-bar Phylloscopus humei, a monomorphic species. Males use their wing-bars in interactions determining territory size, but other forms of selection on the wing-bar have not been identified. I studied a breeding population of P. humei in the Manali Sanctuary, Manali, Himachal Pradesh, India breeding along an elevational gradient. In Chapter I, I use this elevational gradient to gain insight into factors that might explain nestling condition. The hatch date of nestlings has been commonly found to be important in their survival and fitness, with earlier-hatching birds faring better than those hatching later in the season. It is unclear whether this effect results as a direct consequence of the actual <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatching</b> or via parental transmission of fitness to offspring (with higher condition birds breeding earlier). I found that chicks hatching at higher elevations did so later in the season and were in poorer condition than were chicks hatching earlier at low elevation. There was no detectable compensation for late breeding at higher elevations, suggesting that parents pass their condition to their offspring. The following two chapters examine possible influences on monomorphism, focusing on the wing-bar. In Chapter II, I assess extra-pair paternity in the species and how it might affect selection on the wing-bar. Using newly isolated microsatellite primers, I assessed parentage in this population as well as in a handful of families sampled in Naran, Pakistan. The rate of extra- pair paternity was high and similar across years and in two populations [...] 35 % overall in Manali and 32 % in Naran. There was no association of wing-bar size, either in adult males or in offspring, with extra-pair paternity, and it appears that the high levels of extra-pair paternity may be a result of male harassment of females owing to the high density and breeding synchrony of the species. Chapter III considers another possible influence on monomorphism in P. humei [...] the inheritance of wing-bar size. Using parent-offspring regressions across sexes, this chapter determines that the wing-bar's presence in females is a result of a genetic correlation between the sexes. This genetic correlation is sufficiently strong that dimorphism is not expected to develop. However, there is a difference in the magnitude of heritability of wing- bar size between mothers and their sons and daughters. This {{may be the result of}} a sex-specific maternal effect acting on inheritance of the size of the wing-bar. Additionally, based on observations of female behavior, it is likely that the wing-bar may serve them a function, though it has not yet been determine...|$|E

40|$|Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields {{may provide}} good habitat for nesting and brood-rearing ring-necked {{pheasants}} (Phasianus colchicus) during {{early stages of}} succession. But, the success of hens in early successional CRP, relative to late successional CRP and other grassland habitats, {{has yet to be}} evaluated. The reproductive period is especially critical for populations of pheasants, and CRP’s benefits to hens and chicks may decrease as fields age because of loss of vegetative diversity, decrease in vegetation density, and accumulation of residual litter. During 2005 – 2006, we evaluated spatial and temporal variation in nest and brood survival for radio-marked hen pheasants in areas of northeastern Nebraska where portions of CRP fields had been recently disced and interseeded (DICRP) with legumes. Nests in DICRP tended to have a higher daily survival rate (0. 984; 95 % CI: 0. 957 – 0. 994) than nests in grasslands (including CRP) that were unmanaged (0. 951; 95 % CI: 0. 941 – 0. 972). The probability of 23 -day nest success was 0. 696 (95 % CI: 0. 631 – 0. 762) for DICRP and 0. 314 (95 % CI: 0. 240 – 0. 389) for unmanaged grasslands. Daily brood survival rates varied by habitat type, brood age, and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatch.</b> The probability <b>of</b> a brood surviving to day 21 was 0. 710 (95 % CI: 0. 610 – 0. 856). Brood survival rates increased with time spent in DICRP and as the brood aged. Survival decreased as broods spent more time in cropland and peaked seasonally with broods that hatched on 15 June. Brood survival probability, to 21 days, would be reduced to 0. 36 (95 % CI: 0. 100 – 0. 701) if broods in our sample had not used DICRP. We combined nest and brood survival in a productivity model that suggested 2, 000 hens, in a landscape with no DICRP, would produce 1, 826 chicks, whereas the same hens in a landscape of 100 % DICRP would produce 5, 398 chicks. Production of first-year roosters more than doubled when hens nested in DICRP. Without DICRP, population growth rates of pheasant populations usually declined; with DICRP, populations stabilized with at annual survival rates of 0. 3 or greater. The positive response of nest and brood survival to discing and interseeding CRP provides further evidence that CRP fields must be managed to optimize wildlife benefits...|$|R

40|$|The {{population}} dynamics of cephalopods are principally influenced by marked phenotypic plasticity {{in response to}} environmental factors, yet we have a poor {{understanding of how the}} life history characteristics of natural populations may alter over spatial or seasonal scales. The focus of this thesis is an examination of the variation in the life history traits of two closely related cephalopod species, Sepioteurhis lessoniana and S. australis, each from two divergent latitudinal zones along the east coast of Australia. The study centred on an assessment of the growth, lifespan, patterns of energy allocation between growth and reproduction, and the timing and mode of reproduction of each species as a function of geographical location, and for temperate S. australis, season <b>of</b> <b>hatching.</b> The growth, lifespan, body size and maturation of Sepioleulhis lessoniana and S. australis from the different latitudinal zones was examined using validated statolith derived age estimations. In tropical waters, S. lessoniana grew fast initially, however the growth rate declined rapidly with age and individuals matured at small sizes and young ages. In the sub-tropical waters of Brisbane, S. lessoniana grew comparatively slower early in the life span, but growth rate did not decline as rapidly with age and individuals matured at larger sizes and older ages. In S. australis, although growth appeared faster in individuals from the sub-temperate waters of Newcastle, maturation occurred at younger ages and smaller sizes in S. australis from temperate Tasmania, despite Tasmanian squid having a longer lifespan and achieving a larger maximum size. Back-calculated <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatching</b> derived from statolith age estimations revealed that growth rate of S. australis from Tasmania was strongly influenced by hatching season, with individuals hatched in warmer seasons having a final size that could surpass that <b>of</b> earlier <b>hatched</b> (and therefore older) individuals. Faster growing squid hatched under the warming temperature regimes of spring and summer generally had heavier mantles at a given length, suggesting better condition at the whole animal level compared with slow growing squid hatched during the cooling temperatures of autumn and winter. Although males and females showed similar patterns in condition, the relative levels of reproductive investment of individuals in each hatching season differed between the sexes. Males hatched in warmer seasons had a higher level of reproductive investment compared with males from cooler seasons, whereas females hatched in spring and summer had lower levels of reproductive investment relative to their autumn and winter hatched counterparts. This study assessed the potential of Sepioteuthis lessoniana and S. australis to spawn multiple batches of eggs at discrete times throughout the adult lifespan. This was achieved by histological examination of the ovarian gametogenic cycle and detailed morphological assessments of the reproductive system, in conjunction with other biological information. Sepioleulhis australis caught in Newcastle showed evidence of a high correlation between body size and quantity of mature eggs, suggesting that eggs may be accumulating to be laid in a single batch. Although maturation was also a size related process in S. lessoniana and Tasmanian S. australis, oviduct size was not correlated with body weight in mature females, which is indicative of multiple spawning. Further supporting evidence included relatively low gonadosomatic indices, the heavier weight of the ovary relative to the oviduct, and the sustained feeding activity of mature animals. In Tasmanian waters, summer caught females showed a negative correlation between egg size and egg number within the oviduct, suggesting that some individuals were producing fewer larger eggs and others many smaller eggs. Sepioteuthis lessoniana and S. australis demonstrate a high degree of plasticity in their life history processes in terms of growth, reproduction and repro-somatic investment, and such flexibility in life history strategies within populations is consistent with an opportunistic lifestyle. Although there were substantial differences in the growth and reproductive biology between Sepioteuthis lessoniana and S. australis, and across latitudinal zones, seasonally related intra-specific variation in these traits within the S. australis population from temperate Tasmania were of similar magnitude. Importantly, this research also highlights the fact that a species may employ substantial variations on a reproductive strategy within different parts of their distribution, or with small genetic differences between populations. This, combined with other findings of this study, demonstrates that caution must be applied when extrapolating life cycle characteristics of cephalopod species across large geographical scales...|$|R

The rate <b>of</b> <b>hatching</b> <b>of</b> the eggs excreted by the patients before treatment was 90. 1 %. The rates <b>of</b> <b>hatching</b> <b>of</b> the eggs excreted by the patients 3 hr, 24 hr and 48 hr after treatment were 25. 5 %, 19. 2 % and 29. 9 % respectively. In vivo PZQ inhibits the <b>hatching</b> <b>of</b> S. haematobium eggs. The result of in vivo experiment was strongly {{supported by the}} results of the in vitro experiments. The <b>hatching</b> <b>of</b> the eggs exposed to PZQ at a concentration of 0. 1 μg/ml for one hour in vitro was inhibited...|$|R
40|$|The study {{considers}} {{the effect of}} white and monochromatic light on the <b>hatching</b> <b>of</b> the hybrid ROSS 208 chickens. The chicken embryos were most sensitive to white light, reaching the <b>hatching</b> time <b>of</b> 499. 80 ± 2. 65 hours, thehatchability of 95. 08 ± 2. 43 %, and an average weight <b>of</b> the <b>hatched</b> chickens 47. 17 ± 3. 08 g. Of the monochromaticlights, the chicken embryos were most sensitive to yellow light with the <b>hatching</b> time <b>of</b> 501. 16 ± 1. 84 hours, thehatchability of 94. 97  1. 92 % and average weight <b>of</b> <b>hatched</b> chicken 45. 88  2. 32 g. The least reaction of chicken wasobserved with blue light, with the <b>hatching</b> time <b>of</b> 506. 74  1. 57 hours, hatchability 92. 11  2. 18 % and averageweight <b>of</b> <b>hatched</b> chicken 42. 13 ± 2. 07 g. The influence of blue light brings the same effects as we observed in thecase <b>of</b> <b>hatching</b> in darkness when the hatching time reached 505. 76  2. 15 hours, hatchability 91. 62  1. 62 % and anaverage weight <b>of</b> <b>hatched</b> chicken 41. 73  1. 95 g...|$|R
