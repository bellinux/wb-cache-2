50|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>simulation</b> software, {{traditionally}} delivered as an on-premises solution {{through the}} user's desktop, {{is an ideal}} candidate for SaaS delivery. The market for SaaS <b>engineering</b> <b>simulation</b> software is in its infancy, but interest in the concept is growing for similar reasons as interest in SaaS is growing in other industries. The main driver is that traditional <b>engineering</b> <b>simulation</b> software required a large up-front investment in order to access the simulation software.

40|$|International audienceThe current way of {{designing}} industrial plants {{relies on the}} communication among experts in the field, and on tools that allow the simulation of the site. Virtual reality (VR) tools are used to visualize and interact with complex 3 D environments in real time, and several <b>engineering</b> <b>simulations</b> employ VR to foresee the results of complex industrial operations. The research project described here presents a Service Oriented Architecture aimed to create a collaborative environment, called CEE (Collaborative Engineering Environment) that integrates VR techniques into a system where the execution of different sequences of <b>engineering</b> <b>simulations</b> is modeled as scientific workflows. The focus {{of this research is}} on the oil & gas industry, particularly offshore engineering, where the project of a new production unit is a lengthy, expensive and usually is conducted by different specialists who are geographically distributed. Among the integrated <b>engineering</b> <b>simulations</b> are those involving structural calculus, hydrodynamics, naval engineering with mooring systems, meteo-oceanography, and others.

40|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>simulations</b> like aircraft, {{helicopter}} or safe {{building design}} on massively parallel hardware result in extreme challenges regarding algorithm and software framework development. Algorithms must be robust, scalable {{and allow for}} highly accurate computations, in many cases for the solution of time-dependent and non-linear engineering problems. Software frameworks must exploit hardware parallelism on several levels, must be tuneable for different, heterogeneous computing systems and must be easily to maintain. The latter is usually supported by a component-wise framework structure. <b>Engineering</b> <b>simulations</b> often require coupling of several application components. This is a particular challenge for the underlying parallel algorithms, for example regarding convergence and communication behavior as well as load balancing.
