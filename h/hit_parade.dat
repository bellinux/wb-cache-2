5|$|Record {{charts in}} the United Kingdom began life on 14 November 1952 when NME imitated an idea started in American Billboard {{magazine}} and began compiling a <b>hit</b> <b>parade.</b> Prior to 15 February 1969, when the British Market Research Bureau chart was established, {{there had been}} no universally accepted chart. During this time the BBC used aggregated results of charts from the Mirror and other sources to compile the Pick of the Pops chart. However, according to The Official Charts Company and Guinness' British Hit Singles & Albums, the NME is considered the official British singles chart before 10 March 1960. After that date and until 1969 a chart compiled by Record Retailer is considered the official British singles chart.|$|E

It had eight charts by 1987, covering different genres and formats, and 28 charts by 1994.|$|E
