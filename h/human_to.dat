5|$|At {{the scene}} of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from <b>human</b> <b>to</b> something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{released}} Ratatouille on high-definition Blu-ray Disc and DVD in North America on November 6, 2007. A new animated {{short film}} featuring Remy and Emile entitled Your Friend the Rat was {{included as a}} special feature, {{in which the two}} rats attempt to entreat the viewer, a <b>human,</b> <b>to</b> welcome rats as their friends, demonstrating the benefits and misconceptions of rats towards humanity through several historical examples. The eleven-minute short uses 3D animation, 2D animation, live action and even stop motion animation, a first for Pixar.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a <b>human</b> <b>to</b> compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E

5|$|In this episode, a Vidiian {{scientist}} named Sulan (Brian Markinson) captures and performs medical {{experiments on}} the half-Klingon, half-human B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson). He separates {{her into a}} full-blooded Klingon and a full-blooded <b>human</b> <b>to</b> {{find a cure for}} a disease. The Voyager crew rescues Torres and restores her to her original state, while she attempts to reconcile with her identity as a half-human half-Klingon. The episode guest stars Rob LaBelle as an unnamed Talaxian prisoner. Actress Joy Kilpatrick was cast as Dawson's photo double to avoid a reliance on split screen.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>human</b> <b>to</b> orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961. In total, about 487 {{people have}} visited outer space and reached orbit , and, of these, twelve have {{walked on the}} Moon. Normally, the only humans in space are those on the International Space Station. The station's crew, made up of six people, is usually {{replaced}} every six months. The farthest that humans have traveled from Earth is 400,171km, achieved during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970.|$|E
5|$|The rocket {{lands in}} the Hipparchus Crater, with Tintin being the first <b>human</b> <b>to</b> step on the Moon. Three days later, Haddock, Wolff and Tintin take the {{battery-powered}} tank to explore some stalactite caves {{in the direction of}} the Ptolemaeus Crater; inside a cave Snowy slips into an ice-covered chasm, but Tintin rescues him. Later aboard the ship, Tintin is overwhelmed by a third stowaway, Colonel Jorgen, a spy who had been smuggled aboard by Wolff, who has been blackmailed by a foreign power for which Jorgen works. With Wolff's help, Jorgen seeks to hijack the ship and return it to Earth, but is foiled by Tintin through emergency sabotage that cuts power to the engine.|$|E

50|$|The {{estimated}} cost of sending <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> Mars is roughly 500 billion U.S. dollars, though the actual costs {{are likely to be}} more. The largest limiting factor for sending <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> Mars is funding. In the late 1950s, rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States stimulated a national priority <b>to</b> send <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> the moon. Under the current global geopolitical climate, however, government funding of these programs has decreased. Recent participation of private companies in space travel and participation by new nations such as India may present new opportunities.|$|R
50|$|According to one source, {{there are}} three main factors that lead to {{automation}} bias. First, the <b>human</b> tendency <b>to</b> choose the least cognitive approach to decision-making, which is called the cognitive miser hypothesis. Second, the tendency of <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> view automated aids as having an analytical ability superior to their own. Third, the tendency of <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> reduce their own effort when sharing tasks, either with another person or with an automated aid.|$|R

After 33 orbits of the Earth, {{and a series of}} rendezvous maneuvers performed by Gidzenko, they docked the Soyuz capsule to the aft port of the Zvezda Service Module on 2 November 2000, at 09:21 UTC. Ninety minutes after docking, Shepherd opened the hatch to Zvezda and the crew members entered the complex.|$|E
5|$|Thermal inertia and the {{transfer}} of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the night and day sides, despite Venus's extremely slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few kilometres per hour, {{but because of the}} high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a <b>human</b> <b>to</b> walk through, even if the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen were not a problem.|$|E

Truth captures Johnson, as he needs a <b>human</b> <b>to</b> use Forerunner technology. Keyes is killed attempting a rescue, and Johnson is forced to activate the rings. Gravemind forges a truce with the Chief and Arbiter to stop Truth. The Arbiter, Master Chief, and Flood forces arrive and overwhelm Truth's guards, rescuing Johnson and halting the installations' activation. After the Arbiter kills Truth, Gravemind turns on the Chief and Arbiter.|$|E

Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
