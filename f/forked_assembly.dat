50|$|Columbia mopeds {{were the}} first mopeds ever {{assembled}} in the United States, even though the motor and some parts were outsourced. The tubular frames, seats, fenders, wheels, hubs, brakes, front <b>fork</b> <b>assembly,</b> headlight, and wiring harnesses {{were made in the}} United States.|$|R
5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{fact is that}} Kymco's 2010 Quannon Naked's 37MM front <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> can {{be nearly}} directly transplanted on Taiwan made NSR's {{with the help of}} a small CNC-ed washer, directly addressing the problem with [...] "head float" [...] under hard acceleration and stability at higher speeds.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Columbia sold {{the rights and}} design of their mopeds to a company, KKM Enterprises, Inc. that {{produced}} identical mopeds under the name Mopet into the mid-1990s. This company produced the tubular frames, long seats, fenders, wheels, hubs, brakes, front <b>fork</b> <b>assembly,</b> headlight, and wiring harnesses in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Early {{disc brake}} {{calipers}} {{were located in}} front of the fork leg on top of the disc. This position placed the caliper in an area of high air flow for better heat removal. Calipers on most modern motorcycles are mounted {{to the rear of the}} fork leg. This has the advantage of reducing the angular momentum of the <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> and improving low speed handling. Radial mounted calipers.|$|R
5000|$|H1C had CDI {{ignition}} {{instead of}} points as found on an H1B, and a front drum brake {{as opposed to}} the disk brake on the H1B model. The H1C carried over the stainless fenders from 1971 along with the complete <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> and gauge style. Engines and exhaust were also carry overs from the 1971 model making it a true hybrid of the new 72 H1B and the 71 H1 models.|$|R
5000|$|... 1966-1967: The A1 was {{available}} {{with either a}} candy red or candy blue with chrome parts and black frame. The fuel tank had rubber knee grips, metal Kawasaki flag emblem and 2 white stripes at the bottom. Rear fender, lower rear shock absorber, chain guard, {{and parts of the}} front <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> were chrome. Front fender was stainless steel, a novelty then. Upper fork, headlight and speedometer combination as well as upper rear shock absorber and side-mounted oil reservoir covers were painted.|$|R
50|$|The bike had a {{prototype}} sprung frame built under the Bentley and Draper patents. The frame {{as far back}} as the gearbox bracket was normal K. Behind this however is a triangulated tubular swinging <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> worked in a trunnion bearing. From the rear fork-ends two seta-stays were pivoted and connected to the sprung part of the frame below the saddle by a system of links and spindles incorporating two coil springs. Friction dampers were fitted to these links and there were also two more at the bottom pivots at the fork-ends.|$|R
2500|$|Early {{disc brakes}} (such {{as on the}} early Honda fours and the Norton Commando) sited the {{calipers}} {{on top of the}} disc, ahead of the fork slider. Although this gave the brake pads better cooling, it is now almost universal practice to site the caliper behind the slider (to reduce the angular momentum of the <b>fork</b> <b>assembly).</b> Rear disc calipers may be mounted above (e.g. BMW R1100S) or below (e.g. Yamaha TRX850) the swinging arm: [...] a low mount is marginally better for CG purposes, while an upper siting keeps the caliper cleaner and better-protected from road obstacles.|$|R
40|$|The lugs of {{the main}} rotor blade <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> have failed by wear {{followed}} by fatigue. The to and fro rotational motion of the bolts during lead/lag {{of the main}} rotor blades appears to {{have led to the}} failure of the lugs as well as the threads on the bolts. Analysis showed that with the present assembly design, such failures are unavoidable. It is, therefore, recommended that the present assembly design be reviewed and modifications incorporated to avoid/minimize rotational movement of the bolts during lead/lag of the rotor blades. The material and microstructure of the fork were found to conform to titanium alloy specification 3. 7164. 1...|$|R
40|$|Signal {{electronics}} {{equipped with}} a bandpass filter phase detector for noncontact atomic force microscopy (ncAFM) has been developed. A double quartz tuning <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is used as a}} force sensor, where one fork serves as a dither tuning fork, while the other is used as a measuring tuning fork. An electrically conductive Pt 90 Ir 10 tip enables the sensor to work in both scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and AFM modes. Electronic circuits for self-oscillation control and for frequency detection are given in detail. Atomically resolved STM and ncAFM images of a thin alumina film on NiAl(110) are shown with the microscope cooled down to 4. 5 K by liquid helium...|$|R
50|$|Mid-'77 {{the front}} forks {{had a major}} redesign, fork tube {{diameter}} increased from 34 to 35 mm and internals were changed (although this also holds true for various years of the same tube size). The entire <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> (with triple tree) will swap either way but fork parts are not equivalent. Also the brake caliper changed from a 48 mm dual piston cast iron design for the 34 mm fork to a 40 mm aluminum single piston floating caliper for the 35 mm forks. The brake caliper mounting lugs on the fork sliders are of different spacing for the 34 mm and 35 mm forks so the calipers can't be swapped.|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} review, A. Groth and {{coworkers}} presented a comprehensive account of nucleosome disassembly {{in front of}} a DNA replication <b>fork,</b> <b>assembly</b> behind the replication fork, and the copying of epigenetic information onto the replicated chromatin. Understanding those processes however would be enhanced by a comprehensive graphical depiction analogous to a circuit diagram. Accordingly, we have constructed a molecular interaction map (MIM) that preserves in essentially complete detail the processes described by Groth et al. The MIM organizes and elucidates the information presented by Groth et al. on the complexities of chromatin replication, thereby providing a tool for system-level comprehension of the effects of genetic mutations, altered gene expression, and pharmacologic intervention...|$|R
5000|$|A triple tree ("triple clamp" [...] (US) or [...] "yoke" [...] (UK)) {{attaches}} {{the fork}} tubes {{to the frame}} via steering head bearings, which allow the <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> to pivot from side to side, and therefore steer the motorcycle. Most bikes have upper and lower triple trees, providing two solid clamping points that keep the fork tubes parallel while also connecting the forks to the frame via the steering head bearings.With the tendency to employ fork tubes with single action damping, fork triple trees need to be reinforced more than when the forks shared both damping roles, because the rigidity of the triple trees is relied upon to distribute the forces within the forks without flex.|$|R
40|$|A double quartz {{tuning fork}} sensor for low {{temperature}} ultrahigh vacuum atomic force and {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} is presented. The features of the new sensor are discussed and compared to a single asymmetric tuning <b>fork</b> <b>assembly.</b> In addition, a low temperature ac signal amplifier has been developed {{to pick up the}} oscillation amplitude of the tuning fork. Current consumption and amplification factor versus the supply voltage of the amplifier as well as the magnitude response of the sensor have been measured at room temperature, 77 and 4 K. Atomically resolved images of a Ag(111) surface and single Ag atoms on Ag(111) were recorded in the scanning tunneling microscopy mode. Initial atomic force measurements are shown that reveal step resolution on a NiAl(110) surface...|$|R
5000|$|The front {{mudguard}} of the Wiesel and Berlin {{would not}} {{fit with the}} Earles <b>fork</b> <b>assembly,</b> so IWL designed a new one to accommodate {{the movement of the}} front suspension. This necessitated a bulbous shape that was inconsistent with the improved styling of the tail unit. In 1964 East Germanys annual book Motor Jahr circumspectly observed [...] "Diese Vorderradhaube liegt jetzt zwischen den Federbeinen, was vielleicht nicht jedermanns Geschmack trifft, aber deren gute Zugänglichkeit gewährleistet". ("This front mudguard now lies between the shock absorbers, which perhaps does not meet everyones taste, but it ensures good access".) However, in February 1963 Der deutsche Straßenverkehr magazine had been more outspoken: [...] "Uns konnte diese ›Linie‹ nicht sonderlich begeistern, und wir beneiden das Institut für industrielle Formgebung keinesfalls um seine Mitarbeit". ("These lines cannot particularly enthuse us, and we do not at all envy the Institute for Industrial Design in their collaboration.").|$|R

40|$|Activation of the {{eukaryotic}} replicative DNA helicase, the Mcm 2 - 7 complex, requires phosphorylation by Cdc 7 /Dbf 4 (Dbf 4 -dependent kinase or DDK), which, in turn, {{depends on}} prior phosphorylation of Mcm 2 - 7 {{by an unknown}} kinase (or kinases). We identified DDK phosphorylation sites on Mcm 4 and Mcm 6 and found that phosphorylation of either subunit suffices for cell proliferation. Importantly, prior phosphorylation of either S/T-P or S/T-Q motifs on these subunits is required for DDK phosphorylation of Mcm 2 - 7 and for normal S phase passage. Phosphomimetic mutations of DDK target sites bypass both DDK function and mutation of the priming phosphorylation sites. Mrc 1 facilitates Mec 1 phosphorylation of the S/T-Q motifs of chromatin-bound Mcm 2 - 7 during S phase to activate replication. Genetic interactions between priming site mutations and MRC 1 or TOF 1 deletion support a role for these modifications in replication fork stability. These findings identify regulatory mechanisms that modulate origin firing and replication <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> during cell cycle progression.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to fill an {{existing}} need two small electric ser-vice vehicles were designed, constructed, and tested. The first acted as a feasibility study and the second as a design prototype. The vehicleS had low cost and the capability of being fabricated by their users as two main design goals. The prototype design vehicle is three wheeled; utilizing a unique asymmetrical design to arrange a full length load box along one side. Motive power is provided by four automotive batteries running an electric motor. Power transmission is by a quiet gear belt drive to one rear wheel. A five solenoid switching system allows for two speeds, forward and reverse, of 5 and 10 mph. The vehicle uses motorcycle wheels and a motorcycle front <b>fork</b> <b>assembly.</b> Brakes are provided in the rear wheels. A full lighting system, consisting of headlight, tail lights, brake lights, and turn signals, is provided. Useful endurance between charges is about five hours at 10 mph. The vehicle is simple to operate and fully capable of negotiating any terrain found on the Oregon State campus...|$|R
40|$|The {{automation}} on front <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> {{machine is}} the project design {{to improve the}} quality as well as productivity of manual machines. Manual operating process consist of lots of errors like parts missing in assembly, parts fitment in the wrong direction, misalignment during assembly, inconsistency in process, etc. We are designing the automated multipurpose machine which will eliminate the errors generated by a manual operating process. Propose machine is also focused to reduce operator fatigue during working. Reduction in operator fatigue, improves working efficiency of operator which will result in an increase in productivity. This proposed automation is the combination of four individual process, namely Oil seal pressing, Guide bush pressing, Washer insertion & Oil seal greasing. The machine is controlled by a programmable logical control (PLC). It consists of number of pneumatic cylinders which will apply for pressing, pick & place & clamping of component, etc. The operator function is just to load & unload the component all the rest process is automatically done by the machine itself. This automation is beneficial in quality & productivity of the product; it will also reduce manpower cost as the proposed automation saves nine men per day...|$|R
40|$|RecG is a DNA {{translocase}} {{that helps}} to maintain genomic integrity. Initial studies suggested a role in promoting recombination, a possibility consistent with synergism between recG and ruv null alleles and reinforced when the protein was shown to unwind Holliday junctions. In this article we describe novel suppressors of recG and show that the pathology seen without RecG is suppressed on reducing or eliminating PriB, {{a component of the}} PriA system for replisome assembly and replication restart. Suppression is conditional, depending on additional mutations that modify ribosomal subunit S 6 or one of three subunits of RNA polymerase. The latter suppress phenotypes associated with deletion of priB, enabling the deletion to suppress recG. They include alleles likely to disrupt interactions with transcription anti-terminator, NusA. Deleting priB has a different effect in ruv strains. It provokes abortive recombination and compromises DNA repair {{in a manner consistent with}} PriB being required to limit exposure of recombinogenic ssDNA. This synergism is reduced by the RNA polymerase mutations identified. Taken together, the results reveal that RecG curbs a potentially negative effect of proteins that direct replication <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> at sites removed from the normal origin, a facility needed to resolve conflicts between replication and transcription...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Processive strand-displacement DNA {{synthesis}} {{with the}} T 4 replication system requires functional “coupling ” between the DNA polymerase (gp 43) and the helicase (gp 41). To define the physical {{basis of this}} functional coupling, we have used analytical ultracentrifugation to show that gp 43 is a monomeric species at physiological protein concentrations and that gp 41 and gp 43 do not physically interact {{in the absence of}} DNA, suggesting that the functional coupling between gp 41 and gp 43 depends significantly on interactions modulated by the replication fork DNA. Results from strand-displacement DNA synthesis show that a minimal gp 41 -gp 43 replication complex can perform strand-displacement synthesis at 90 nts/s in a solution containing poly(ethylene glycol) to drive helicase loading. In contrast, neither the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I nor the T 7 DNA polymerase, both of which are nonprocessive polymerases, can carry out strand-displacement DNA synthesis with gp 41, suggesting that the functional helicase-polymerase coupling may require the homologous system. However, we show that a heterologous helicase-polymerase pair can work if the polymerase is processive. Strand-displacement DNA synthesis using the gp 41 helicase with the T 4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme or the phage T 7 DNA polymerase-thioredoxin complex, both of which are processive, proceeds at the rate of 250 nts/s. However, replication <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> is less efficient with the heterologous helicase-polymerase pair...|$|R
50|$|In {{production}} {{the complete}} power unit was {{carried on a}} special front fork, with the 104 cc two-stroke engine on the left with its main-shaft run through the wheel spindle to a flywheel. Ignition was by chain-driven Runbaken magneto bolted upside-down to the crankcase base, and transmission was by chain up to a counter-shaft carrying a clutch {{and then back to}} the wheel by a second chain. The firm offered a package of wheel, engine unit and front fork or the choice of complete ladies’ or gents’ machines. The complete Cykelaid could be purchased for £50. The specification included an Eadie coaster brake, rear hand-operated brake, number plate, rear stand and Brooks saddle. The wheels were 28″×1.75″, shod with Dunlop Roadster tyres. Alternatively, the complete front <b>fork</b> <b>assembly</b> was available for £32, as a conversion of an existing bicycle. The early versions were not fitted with a front brake and, as mentioned above, the complete machine was fitted with two independent rear brakes. Presumably, when buying the front fork unit to convert an existing bicycle, one was also expected to fit an additional rear brake to the machine. Although the engine was lubricated by the petroil mixture, an additional oil tank was fitted. An oil pump driven by the front wheel hub delivered a measured supply of oil to the engine’s main bearings. It would, therefore, be inadvisable to allow the engine to run for a long period with the clutch disengaged, since this would cut off the supply of oil to the crankshaft. None of the available options proved to be very popular with the buying public.|$|R
40|$|The {{advance of}} {{replication}} forks to duplicate chromosomes in dividing cells requires the disassembly of nucleosomes {{ahead of the}} fork and the rapid assembly of parental and de novo histones at the newly synthesized strands behind the <b>fork.</b> Replication-coupled chromatin <b>assembly</b> provides {{a unique opportunity to}} regulate fork advance and stability. Through post-translational histone modifications and tightly regulated physical and genetic interactions between chromatin assembly factors and replisome components, chromatin assembly: (1) controls the rate of DNA synthesis and adjusts it to histone availability; (2) provides a mechanism to protect the integrity of the advancing fork; and (3) regulates the mechanisms of DNA damage tolerance in response to replication-blocking lesions. Uncoupling DNA synthesis from nucleosome assembly has deleterious effects on genome integrity and cell cycle progression and is linked to genetic diseases, cancer, and aging...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{or service}} systems with {{multiple}} product classes, job circulation due to random failures, resources shared between product classes, and some {{portions of the}} manufacturing or assembly carried in series and the rest in parallel are commonly observed in real-life. The web server assembly is one such manufacturing system which exhibits the above characteristics. Predicting the performance measures of these manufacturing systems {{is not an easy}} task. The primary objective of this research was to propose analytical approximations to predict the flow times of the manufacturing systems, with the above characteristics, and evaluate its accuracy. The manufacturing system is represented as a network of queues. The parametric decomposition approach is used to develop analytical approximations for a system with arrival and service rates from a Markovian distribution. The results from the analytical approximations are compared to simulation models. In order to bridge the gap in error, correction terms were developed through regression modeling. The experimental study conducted indicates that the analytical approximations along with the correction terms can serve as a good estimate for the flow times of the manufacturing systems with the above characteristics.

40|$|<b>Fork</b> and Join <b>Assembly</b> Systems are {{increasingly}} being used in modern manufacturing systems. Due to the complexities in their configurations, designing such systems for an optimal performance may pose a number of challenges. Because of the involvement of large system parameters and variables, designing an assembly system {{is not an easy}} task. This study presents a design optimization approach in Fork and Join Open Assembly Systems. Optimal buffer allocations to accommodate the work-in-process inventories in such systems are optimized in an attempt to maximize the overall system production rate. Fundamentally the problem is a stochastic, nonlinear, combinatorial optimization problem with discrete decision variables. Because {{of the nature of the}} problem, it is extremely difficult to find any closed-form expression to determine the expected value of the production rate. Hence discrete event simulation is used to estimate the expected value of the production rate. Then simulation model coupled with genetic algorithms is used to find optimal buffer configuration for maximum production rate. Results obtained proved the efficiency of simulation optimization method. However, simulation is extremely time consuming due to lengthy computational requirements for most of the real life problems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the linearized {{equations}} of mo-tion for a bicycle as a benchmark. The results obtained by pencil-and-paper and two programs are compared. The bicy-cle model we consider here {{consists of four}} rigid bodies, viz. a rear frame, a front frame being the front <b>fork</b> and handle-bar <b>assembly,</b> a rear wheel and a front wheel, which are con-nected by revolute joints. The contact between the knife-edge wheels and the flat level surface is modelled by holonomic constraints in the normal direction and by non-holonomic constraints in the longitudinal and lateral direction. The rider is rigidly attached to the rear frame with hands free from the handlebar. This system has three degrees of freedom, the roll, the steer, and the forward speed. For the benchmark we con-sider the linearized equations for small perturbations of the upright steady forward motion. The entries of the matrices of these equations {{form the basis for}} comparison. Three dif-ferent kinds of methods to obtain the results are compared: pencil-and-paper, the numeric multibody dynamics program SPACAR, and the symbolic software system AutoSim. Be-cause the results of the three methods are the same within the machine round-off error, we assume that the results are correct and {{can be used as a}} bicycle dynamics benchmark. ...|$|R
40|$|The cohesin complex tethers {{the sister}} chromatids {{together}} from S phase to anaphase, ensuring faithful chromosome segregation. Defects in cohesion result in premature sister chromatid separation and chromosome loss, which {{may lead to}} aneuploidy and chromosome instability (CIN), as commonly seen in solid tumors. In Sacchromyces cerevisiae, null mutant of Bre 1, a conserved RING domain-containing E 3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for histone H 2 B monoubiquitination (H 2 Bub), shows CIN. Bre 1 is important for replication <b>fork</b> progression, nucleosome <b>assembly,</b> histone crosstalk, transcription elongation, DNA damage checkpoint and double strand break (DSB) repair. Here, we discovered that Bre 1 and H 2 Bub are required for sister chromatid cohesion. We found that Bre 1 ’s function in G 1 and S phases contributes to sister chromatid cohesion establishment, but Bre 1 does not affect cohesion loading in G 1. We discovered that Bre 1 {{play a role in}} recruiting cohesion establishment factors, Ctf 4 and Ctf 18, to chromatin, specifically at early replication origins in S cells. The result suggests that Bre 1 -mediated H 2 Bub may modulate the chromatin environment before S phase to facilitate the recruitment of cohesion establishment factors to the chromatin, so that cohesion can be established at the replication forks. Our study reveals a novel function of Bre 1 -mediated H 2 Bub in maintaining the chromosome stability...|$|R
