5|$|Robson's {{success with}} Ipswich had {{attracted}} the attention of many bigger clubs, and he had been linked with the Manchester United <b>job</b> <b>when</b> Dave Sexton was sacked in May 1981, but the job went to Ron Atkinson instead.

5|$|When the {{government}} withdrew Mitchell, the McCanns hired Justine McGuinness, who was reportedly headhunted for the <b>job.</b> <b>When</b> she left, Hanover Communications took over briefly, headed by Charles Lewington, formerly John Major's private secretary. In September 2007 Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows stepped forward as a benefactor {{and offered to}} cover Clarence Mitchell's salary {{so that he could}} return.

5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to do the <b>job.</b> <b>When</b> he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E
5|$|Few {{teams were}} {{interested}} in Pujols because of uncertainty about his age, which position he would play, and his build. Tampa Bay Rays scout Fernando Arango recommended that his team sign Pujols, and quit his <b>job</b> <b>when</b> Tampa Bay failed to do so. Pujols was not drafted until the 13th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, when the St. Louis Cardinals selected him with the 402nd overall pick. Pujols initially turned down a $10,000 bonus and spent the summer playing for the Hays Larks of the Jayhawk Collegiate League (a summer league in the National Baseball Congress); his total of 48 runs batted in (RBIs) with the team was tied for ninth with Tyler Wasserman in Larks' history. When the Cardinals increased their bonus offer to $60,000, he signed.|$|E
5|$|In the meanwhile, her father's {{fishing boat}} is {{taken away by}} creditors. He sinks {{into a state of}} sadness and begins to drink away their savings. On one occasion, Vanaja’s {{superior}} intellect pits her against Shekhar in a public incident which ultimately humiliates him in front of his mother. Matters escalate, and one day Vanaja is raped by Shekhar. She eventually loses her <b>job</b> <b>when</b> she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, much against Rama Devi’s wishes who would have liked her to abort the foetus. Vanaja hopes that the physical evidence of the child will be proof of the rape and that somehow Shekhar will be brought to justice. However, Shekhar has no desire to marry Vanaja because she is from a lower caste. In the end Rama Devi and Shekhar gain possession of the child, who will grow up to be an upper caste boy.|$|E

50|$|Burrowing is a slang {{term used}} in the United States to {{describe}} the practice in which political appointees are given civil service protection. Except for judges, political appointees are subject to losing their <b>jobs</b> <b>when</b> a new administration takes power. On the other hand, career government officials are protected from losing their <b>jobs</b> <b>when</b> a new administration takes over. Burrowing is therefore the practice of reassigning {{people who do not}} have civil service protection into jobs that have civil service protection.|$|R
5|$|In {{these early}} years, Harrison also earned {{money from his}} {{contributions}} to a biography written by James Hall, entitled A Memoir of the Public Services of William Henry Harrison, published in 1836. That year, he made an unsuccessful {{run for the presidency}} as a Whig candidate. Between 1836 and 1840, Harrison served as Clerk of Courts for Hamilton County. This was his <b>job</b> <b>when</b> he was elected president in 1840. About this time, Harrison met African-American abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor George DeBaptiste who lived in nearby Madison. The two became friends, and DeBaptiste became his personal servant, staying with Harrison until his death. By 1840, when Harrison campaigned for president a second time, over a dozen books had been published on his life. He was hailed by many as a national hero.|$|E
5|$|Joining Mikulski as an {{advocate}} for servicing Hubble was NASA's Chief Scientist, physicist John Grunsfeld, who {{was present at the}} meeting when O'Keefe announced the cancellation of the mission. A veteran astronaut of four shuttle missions, including two Hubble servicing missions, Grunsfeld had devoted years to Hubble, and was very disappointed when O'Keefe canceled the mission. He briefly considered retiring from NASA, but realized if he stayed, he could continue to advance physics in other ways. Instead, Grunsfeld dedicated himself to finding alternate ways to service the telescope, possibly by sending a robot into orbit to do the <b>job.</b> <b>When</b> O'Keefe announced his resignation as Administrator in December 2004, five days after a National Academy of Sciences committee opposed O'Keefe's position regarding servicing Hubble, the media and science community saw hope for the telescope's servicing mission to be reinstated.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Sergei Khrushchev {{moved to}} the Donbas city of Yuzovka (now Donetsk, Ukraine); fourteen-year-old Nikita {{followed}} later that year, while Ksenia Khrushcheva and her daughter came after. Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and Donetsk in 1961, {{was at the heart}} of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire. After the boy worked briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found him a place as a metal fitter's apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory. He lost that <b>job</b> <b>when</b> he collected money for the families of the victims of the Lena Goldfields Massacre, and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Rutchenkovo, where his father was the union organizer, and he helped distribute copies and organize public readings of Pravda. He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta {{moved to}} Thika, where he gained {{employment}} with the engineering firm run by Briton John Cook. In this position, he was tasked with fetching the company wages {{from a bank}} in Nairobi, 25 miles away. Kenyatta had to leave his <b>job</b> <b>when</b> he again became seriously ill. He stayed {{at the home of}} his friend Charles Kasaja, located at the Tumutumu Presbyterian mission, in order to recuperate. At the time, the British Empire was involved in World War I, and it had recruited many Kikuyu to serve in the British Army. One of those who joined was Kongo, but he disappeared during the conflict; his family never learned of his fate. Kenyatta did not join the armed forces, and like many Kikuyu he moved to live among the Maasai, who had refused to fight for the British war effort. Kenyatta had an aunt who had married a Maasai chief and began living with her family. He adopted a number of Maasai customs, and took to wearing the Maasai jewellery, including a beaded belt which was known as kinyata in the Kikuyu language.|$|E

5|$|Homer is {{relaxing}} on a Saturday when Marge {{tells him}} {{that he should be}} doing work around the house and yard. Homer overcomes his reluctance and takes Bart to Mom & Pop Hardware to get some equipment. But while there, Homer sees a do it yourself barbecue pit and is compelled to buy it instead of anything that might help him with his work. Homer tries to install the pit, but bungles the <b>job</b> <b>when</b> he drops the parts of the barbecue into wet cement. He frantically tries to assemble the barbecue pit before the cement hardens, but only makes things worse. In the end, Homer is left with a mismatched collection of parts stuck in hardened cement, which angers him. He vents his rage on the construct, mangling it further. Later, Homer takes the results of his work back to the store for a refund, which he does not receive. On the way home, Homer loses control of the wagon containing the jumbled mess of concrete and bricks. It rolls down the highway and crashes into a woman's car, wrecking it. Homer flees the scene of the accident, but the woman tracks him down. It turns out that she is an artist named Astrid Weller (voiced by Isabella Rossellini), and sees Homer's handiwork as being a masterpiece of outsider art. Homer's exhibit goes to the Louvre: American Style museum and when Mr. Burns buys his work, Homer becomes a success.|$|E
30|$|Comparing {{the arrival}} rate of <b>jobs</b> <b>when</b> {{unemployed}} for females entering {{the labor market}} after finishing primary school, both Western and non-Western females receive more offers than ethnic Danes do, both in general and when compared with ethnic Danish twins. Second-generation Western females have the highest arrival rate. For the arrival rate of <b>jobs</b> <b>when</b> employed, however, ethnic Danish females have the highest arrival rate. The same pattern is found for the layoff rate, meaning that ethnic Danes {{are more likely to}} be laid off.|$|R

30|$|Comparing {{the arrival}} rate of <b>jobs</b> <b>when</b> {{unemployed}} for females entering {{the labor market}} after finishing high school, both second-generation Western and non-Western females receive fewer offers than ethnic Danes.

For the arrival rates of <b>jobs</b> <b>when</b> employed, though, high-school educated females with non-Western background have a lower arrival rate than ethnic Danes have even when compared to their ethnic Danish twins. However, all groups have similar layoff rates.|$|R

30|$|There is {{evidence}} also that many young workers are underemployed {{and are in}} part-time <b>jobs</b> <b>when</b> {{they would like to}} have full-time and in temporary <b>jobs</b> <b>when</b> they would like permanent ones.
