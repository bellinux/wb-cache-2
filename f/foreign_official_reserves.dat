If conducted properly, it will greatly strengthen the public’s respect for and confidence in official policy, and can make a material contribution to successful macro-economic management. The purpose of the paper is to explore the policy structure under which the Monetary Authority of Macau (AMCM) adopted for the <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>reserves</b> management.

30|$|Meanwhile, {{capital flight}} {{emerged as a}} tricky problem that called for the {{macroeconomic}} policymakers’ close attention. In {{the light of the}} RMB depreciation trend, the corporate sector sped up paying back debts denominated in US dollar and obtained less US dollar credits, and some residents enlarged their position in US dollar assets. To prevent further large depreciation of RMB and stop the panic, the monetary authority tried to guide the market through foreign exchange market intervention utilizing China’s huge <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> exchange <b>reserves.</b> China’s <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> exchange <b>reserves</b> shrank rapidly from the peak of 3993.2 billion US dollar in June 2014 to 3330.4 billion US dollar at the end of 2015.1 In 2015 only, the reserves lost 512.7 billion US dollar. For a very long time, {{in the context of the}} double surpluses of the international balance of payment, the discussion on China’s <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> exchange <b>reserves</b> focused on topic such as whether the foreign exchange reserves were too large and the welfare loss of excess foreign reserves. However, the rapid depletion of the foreign reserves in 2015 led to a turnaround of public opinions, whether the foreign exchange reserves were adequate emerged as a much-discussed topic. Naturally, capital flight and foreign reserve depletion further strengthened the market’s expectation for RMB depreciation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the potential impact}} of a shift in <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>reserves</b> from dollars to euros using a global DSGE model. This paper uses QUEST III, a multi-region global DSGE model, to study the macroeconomic effects of a gradual equalization of <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>reserves</b> between dollars and euros. We simulate a scenario of a shift in the composition of foreign reserves holdings from the present ratio of 65 percent dollars and 25 percent euros to equal 45 percent shares over a 10 years period. We assume imperfect substitutability between financial assets to allow this shift to have real effects. Our simulations point towards small real effects due to the reduction in real interest rates resulting from this shift in official holdings.

40|$|Choosing {{instruments}} in managing dollar {{foreign exchange reserves}} 1 Two years ago, managers of <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> exchange <b>reserves</b> were pondering the uncertain but serious prospect of a shrinking stock of outstanding US Treasury securities. This concern reflected {{the fact that some}} three quarters of global foreign exchange reserves were held in US dollars, and their management traditionally favoured US Treasury securities. Today, with the US economy growing slowly after a shallow recession, and the effects of discretionary tax cuts being felt, the outstanding stock of Treasury securities is once again expanding. Moreover, while the risk of a war of unknown duration and expense attaches more than usual uncertainty to any forecast of future US deficits, {{there is little doubt that}} this expansion will continue for some time. The challenge posed by the gradual disappearance of the outstanding stock of the traditional investment vehicle no longer seems so pressing as it was two years ago.

Historical evidence links the currency composition of reserves to currency movements. The currency composition of reserves is strongly related in the cross-section to both currency movements and the currency denomination of trade.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{determinants}} of black market (BM) exchange rates in India using annual data from 1955 - 1994 and integration and cointegration analysis. Two important factors, namely the import capacity of <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> exchange <b>reserves</b> and restrictions on international trade, have largely been ignored as determinants of BM rates. We {{stress the importance of}} these two factors and incorporate them, with others more familiar in the literature, in our theoretical and empirical model for BM rates in India. Our empirical findings show that a low level of <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> exchange <b>reserves</b> negatively and a high level of trade restrictions positively affect BM rates. We show that the flexible Bretton Woods exchange rate policies for India in 1973 {{have a negative impact on}} BM rates. The results also reveal that interest rate policies positively affect BM rates. Thus, our empirical model lends support to the trade and monetary approaches to BM rates and hence, trade restrictions with excess money supply should be removed to eliminate the BMs for forex in India.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the endogenous implementation of capital controls {{in the context}} of a fixed exchange rate regime. It is shown that if there exists a nonzero probability that the policymaker's response to a significant decrease in <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>reserves</b> will be the introduction of controls, a speculative attack may occur even when current and expected monetary policy is consistent with a permanently viable, control-free, fixed exchange rate regime. Consequently, capital controls may be the outcome of self-fulfilling expectations rather than the result of imprudent economic policies. Copyright 1993 by Ohio State University Press. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{currency}} board enables governments {{to manage their}} external credibility problems and discipline their central banks by “tying their hands” with binding arrangements. A {{currency board}} combines three elements: an exchange rate that is fixed to another, “anchor currency”; automatic convertibility or the right to exchange domestic currency at this fixed rate whenever desired; and a long-term commitment to the system. A currency board system can ultimately be credible only if central bank holds <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> exchange <b>reserves</b> sufficient to at least cover the entire monetary base. Exchange rate movements cannot buffer external shocks.|$|R

Previously, the Seychellois economy was characterized by price, trade and foreign exchange controls, a prominent role for parastatal companies, and robust debt-funded development spending, leading to the near-depletion of <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> exchange <b>reserves</b> in October 2008. Seychelles defaulted on interest payments, which severely damaged its credibility as a borrower. The government subsequently turned to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for support, and {{in an attempt to}} meet the conditions for a stand-by loan, began implementing a program of radical reforms. The economic circumstances led the leading People's Party to abandon many of its more socialist stances in favor of economic liberalization.|$|R
50|$|Capital {{movements}} {{offset the}} surpluses or deficits {{in the current}} account. A current account surplus, for example, implies that rather than using all the foreign currency earned by selling exports to buy imports, corporations and individuals choose to invest the money in foreign-currency-denominated assets instead. As measured in Japan's balance of payments data, capital movements consist of long- and short-term investments and movements in <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> exchange <b>reserves</b> and private bank accounts. Capital movements include loans, portfolio investments in corporate stock, and direct investment (establishment or purchase of subsidiaries abroad). A capital outflow occurs when a Japanese individual or corporation makes a loan, buys foreign stock, or establishes a subsidiary abroad. A capital inflow occurs when foreigners engage in these operations in Japan.|$|R

40|$|Unifying {{government}} bond markets in East Asia 1 One conclusion drawn by policymakers from the Asian crisis of 1997 – 98 is that broader and deeper domestic bond markets {{would serve to}} reduce the financial vulnerability of banks and firms to sudden shifts of risk perception {{on the part of}} global investors. Better able to sell domestic currency bonds, firms {{would be less likely to}} sell foreign currency bonds in order to obtain long-term funding. This would reduce the risk of introducing a mismatch between the currency of cash flows and debt. The temptation to finance long-term investments with short-term bank debt would also be lessened. Another conclusion drawn is that higher levels of <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> exchange <b>reserves</b> can likewise serve to reduce financial vulnerability. Asian economie...|$|R

40|$|Canada {{has perhaps}} the longest {{track record of}} {{adhering}} to a floating exchange rate regime, but it may well also {{have been the first}} country to adopt a managed float during the 1950 s. In spite of criticisms levelled at the Canadian government’s decision to float the dollar, the remarkable feature of the behaviour of the exchange rate during the so-called float is the relative stability of the nominal exchange rate, and the small volatility in its movements. This article stresses the impact of foreign exchange intervention in limiting exchange rate appreciations and in moderating exchange rate volatility, using newly found, and heretofore unused, intervention data.

40|$|That {{central banks}} should hold foreign {{currency}} reserves is a key tenet of the post–Bretton Woods international financial order. But recent growth in the reserve balances of industrialized countries raises questions about what level and composition of reserves are “right ” for these countries. A look at the rationale for reserves and the reserve practices of select countries suggests that large balances may not be needed to maintain an effective exchange rate policy over the medium and long term. Moreover, countries may incur an opportunity cost by holding funds in currency and asset portfolios that, while highly liquid, produce relatively low rates of return. Governments around the world hold <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> exchange <b>reserves,</b> which consist of foreign currencies, foreign government securities, and other foreign currency assets. Most often these reserves are held by central banks, although {{in some cases they}} may be held by finance ministries or sovereign wealth funds. T...|$|R
40|$|Reaching for yield: {{selected}} {{issues for}} reserve managers 1 Managers of <b>official</b> <b>foreign</b> exchange <b>reserves</b> have been facing historically low yields on highly rated government securities, the instruments {{to which they}} have traditionally devoted the bulk of their investment portfolios. In mid-August 2003, after eight weeks of rising long-term interest rates, the yield on the twoyear US Treasury note still stood at 1. 86 %, down from a peak of nearly 17 % in 1981. It is true that much of the decline since 2001 had been the result of cuts in monetary policy rates, which had served to shift down whole yield curves. Nevertheless, even adjusting for the monetary policy cycle, yields in the major currencies have tended to be substantially lower in recent years compared to those in the previous decade. In these conditions, reserve managers have found themselves seeking instruments with higher yields in an effort to maintain the investment returns to which they had become accustomed. In considering higher-yielding alternative instruments, reserve manager...|$|R

Foreign-owned banks were permitted to continue doing business in Bangladesh. The insurance business was also nationalised and became a source of potential investment funds. Cooperative credit systems and postal savings offices handled service to small individual and rural accounts. The new banking system succeeded in establishing reasonably efficient procedures for managing credit and foreign exchange. The primary function of the credit system throughout the 1970s was to finance trade and the public sector, which together absorbed 75 percent of total advances.|$|R
