40|$|Two {{groups of}} 100 {{cuttlefish}} hatchlings each {{were used to}} determine the duration of the yolk reserves, during which growth can be obtained with no food supply. One group was fed live grass shrimp ad libitum from the 3 rd day of life onwards, while the other was starved during the whole experiment. The experiment lasted 7 days, because this was the 1 st day where a negative growth rate was obtained. Nucleic acid derived indices and instantaneous growth rates (IGR) were used as a way to describe their condition, when all the yolk reserves would be exhausted and to determine the most accurate tool to express growth and condition. RNA/DNA ratios described clearly the differences (P 0. 05) between groups and did not displayed a clear pattern with increasing age. Correlation between IGR and DNA was only attained for the fed population (R − 0. 90; P 0. 0374). RNA concentration values were different from day 5 onwards. Any of the nucleic acid derived indexes were not accurate enough to express growth and condition, so IGR seems to be the most accurate and inexpensive way to describe <b>hatchlings</b> <b>growth</b> and condition in controlled conditions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Environmental {{challenges}} {{might affect}} the maternal organism and indirectly affect the later ontogeny of the progeny. We investigated the cross-generation impact of a moderate heat challenge in chickens. We hypothesized that a warm temperature [...] within the thermotolerance range [...] would affect the hormonal environment provided to embryos by mothers, and in turn, affect the morphology and behavioral phenotype of offspring. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Laying hens were raised under a standard thermal condition at 21 °C (controls) or 30 °C (experimental) for 5 consecutive weeks. A significant increase was observed in the internal temperature of hens exposed to the warm treatment; however plasma corticosterone levels remained unaffected. The laying rate was not affected, but experimental hens laid lighter eggs than the controls during the treatment. As expected, the maternal thermal environment affected yolk hormone contents. Eggs laid by the experimental hens showed significantly higher concentrations of yolk progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol. All chicks were raised under standard thermal conditions. The quality of <b>hatchlings,</b> <b>growth,</b> feeding behavior and emotional reactivity of chicks were analyzed. Offspring of experimental hens (C 30 chicks) were lighter but obtained better morphological quality scores at hatching than the controls (C 21 chicks). C 30 chicks expressed lesser distress calls when exposed to a novel food. Unlike C 21 chicks, C 30 chicks expressed no preference for energetic food. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that moderate heat challenge triggers maternal effects and modulate the developmental trajectory of offspring {{in a way that}} may be adaptive. This suggests that the impact of heat challenges on captive or wild populations might have a cross-generation effect...|$|E
40|$|Hatchling {{fitness in}} {{crocodilians}} {{is affected by}} "runtism" or failure to thrive syndrome (FTT) in captivity. In this study, 300 hatchling C. porosus, artificially incubated at 32 °C {{for most of their}} embryonic development, were raised in semi-controlled conditions, with growth criteria derived for the early detection of FTT (within 24 days). Body mass, four days after hatching (BM 4 d), was correlated with egg size and was highly clutch specific, while snout-vent length (SVL 4 d) was much more variable within and between clutches. For the majority of <b>hatchlings</b> <b>growth</b> trajectories within the first 24 days continued to 90 days and could be used to predict FTT affliction up to 300 days, highlighting the importance of early growth. Growth and survival of hatchling C. porosus in captivity was not influenced by initial size (BM 4 d), with a slight tendency for smaller hatchlings to grow faster in the immediate post-hatching period. Strong clutch effects (12 clutches) on affliction with FTT were apparent, but could not be explained by measured clutch variables or other factors. Among individuals not afflicted by FTT (N =  245), mean growth was highly clutch specific, and the variation could be explained by an interaction between clutch and season. FTT affliction was 2. 5 times higher among clutches (N =  7) that hatched later in the year when mean minimum air temperatures were lower, compared with those clutches (N =  5) that hatched early in the year. The results of this study highlight the importance of early growth in hatchling C. porosus, which has implications for the captive management of this species...|$|E

40|$|Within Galliformes, megapods (brush turkey, malleefowl, scrubfowl) exhibit unique {{forms of}} parental care and <b>growth.</b> <b>Hatchlings</b> receive no post-hatching parental care and exhibit the most exaggerated precocial {{development}} of all extant birds, hatching with fully developed, flight-capable forelimbs. Rather than flying up to safety, young birds preferentially employ wing-assisted incline running. Newly hatched Australian brush turkeys (Alectura lathami) are extraordinarily proficient at negotiating all textured inclined surfaces and can flap-walk up inclines exceeding the vertical. Yet, as brush turkeys grow, their forelimb-dependent locomotor performance declines. In {{an attempt to}} elucidate how hatchlings perform so well, we analysed hindlimb forces and forelimb kinematics. We measured ground reaction forces (GRFs) for animals spanning the entire growth range (110 – 2000 g) as they ascended a variably positioned inclined ramp that housed a forceplate. These data are compared with a similar dataset for a chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar) that exhibit a growth strategy typical of most other Galliformes and that demonstrate improved incline performance with increasing age. The brush turkeys' ontogenetic decline in incline running performance is accompanied by loss of traction at steep angles, reduced GRFs and increased wing-loading. We hypothesize that Australian brush turkeys, in contrast to other Galliformes, develop from forelimb-dominated young that exploit a variable terrain (e. g. mound nests, boulders, embankments, cliffs, bushes and trees) into hindlimb-dominated adults dependent on size and running speed to avoid predation...|$|R
40|$|Agonistic {{and thermal}} {{behaviour}} was studied in hatchling Crocodylus porosus under captive conditions using CCTV cameras. The results guided {{the design of}} experiments aimed at improving growth and survival of this species in captivity. C. porosus are born with a repertoire of 16 distinctive agonistic behaviours, and most interactions occur {{in the morning and}} evening in open, shallow water. There are clutch-specific differences in the frequency of agonistic interactions, and older hatchlings display fewer behaviours based on dominance status. A comparison of eight crocodilian species revealed differences in behaviours displayed and the level of conspecific tolerance, with C. porosus being the most aggressive. Hatchling C. porosus preferred body temperatures (Tbs) between 29. 4 ºC and 32. 6 ºC, and the mean (30. 9 ± 2. 3 ºC SD) was not influenced by social situation or feeding status. During the day, hatchlings had higher Tbs and were less active than at night. Growth of C. porosus during the first 24 days can be used to predict ‘failure to thrive’ (FTT) affliction up to 300 days. Hatchlings fed short chopped meat had higher growth than those fed standard mince or long chopped meat. Although visual barriers and deeper water reduced agonistic behaviour among hatchlings, these factors did not result in improved growth. Hatchling growth was highest at a density of 6. 7 /m 2, and was lower at higher densities. The frequency of agonistic interactions was higher at lower densities (3. 3 /m 2; 6. 7 /m 2) than at higher densities (13. 3 /m 2; 20. 0 /m 2). Although hatchlings given Valium in their food had fewer agonistic interactions, they had reduced <b>growth.</b> <b>Hatchlings</b> raised under constant warm temperatures (32 - 34 ºC), a gradient of temperatures, or warmer night time temperatures had higher growth than hatchlings with warm temperatures during the day only.

40|$|Intraclutch egg size {{variation}} may non-adaptively {{result from}} nutritional/energetic constraints acting on laying females or may reflect adaptive differential investment in offspring {{in relation to}} laying/hatching order. This variation may contribute to size hierarchies among siblings already established due to hatching asynchrony, and resultant competitive asymmetries often lead to starvation of the weakest nestling within a brood. The costs in terms of chick mortality can be high. However, {{the extent to which}} this mortality is egg size-mediated remains unclear, especially in relation to hatching asynchrony which may operate concomitantly. I assessed effects of egg size and hatching asynchrony on nestling development and survival of Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus), where the smaller size and later hatching of c-eggs may represent a brood-reduction strategy. To analyze variation in egg size, I recorded the laying order and laying date of 870 eggs in 290 three-egg clutches over a 3 -yr period (2010 - 2012). I measured <b>hatchlings</b> and monitored <b>growth</b> and survival of 130 chicks from enclosed nests in 2011 and 2012. The negative effect of laying date (= - 0. 18 SE 0. 06, P = 0. 002) on c-egg size possibly reflected the fact that late breeders were either low quality or inexperienced females. The mass, size, and condition of hatchling Herring Gulls were positively related to egg size (all P < 0. 0001). C-chicks suffered from increased mortality risk during the first 12 d, identified as the brood-reduction period in my study population. Although intraclutch variation in egg size was not directly related to patterns of chick mortality, I found that smaller relative egg size interactively increased differences in relative body condition of nestlings, primarily brought about by the degree of hatching asynchrony during this brood-reduction period. Thus, the value of relatively small c-eggs in Herring Gulls may lie in reinforcing brood reduction through effects on nestling body condition. A reproductive strategy Herring Gulls might have adopted to maintain a three-egg clutch, but that also enables them to adjust the number of chicks they rear relative to the prevailing environmental conditions and to their own condition during the nestling stage...|$|R
