5|$|Initially {{presented}} {{as the primary}} antagonist who he must capture, Nero’s encounters with Dante {{over the course of}} the game reveal that the Order of the Sword is in fact responsible for a number of atrocities. Chief among them, is the Order's High-Ranking Scientist Agnus, who <b>has</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> transforming himself, Credo, and a very-much-alive Sanctus into Demons with incredible power by siphoning demonic energy from Yamato, the long lost Devil Arm of Dante's twin brother Vergil. Furthermore, Sanctus has used Agnus' research to summon an army of demons to attack Fortuna, while simultaneously awakening a long dormant weapon called The Savior (a giant colossus made in Sparda's image) to destroy the threat; posing as the second coming of Sparda in order to eliminate non-believers, and strengthen his congregation’s worship.|$|E
5|$|Squidward gets a {{call from}} his former high school classmate, Squilliam Fancyson, who is very {{successful}} and <b>has</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> everything in which Squidward has failed, such as music. Squilliam reveals to Squidward that he has become {{the leader of a}} band and that they are supposed to play at the Bubble Bowl; but he will be busy at that time and {{will not be able to}} attend so Squilliam asks Squidward to allow his band to substitute for his at the Bubble Bowl, believing that Squidward does not have one. However, Squidward insists that he has a band and accepts the offer. He assembles a large marching band composed of various Bikini Bottom residents.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of release}} schedules—especially {{in the case}} of films {{released}} {{towards the end of the}} year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year <b>has</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> producing a billion dollar grossing film.|$|E

25|$|The above {{definitions}} {{are limited}} in {{that they do not}} take into account the time period over which the drinking occurs or the body mass of the person drinking.

25|$|The country {{entered a}} high period of {{economic}} growth in 2006, and the following year managed to register 8% economic growth, a record it has sustained since, turning it {{into one of the}} fastest-growing economies in Africa.

25|$|The party leave Lothlórien via {{the river}} Anduin. Boromir tries to {{convince}} Frodo {{to take the}} Ring to Gondor {{to use it as}} a weapon against Sauron, but Frodo refuses. As they travel on the river, a Nazgûl riding a Fellbeast seizes Sam. The party give chase, and on the hill of Amon Hen, Aragon and Legolas slay the creature and rescue Sam. The game ends with Galadriel looking into her mirror, noting that although the Fellowship <b>has</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> getting Frodo close to Mordor, she sees him and Sam alone in the future, with Gollum following closely behind them.|$|E
25|$|Another {{suggestion}} for simplifying {{the proof is}} to make greater use of representation theory. The {{problem here is that}} representation theory seems to require very tight control over the subgroups of a group in order to work well. For groups of small rank one has such control and representation theory works very well, but for groups of larger rank no-one <b>has</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> using it to simplify the classification. In {{the early days of the}} classification there was considerable effort made to use representation theory, but this never achieved much success in the higher rank case.|$|E
