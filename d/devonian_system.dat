25|$|The Devonian Period is {{formally}} {{broken into}} Early, Middle and Late subdivisions. The rocks corresponding to those epochs {{are referred to}} as belonging to the Lower, Middle and Upper parts of the <b>Devonian</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{period is}} named after Devon, a county in southwestern England, where a {{controversial}} argument in the 1830s over the age {{and structure of the}} rocks found distributed throughout the county was eventually resolved by the definition of the Devonian period in the geological timescale. The Great Devonian Controversy was a long period of vigorous argument and counter-argument between the main protagonists of Roderick Murchison with Adam Sedgwick against Henry De la Beche supported by George Bellas Greenough. Murchison and Sedgwick won the debate and named the period they proposed as the <b>Devonian</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1832 Dr Thomas Lloyd, the Ludlow {{doctor and}} amateur geologist, met Roderick Murchison at Ludford Corner {{to study the}} rocks exposed along the River Teme and on Whitcliffe, {{advancing}} Murchison's theory for a Silurian System {{that he was to}} publish in 1839. Immediately above the topmost layer of the marine rock sequence forming Murchison's Silurian System was a thin layer of dark sand containing numerous remains of early fish, especially their scales, along with plant debris, spores and microscopic mites. In contrast to the underlying sediments of the Ludlow Series which were deposited in a shallow warm sea some 400 million years ago, the Ludlow Bone Bed represents terrestrial (land) conditions and thus a fundamental change in the landscape. At the time, this was believed to be the earliest occurrence of life on land. Murchison thus took the Ludlow Bone Bed as the base of his <b>Devonian</b> <b>System,</b> although over a century later this boundary was to be moved a little higher, the overlying rocks being ascribed to the Pridoli. The science of geology has taken a number of local names from these studies and now applies them worldwide, in recognition of the importance of this area to scientific understanding, for example Ludlow Series. The site is now an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) and still attracts international studies. The geological interval of time, the Ludlow Epoch, is named after the town as part of the Silurian Period.|$|E

60|$|These fishes {{increase}} {{greatly in}} the next division of rocks, the rocks known as the <b>Devonian</b> <b>system.</b> They are so prevalent that this period of the Record of the Rocks {{has been called the}} Age of {20} Fishes. Fishes of a pattern now gone from the earth, and fishes allied to the sharks and sturgeons of to-day, rushed through the waters, leapt in the air, browsed among the seaweeds, pursued and preyed upon one another, and gave a new liveliness to the waters of the world. None of these were excessively big by our present standards. Few of them were {{more than two or three}} feet long, but there were exceptional forms which were as long as twenty feet.|$|E
60|$|On {{this same}} theory, {{it is evident}} that the fauna during any one great period in the earth's history will be {{intermediate}} in general character between that which preceded and that which succeeded it. Thus the species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram are the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and are the parents of those which became still more modified at the seventh stage; hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character between the forms of life above and below. We must, however, allow for the entire extinction of some preceding forms, and in any one region for the immigration of new forms from other regions, and for a large amount of modification during the long and blank intervals between the successive formations. Subject to these allowances, the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is intermediate in character, between the preceding and succeeding faunas. I need give only one instance, namely, {{the manner in which the}} fossils of the <b>Devonian</b> <b>system,</b> when this system was first discovered, were at once recognised by palaeontologists as intermediate in character between those of the overlying carboniferous and underlying Silurian systems. But each fauna is not necessarily exactly intermediate, as unequal intervals of time have elapsed between consecutive formations.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The Greenstone Mountain area, which {{includes}} the Utopia mining district, {{is located in the}} foothills of the Pioneer Range, Beaverhead County, Montana. Approximately 12, 600 feet of Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks and an undetermined thickness of Precambrian sediments and Late Cretaceous igneous rocks are exposed within the area of investigation. Most of the sedimentary rocks were deposited along the margin of the Cordilleran miogeosyncline. Precambrian Beltian sediments are the oldest exposed rocks in the map area. Pre-Mississippian Paleozoic rocks have not been differentiated in this study but probably represent the Cambrian and <b>Devonian</b> <b>Systems.</b> Other Paleozoic rock units include the Lodgepole and Mission Canyon Formations of Mississippian age, the Amsden Formation of Mississippian to Pennsylvanian age, the Quadrant Formation of Pennsylvanian age, and the Phosphoria Formation of Permian age. Mesozoic sediments include the Dinwoody and Woodside Formations of Triassic age and the Kootenai Formation and Colorado Group of Cretaceous age. The Jurassic System is not represented. During the Late Cretaceous Laramide orogeny the sedimentary rocks of the area were folded and faulted. The dominant structures produced during this period of deformation are northeast- to north-trending anticlines and synclines that are locally overturned to the east. Steep faults of small to moderate displacement disrupt the folds. Quartz monzonite intrusive rocks were emplaced following the Laramide orogeny and are probably genetically related to the Boulder Batholith. The intrusion gave rise to mineralization and thermal metamorphism of the surrounding country rocks. Quaternary glacial and fluvial deposits mantle parts of the area. At least three valley glaciers advanced into the northwestern corner of the area in Late Pleistocene time and left lateral and terminal moraines. Pleistocene terrace gravels are situated along Birch Creek and on lowlands in the west, and Recent alluvium is being deposited along existing streams...|$|R

6000|$|This is the generally-current belief. On this {{assumption}} the received geological classifications {{appear to be}} framed. The Silurian system, the <b>Devonian</b> <b>system,</b> the Carboniferous system, etc., are set down in our books as groups of formations which everywhere succeed {{each other in a}} given order; and are severally everywhere of the same age. Though it may not be asserted that these successive systems are universal; yet it seems to be tacitly assumed that they are. In North and South America, in Asia, in Australia, sets of strata are assimilated to one or other of these groups; and their possession of certain mineral characters and a certain order of superposition are among the reasons assigned for so assimilating them. Though, probably, no competent geologist would contend that the European classification of strata is applicable to the globe as a whole; yet most, if not all geologists, write as though it were. Among readers of works on Geology, nine out of ten carry away the impression that the divisions, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary, are of absolute and uniform application; that these great divisions are separable into subdivisions, each of which is definitely distinguishable from the rest, and is everywhere recognizable by its characters as such or such; and that {{in all parts of the}} Earth, these minor systems severally began and ended at the same time. When they meet with the term [...] "Carboniferous era," [...] they take for granted that it was an era universally carboniferous--that it was, what Hugh Miller indeed actually describes it, an era when the Earth bore a vegetation far more luxuriant than it has since done; and were they in any of our colonies to meet with a coal-bed, they would conclude that, as a matter of course, it was of the same age as the English coal-beds.|$|E

The results demonstrate that in most cases the systems with pre-aeration effectively purify groundwater from iron, but only 13 out of 20 water treatment plants achieved a reduction of iron concentration to the level fixed in drinking water requirements (0. 2 mg L– 1). Manganese content decreased below the maximum allowed concentration in only 25 % of systems and in cases where the filter media was Birm or quartz sand and pre-oxidation was applied.

''Expert'' systems developed and used in several disciplines and industries have demonstrated beneficial results. A state-of-the-art exploration ''expert'' tool, relying on a computerized database and computer maps generated by neural networks, is being developed through the use of ''fuzzy'' logic, a relatively new mathematical treatment of imprecise or non-explicit parameters and values. Oil prospecting risk can be reduced {{with the use of a}} properly developed and validated ''Fuzzy Expert Exploration (FEE) Tool. '' This FEE Tool can be beneficial in many regions of the U.

In the 1998 - 1999 oil industry environment, many smaller exploration companies lacked the resources of a pool of expert exploration personnel. Downsizing, low oil prices, and scarcity of exploration funds have also affected larger companies, and will, with time, affect the end users of oil industry products in the U.

This research is funded by the Belgium National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS) and conducted by the University of Namur, University of Mons and the Royal Observatory of Belgium. The LKS – Lomme Karst System (Rochefort, southern Belgium) was chosen as it is a major Belgian karst system (10 km long) in the Givetian carbonate aquifer (Middle <b>Devonian).</b> The <b>system</b> is formed by two parallel components: the surface system (the Lomme River) and a complex underground system (multiple sinkholes with one main resurgence).

Multi-tracing experiments with different injections and monitoring points highlight the complexity of underground flow dynamics. Investigations enlightened the connectivity between monitoring points and how dependent of the hydrological conditions were these connections. The breakthrough curves analysis allows to characterize the hydrodynamic behavior of the underground flows within the aquifer.

40|$|The Upper Devonian Alexander {{siltstone}} is an informally named drillers' {{unit that}} occurs throughout {{the eastern half}} of the gas-producing portion of the Appalachian basin. The Alexander is primarily a gas-producing unit that extends from western New York and Pennsylvania south through West Virginia. In Doddridge and Ritchie counties in northwestern West Virginia the Alexander occurs within the Angola Member of the West Falls Formation and lies stratigraphically below the more prolific Benson sand reservoir. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the stratigraphic architecture of the Alexander in Doddridge and Ritchie counties to acquire a better understanding of the petroleum geology of the unit in the study area.   The gamma-ray signatures of the Alexander indicate three distinct siltstone intervals composed of intercalated siltstone bundles and thin shale layers that are separated from one another by intervals of shale that lack siltstone bundles. The Alexander intervals are referred to as the lower, middle, and upper Alexander in this study. The lower Alexander is the thickest interval and is laterally extensive across the study area. The gamma-ray signatures indicate that each Alexander interval has a sharp base with the abrupt appearance of siltstone bundles and a sharp or gradational upper boundary with the siltstone bundles fining-upward into shale. The siltstone bundles in the lower Alexander are coarsening-upward near the base and transition into fining-upward bundles near the upper boundary. The lower, middle, and upper Alexander are interpreted to represent distal depositional lobes within the fine-grained Upper <b>Devonian</b> turbidite <b>system.</b> The depositional lobes are thickest in the southern/southeastern portion of the study area and thin basinward to the west/northwest away from the sediment source. The individual siltstone bundles composing the Alexander are interpreted to be stacked siltstone turbidite deposits. The thin, discontinuous shale layers that are interbedded with the siltstone bundles were deposited from suspension between subsequent turbidity flows.   The log porosity of the Alexander intervals ranges from zero to eighteen percent within the study area, with the majority of the measurements ranging from zero to fourteen percent. The highest log porosities occur within the lower Alexander in laterally extensive porous zones and coincide with areas where the lower Alexander strata are thickest, suggesting that porosity is primarily related to the thickness of the interval. Available pay zone data indicate that hydrocarbon production is primarily from the lower Alexander and that production is primarily related to porosity in the study area.   M. S...|$|R

Petroleum systems of the Orcadian study area that involve significant Palaeozoic elements are not wholly contained within Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian strata. A number of producing fields attest to two main proven petroleum systems; i. Co-sourced Devonian oil (with Jurassic oil) within a Jurassic reservoir: the Beatrice, Jacky and Lybster fields; ii. Jurassic-sourced oil in a Devonian and/or Carboniferous reservoir: the Buchan, Stirling, Claymore, Highlander fields. (Jurassic-sourced oil in a Permian (Zechstein) reservoir is also proven in the Carnoustie, Ettrick and Claymore fields, and in a Rotliegend reservoir in the Dee discovery). A number of additional unproven petroleum system elements are considered in this report; i. Possibilities for Devonian and Carboniferous sourcing or co-sourcing (with Jurassic oil) of Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian (Rotliegend) reservoirs in those areas underlain by proven Palaeozoic source rock; ii. Possibilities for migrated Jurassic and/or Devonian and/or Carboniferous hydrocarbons onto horst blocks and the regional Grampian High, into basement, Palaeozoic or younger reservoirs. Focusing on frontier areas north and east of the Inner Moray Firth and from the north-eastern Forth Approaches to Grampian High, integration of a large volume of seismic, well, geophysical, organic geochemistry, maturity and reservoir property data at regional scale has established: Source rocks  A wide extent of potential Devonian lacustrine source rocks mapped seismically from the Inner Moray Firth to the East Orkney Basin and north of the Halibut Horst.  Geochemically-typed Devonian-sourced oil shows, oil seep data outside the area of mature Kimmeridge Clay Formation, burial depth and a limited organic geochemistry/maturity dataset indicative of Devonian source rocks that are potentially mature for oil generation outside the Inner Moray Firth.  Good quality gas- and oil-prone Carboniferous source rocks are mapped from the Witch Ground Graben to north eastern end of the Forth Approaches. Wells drilled on highs indicate oil-window thermal maturity levels. Oil and gas shows and basin modelling indicate Carboniferous strata buried more deeply in adjacent basins may reach gas maturity levels, with Cenozoic maturation.  Key source rock intervals are: o Lower Devonian, lacustrine Struie Formation (Quadrants 11, 12), oil prone. o Middle Devonian, lacustine Orcadia Formation and Eday Group (Quadrants 11 - 15 and possibly Quadrants 19, 20), oil prone. o Visean – Namurian (lower-mid Carboniferous) fluvio-deltaic Firth Coal Formation, gas and oil prone.

Soc. 1862), and in this now classic essay he first clearly sketched the origin and development of rivers. In later years he devoted much attention to the relations between the <b>Devonian</b> <b>system</b> and the Carboniferous rocks and Old Red Sandstone.|$|E
40|$|A key {{focus of}} this thesis is if {{migrated}} bitumen from Lower to Middle Jurassic and Cretaceous age sandstones in the 6609 / 11 - 1, 6610 / 7 - 1 and the 6609 / 5 - 1 wells in the Helgeland Basin might originate from Devonian source rock strata. For a possible comparison of source rock facies has nine outcrop samples collected from the Orkneys been used alongside with the Beatrice oil from Moray Firth as references of the lacustrine Middle Devonian organofacies present in the Orcadian Basin, Also, oils from the Judy Field and the Embla Field were included in this investigation as their geochemical signature differs from the typical Kimmeridge derived oils on the Norwegian Shelf, which {{in this study is}} represented by the NSO- 1 oil i. e. oil from the Oseberg Field. Analytical methods i. e. GC-FID and GC-MS were used to generate characterization parameters used for indicating the maturity and also the type of organofacies of bitumen samples and the oil samples. In addition, TOC and Rock-Eval analysis were performed on the source rock samples for assessing the quality i. e. the kerogen type and the generative potential, and also for obtaining additional maturity information. Based on the TOC and Rock-Eval analysis, the HI of the five highest quality source rocks samples is in the range of 313 mg HC/g TOC to 397 mg/ HC/g TOC and those values corresponds to type II kerogen and the overall generative potential of the same five samples is categorized as good to very good, i. e. the TOC values in the range of 1. 48 wt. % to 2. 79 wt. %. The four other samples scores lower in both quality and/or generative potential. Of the nine source rock samples in total, only one scores below the minimum criteria for being categorized as a source rock, i. e. a TOC value of at least 0. 5 wt%. All the three wells i. e. 6609 / 11 - 1, 6610 / 7 - 1 and 6609 / 5 - 1 from which the bitumen bitumen samples studied in this thesis were isolated show evidence of having received migrating oils from a source rock that correlates with the geochemistry of the lacustrine Middle Devonian source rocks of the general Orcadian Basin source rock facies. In particular is the positive identification of β-carotane in the 6609 / 11 - 1, 6610 / 7 - 1 and 6609 / 5 - 1 wells of the highest interest as this biomarker is a type component for the <b>Devonian</b> lacustrine <b>systems.</b> It is thus concluded that there are <b>Devonian</b> source rock <b>systems</b> present in the Helgeland Basin which are of sufficient magnitude to generate and migrate oil into the studied sandstones which are of Early to Middle Jurassic and Cretaceous age. In addition to oil from the likely Middle Devonian source rock, well 6609 / 11 - 1 also contains migrated oil from a terrestrially derived source rock and the upper section in well 6610 / 7 - 1 (depth 2661 m to 2668. 5 m) and also well 6609 / 5 - 1 contains migrated bitumen (oil) which is clearly sourced form a marine derived source, i. e. the Late Jurassic Kimmeridge equivalent. The bitumen samples in the lower section of well 6610 / 7 - 1 (depth 2713. 8 to 2715 m) bears no resemblance of influence from lacustrine Middle Devonian source rocks, but are interpreted to have been sourced mainly from terrestrially derived source rocks, and there is also indications for co-sourcing from the Late Jurassic Kimmeridge equivalent source rocks. Furthermore, oils representing the Embla Field, the Judy Field and the Oseberg Field, are interpreted to have been mixed in the reservoir with petroleum from a lacustrine Middle Devonian source rock equivalent. Also this is totally new information as such has never been described, and it is inferred that such palaeo-oil must have escaped from the Oseberg Field reservoir and the Judy Field reservoirs long before the arrival of the present oil charges. It is thus inferred that also in the drainage areas of Oseberg, Embla and Judy are the Devonian basins which have generated oil. Concerning the maturity, the source rock bitumen samples from the Orkneys are considered marginally mature, and the Helgeland Basin bitumen samples, the Judy oil, the Beatrice oil and the Oseberg oil are considered to be at maturity levels which corresponds {{to the middle of the}} oil window. The Embla oil is highly mature, with a maturity level corresponding to the later part of the oil window. The maturity from the lowest to the highest is as follows: The source rock bitumen samples from the Orkneys - NSO- 1 (Oseberg) - Beatrice - 6609 / 11 - 1 - Judy - 6610 / 7 - 1 upper section - 6610 / 7 - 1 lower section - 6609 / 5 - 1 - Embla...|$|R
40|$|This report synthesises {{the results}} of the 21 CXRM Palaeozoic project to {{describe}} the Carboniferous and <b>Devonian</b> petroleum <b>systems</b> of the Central North Sea/Mid North Sea High area (Quadrants 25 – 44). Focusing on frontier areas {{to the north of the}} Southern North Sea gas fields and west of the Auk-Flora ridge, integration of a large volume of seismic, well, geophysical, organic geochemistry, maturity and reservoir property data at regional scale has established:  Extensional to strike-slip Devonian and Carboniferous basins cutting across the Mid North Sea High on orientations strongly controlled by basement inheritance, granites and a complex Palaeozoic stress field. Varsican orogenic transpression and inversion was superimposed resulting in a variety of structural trapping styles and burial/uplift histories, and a complicated pre-Permian subcrop map.  A widespread spatial and temporal extent of oil and gas mature source rock intervals within the Carboniferous succession particularly; o lower Carboniferous (Visean) coals and mudstones of the Scremerston Formation, dominantly fluvio-deltaic and lacustrine with some marine influence, dominantly gas prone. Gas mature in Quadrant 41 and central-southern Quadrants 42 - 44 and oil mature in the Forth Approaches and North Dogger Basin o lower-mid Carboniferous (Visean-Namurian) coals and mudstones of the Yoredale and Millstone Grit formations in fluvio-deltaic to marine cycles, gas prone with oil prone intervals. Gas mature in central Quadrant 41 and southern Quadrants 42 - 43, oil mature across northern Quadrants 41 - 44, Quadrant 36, 38 and 39. o Lower-mid Carboniferous (Visean-Namurian) mudstones and siltstones of the Cleveland Group, over 1 km thick, deposited in dominantly marine environments. Gas mature to overmature in southern Quadrants 41 - 44 and modelled as having generated oil and gas.  Potentially widespread reservoir intervals of varying reservoir quality. Favourable intervals include the Upper Devonian sandstone of the Buchan Formation expecially where fractured, channels within the fluvio-deltaic lower-mid Carboniferous (Visean-Namurian) Scremerston, Yoredale and Millstone Grit formations, the laterally extensive, high net:gross Fell Sandstone Formation, and possibly turbidites or shoreface sands within marine mudstones/siltstones in southern Quadrants 41 - 44 (likely tight gas unless early hydrocarbon charged)  Widespread opportunities for structural (fault/fold/dip) traps utilising a Silverpit mudstone, or Zechstein evaporite seal as in the Breagh Field. Intraformational Carboniferous seals are documented widely in onshore Carboniferous fields and in some offshore fields and should be further investigated, particularly in mudstone/siltstone-dominated basinal successions with modelled Carboniferous and recent hydrocarbon generation, along with possibilities for stratigraphic traps.  Basin modelling predicts oil and gas generation at a variety of times (Carboniferous, Mesozoic and Cenozoic dependent on the well) from lower-mid Carbonferous (Visean-Namurian) strata in Quadrants 41 - 44. In the Forth Approaches, Quadrant 29 /North Dogger basins and on the poorly constrained Devonian-Carboniferous Mid North Sea High, oil window maturity levels are modelled at selected wells in a largely gas-prone sequence, though basinwards gas maturity may be achieved. It is recommended that the contribution and volumetrics of relatively thin oil-prone intervals within the Carboniferous succession be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{basement}} {{rocks in}} central Queensland are largely {{obscured by the}} Phanerozoic sedimentary succession and the basement geology is known from limited drill holes. Constrained regional potential field analysis is applied to unveil the crustal architecture of the Proterozoic southern Mount Isa terrane and the Phanerozoic Thomson Orogen in Queensland. The Mount Isa terrane forms part of the Palaeoproterozoic North Australian Craton. The exposed Mount Isa Inlier preserves geological record that spans more than 350 million years between ca. 1870 and 1500 Ma. An early cycle of a ca. 1870 Ma orogenesis and ca. 1870 Ma - 1850 Ma extensive batholith emplacement was succeeded by ca. 1800 - 1600 Ma superimposed rifting and subsidence. This was followed by major period of Mesoproterozoic orogeny. Constrained aeromagnetic and gravity data indicate that the depositional sequences and the regional architecture of the Mount Isa terrane extend for ~ 250 km south of the exposed Inlier, beneath Palaeozoic cover. In the southern parts of the Mount Isa terrane, Palaeoproterozoic sedimentation and volcanism were controlled by NNW-trending structures in half graben setting, resulting in complex superimposed and stacked basins prior to intense basin inversion associated with the Isan Orogeny. Petrophysically constrained geophysical interpretation indicates that prominent regional magnetic and gravity anomalies of the region reflect shallowing of the Pre- 1800 Ma crystalline basement {{and the distribution of}} meta-sedimentary and meta-volcanic rocks deposited during the development of the ca. 1790 Ma to 1730 Ma Leichhardt Superbasin. Regional low magnetic and low gravity responses coincide with sedimentary successions deposited during the development of the Calvert and Isa superbasins. The ca. 1600 - 1500 Ma Isan Orogeny reactivated the existing extensional fault network and determined the current regional architecture. Extensive low density batholith emplacement occurred at that time. The Thomson Orogen forms the northen extent of the eastern Australian Tasmanides. The region records a protracted tectonic evolution that spans the Neoproterozoic to Triassic and is coincident with one of the largest period of continental growth of the Australian continent. Combined potential field and seismic interpretation indicates that NE- and NW-trending high angle reverse thrusts represent the main crust-scale structural elements in the mid- to lower crust. Gravity data indicate that the eastern and western portions of the Thomson Orogen have a different crustal architecture. The eastern Thomson Orogen is characterized by a regional NE trend and a network of orthogonal faults resulting in a series of troughs and highs. The negative gravity anomalies reflect mostly the distribution of the basinal sequences inferred from drill holes and deep seismic surveys. The western part appears as a series of NW-trending structures interpreted to reflect reverse thrust faults. The smooth magnetic signature of the Thomson Orogen is interpreted to represent source bodies at mid- to lower crustal level. Seismic profiles and forward models consistently indicate that the upper and lower crusts show different geophysical properties. The Thomson Orogen can be distinctly divided in a non-magnetic to weakly magnetic upper crust and a magnetic lower crust. Long wavelength magnetic anomalies are inferred to reflect the topography of the magnetic lower basement. Forward modelling indicates that the western and eastern parts of the Thomson Orogen are petrophysically indistinguishable and the region is interpreted to be a single terrane. The constrained geophysical interpretation indicates that lower basement consists of attenuated Precambrian and mafic enriched continental crust. The Cork Fault is a continental scale structure that defines the boundary between the Proterozoic Mount Isa terrane and the Phanerozoic Thomson Orogen. The Cork Fault coincides {{with one of the most}} distinguishable geophysical features of the Australian continent. The prominent geophysical signature of the Cork Fault reflects the abrupt termination of positive NNW-trending geophysical features of the Mount Isa terrane against NE-trending low gravity and low magnetic anomalies of the Thomson Orogen. 2 D forward modelling indicates that the lower basement crust of the Thomson Orogen is petrophysically indistinguishable from the Proterozoic crust of the Mount Isa terrane. Best fit reconstruction suggests that high angle listric faults offset the magnetic crust which regionally deepens toward the Thomson Orogen. The prominent potential field gradients associated with the Cork Fault are interpreted to represent the displacement and burying of the Mount Isa terrane crust under the Thomson Orogen basement rocks. The geophysical interpretation indicates that the timing of initiation of the Cork Fault postdates the Isa Orogeny. Initiation of the Cork Fault may be consistently dated to the Mesoproterozoic and may be related to the continental re-organization of the Australian continent that led to the separation of the Mount Isa terrane from the Curnamona Province. The mechanism of separation envisages initial N-S- to NNW-directed extension and development of normal faults. The Cork Fault formed part of a network of major north-dipping and south-dipping normal faults active at that time. Constrained aeromagnetic and gravity data provide support for a Neoproterozoic extensional event in the Thomson Orogen which was controlled by NW-oriented rift segments and occurred in a continental setting as a distal response to the E-W to NE Rodinia break-up. A tectonic model is proposed in which the Thomson Orogen represents the interior extensional architecture during the Rodinia break-up, which is recorded further east in the Anakie Inlier and south in the Koonenberry Belt and the Adelaide Fold Belt in south Australia. This implies that the continental break-up did not occur along the Cork Fault. Instead during the Rodinia break-up, the Cork Fault may have been reactivated as a strike-slip fault, being in a favourable orientation, and formed part of the NE-striking strike-slip faults and NW-oriented normal faults that accommodated the deposition of the Late Neoproterozoic to Middle Cambrian stratigraphy in the Thomson Orogen. Alternatively, at ca. 580 Ma the Thomson Orogen may have switched to a continental back-arc setting driven by the roll-back of a NW-dipping subduction zone. Renewed deposition and volcanism occurred during the Ordovician that may have continued into the Late Silurian, resulting in thinned Proterozoic basement crust and extensive basin systems that formed in a distal continental back-arc environment. The <b>Devonian</b> extensional basinal <b>system</b> in the Thomson Orogen formed in a continental setting. At this time, the extension was controlled by the existing NE- and NW-trending fault architecture. The basin is interpreted to record a distal back-arc basin in the interior of the Australian continent. The Early Palaeozoic tectonic evolution of the continental crust of the Thomson Orogen differs from that of the oceanic crust of the Lachlan Orogen to the south and amalgamation of the two geological terranes might have occurred during Middle Palaeozoic. Thinned Precambrian crust of the Thomson Orogen may be representative of an Early Palaeozoic continental margin or back-arc setting whereas the Lachlan Orogen formed via incorporation of arc type, oceanic and continental rocks. These results demonstrate that regional potential field datasets are a valuable tool in the comprehension of regional geology of tectonic systems with little or no geological exposure...|$|R
