25|$|Further {{advances}} in computing led to greater advancements in <b>interactive</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphics.</b> In 1959, the TX-2 computer was developed at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. The TX-2 integrated {{a number of}} new man-machine interfaces. A light pen could be used to draw sketches on the computer using Ivan Sutherland's revolutionary Sketchpad software. Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small photoelectric cell in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed {{in front of a computer}} screen and the screen's electron gun fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location. Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects - not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reason that}} most of these systems succeeded in just those years, not earlier or later, and within a short {{timespan}} {{had to do with the}} arrival of commercial hardware that was powerful enough. Two things were needed and arrived at about the same time. [...] First, electron density maps are large and require either a computer with at least a 24-bit address space or a combination of a computer with a lesser 16-bit address space plus several years to overcome the difficulties of an address space that is smaller than the data. [...] The second arrival was that of <b>interactive</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> displays that were fast enough to display electron-density maps, whose contour circles require the display of numerous short vectors. The first such displays were the Vector General Series 3 and the Evans and Sutherland Picture System 2, MultiPicture System, and PS-300.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the multiresolution modeling of polygonal meshes. This approach is based on the theoretically well-established fractal image compression techniques. A polygonal mesh is represented as a fractal using an iterated function system (IFS). In this way, a level of detail can be obtained over a region of the mesh by successively iterating the IFS. The main advantage is that it becomes possible to recover new levels of detail that were not present in the original mesh, so that the quality is not lost as the observer approaches the mesh. Another characteristic is that the same representation can be used over textures, and in this case the algorithm is directly implemented over the GPU. The visualization time obtained allows this new approach to be used in real-time <b>interactive</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphic</b> applications...|$|R

First, an <b>interactive</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphic</b> display was developed to resolve the problems of interpretation of three-dimensional motion and force plate data collected, and of the presentation of these using planar projections on a two-dimensional computer screen.
