5|$|All {{actinides}} are radioactive {{and release}} energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and synthetically produced plutonium {{are the most}} abundant actinides on Earth. These are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or <b>historical</b> <b>uses,</b> and americium {{is used in the}} ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not having}} a sting, the {{porcupine}} ray is capable of injuring humans with its many sharp thorns. It is reportedly bold and tolerant of being approached closely underwater. The tough, thorny skin of this ray, made into a form of leather called shagreen, had many <b>historical</b> <b>uses.</b> In particular, {{it was used to}} cover the hilts of various melee weapons, as its extremely rough texture prevented slippage during battle. For example, the Japanese deemed it the only species whose skin was acceptable for covering sword grips. The Malayans used it to cover shields. The skin was also used ornamentally, such as by the Chinese, who dyed it and ground down the thorns to yield a mottled pattern. The native inhabitants of Funafuti Atoll used dried portions of the ray's tail as a rasp-like tool.|$|E
5|$|The AdelaideMannum {{pipeline}} {{crosses the}} park and the Anstey Hill water filtration plant lies on its southern boundary; together they supply 20% of Adelaide's reticulated water. Significant <b>historical</b> <b>uses</b> of the area are preserved as ruins and highlighted with interpretive signs. The ruins of Newman's Nursery are {{all that remains of}} what was once the largest plant nursery in the Southern Hemisphere. Ellis Cottage is one of the earliest homes in the area, and the Rumps Bakery building housed the first bakery in Tea Tree Gully. Quarries supplied stone for significant Victorian buildings in Adelaide and aggregate for road building. Klopper's quarries in the southwest hosted plays for the Festival of the Arts in 1980 and 1988.|$|E

5|$|The {{human use}} of fungi for food {{preparation}} or preservation and other purposes is extensive {{and has a}} long history. Mushroom farming and mushroom gathering are large industries in many countries. The study of the <b>historical</b> <b>uses</b> and sociological impact of fungi is known as ethnomycology. Because of the capacity of this group to produce an enormous range of natural products with antimicrobial or other biological activities, many species have long been used or are being developed for industrial production of antibiotics, vitamins, and anti-cancer and cholesterol-lowering drugs. More recently, methods {{have been developed for}} genetic engineering of fungi, enabling metabolic engineering of fungal species. For example, genetic modification of yeast species—which are easy to grow at fast rates in large fermentation vessels—has opened up ways of pharmaceutical production that are potentially more efficient than production by the original source organisms.|$|E

25|$|<b>Historical</b> <b>uses</b> of {{hydrogen}} chloride in the 20th century include hydrochlorinations of alkynes in producing the chlorinated monomers chloroprene and vinyl chloride, which are subsequently polymerized to make polychloroprene (Neoprene) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), respectively. In {{the production of}} vinyl chloride, acetylene (C2H2) is hydrochlorinated by adding the HCl across the triple bond of the C2H2 molecule, turning the triple into a double bond, yielding vinyl chloride.|$|E

500|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by TV Asahi, most Japanese people perceived [...] "Kimigayo" [...] as an important song even before {{the passage of the}} Act on National Flag and Anthem in 1999. However, a poll in the same year conducted by the Mainichi Shimbun found that most respondents opposed legislation making it the national anthem or felt the Diet should take more time in passing such a law. Many Japanese students, who must sing the song at entrance and graduation ceremonies, say they cannot understand the old language of the lyrics and are not educated on its <b>historical</b> <b>uses.</b> Controversies surrounding the use of the anthem in school events still remain.|$|E
2500|$|The first <b>historical</b> <b>uses</b> of the Geiger {{principle}} {{were for}} the detection of alpha and beta particles, and the instrument is still used for this purpose today. For alpha particles and low energy beta particles, the [...] "end-window" [...] type of G-M tube has to be used as these particles have a limited range even in the free air, and are easily stopped by a solid material. Therefore, the tube requires a window which is thin enough to allow as many as possible of these particles through to the fill gas. The window is usually made of mica with a density of about 1.5 - 2.0mg/cm2.|$|E
