50|$|DMSs access {{real-time}} data and provide all {{information on a}} single console at the control centre in an integrated manner. Their development varied across different geographic territories. In the USA, for example, DMSs typically grew by takingOutage Management Systems to the next level, automating the complete sequences and providing an end to end, integrated view of the entire distribution spectrum. In the UK, by contrast, the much denser and more meshed network topologies, combined with stronger Health & Safety regulation, had led to early centralisation of high-voltage switching operations, initially using paper records and schematic diagrams printed onto large wallboards which were 'dressed' with magnetic symbols to show the current running states. There, DMSs grew initially from SCADA systems as these were expanded to allow these centralised control and safety management procedures to be managed electronically. These DMSs required even more detailed component/connectivity models and schematics than those needed by early OMSs as every possible isolation and <b>earthing</b> <b>point</b> on the networks had to be included. In territories such as the UK, therefore, the network component/connectivity models were usually developed in the DMS first, whereas in the USA these were generally built in the GIS.|$|E

40|$|Earthing of {{electrical}} installations is mainly governed by security rules. Electromagnetic compatibility also deals with earthing, among others circuit characteristics. Tokamaks are large-scale electrical installations {{that are known}} to generate large and low frequency magnetic fields as well as large and high frequency electrical fields.

But none of these existing installations looks like ITER, no even remotely.

GIC are a potential source of problems to the systems and therefore important in practice. GIC in a power system (or in principle in any other discretely-earthed system) can be calculated conveniently by using matrix equations presented earlier. Since temporal variations associated with GIC are slow compared to the 50 / 60 Hz frequency used in power transmission, a dc treatment is acceptable. An essential quantity in calculations of GIC in a power grid is the earthing impedance matrix, which is the transfer function coupling GIC flowing to (from) the Earth with the voltages between the earthing points, called nodes or (sub) stations, and a remote earth. The diagonal elements of the matrix equal the earthing resistances of the nodes whereas an off-diagonal element expresses how much GIC at one <b>earthing</b> <b>point</b> affects the voltage at another node.

40|$|People using {{electrical}} installations {{have to be}} protected against electrical shock. For purposes of protection a distinction is made between direct and indirect contact. Direct contact is contact with a live conductor. Protection {{is provided by the}} insulation of cables or the screening of live parts. An indirect contact happens when someone touches exposed metal parts which are not intended to carry current but have become live {{as a result of a}} fault. In this case metallic parts raise the metal to a dangerous potential (contact voltage). Here protection is provided by connecting the exposed metal part (i. e. the case of the electrical machine) to the <b>earthing</b> <b>point</b> of the installation. A protective device will disconnect the circuit as soon as a fault current flows to earth. The earth fault value will depend on the impedance of the path taken by the fault current, which is known as the earth fault loop. The resistance of the earth electrode plays an important role in the final impedance of the earth fault loop, especially when the neutral of the transformer is earthed without any impedance. A good earth electrode should have the lowest possible value compared with the rest of the earth loop (voltage divisor). If this can be achieved, the contact voltage will be limited and the current that trips the protections will be of a higher value. The maximum duration of a contact voltage is established according to IEC 60364 - 4 413. 1. 1. 1. An important constraint in obtaining a good resistance value for the earth electrode is the resistivity of the soil...|$|E
