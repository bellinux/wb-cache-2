40|$|The longhorn beetles, LHBs, {{belonging}} to the Family Cerambycidae constitute {{an important part of}} the biodiversity spectrum in Swedish forests. The LHB community signifies high relevance of biodiversity and conservation status of several specific habitats as well as at the landscape level, owing to their ecological position in a variety of habitats across the landscape. The current study focused on LHBs, since there exists with well-organized and structured data sets on their distribution and abundance over the last two hundred years. The present study focused on discerning the influence of different land uses and land cover parameters on the distribution of certain long horn beetles over different landscapes in Sweden. The main objective was to understand the different aspects to be considered in suggesting inputs for biodiversity conservation in the Swedish forest landscape. The study is based on spatially explicit analysis methods to discern the distribution of selected species of LHBs both at individual and group levels by studying a grid network of 10 x 10 km representing the different supporting habitat factors. The analysis was performed with the support of data already available in SMD - Swedish land cover data base, KNN forest data and Key biotopes data. Variables for prediction were selected based on the assumption that they should influence the distribution of LHBs. A combined LHB records over 65 years from Lindhe et al. 2010 and artportalen records were considered in this study as response variables. The geospatial analysis to quantify the predictors and response variables were accomplished with ArcMap 10. 2. 2. However, the influence of land use and land cover parameters on the distribution of LHBs were assessed with binary logistic regression models by considering predictor variables both individually and also in combined models. The results of the study indicate that among landscape variables considered in the study general structures such as arable land and pasture land exhibited consistently high statistical power in predicting the presence of most groups of LHB across the landscapes, whilst the area of nominal habitat was observed with very limited predictive power to explain the distribution of LHBs. However, the exception of general pattern is represented by LHBs breeding in oak habitat substrate, which had a relatively strong relation to deciduous forest cover when predictor variables were studied individually. Volumes of specific categories of trees as predictors were found to contribute significantly for the occurrence of particular beetles in respective forest habitats. <b>Key</b> <b>biotope</b> small scale owner area revealed positive significant relation with the occurrence of almost all species in both individual and combined models. In contrast <b>key</b> <b>biotope</b> large scale owner area showed negative relation with almost all of the species’ occurrence. Only one exception for conifer breeding beetles in individual model both <b>key</b> <b>biotope</b> area as predictors exhibited the opposite response pattern. No group of LHBs exhibited strong threshold effects but some individual cases, Trogosoma depsarium, Monochamus galloprovincialis, revealed threshold effects of nominal habitat area as well as volume and below that area or volume the existence of these particular beetles almost absence. Xylotrechus antelope showed to have strong threshold effect of coniferous forest area although it’s breeding substrate is oak habitat. It is concluded that among the land use and land cover parameters arable land, pasture land and clearcut area were represented to have higher relative contribution in regard to the distribution of most of the LHBs. Volume of respective nominal habitat as well as key biotopes also contributed to influence the distribution of LHBs. Therefore for biodiversity conservation we observe that indicators of general management and landscape factors appear to contribute equally much or more towards sustainable forest management than nominal habitat resources in the landscape...|$|E
40|$|Studiens syfte är att undersöka arterna Buxbaumia viridis och Nowellia curvifolia för att kunna förutse var man hittar dessa signalarter. Detta gjordes genom att död liggande ved undersöktes i Ycke naturreservat samt en närliggande brukas skog, Östergötlands län. Resultaten visar att faktorerna som är avgörande för B. virids är markkontakt och nedbrytningsklass. B. viridis föredrar att växa på lågor i de högre nedbrytningsklasserna (4 - 7) och med stor andel markkontakt, över 80 %. N. curvifolia beror på {{diameter}} (över 60 cm), nedbrytningsklass (3 - 4) och längd (över 30 m). Baserat på dessa resultat, kan signalarter lättare upptäckas utan en fullskalig inventering av skogen. Young trees dominate Swedish forests, {{which today}} have {{a shortage of}} downed dead wood, <b>key</b> <b>biotopes,</b> and an overall lack of high natural values. By using the mosses Buxbaumia viridis and Nowellia curvifolia the general state of a forest can be assessed. These species indicate high natural values, with a continuity of dead wood in different stages of decay. By investigating ground-lying dead wood, one can predict if the mosses occur in the area or not. This is useful for maintenance of the forests and the preservation of biological diversity. The {{purpose of this study}} was to study the species B. viridis and N. curvifolia in Ycke natural reserve in Östergötland, southern Sweden, and learn how to predict where these species occur. The results showed that ground contact (over 80 %) and stage of decay (stage 4 - 6) of logs were important to B. viridis, with test values 30 - 50 times as high as the other test values. To N. curvifolia, the diameter of the logs was the most important. Decay stage and length of the log were also important factors to N. curvifolia. Based on these results, these indicator species can more easily detected without a full scale inventory of the forest...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{planning}} {{is the most}} important condition for sustainable, continuous, economically efficient and ecological forest use. In North-West Russia, in the Komi Republic in particular, the increasing role of forest {{planning is}} based on the obvious need to transfer from the extensive way of forest management and use of primary natural forests to intensive way of secondary reforestated forests management and use. Forest planning in these conditions should provide the required demand in timber under conditions of forest ecological and social importance protection, taking into account the existed spatial structure of the forest fund. Landscape, ecological and economical forest evaluation as a basis for forest planning allows to define secondary forest areas where efficient forestry and economically profitable activities are possible (taking in consideration the pattern structure and spatial heterogeneity of secondary forests, where most of the territory is covered with low-value stands). Forest planning in intensive forestry should be long-term, minimum for one felling rotation period. This requires to work out regional research programmes for forest activities, but allows giving the economical estimation at each stage of forest management, not only by the felling time. Forest planning allows to estimate the costs of forestry activities and to relate to the expected results that are really important for the financial and economical planning at the enterprise. Long-term forest planning guarantees not only economical efficiency, but makes the grounds for forest social and ecological values protection. Forest planning process is dealing with the necessity of various data collection and joint use. Besides forest inventory data, forest planning includes remote sensing data that can guarantee acute and updated information about a certain forest area, allows to specify spatial, age and tree species structure of a forest stand, define a landscape and ecological peculiarities of the planning object, mark high value forests and <b>key</b> <b>biotopes.</b> Modern information technologies based on GIS provide the tools for the complex analysis of information about forests and give opportunities to modeling of expected results and give an opportunity for forest planning to select the optimal way of forest management for a certain place...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Botany)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Urbanisation {{contributes}} to the degradation of urban biospheres, and the degeneration {{of the quality of}} life for future generations, In the North West Province the urbanisation rate is expected to rise dramatically due to continued drought in rural areas that causes a high poverty rate and low levels of job opportunities. The increasing urbanisation and the need to provide homes for the homeless, place the natural, spontaneous and other vegetation types under extreme pressure. Conservation of open spaces, especially those with natural and semi-natural vegetation, is constantly in competition with urban development. Little research has been done on vegetation in man-made habitats and therefore, planners and national, provincial and local governments in South Africa are unaware of the true biological and ecological value of urban open spaces. Biotope mapping for urban areas based on land-use is one method to determine and map those areas worthy to protect. The map of the urban biotopes forms an important background for planning, management and conservation of urban open spaces. The first urban biotope mapping project in South Africa was completed in 2001 in the city of Potchefstroom. A <b>key</b> for urban <b>biotope</b> mapping was developed, based on German experiences, but adapted to South African conditions. Maps were also drawn up to assist in proposed measures for development and conservation and additional general ideas and proposals to create a better environmental situation for Potchefstroom. Decisions on which plant communities and species must be controlled and which must be conserved could, however, only be based on long-term vegetation dynamics studies. In this thesis, quantitative methods were used to study the vegetation dynamics of certain urban biotopes subjected to different anthropogenic influences. These biotopes include management grasslands, secondary grasslands and a variety of pavements occurring in different land-use areas. Changes in management practices such as the termination of mowing and weeding as well as human impacts such as trampling in areas that haven't iii been disturbed for a while, brought about changes in species composition and/or abundance within one year. Changes in species importance values over time can be attributed to changes in management practices, especially in managed and ruderal grasslands. Experimental studies are, however, needed to verify the results. The time span over which this study took place was probably not long enough, although changes did occur within the first year. Seed-bank analyses were also performed on the different biotopes to investigate the real plant diversity, including plants only present as seeds at the time of the survey. The data collected were analysed using multivariate statistics. Master...|$|R

Vi har sammenliknet samme type død ved i de tre forvaltningskategoriene naturreservat, nøkkel-biotop og slutthogsthensyn (kantsoner og gjensatte grupper av livsløpstrær), og sett på artsan-tall og -sammensetning av både biller i nydød osp og sopp på granlæger. Undersøkelsen er foretatt i fire ulike landskaper i Sørøst-Norge, nær Oslo, i sør- til mellomboreal sone. Gran er dominerende treslag, og alle stokkene har vært valgt ut fra blåbær- eller småbregneskog. For insektsundersøkelsen, som ble utført i tre av landskapene, ble det felt ferske ospetrær, kappet i lengder på 1 meter. De ble plassert ut stående og parvis med 1, 5 meters mellomrom, ett par per prøveflate. Alle tre arealavsetningskategorier ble studert i tre landskap, med 24 stokkpar i hvert av dem, 72 stokkpar totalt. En vindusfelle ble festet til hver stokk. Med to stok-ker var det mulig å sammenlikne billemangfoldet som ble tiltrukket av stokkene med det som faktisk ble produsert i stokkene. For å få til dette ble en av stokkene tildekket med et nett an-nethvert år, etter at begge var åpne for kolonisering i år 1. Vindusfellen hang inne i nettet og fanget insekter som klekket fra stammen. Av vedlevende billearter som inngår i analysen her, ble det registrert 345 arter med til sammen 13208 individer, av 573 arter fanget totalt. Mange arter ble funnet i lave antall; 60 vedlevende arter (17 % av alle vedlevende arter) kun med ett individ. Den vanligste arten, kortvingen Hap-loglossa villosula, forekom med 775 individer (6 % av alle vedlevende individer). 154 av de vedlevende artene er tilknyttet osp i større eller mindre grad, mens 11 har osp som eneste eller foretrukne treslag. Til sammen 21 arter er truet eller nær truet. Både vanlige og rødlistede biller som er tilpasset å leve i nydød osp, syntes langt på vei å kun-ne utnytte slikt {{substrat}} uavhengig av om det var lokalisert i et naturreservat, en nøkkelbiotop eller i et slutthogsthensyn. Biller som er spesialisert til å leve i nydød osp, ble fanget i lik arts-rikdom i våre eksperimentstokker i alle tre kategoriene, mens de øvrige ospeassosierte billear-tene hadde høyest artsrikdom i tilknytning til stokker som stod i nøkkelbiotopene. Slutthogst-hensyn-stokkene tiltrakk seg det høyeste artsmangfold av vedlevende biller totalt, inkludert mange arter som ikke kan leve i våre eksperimentstokker. Dette indikerer at forekomst av til-strekkelige mengder egnet dødved-substrat er viktigere enn hvor i landskapet det forekommer, for denne gruppen av biller og i våre studielandskap. Vedboende sopp ble registrert på 390 granstokker, fem for hvert par av ospestokker. For to av landskapene ble alle de tre kategoriene undersøkt, mens for de to øvrige landskapene ble stu-dert bare naturreservat og nøkkelbiotop. Til sammen ble det registrert 205 arter av vedboende sopp, fordelt på 30 poresopper, 169 barksopper og 8 corticoide heterobasidiomyceter. Hele 69 arter ble bare funnet én gang, mens fem arter hadde over hundre stokkforekomster. Totalt ble det observert 23 rødlistearter. Disse utgjorde 161 (5, 9 %) av totalt 2745 stokkforekomster. I tillegg ble det undersøkt et antall granlæger i granplantasjer med ungskog, samt foretatt noen mer kvalitative studier i mer påvirket gammelskog. Svært få av disse stokkene hadde rødliste-artsforekomster.

We have compared the same type of dead wood in the three conservation categories of nature reserve, woodland key habitat and retention patch (riparian margin zones and retention trees) and studied species number and species composition of both beetles in newly dead aspen logs and fungi on spruce logs. The study has taken place in four different landscapes in South East Norway, close to Oslo in the south and middle boreal zones. Spruce is the dominating tree species, and all of the logs have been selected from bilberry or small fern forest. For the study of early-successional beetles associated with aspen, fresh aspen trees were cut into units of one meter in length. The wood units were transported out to the study sites and placed upright, spaced about one meter apart, one pair for each study plot. All the three categories of area-based conservation measures were studied in three landscapes, each of them with 24 pairs of logs, 72 all together. A flight interception trap was mounted on each wood unit. Using two logs for each plot it was possible to compare the diversity of beetles that were attracted by the logs with what was in fact produced in the logs. To manage this, one of the logs was covered by a net every second year after that both of them were open for colonization in the first year. The flight interception trap was hanging inside the net and caught insects which hatched from the log. Of wood living beetles included in this analysis, 345 species were recorded with a total of 13208 individuals, of 573 species sampled totally. Many species were sampled in low numbers; 60 wood-inhabiting species (17 % of all the wood-inhabiting species totally) were recorded with only one individual. The commonest species, the rove beetle Haploglossa villosula, occurred with 775 individuals (6 % of all wood-inhabiting individuals). 154 of the wood-inhabiting species are associated with aspen to some degree, whereas 11 have aspen as the only or preferred tree species. Altogether, 21 species are threatened or near threathened. Both common and red-listed beetles which are adapted to live in newly dead aspen seemed to a large degree {{to be able to use}} such a substrate independently of whether it was localized in a nature reserve, a woodland key habitat or in a retention patch. Beetles specialized to live in newly dead aspen were sampled in about the same number in our experimental logs in all of the three categories, whereas the other aspen-associated beetle species had their highest species number for logs standing in the woodland key habitats. The retention patch logs attracted the highest diversity of wood-inhabiting beetles totally, including many species which cannot live in our experimental logs. This indicates that the occurrence of sufficient amounts of suitable substrate of dead wood is more important than where in the landscape it occurs for this group of beetles in our studied landscapes. Wood-inhabiting fungi were recorded on 390 spruce logs, five for each pair of aspen logs. For two of the landscapes all of the three categories were studied, whereas for the two other landscapes only nature reserve and woodland key habitat were studied. Altogether, 205 species of wood-inhabiting fungi were recorded; 30 polypores, 169 corticiaceous fungi and 8 corticioid heterobasidiomycetes. As many as 69 species were only found once, wheras five species were found on more than 100 logs. Totally, 23 red-listed species were found. They constituted 162 (5. 9 %) of a total of 2745 log occurrences. A number of spruce logs were studied from spruce plantations in young forests and some qualitative studies were performed in old forests more influenced by forestry. Very few of these logs had occurrences of red-listed species. In contrast to beetles wood-inhabiting fungi on spruce logs exhibited a distinct contrast in total species number and number of red-listed species between nature reserves and woodland key habitats on the one side and retention patches on the other side. The latter category is most often in the form of margin zones along mires. However, also for fungi, there is some variation: In cases when the margin zones were broad and consisted of forest with the character of nature forest, also this type seemed to function as a habitat for numerous species, included some red listed species. We also found a modest difference between the different conservation categories. However, both beetles and fungi showed greater difference between the different landscapes. The utility effect of setting aside an area, either as nature reserve, woodland key habitat, or retention patch, is high and complimentary for all of the three categories, evaluated from the criteria we have measured in the project. Given that the economic cost of setting aside trees is the same for all categories, the economic loss also becomes the same. But this prerequisite is not always true, and in reality, separate trees which are set aside, probably cost more per m 3 than the same amount of trees in forest reserves. Anyway, small scale considerations may to a larger degree become localized where they have the least cost, so that this effect can be reduced. The results also indicate that there is some degree of freedom of choice as to how area should be set aside, even though the ecological results also stress the significance of larger areas rich in dead wood in closed forest for wood-inhabiting fungi. The study further stresses that the woodland <b>key</b> <b>biotopes</b> have an important function to conserve red-list species. This does not only refer to signal species which in many cases have been recorded beforehand, but also to other red-listed species which cannot or only with difficulty can be identified macroscopically, but which were recorded in this study. Possible dispersal limitations of fungi and possible roles of woodland key habitats and retention patches in a dispersal network are discussed. Our results also show the significance of the width of the margin zone. Therefore, it will be favourable both with respect to biology and economy that the margin zones have sufficient width, so that they can house sufficient amounts of the right elements of dead wood in a short and long term perspective, and that they despite of small size may retain some kind of old forest environment on a small scale. From the results and current knowledge about the biology of wood-inhabiting fungi and beetles, it is reason to believe that the three categories of nature reserves, woodland key habitats and margin zone complement each other in a positive way, especially with respect to the need both for large and robust conservation areas and the occurrence of a network, which ensure the possibility for rapid dispersal and establishment. There is therefore every reason to continue current policies with an emphasis on all three categories of conservation measures. © Norsk institutt for naturforskning.
