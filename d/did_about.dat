5|$|After its {{unexpected}} redevelopment over Oklahoma, widespread {{damage was}} also reported there. Several communities in central Oklahoma were flooded {{due to the}} heavy rainfall. Watonga, Kingfisher and Geary were the hardest-hit communities, where many houses and buildings were inundated. The weather forced the cancellation of the Hydro Fair as the carnival rides were not safe in heavy rain and high wind. Winds in Watonga gusted as high as 82mph (131km/h), which damaged numerous trees and power lines and heavily damaged mobile homes. The entire community lost power, as <b>did</b> <b>about</b> 15,000 customers in total in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. A section of Interstate 40 was also closed for a while.|$|E
5|$|In general, Bret was {{forecast}} {{to track}} farther north than it ultimately <b>did.</b> <b>About</b> 24hours {{in advance of}} the storm, tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for the southern Lesser Antilles and Venezuela. The first tropical storm watch was posted late on August5 from Dominica southward to Trinidad. On the next day, this was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from Saint Lucia to Trinidad. Tropical storm warnings spread westward through Venezuela along the storm's path, as well as the ABC islands and northern Colombia along the Guajira Peninsula. Later when Bret began reorganizing in the southwestern Caribbean, portions of Nicaragua were under a tropical storm warning only nine hours before the storm struck. The warning covered from Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua through the entirety of the Costa Rican coastline, as well as San Andrés island offshore.|$|E

25|$|Sure, {{there have}} been controversies as well. Naya Daur (right) was one instance, thanks to the Madhubala episode.

25|$|Khand (Evil) – Tolkien wrote {{even less}} about Khand than he <b>did</b> <b>about</b> Harad, though {{we know that}} the only thing implied about them is that the armor they wore covered - {{literally}} - their entire bodies ("Variags who hated the sun"), and that their weapons may be their own design of Haradrim and Easterling weapons. Games Workshop has based their Variags of Khand on the Mongols and the Japanese, featuring sashimonos and the unique chariots, despite the Easterlings being the only culture in Middle-earth with chariots in Tolkien's writings. It was suggested that the Gondorians were unaware of the lands further east, and thus the names of the Variags and Wainriders had been mixed-up. Khand allies with the Easterlings (and the Haradrim) frequently.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though he}} sought to {{distinguish}} observed facts from myths and popular errors and {{was known for his}} accurate depiction of many animals in Historiae animalium, he also included many fictional animals such as the Unicorn and the Basilisk, which he had only heard about from medieval bestiaries. But when Gessner doubted the accuracy of the opinions he relayed in his own writings, or the validity of the illustrations he included, he clearly said so. Besides any plant or animal's potential advantage to people, Gessner was interested in learning about them because of the moral lessons they could teach and the divine truths they might tell. He went into as much detail about some unreal animals as he <b>did</b> <b>about</b> real ones. Later in 1556 he also combined real and fictional creatures in his edition of the works of Claudius Aelianus.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} 2006 midterm elections, media pundits began speculating, as they <b>did</b> <b>about</b> the Democrats, about {{potential}} Republican candidates for President in 2008. In November 2006, Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led in the polls, {{followed closely by}} Arizona Senator John McCain. The media speculated that Giuliani's pro-choice stance on abortion and McCain's age {{and support of the}} unpopular Iraq War would be detriments to their candidacies. Giuliani remained the frontrunner in the polls throughout most of 2007, with McCain and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson fighting for second place. Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Giuliani, Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, and Texas Representative Ron Paul announced their candidacies on January 28, February 5, February 13, and March 12, respectively. McCain officially announced his candidacy on March 1, 2007, after several informal announcements. In the third quarter of 2007, the top four GOP (Republican) fundraisers were Romney, Giuliani, Thompson, and Ron Paul. MSNBC's Chuck Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early 2007.|$|E

The awful tragedy, for the orchestra, was that eventually {{we were not able}} to play the standard classics.

[...] The bassoon player William Waterhouse who joined the BBC SO from the LSO found the BBC's repertory refreshing, but the music making less impressive: [...] "There were no potboilers, but also, I'm afraid, no world-ranking soloists either." ...|$|E

500|$|The Civil Constitution of the Clergy {{required}} all clerics {{to swear}} allegiance to it and, by extension, to the increasingly anti-clerical National Constituent Assembly. All but {{seven of the}} 160 French bishops refused the oath, as <b>did</b> <b>about</b> half of the parish priests. [...] Persecution of the clergy [...] and of the faithful was the first trigger of the rebellion. Those who refused the oath, called non-juring priests, had been exiled or imprisoned. Women {{on their way to}} Mass were beaten in the streets. Religious orders had been suppressed and Church property, confiscated. On 3 March 1793, most of the churches were ordered closed. Soldiers confiscated sacramental vessels and the people were forbidden to place crosses on graves.|$|E
500|$|Collins, pg. 11 In addition, Collins {{notes that}} early pseudo-country musicians like Vernon Dalhart {{who had made}} their name {{recording}} 'country music songs' were not from the hills and hollows or plains and valleys. These recording stars sang both rural music and city music, and most knew more about Broadway than they <b>did</b> <b>about</b> hillbillies. Their rural image was often manufactured for the moment and the dollar. In contrast, Collins later explains, both the Carter Family and Rodgers had rural folk credibility that helped make Peer's recording session such an influential success; it was the Carter Family that was Ralk Peer's tie to the hills and hollows, to lost loves and found faith, but it took Jimmie Rodgers to connect the publisher with some of country music's other beloved symbols—trains and saloons, jail and the blues.|$|E

500|$|However, Hergé knew {{as little}} about China as he <b>did</b> <b>about</b> the Soviet Union or the Belgian Congo. At the time most Belgians {{held to a}} {{negative}} stereotype of China, viewing it as [...] "a distant continent of a nation, barbaric, overpopulated, and inscrutable", and Hergé had long believed this view. He had included Chinese characters in two previous Adventures, in both instances depicting them according to traditional European clichés. In Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, he included two pigtailed Chinese men hired by the Bolsheviks to torture Tintin, while in Tintin in America he featured two Chinese hoodlums who plotted to eat Snowy. Hergé learned {{a bit about the}} country from Albert Londres' book China Madness, based on Londres' experiences in the country. He was also influenced in his portrayal of China by the 1933 German film Flüchtlinge (At the End of the World).|$|E

Gatiss also made Henry display signs of survivor guilt. Tovey's nephew auditioned for the part of a younger Henry, but another child actor was cast for the role as the nephew was considered too young.|$|E
