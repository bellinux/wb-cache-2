5000|$|In 2014, the IAM {{introduced}} Masters as an {{even higher}} standard of driving. Masters is a big step up from IAM entry level. The IAM Masters programme provides true [...] "one to one" [...] mentoring support and guidance, {{in order to help}} people achieve the highest level of civilian driving standard in the country. Prior to the introduction of the IAM Masters programme, RoSPA Gold and the DIAmond Special Test were considered the highest civilian <b>driving</b> <b>qualification</b> in the UK. However, IAM Masters is now widely recognised as the highest civilian qualification in the UK. There are two grade of Masters: pass and distinction.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} levels of IAM membership, {{representing}} increasing skill levels. IAM entry level {{is considered a}} foundation in advanced motoring, which is easily achievable by most people. It requires only a rudimentary grasp of the police system of driving. At a higher skill level, a F1RST is awarded to those who pass their advanced test and achieve a score of 1 in virtually every category. An IAM F1RST {{is considered to be}} at least as high as standard as a RoSPA Gold. Moving up to a much higher skill level are Masters and Masters with distinction (described below). The latter is now recognised as the highest civilian <b>driving</b> <b>qualification</b> in the UK.|$|E
5000|$|... {{to be over}} 18 {{years of}} age (21 in some services) to hold a full, usually clean, driving licence {{for at least one}} year, {{sometimes}} two - if you passed your test after 1996, you may need an extra <b>driving</b> <b>qualification</b> to satisfy the selection criteria set by the local ambulance service you are applying to - this may include testing your driving skills and knowledge of the Highway Code to have a medical assessment to make sure you are physically fit and have good eyesight. You also need a good general standard of education, and some ambulance services ask for a minimum of four GCSEs (A-C)/S grades (1-3) in English, maths and a science-based subject. Equivalent qualifications may be accepted; check with your local ambulance service.|$|E

25|$|Regardless {{of their}} {{previous}} <b>driving</b> <b>qualifications</b> members of the German armed forces need an additional driver's licence before being allowed to use a military vehicle. The Driving Instruction Centre (Kraftfahrausbildungszentrum Celle) provided training for vehicles of the classes B and BCE as well as training for driving instructors.|$|R
50|$|NARS {{doctors and}} Critical Care Paramedics are still {{dispatched}} from home, {{in their own}} cars, but today their cars are equipped with blue lights and sirens, {{paid for by the}} charity. They have been trained to drive under emergency conditions, have advanced <b>driving</b> <b>qualifications</b> and have additional ‘blue light’ insurance, again paid for from the charity’s funds. NARS doctors and paramedics still provide their services voluntarily.|$|R
5000|$|A {{key feature}} of [...] "compound" [...] trust {{relationships}} {{is the possibility}} of selective disclosure from one entity to another of locally relevant information. As an illustration of the potential application of selective disclosure, let us suppose a certain Diana wished to book a hire car without disclosing irrelevant personal information (utilising a notional digital identity network that supports compound trust relationships). As an adult, UK resident with a current driving license, Diana might have the UK's Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency vouch for her <b>driving</b> <b>qualification,</b> age and nationality to a car-rental company without having her name or contact details disclosed. Similarly, Diana's bank might assert just her banking details to the rental company. Selective disclosure allows for appropriate privacy of information within a network of identity relationships.|$|E
40|$|This paper empirically {{tests the}} role of search {{frictions}} in <b>driving</b> <b>qualification</b> mismatches in the labor market. Using new data from several low-income economies in urban Asia we find that overeducation in less developed labor markets are more pervasive than in more developed economies. Moreover, frictions related to search costs are a crucial determinant of match quality resulting in socially inefficient talent misallocation. Our findings suggest scope for policy interventions that improve worker-job matches with potential gains to wages and aggregate productivity...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper from IAENG International Conference on Operations Research, (ICOR' 15), Hong Kong, 18 - 20 March, {{published}} subsequently in Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Due to the funding cuts {{the police are}} facing {{there is a growing}} need for increased resource efficiency. Current methods of officer dispatch do not use all the information available to make an informed decision on the most efficient officer to send to an incident. Automating the police officer selection for incident response can utilize this information to make an informed decision for which officer to send. The tool for selecting an officer described here, consists of mapping, routing, and decision making applications. The decision criteria used is officer availability, predicted possible response time, area coverage, and <b>driving</b> <b>qualification.</b> This increases the chance of selecting the most efficient officer to attend an incident. Through simulation it has been proved that making an informed decision can increase the efficiency significantly over random selection within the proximity...|$|E

It is crucial that police forces operate in a cost {{efficient}} manner and, {{in the case of}} incident response, that the most efficient resources are allocated. The current procedure is that police response units are allocated manually by a dispatcher using a resource list and mapping software. The efficiency of this process can be improved by the use of integrated mathematical approaches embedded within an automatic framework, yielding the optimal selection framework developed in this paper. The framework combines mapping and routing algorithms, and a decision process to facilitate optimal officer selection for incident response. The decision process considers information such as quickest response time, predicted traffic conditions, <b>driving</b> <b>qualifications,</b> response unit availability and demand coverage. The selection framework has been tested and validated through simulation and has shown to increase the efficiency of response units through reduced response times, increased response unit availability, and greater demand coverage...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{computers}} within the dental curriculum for students is vital for many aspects of their studies. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess how dental students who had obtained the European computer <b>driving</b> licence (ECDL) <b>qualification</b> (an internationally-recognised standard of competence) through taught courses, felt about the qualification, and how it changed their habits vis-a-vis computers, and information and communication technology. This study was carried out as a descriptive, one-off, cross-sectional survey. A questionnaire was distributed to 100 students who had successfully completed the course, with questions pertaining to the use of email, word processing and Internet for course-works, Medline for research, computer based learning, online lecture notes, and online communication with members of staff, both before and after ECDL qualification. Scaled responses were given. The attitudes of students towards the course were also assessed. The frequencies and percentage distributions of the responses to each question were analysed. It was found that dental students who follow ECDL teaching and successfully complete its requirements, seem to increase the frequency with which they use email, word processing and Internet for course works, Medline for research purposes, computer based learning, online lecture notes, and online communication with staff. Opinions about the ECDL course varied, many dental students finding the course easy, enjoying it only a little, but admitting that it improved their computer skills...|$|R
