5000|$|In non-MacPherson strut {{automobile}} suspension, the two <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> {{are called}} the [...] "upper ball joint" [...] and [...] "lower ball joint". Lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> are sometimes larger and may wear out faster, because the fore and aft loads, primarily due to braking, are higher at the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> (Torque reaction and drag add at the bottom joint, and partly cancel at the top joint.) Also, lateral cornering loads are higher at the bottom joint. Depending on the suspension design, the vertical load from the suspension spring may be handled entirely by the top <b>ball</b> <b>joint,</b> or entirely by the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> The damper load, (which is low in normal conditions, zero when stationary, but in peak bump or rebound rate may be almost {{as large as the}} spring load) is usually, but not always, taken on the same <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> as the spring load. The anti-roll bar loading is often, but not always, taken on the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> It may be taken by the top <b>ball</b> <b>joint,</b> or directly from the steering knuckle by ball-jointed drop links.|$|R

5000|$|Sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> do {{not require}} {{lubrication}} as they are [...] "lubed for life". Formerly most <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> had grease fitting (sometimes called a grease zerk) and were designed for periodic addition of a lubricant, however almost all modern cars use sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> to minimise maintenance requirements. The lubricant was usually a very high-viscosity lubricant. It is commonly believed that standard <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> will outlive sealed ones because eventually the seal will break, causing the joint to dry out and rust. [...] Additionally, the act of adding new lubricant pushes out old and dry lubricant, extending {{the life of the}} joint. This was supposed to be done at intervals of 1000 to 2000 miles on many vehicles, which is incompatible with the service interval on modern cars, often 12000 miles or more, and in any case was rarely attended to by owners, resulting in severe wear and possible <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> failure, which can result in serious accidents. For this reason, almost all <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> on modern European or Far Eastern cars are the sealed for life type. New technology especially applied to the internal bearing design has allowed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> to meet these longer service intervals. The special design's incorporate sintered metal bearings which replace OEM sealed polymer/plastic version and improved dust boot seal's that work much better at retaining the grease.|$|R

50|$|The SY II {{received}} a revised front suspension {{to address a}} well-documented weakness in the front lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints.</b> Specifically, the original design had the <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> under constant tension, which resulted in some complete failures of the joint (causing the wheel to detach from the suspension and steering) and premature wear requiring lower control arm replacements after as little as 30000 km. With the new design, the lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> were now under compression, thus eliminating the premature wear issue.|$|R
50|$|While {{there is}} no exact {{lifespan}} that can be put on sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints,</b> they can fail as early as 80000 miles km in modern vehicles, and much sooner in older vehicles. Signs of a failing <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> may start with a sudden burst sound {{as a result of}} <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> dismantling. Then it keeps on with clicking, popping or snapping sound when the wheel is turned and eventually turn into a squeaking sound {{at the end of a}} stop, when the gas pedal is used and/or also when hitting bumps. Another symptom could be 'thud' noises coming from front suspension when going over bumps. Dry <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> have dramatically increased friction and can cause the steering to stick or be more difficult.|$|R

50|$|The two arms, the spindle, and the body, form a four-bar link.

30|$|Tilting {{mechanism}} The {{purpose of}} the tilting mechanism {{is to increase the}} number of DOFs of the calibration board.

To increase the number of DOFs while retaining sufficient stiffness of the calibration table, a 3 -DOF <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> with high stiffness was used in the tilting mechanism. The calibration board can tilt in roll and pitch directions. A wing nut on the <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> slider is used to fix the <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> slider and aluminum extrusion (see Fig.  2 c, d). Therefore, the calibration broad rotates in roll and pitch direction via the tilting mechanism.|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} an approach for the modeling and numerical optimization of <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> within a Marker-less Motion Capture (MoCap) framework. In skeleton based approaches, kinematic chains {{are commonly used}} to model 1 DoF revolute joints. A 3 DoF joint (e. g. a shoulder or hip) is consequently modeled by concatenating three consecutive 1 DoF revolute joints. Obviously such a representation is not optimal and singularities can occur. Therefore, we propose to model 3 DoF joints with spherical <b>joints</b> or <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> using the representation of a twist and its exponential mapping (known from 1 DoF revolute joints). The exact modeling and numerical optimization of <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> requires additionally the adjoint transform and the logarithm of the exponential mapping. Experiments with simulated and real data demonstrate that <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> can better represent arbitrary rotations than the concatenation of 3 revolute joints. Moreover, we demonstrate that the 3 revolute joints representation {{is very similar to}} the Euler angles representation and has the same limitations in terms of singularities. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{parabolic}} trough collectors constitute the first concentrating {{solar thermal technology}} regarding global installed power. Central receivers and Fresnel receivers appear with smaller value and commercial solar dishes power are practically negligible. Several features have driven {{parabolic trough}}s to this first position, but some disadvantages are appearing, i. e. the cost reduction is not as quick as expected, the <b>flexible</b> or <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> constitute leak problems with high pressure and temperature, and simplification of the mechanical structures is quite difficult. At this point, Fresnel receivers appear as a main competitor with troughs, offering lower cost but also lower efficiency; if the reduction in cost is higher than in efficiency, or if Fresnel efficiency is improved, there are potential facts which can make this simpler technology more competitive than trough collectors. In order to improve the Fresnel capabilities, {{it could be useful}} to analyze its optical properties. One important feature of Fresnel solar fields is that receiver and concentrator are mechanically separated, providing the system of a new freedom degree in comparison with trough collectors. This degree of freedom can be used in multi-tube receivers, using the high intensity thermal flux impinging in the receiver to illuminate the tubes where the fluid has higher film coefficient (i. e. where the phase change occurs) to obtain a high thermal efficiency, and using the lower thermal flux for preheating and reheating. The idea presented in this paper is to use a multi-tube Fresnel receiver with an adequate optical system that permits tailoring the thermal flux mapping in the receiver in coherence with the convection process of the thermal fluid. In order to obtain this objective, the mass flow will undergo preheating through the peripheral tubes (where the radiation flux will be lower due to the tracking, mirrors shape and sun shape errors) and will be driven afterwards to the high intensity thermal flux, where boiling (that implies high film coefficient values) takes place. A four tube receiver configuration, according to these ideas, will have two main possibilities. The first one a one-way mass flow through the peripheral tubes (inlets to the receiver) and a second pass inside the internal tubes (outlets). The second possibility assumes the mass-flow inlet receiver through one peripheral tube and the exit at the other one, the mass flow passing consecutively through the other two tubes...|$|R
