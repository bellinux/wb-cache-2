To examine the effects of waste rubber powder and fly ash on the strength and microstructure of sulfur composites after three days of curing, a series of characterization analyses were conducted based on the tests of compressive strength, powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, and mercury intrusion porosimetry. The test results suggested that the replacement of sulfur with fly ash up to about 45 % generally improved the compressive strength of sulfur composites, and rubber powder effectively substituted fine aggregate or a portion of sulfur without significant strength reduction.

One major objective was to use materials other than cement, and preferably materials that are themselves wastes, as the solidification additives, namely using wastes to treat wastes or locally available natural material. This research examines the cement-based and lime-based stabilization/solidification (S/S) techniques applied for waste generated at a metal-plating industry and a dye industry. For the lime-based S/S process the following binder mixtures were used: cement kiln dust/lime, bentonite/lime and gypsum/lime. For the cement-based S/S process three binder mixtures were used: cement kiln dust/cement, bentonite/cement and gypsum/cement. The leachability of the wastes was evaluated using the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure. The applicability and optimum weight ratio of the binder mixtures were estimated using the unconfined compressive strength test. The optimum ratio mixtures were mixed with waste samples in different ratios and cured for 28 days in order to find the S/S products with the highest strength and lowest leachability at the same time. The results of this work showed that the cement-and lime-based S/S process, using cement kiln dust and bentonite as additives can be effectively used in order to treat <b>industrial</b> <b>waste.</b> Copyright © ISWA 2004...|$|R
