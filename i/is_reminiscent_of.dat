5|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} removal, called Brumby running, <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> Banjo Paterson's iconic poem, The Man from Snowy River where expert riders rope the Brumbies and remove {{them to a}} new location.|$|E
5|$|Film critic Ben Zipper {{believes}} that Kiarostami’s {{work as a}} landscape artist {{is evident in the}} composition of distant shots of the dry hills throughout a number of his films. He points out that Kiarostami’s use of rural locations and remote settings <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> Sohrab Sepehri’s attention to landscape as represented in his poems such as Golestaneh, in which the poet treats the rural environment realistically and imbues it with a poetic aura.|$|E
5|$|Not {{far from}} Copenhagen Airport on the Kastrup coast, The Blue Planet {{completed}} in March 2013 now houses the national aquarium. With its 53 aquariums, {{it is the}} largest facility of its kind in Scandinavia. Grundtvig's Church, located in the northern suburb of Bispebjerg, was designed by P.V. Jensen Klint and completed in 1940. A rare example of Expressionist church architecture, its striking west façade <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> a church organ.|$|E

5|$|Slither.io is a massively {{multiplayer}} browser game {{developed by}} Steve Howse. Players control an avatar resembling a snake, which consumes multicolored pellets, both from other players and ones that naturally spawn {{on the map}} in the game, to grow in size. The objective {{of the game is}} to grow the longest snake in the server. Slither.io is similar in concept to the popular 2015 web game Agar.io and <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> the classic arcade game Snake.|$|E
5|$|The Shingouz are aliens {{who make}} their first {{appearance}} in Ambassador of the Shadows and re-appear regularly throughout the subsequent albums. They are brown, short-furred creatures, slightly less than a metre tall, resembling flightless birds with a snout instead of a beak. Their appearance <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> the main characters in the Mad magazine comic strip Spy vs. Spy.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviewssome critics {{claimed it}} was fresh and a new sound, while others argued it was very similar to music already available. Desolate North has an extremely slow rhythm and has only limited vocals. The music is interspersed with various woodland sounds, such as running water and footsteps. The natural imagery used on the album <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> that used in black metal, but the music is closer to ambient.|$|E

25|$|The Madonna's dress, {{frame and}} angle <b>of</b> her head <b>are</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> Justice in the Stanza della Segnatura which was painted {{about the same}} time as this painting. It <b>is</b> also <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> the Madonna of the Blue Diadem.|$|R

5|$|The {{calls of}} the two species are not similar. The call of the greater melampitta is a double or triple note, which is slurred and {{repeated}} monotonously, and <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> the black pitohui. The call of the lesser melampitta are either harsh buzzy notes or chirped whistles, {{both of which are}} repeated at intervals.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{has several}} {{references}} to Christmas films. The title is {{a play on}} Miracle on 34th Street while the scene where everyone rallies around to support the Simpsons <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> the last scene of the classic holiday movie It's a Wonderful Life. The film is further spoofed when Homer tells Lisa to stop playing the piano which parodies a similar scene involving George Bailey.|$|E
5|$|The manner {{with which}} van der Weyden {{presents}} {{the resurrection of}} the dead across the five lower panels <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> a Gothic tympanum, specifically that at Autun Cathedral. Rolin would have been familiar with the Autun Cathedral entrances, which may have motivated his decision to commission a Last Judgement for the hospice from van der Weyden.|$|E

The life and death of Joe Christmas <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> the passion of Christ, Lena and her fatherless child parallel Mary and Christ, and Byron Bunch acts as a Joseph figure. Christian imagery such as the urn, the wheel, and the shadow, can be found throughout.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{version of}} Puyo Puyo and replaces its {{characters}} {{with those from}} the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, being primarily based on the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog animated series. The gameplay <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> Tetris, in which the player must organise different coloured shapes as they fall down a board. The game received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the gameplay, while criticising the difficulty and overuse of the falling block puzzle genre.|$|E
5|$|Gomphus clavatus is {{commonly}} known as pig's ears, alluding to the violet underside and yellowish cap of the fruit bodies, although this vernacular name is also used for Discina perlata. Other English common names for this species include clustered chanterelle and violet chanterelle. Gray coined the name clubbed gomphe. In the Sherpa language of Nepal the fungus is known as Eeshyamo ("mother-in-law"), as its imposing fruit body <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> a mother-in-law, who has a dominant role in the Sherpa family.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, Casino Royale {{became the}} first Bond film ever to be shown in {{mainland}} Chinese cinemas. The Chinese version was edited before release, with the reference to the Cold War re-dubbed and new dialogue added during the poker scene explaining the process of Texas hold 'em, as the game is less familiar in China (this addition <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> dialogue that {{was added to the}} 1954 American TV adaptation to explain the rules of baccarat, the game featured in the original book). Casino Royale has earned approximately $11.7million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens, including a record opening weekend collection for a non-Chinese film, with $1.5million.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to rich dinosaur fossils, {{there are also}} plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the K–Pg boundary. In the sediments below the K–Pg boundary the dominant plant remains are angiosperm pollen grains, but the boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores. More usual pollen levels gradually resume above the boundary layer. This <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions, where the recovery is led by ferns, which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants.|$|E
5|$|Jørgen Olufsen's House (Jørgen Olufsens Gård) on Østerågade is Denmark's best {{preserved}} merchant's {{mansion in}} the Renaissance style. Built mainly of sandstone in 1616, {{it also has}} a half-timbered section. The style <b>is</b> <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> similar buildings in the north of Germany and in the Netherlands. Olufsen, Jens Bang's half brother, was not only a successful merchant but also mayor of Aalborg. When it was built, the residence with its integrated warehouse was on the Østerå, an inlet from the sound with access for barges. The old iron bar with a hook for scales {{can be seen in the}} portico.|$|E
