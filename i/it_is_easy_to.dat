5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E
5|$|CsF is more soluble than sodium {{fluoride}} or potassium fluoride. It {{is available in}} anhydrous form, and if water has been absorbed <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> dry by heating at 100°C for two hours in vacuo. CsF reaches a vapor pressure of 1 kilopascal at 825°C, 10 kPa at 999°C, and 100 kPa at 1249°C.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Anglo-Saxon {{charters}} document {{the incorporation of}} areas of moor in estates, suggested that the area continued to be exploited. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> see why the area acquired a number of legends, particularly of King Arthur and his followers, who some believe based his court in the hill fort at South Cadbury. According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.|$|E

5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E
5|$|The combat was {{generally}} well-received, with some reviewers noting {{that it is}} mostly unchanged from the original Knights of the Old Republic. GameSpot compared the combat from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, saying that it isn't well-balanced in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous. GameZone said that the combat is not changed from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, but {{that this is a}} good thing since the combat in the original was enjoyable. IGN praised the game's AI, saying that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> control the main character alone without controlling the party members. GameSpy's reviewer, on the other hand, said that he encountered problems with the combat AI that were not present in the original Knights of the Old Republic.|$|E

25|$|With a 455kHz IF <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> get {{adequate}} {{front end}} selectivity with broadcast band (under 1600kHz) signals. For example, if the station being received is on 600kHz, the local oscillator {{will be set}} to 600 + 455 = 1055kHz. But a station on 1510kHz could also potentially produce an IF of 455kHz and so cause image interference. However, because 600kHz and 1510kHz are so far apart, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> design the front end tuning to reject the 1510kHz frequency.|$|E
