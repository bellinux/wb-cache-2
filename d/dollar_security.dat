40|$|We’re {{going to}} build a wall. ”Borders have been drawn since the {{beginning}} of time, but in recent years artificial barriers have become increasingly significant to the political conversation across the world. Donald Trump was elected President of the United States while promising to build a wall on the Mexico border, and in Europe, the international movements of migrants and refugees have sparked fierce discussion about whether and how countries should restrict access to their territory by erecting physical barriers. Virtual walls are also built and crushed at increasing speed. In the post- 9 / 11 era there is a greater danger from so-called "transnational non-state actors”, and computer hacking and cyberterrorism threaten to overwhelm our technological barriers. In this timely and original book, Said Saddiki scrutinises the physical and virtual walls located in four continents, including Israel, India, the southern EU border, Morocco, and the proposed border wall between Mexico and the US. Saddiki’s detailed analysis explores the tensions between the rise of globalisation, which some have argued will lead to a "borderless world” and "the end of the nation-state”, and the rapid development in recent decades of border control systems. Saddiki examines both regular and irregular cross-border activities, including the flow of people, goods, ideas, drugs, weapons, capital, and information, and explores the disparities that are reflected by barriers to such activities. He considers the consequences of the construction of physical and virtual walls, including their impact on international relations {{and the rise of the}} multi-billion <b>dollar</b> <b>security</b> market.

40|$|A {{striking}} {{development of}} the U. S. economy in the 1990 s has been the large impact of exchange rate movements on the U. S. international position. Because of the substantial leverage in the U. S. position, with U. S. investors short in <b>dollar</b> <b>securities</b> and long in foreign securities, a depreciation of the dollar leads to a large capital gain for the U. S. We show that this effect is concentrated for movements against Eu-ropean currencies, as Asian currencies make only a small share of the foreign currency securities held by U. S. investors. We incorporate this valuation channel in a simple general equilibrium model, and analyze the international transmission of monetary shocks. We find that the valuation effect of exchange rate movements is a major dimension, dwarfing the usual effects through the trade balance. In addition, the valuation effect of exchange rate movements on welfare operates even when prices are fully flexible...|$|R
50|$|In December 2012, Eric Ben-Artzi {{came forward}} {{publicly}} {{with evidence of}} multi-billion <b>dollar</b> <b>securities</b> violations at Deutsche Bank, the global financial services company. Ben-Artzi joined Deutsche Bank in 2010 as a quantitative risk analyst in the company's Market Risk Management department. He internally reported violations stemming from the bank's failure to report {{the value of its}} credit derivatives portfolio accurately. Specifically, he showed that the bank had inflated the value and underestimated the risk of a significant number of its trades. The bank retaliated in multiple ways and ultimately dismissed him. Ben-Artzi's story led to a series of front-page investigative pieces by the Financial Times. Reports showed that the Bank concealed up to $10 billion in losses and that German regulators had been briefed previously about the fraudulent activities but did nothing. Independent economists have backed Ben-Artzi's allegations.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the evolution of}} three types of corporate securities in Argentina, namely, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and deferred checks. Corporate bonds (obligaciones negociables) were legally authorized in 1988, and after a tax reform in 1991 they became an important financing vehicle. Asset backed securities (fideicomisos), legally created in 1995, have been issued since 1996. They typically bundle together small credits of a similar category. Deferred checks (cheques de pago diferido) exist since 1993, alongside standard checks. They can be negotiated on the exchange since 2003, and are akin to commercial paper. Corporate bonds have been overwhelmingly issued by large firms and banks, with an average issue size of 53 million <b>dollars.</b> Asset backed <b>securities</b> have an average value of 9 million dollars.

40|$|The global {{financial}} and {{economic crisis and}} prospects for large and sustained budget deficits in the United States have prompted countries with massive dollar holdings such as China to consider alternatives to the US dollar. These countries realize that they would suffer losses if inflation eroded {{the value of the}} <b>dollar</b> <b>securities</b> they own. Are there feasible alternatives to the US dollar as a widely used international currency? Richard Cooper looks at possible alternatives [...] major currencies in use, such as the euro, the yen, the pound, or even the Chinese renminbi, and a synthetic currency such as the special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund [...] and concludes that no other currency seems likely to overtake the US dollar, and it is likely to remain the dominant international currency for a long time. He notes that international use of the euro will grow, perhaps even more rapidly than that of the dollar for some years, but because of limitations on issuers and financial markets, the euro is not likely to displace the dollar. In a growing world economy, there is room for both. A deliberate international decision to create an international currency could displace the dollar, but that task would be formidably difficult. The prospective gains from such a creation would have to be sufficiently great to make governments willing to overcome the practical difficulties and to adopt the complementary policies (mainly concerning exchange rates) necessary to give a new international currency a compelling advantage over present arrangements. ...|$|R
