40|$|Abstract- In today’s {{electric}} power system, {{solid state power}} electronics technology plays more and more important roles {{and the demand for}} mega-watt level power ratings is increasing. The development of mega-watt power converters strongly depends on the state-of-the-art of power semiconductor technology. The <b>Emitter</b> <b>Turn-off</b> <b>Thyristor</b> (ETO) is a new emerging high power semiconductor switch which combines the advantages of Gate Turn-off Thyristor’s (GTO) high voltage and current capability and MOS easy gate control. Its superior control characteristics combined with its high speed, wider RBSOA, higher controllable maximum current, forward current saturation capability, its on-device current sensing and low cost make the ET 0 the most promising power device in high power, smart control applications. Future, ETO switches under development will also pack with additional features that no-competing technologies offer, including built-in voltage, current and temperature sensing capability, control-power self-generation capability and high-voltage current saturation capability. These capabilities make ETO a very promising power semiconductor device to reduce the cost of converter-based transmission controllers while improving the controller output power, dynamic performance, and operating reliability...|$|E
40|$|A novel MOS-controlled SiC {{thyristor}} device, the SiC <b>emitter</b> <b>turn-off</b> <b>thyristor</b> (ETO) is {{a promising}} technology for future high-voltage switching applications because it integrates the excellent current conduction capability of a SiC thyristor {{with a simple}} MOS-control interface. Through unity-gain turn-off, the SiC ETO also achieves excellent Safe Operation Area (SOA) and faster switching speeds than silicon ETOs. The world's first 4. 5 -kV SiC ETO prototype shows a forward voltage drop of 4. 26 [*]V at 26. 5 [*]A/cm 2 current density at room and elevated temperatures. Tested in an inductive circuit with a 2. 5 [*]kV DC link voltage and a 9. 56 -A load current, the SiC ETO shows a fast turn-off time of 1. 63 microseconds and a low 9. 88 [*]mJ turn-off energy. The low switching loss indicates that the SiC ETO could operate at about 4 [*]kHz if 100 [*]W/cm 2 conduction and the 100 [*]W/cm 2 turn-off losses can be removed by the thermal management system. This frequency capability is about 4 times higher than 4. 5 -kV-class silicon power devices. The preliminary demonstration shows that the SiC ETO is a promising candidate for high-frequency, high-voltage power conversion applications, and additional developments to optimize the device for higher voltage (> 5 [*]kV) and higher frequency (10 [*]kHz) are needed...|$|E

50|$|The {{thyristor}} {{appeared in}} 1957. It {{is able to}} withstand very high reverse breakdown voltage and is also capable of carrying high current. However, one disadvantage of the thyristor in switching circuits is that once it becomes 'latched-on' in the conducting state; it cannot be turned off by external control, as the <b>thyristor</b> <b>turn-off</b> is passive, i.e., the power must be disconnected from the device. Thyristors which could be turned off, called gate <b>turn-off</b> <b>thyristors</b> (GTO), were introduced in 1960. These overcome some limitations of the ordinary thyristor, {{because they can be}} turned on or off with an applied signal.Due to improvements in the MOSFET technology (metal oxide semiconductor technology, initially developed to produce integrated circuits), the power MOSFET became available in the late 1970s.
