5|$|Berg's {{observation}} of {{local high school}} students while preparing to film the movie inspired his development {{of some of the}} characters. For example, Jason Street, the character whose promising football career is ended by a spinal injury in the pilot, was inspired by a local event. David Edwards, a football player from San Antonio’s Madison High, was paralyzed during a November 2003 game. Berg was at the game when this accident occurred; he was profoundly affected by Edwards' injury and how it overturned his life. Berg set up a similar <b>incident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pilot.|$|E

He also dealt with the 1976 shootings and Axe Murder <b>Incident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Korean Demilitarized Zone, and oversaw the Panama Canal Treaty in 1977.|$|E

In both of those categories, Flight 370 was surpassed 131 days later by Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, another Boeing 777-200ER, which was shot down on 17 July 2014, killing all 298 people aboard.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, McLaren lodged an {{official}} {{complaint with the}} FIA about the <b>incident.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> appeal hearing on 22 September, McLaren alleged that they had twice been advised by race director Charlie Whiting that Hamilton had correctly returned the position to Räikkönen.

5|$|Telpuk is {{a former}} nursery school teacher.

5|$|The Amina Bokhary {{controversy}} {{occurred in}} Hong Kong in 2010 involving the assault conviction {{of a wealthy}} woman from a well-connected political family. Amina Mariam Bokhary, 32, received a non-custodial sentence and a one-year driving ban following an <b>incident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of a road traffic accident when she struck several police officers. As she had committed similar offences in 2001 and 2008, her resulting probation was seen by some commentators as too lenient.|$|E
5|$|The St. Vrain {{massacre}} was an <b>incident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Black Hawk War. It occurred near present-day Pearl City, Illinois, in Kellogg's Grove, on May 24, 1832.

It is also unlikely that the group of Ho-Chunk had the sanction of their nation. Killed in the massacre were United States Indian Agent Felix St. Vrain and three of his companions. Some accounts reported that St. Vrain's body was mutilated.|$|E

5|$|The match started badly with an <b>incident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first {{minute of}} play, a tackle by Leeds striker Allan Clarke {{bringing}} down Phil Thompson who needed treatment.

Smith was booked for his challenge on Clarke and Johnny Giles also received a booking after throwing a punch at Keegan.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father {{deep in a}} forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a {{gingerbread}} house and are captured by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her to prepare the oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire of the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the <b>incident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gingerbread house has left Hansel diabetic. He needs a shot of insulin every few hours or he will get sick and die.|$|E
5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows familiarity with the exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, an <b>incident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opening up of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination of the tragic poets.|$|E

5|$|Andrea Doria saw {{no major}} action in World War I, and served {{extensively}} in Mediterranean in the 1920s and 1930s. She {{was involved in}} the suppression of rebels in Fiume and the Corfu <b>incident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s. Starting in 1937, Andrea Doria underwent an extensive modernization, which lasted until 1940. She saw relatively little action during World War II; she was tasked with escorting convoys to Libya throughout 1941 and into 1942, during which she engaged in the inconclusive First Battle of Sirte. After the Armistice in September 1943 the ship was sailed to Malta and interned by the Allies. She remained there until 1944, when she was permitted to return to Italian ports. Andrea Doria survived the war and soldiered on in the post-war navy as a training ship until 1956. Paid off in September, she was formally stricken from the naval register on 1 November and sold for scrapping later that year.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without <b>incident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first week of June 1917.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} heavy industry, the {{possibility}} of serious injury or death was an everyday risk for the mine workers of the Rhondda Valley. The most notorious form of colliery disaster was the gas explosion, caused by either a buildup of methane gas or coal dust. As the mines became deeper and ventilation become more difficult to control the risk increased. The worst single <b>incident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rhondda was the 1867 Ferndale disaster in which an explosion saw the loss of 178 lives. However, the major disasters only accounted for roughly 20% of overall fatalities, with individual accidents accounting {{for the bulk of}} deaths. The list below shows mining disasters which saw the loss of five or more lives during a single incident.|$|E
