500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{industrial}} applications of optical interferometry is as a versatile measurement tool for the high precision examination of surface topography. Popular interferometric measurement techniques include Phase Shifting Interferometry (PSI), and Vertical Scanning Interferometry(VSI), also known as scanning white light interferometry (SWLI) or by the ISO term Coherence Scanning Interferometry (CSI), CSI exploits coherence to extend the range of capabilities for <b>interference</b> <b>microscopy.</b> These techniques are widely used in micro-electronic and micro-optic fabrication. PSI uses monochromatic light and provides very precise measurements; however it is only usable for surfaces that are very smooth. CSI often uses white light and high numerical apertures, and rather than looking at the phase of the fringes, as does PSI, looks for best position of maximum fringe contrast or some other feature of the overall fringe pattern. [...] In its simplest form, CSI provides less precise measurements than PSI but can be used on rough surfaces. Some configurations of CSI, variously known as Enhanced VSI (EVSI), high-resolution SWLI or Frequency Domain Analysis (FDA), use coherence effects in combination with interference phase to enhance precision.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the candid photography {{for which he is}} best known, Vishniac worked heavily in the field of photomicroscopy, (specifically <b>interference</b> <b>microscopy</b> and cinemicroscopy). He specialized in photographing living insects and had a talent for arranging the moving specimens in [...] "just the right poses", according to Philippe Halsman, former president of the American Society of Magazine Photographers. On the subject of Vishniac's skill in photomicroscopy, Halsman said he was, [...] "a special kind of genius". He worked with all sorts of specimens, from protozoa, to fireflies to amino acids. Vishniac's work in photomicroscopy was, and is, highly regarded in the field. For three consecutive years, beginning in 1952, he won the Best-of-the-Show Award of the Biological Photographic Association in New York.|$|E

40|$|Cell {{motility}} plays {{a critical}} role in numerous physiological processes such as embryonic development and tissue morphogenesis as well as in pathological processes such as wound healing, tumor invasion and inflammation. Migration of the cell involves remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and formation / disassembly of focal adhesion sites.

Compared to other <b>microscopy</b> techniques, <b>interference</b> reflection <b>microscopy</b> enables visualization of focal adhesion sites without overexpression of fluorescent proteins, which might alter focal adhesion dynamics.
