Stress relaxation in hydrated gluten, its protein fractions and varying percentage mixtures {{of the components}} were investigated by means of rheometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Stress relaxation was carried out {{over a period of}} 30 min at 20 °C for all samples under investigation. Samples exhibited relaxation modulus G(t) ranging from 1 to about 1000 Pa with the gliadin fraction showing almost full decay. MATLAB with the combination of regularization algorithms were used to generate L-curves and calculate the relaxation spectra of the samples. Stress relaxation spectra identified five dominant relaxation modes with baseline resolution. Stress relaxation is somewhat independent of compositional differences, although, confocal microscopy showed the influence of protein composition on the morphology of the networks. Therefore, morphology and relaxation dynamics seem to be controlled by independent mechanisms for <b>gluten</b> <b>networks.</b> These findings provide a fundamental understanding of gluten dynamics and may allow controlling the industrial performance of flours and engineering novel dough formulations...|$|R

This approach revealed a continuous relaxation with absence of plateau modulus, typical of polydisperse materials of low molecular weight. Calculation of stress relaxation spectra identified three relaxation regimes. Stress relaxation is independent of compositional differences, although, confocal microscopy showed the influence of protein composition on the morphology of the networks. Utilization of concepts from macromolecular dynamics and poroelasticity allowed a first insight to the mechanisms of relaxation. Reptation of chains in combination with water migration from the pores of the network seems to play major role in the relaxation mechanisms.

The experimental protocol documented the absence of a well-defined glass transition region in terms of overall spectrum shape and temperature band.

Furthermore, calorimetrically observed relaxation mechanisms do not correlate in the temperature domain with mechanical functions, an outcome that argues that there is no direct link between the mechanical stability and calorimetrically recorded molecular processes. In the absence of a distinct glass transition region, it is proposed that ice melting could be considered as the sole valid indicator of molecular mobility and quality control for frozen hydrated gluten.

50|$|Glutenin and gliadin are {{functional}} proteins {{found in}} wheat bread {{that contribute to}} the structure of bread. Glutenin forms interconnected gluten networks within bread through interchain disulfide bonds. Gliadin binds weakly to the <b>gluten</b> <b>network</b> established by glutenin via intrachain disulfide bonds. Structurally, bread can be defined as an elastic-plastic foam. The glutenin protein contributes to its elastic nature, as it is able to regain its initial shape after deformation. The gliadin protein contributes to its plastic nature, because it demonstrates non-reversible structural change after a certain amount of applied force. Because air pockets within this <b>gluten</b> <b>network</b> result from carbon dioxide production during leavening, bread can be defined as a foam, or a gas-in-solid solution.|$|E

40|$|Wheat bran is {{a source}} of dietary fiber. It can {{decrease}} the risk of developing health problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. But it also raises concern because it chelates essential multivalent metal ions. Wheat bran particles can dilute gluten, which causes mechanical damage to <b>gluten</b> <b>networks</b> in dough. This study tested the effects of three wheat bran treatments: soaking, water hydrothermal and buffer hydrothermal processes at temperatures of 20, 45, and 55 ْ C, respectively, on physicochemical properties of bran in two different particles size (coarse and fine). Results showed that evaluations for bran tested under different treatments (soaking, water hydrothermal and buffer hydrothermal) caused reductions of phytic acid of 31, 50 and 80 %, respectively and calcium content (12, 32 and 50 %, respectively), iron (11, 27 and 50 %, respectively) and zinc (5, 12 and 30 %, respectively); fiber content was increased (24. 5, 20, 35 %, respectively). Digital image analysis showed bran size reduction from 4. 83 mm 2 to 0. 097 mm 2. Whole wheat dough containing fine bran (0. 097 mm 2) treated with hydrothermal buffer indicated less phytate content; higher development time and better valorimetric value did than other treatments...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of water content on the relaxation dynamics of mesoporous <b>gluten</b> <b>networks</b> has been explored {{in a wide}} range of temperatures. The systems were investigated in the linear viscoelastic region by means of stress relaxation, creep and numerical analysis of data. Time-temperature superposition principle and sticky reptation dynamics have been used to provide molecular interpretation of gluten relaxation. Overall, hydration influences relaxation behaviour of the system, which can be linked to changes in the secondary structure of gluten proteins with increase in water content. Relaxation spectra calculated with Tikhonov regularization revealed the remarkable {{influence of}} water on the long times relaxation processes of the material. Creep measurements and extraction of dynamic data with direct conversion of creep data via Laplace transform augmented the experimental timeframe of observations to low frequencies unattainable by standard frequency sweeps. The predominance of loss modulus at long times is attributed to migration of water within the nanopores of the structure. Samples also exhibit self-similar relaxation a characteristic of systems existing at a critical state. Two relaxation mechanisms can be distinguished: one arising from viscoelastic relaxation of protein chains and an additional stemming from poroelastic relaxation owing to migration of water in the system...|$|R
40|$|To dissect {{the most}} {{important}} determinant of wheat bread-making quality, gluten protein-types from 128 flours of organically grown German wheat varieties Bussard and Orestis were investigated by quantitative HPLC and SDS-PAGE procedures using protein standards. Both varieties exhibit great differences in gluten strength (> 34 %) at two locations and between two years determined by SDS-sedimentation volume (SDS-SV), a measure of bread-making quality. Unexpectedly, {{the results showed that}} neither concentrations of gliadin, gluten, HMW-glutenin or glutenin could explain the observed variation in SDS-SV even if protein concentrations were equal. In the case of glutenin this was found to be due to a low glutenin recovery resulting from a partial insolubility of glutenin in propanol (protein recoveries from 78 % to 95 %). Further investigations under the conditions of a complete glutenin extraction led to the identification and characterization of glutenin macropolymer (GMP) which affected the bread-making quality of wheat significantly. This effect was associated with higher molecular weights of GMP which may cause growing <b>gluten</b> <b>networks</b> compared to simple glutenin. Moreover, it was finally shown that quantitatively the concentrations of GMP (mg/ 100 mg flour) were independent of protein concentrations. Our results demonstrate that, for the flour samples used, the flour GMP concentration is a key determinant, and together with the SDS-SV a reliable tool for bread-making quality prediction...|$|R
5000|$|The {{physical}} {{structure of the}} doughnut is created by the combination of flour, leavening agent, sugar, eggs, salt, water, shortening, milk solids, and additional components. The most important ingredients for creating the dough network are the flour and eggs. The main protein in flour is gluten, which is overall responsible for creating elastic dough because this protein acts as “coiled springs.” The <b>gluten</b> <b>network</b> is composed of two separate molecules named glutenin and gliadin. Specifically, [...] "the backbone of the <b>gluten</b> <b>network</b> likely consists of the largest glutenin molecules, or subunits, aligned and tightly linked to one another. These tightly linked glutenin subunits associate more loosely, along with gliadin, into larger gluten aggregates." [...] The gluten strands than tangle and interact with other strands and other molecules, resulting in networks that provide the elasticity of the dough.

50|$|Water {{migration}} {{influences the}} quality of stored croissants through two mechanisms. First, as previously stated, water redistributes from gluten to starch {{as a result of}} starch retrogradation. Secondly, during the baking process, a moisture gradient was introduced as a result of heat transfer from the oven to the croissant. In fresh croissants, there is high moisture content on the inside and low moisture content on the outside. During storage, this moisture gradient induces water migration from the inside to the outer crust. On a molecular level, water is lost from the amorphous starch fraction and <b>gluten</b> <b>network.</b> At the same time, water diffuses from the outer crust to the environment, which has less moisture. The result of this redistribution of water is a firming up of the croissant, caused by a decrease in starch plasticity and an increase in <b>gluten</b> <b>network</b> rigidity. Due to the presence of large pores in croissants, moisture is lost to the environment at a faster rate than bread products. As such, croissants generally become harder in texture at a faster rate than breads.|$|E
40|$|Sponge cakes have {{traditionally}} been manufactured using multistage mixing methods to enhance potential foam formation by the eggs. Today, use of all-in (single-stage) mixing methods is superseding multistage methods for large-scale batter preparation to reduce costs and production time. In this study, multistage and all-in mixing procedures and three final high-speed mixing times (3, 5, and 15 min) for sponge cake production were tested to optimize a mixing method for pilot-scale research. Mixing for 3 min produced batters with higher relative density values than did longer mixing times. These batters generated well-aerated cakes with high volume and low hardness. In contrast, after 5 and 15 min of high-speed mixing, batters with lower relative density and higher viscosity values were produced. Although higher bubble incorporation and retention were observed, longer mixing times produced better developed <b>gluten</b> <b>networks,</b> which stiffened the batters and inhibited bubble expansion during mixing. As a result, these batters did not expand properly and produced cakes with low volume, dense crumb, and high hardness values. Results for all-in mixing {{were similar to those}} for the multistage mixing procedure in terms of the physical properties of batters and cakes (i. e., relative density, elastic moduli, volume, total cell area, hardness, etc.). These results suggest the all-in mixing procedure with a final high-speed mixing time of 3 min is an appropriate mixing method for pilot-scale sponge cake production. The advantages of this method are reduced energy costs and production time...|$|R
40|$|Wheat gluten {{proteins}} {{are among}} the most complex protein networks in nature, due in particular to their poor solubility in water and to their viscoelastic behavior. <b>Gluten</b> <b>networks</b> are often considered as transient networks comprising extensible biopolymer segments of flexible or semiflexible chains between junction points. However, the exact structure of the network, the nature of the junction points and the way it get structured under shear remain to be clarified. Here we report the visco-elastic behavior of model systems composed of gluten proteins near gelation. We build model systems by dispersing in ethanol-water mixtures two major protein groups, gliadins and glutenins, that we have purified from gluten. Rheological properties show a slow evolution over time scales of the order of days of the linear frequency dependence complex modulus of the samples, with a concentration-dependent liquid to solid transition. Interestingly, we find that all data acquired at different protein concentrations and different times after sample preparation can be scaled onto a master curve showing a cross-over from a soft solid behavior at low frequency to a visco-elastic fluid at high frequency. Rheological data are completed by scattering experiments in order to elucidate the complex structure of the materials. For gel samples, the scattering profiles display at small length scales features typical of polymer and evidences at larger length scale a fractal structure that we interpret as being due to the highly disordered state of the junction points. Biochemical assays are also performed to elucidate the origin of the sample aging...|$|R
30|$|Transglutaminase (TG) catalyzes acyl-transfer reactions, {{creating}} inter- and intra-molecular cross-links between lysine residues and glutamines residues, {{forming the}} so-called e(c-glutamyl)-lysine isopeptide bonds [101].

The investigation for effects of TG on quality of buckwheat noodle showed that, addition of TG significantly decreased the water absorption and cooking loss of noodles, increased the hardness and tensile force. When adding 0.01 % TG, the lowest cooking loss of buckwheat noodle was observed [103]. Bellido et al. [102] investigated the effects of TG on the protein composition, mechanical properties and microstructure of yellow alkaline noodles. The results indicated that, in the presence of TG, the unextractable glutenin was greater than 225 – 300 % over that of corresponding flour from three different varieties. Comparison of the mechanical properties of YAN formulated with and without TG showed that the firmness and elastic-like behavior of the noodle increased with the TG supplementation.|$|R
50|$|Starch plays a {{major role}} in the {{degradation}} of croissants during storage. Amylopectin retrogradation occurs over several days to weeks, as amorphous amylopectin chains are realigned into a more crystalline structure. The transformation of the starch causes undesirable firmness in the croissant. Additionally, the formation of the crystal structure of amylopectin requires the incorporation of water. Starch retrogradation actively draws water from the amorphous <b>gluten</b> <b>network</b> and some of the amorphous starch fraction, which reduces the plasticity of both.|$|E

Despite its high protein content, durum is not a strong wheat in the sense of giving strength to dough through the formation of a <b>gluten</b> <b>network.</b> Durum contains 27% extractable, wet gluten, about 3% higher than in common wheat (T. aestivum L.).|$|E
40|$|The role of gluten {{proteins}} during lamination and fermentation of multi-layered {{wheat flour}} pastry dough was examined by including oxidizing or reducing {{agents in the}} recipe to respectively strengthen or weaken the <b>gluten</b> protein <b>network.</b> Pastry burst rig textural measurements showed that dough strength increases during lamination up to 16 fat layers. However, further lamination up to 64 and 128 fat layers decreases the dough strength, most likely due to destruction of layer integrity. Redox agents strongly affect dough strength. Furthermore, fermentation and spread tests showed that they strongly influence elastic recoil immediately after lamination and during relaxation. Moreover, elastic recoil consistently occurs {{to a greater extent}} in the final direction of sheeting. None of the observed changes in dough strength and relaxation behaviour could be linked to changes in the levels of protein extractable in sodium dodecyl sulfate containing medium (SDS-EP). This suggests that changes occur preferentially either within the SDS-extractable or within the non-SDS-EP fraction and that they do not render non-extractable protein fractions extractable or vice versa. Furthermore, elastic recoil is most likely caused by reformation of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. status: accepte...|$|R

Composite flour of whole grain oat flour, wheat flour, and tapioca starch in the ratio 1 : 1 : 0. 16 was formulated to make oat noodles {{with the addition of}} gluten at various levels. The influence of gluten on pasting and gelling properties of composite flour, and on cooking, textural, and sensory properties of salted oat noodles was evaluated. Addition of gluten decreased the paste viscosity, reduced hardness and springiness of gel, reduced cooking yield, cooking loss, and broken ratio during cooking, and increased the tensile strength and firmness of cooked noodles. Scanning electron microscopy showed that <b>gluten</b> tightened the <b>network</b> of protein in the noodles by forming oriented fibrils.

50|$|In {{laminated}} croissant dough, the <b>gluten</b> <b>network</b> is not continuous. Instead, the gluten proteins {{are separated}} as thin gluten films between dough layers. The formation of thin, well-defined layers affects {{the height of}} dough lift. Generally, laminated croissant dough contains less layers than other puff pastry doughs that do not contain yeast, due {{to the presence of}} small bubbles in the gluten sheets. Upon proofing, these bubbles expand and destroy the integrity of the dough layers. The resulting interconnections between different dough layers would over-increase dough strength and allow water vapor to escape through micropores during baking, consequently decreasing dough lift.

50|$|Starch {{undergoes}} gelatinization as {{a result}} of baking. Prior to baking, starch granules absorb a small amount of water at room temperature as it is mixed with water to form predough. As long as the dough’s temperature stays under the gelatinization temperature, this granule swelling is limited and reversible. However, once the baking process begins and the dough is exposed to temperatures above the gelatinization temperature, amylopectin crystallites become more disordered inside the starch granules and cause an irreversible destruction of molecular order. At the same time, starch gelatinization actively draws water from the <b>gluten</b> <b>network,</b> further decreasing the flexibility of the gluten. Currently, the extent of amylose leaching and granular structure distortion during the baking of croissants is still unknown.|$|E

This forms the highly structured protein <b>network</b> (<b>gluten)</b> that determines the viscoelastic properties of the flour which affect its end-uses 1, 2, 3. The storage protein bonding, folding, assortment and deposition processes in the endosperm imply significant roles for ER-localised chaperones and ‘foldase’ enzymes, and three groups of proteins are likely involved: the enzymes protein disulphide isomerases (PDI), peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), and the Binding Protein (BiP) /heat shock protein (Hsp 70) chaperones 4, 5. The cyclophilins (CyPs), belonging to PPIase class, are of particular interest as preliminary evidence shows their involvement in seed storage protein processes 6, 7. The ER-localised Cyps (commonly called CypB) are of particular relevance due to the storage protein folding and assortment processes for both transport pathways initiating and/or occurring in the ER.

40|$|Shear oscillatory and {{uniaxial}} elongational {{tests performed}} at 30 C {{were used to}} simulate gluten-free dough proving; shear oscillatory temperature ramp (30 – 90 C) was used to simulate baking. In test simulating initial stages of proving the differences in wheat and gluten-free dough (amaranth, buckwheat, chickpea, corn, quinoa, millet and rice) behavior were most evident from the higher values of elastic (105 Pa) and viscous moduli (104 Pa) of gluten-free doughs compared with the values of elastic (104 Pa) and viscous moduli (103 Pa) of wheat dough. During later stages of proving, the region of elastic, time-dependent viscoelastic and viscous deformations of gluten-free doughs were very narrow, and moreover varied among the investigated gluten-free doughs. The stress required for dough rupture also differed among the tested gluten-free doughs. While rice, quinoa and millet dough ruptured under the stress of 10. 6 kPa, 9. 5 kPa and 9. 2 kPa, respectively, significantly the lower stresses were required to rupture chickpea (4. 9 kPa), amaranth (4. 7 kPa), buckwheat (4. 0 kPa) and corn (3. 2 kPa) dough. Hencky strains {{at the moment of}} gluten-free doughs rupture were, however, quite similar (0. 6 – 0. 7). During oscillatory test simulating baking, complex viscosity of gluten-free doughs was up to 2 – 3 log cycles higher than the viscosity of wheat dough. Practical Applications: The results confirmed known significant differences between the behavior of gluten-free and wheat doughs, which occurred during proving as well as baking. Compared with wheat <b>gluten</b> proteins, <b>network</b> in gluten-free doughs exhibited high values of elastic and viscous moduli, narrow region of elastic, time-dependent viscoelastic and viscous deformations, as well as high peak complex viscosity during heating. This behavior indicated lower gluten-free dough ability to increase the gas-dough interface area and to accumulate leavening gas in pores, which may decrease the bread-making quality of gluten-free doughs. Moreover, the differences in the behavior among gluten-free doughs were described. It can be assumed the differences are in close relationship with the characteristics of arabinoxylan networks.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to design and develop anti-hyperglycemic {{functional}} foods containing phenolic carbohydrate absorption modulator. Physical, chemical, structural and digestive aspects of the reactions of carbohydrates in the presence of phenolic extracts of traditional Chinese medicines were investigated. Water extracts of 14 traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) plants with reputation of usefulness in treating diabetes were examined for total phenolic contents, antioxidant activities and α-amylase inhibitory activities through in vitro assays. A positive and significant linear relationship between total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity was found (R 2 = 0. 99), indicating that the phenolic compounds are the major antioxidant components in the tested materials. Extract of Chinese galls from Rhus chinensis exhibited highest total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity and α-amylase inhibitory activities. The results of this study demonstrate that the extract of Rhus chinensis would be the most effective carbohydrate modulator among the samples tested. Swelling, pasting and thermal properties of wheat and potato starch were studied in the presence of aqueous extract of Galla chinensis (GAC), also known as Chinese galls. The swelling factor was reduced in both starches after GAC extract addition. The extract increased peak viscosity and cold paste viscosity of wheat starch, but decreased those of potato starch. Increased breakdown has shown for wheat starch, but that for potato starch decreased. GAC extract also delayed gelatinization of both starches with higher onset temperature (To). The results of this study demonstrated that GAC extract supplementation can alter the physicochemical properties of wheat and potato starch. To examine the potential application of Galla chinensis (GAC) extract supplementation in Asian white salted noodles, the effects of various GAC extract addition levels on microstructure and in vitro starch digestibility of noodles were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the <b>gluten</b> protein <b>network</b> was improved (more compact and smooth) by GAC extract in both raw and cooked noodles. The estimated glycemic index (GI) was significantly decreased from 100 to 90. 6 after 0. 5 % GAC extract was added.

50|$|Water is a {{necessary}} ingredient {{in the production of}} doughnuts because it activates the other ingredients, allowing them to perform their functions in building the doughnut's structure. For example, sugar and salt crystals must be dissolved {{in order for them to}} act in the dough, whereas larger molecules, such as the starches or proteins, must be hydrated in order for them to absorb moisture. Another important consideration of water is its degree of hardness, which measures the amount of impurities in the water source. Pure water consists of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen, but water used in baking often is not pure. Baker’s salt (NaCl) is usually used as an ingredient due to its high purity, whereas the salts in water are derived from varying minerals. As an ingredient, “salt is added to enhance the flavour of cakes and breads and to ‘toughen up’ the soft mixture of fat and sugar.” If relatively soft water is being used, more salt should be added in order to strengthen the <b>gluten</b> <b>network</b> of the dough, but if not enough salt is added during the baking process, the flavor of the bread will not be appealing to consumers.|$|E
5000|$|Durum {{flour and}} {{semolina}} {{are good for}} making pasta {{because it does not}} create doughs hard to shape, e.g. into sheets. Technically, the dough is relatively plastic, contrasting with the strong elastic doughs obtained from bread flours. The French language differentiates strength (force) from hardness (dureté), resolving a contradiction present in English language presentations: durum is rich in gluten but that is not readily available as the endosperm is hard to break to release that gluten. Durum wheat is thus less used in breadmaking. Its protein content is almost as high as that of hard spring or winter wheat and so is its gluten content, necessary for bread to rise. Although 100 percent durum wheat breads do exist (such as pagnotte di Enna or [...] "rimacinato" [...] bread from Sicily, as well as Altamura bread from Apulia and Matera bread from Basilicata) in most instances bread doughs contain only a portion of durum wheat and are supplemented substantially with commercial white flours, often those higher in gluten necessary to offset the poor contribution of durum flour to the <b>gluten</b> <b>network.</b> Pure durum wheat breads are often dense, containing little air bubbles, with relatively little elastic structure (continuum).

In organic farming, {{there seems to be a}} stronger interaction between genotype and environment on the gluten properties and the baking properties, due to the restricted nutrient availability. Therefore, the influence of environmental factors, and especially the influence of fertilisation in organic farming must be investigated in order to grow organic bread wheat with good quality. The importance o the wheat gluten is due to its unique viscoelastic properties. Rheological characterisation of the <b>gluten</b> protein <b>network</b> is essential to explain differences due to genotype and/or environmental factors. The dynamic rheological parameters (G', G", and d) differ between cultivars with good and poor bread making quality. Differences in rheological parameters are mainly related to the ratio between the gliadins and glutenins (Khatkar et al., 1995, 2002). As some environmental factors influence this ratio, fundamental rheological testing may be valid for the testing of the influence of environmental factors on the gluten properties. Experiments At The Askov Long-term Experiments on Animal Manure and Mineral Fertilizer, an organic farming workshop was established in 1996 with the aim to study the influence of the nutrients. Three nutrients levels are compared with unmanured treatments. The spring wheat cultivar Vinjett was grown with application of two organic manures, slurry (GY) and liquid manure (FG), in three N-levels (0, 75, and 150 kg N/Ha). Additionally, FG was added at 225 kg N/Ha. Wheat grain was milled, and the gluten was isolated using a Glutomatic 2100 (ICC standard 137). The gluten was measured in oscillation in a frequency range of 0. 05 Hz to 20 Hz. The stress amplitude was 100 Pa. Results Frequency sweeps from two samples are shown in Figure 1. In the gluten elastic behaviour is dominating. The modulus G' and G" increased for increasing frequency. The slope (log G'/log w) was slightly different for the two samples, 0. 20 for the sample with no manure added, and 0. 22 with liquid manure (75 kg N/Ha). However, the phase angle d increased with increasing frequency up to 20 Hz. Increasing levels of N increased the gluten content of the flour (Fig. 2.). Application of liquid manure resulted in higher gluten contents at all N-levels. The viscoelastic behaviour of gluten in relation to type of manure and level of N is shown in Figure 3. The modulus seemed to be influenced by the type of manure, and by the level of N. There was a small increase in G' and G" when N-level was increased from 0 to 75 kg N/Ha for liquid manure (FG), and similar for the slurry (GY) between 75 and 150 kg N/Ha. N-levels beyond these values decreased G' and G". At the lowest N-level (75 kg N/Ha), there was a difference in G' and G" between the two types of manure. The N-level had no effect on d for the slurry, whereas a slightly increase in d was observed for the liquid manure. These results indicate, that the type and level of manure have an impact on the amount of gluten protein and the viscoelastic properties of gluten. The variability in the moduli in relation to N-management is probably explained by differences in the protein composition, and mainly the ratio gliadins/glutenins (Khatkar et. al., 1995, 2002) Conclusions Oscillatory measurements of gluten from one wheat cultivar with different application of manures indicated that type of manure, and the level of N influenced the viscoelastic properties of gluten. Thus, measurements of G', G" and d may be valid in the studies of the influence of growth conditions on the baking quality of wheat. References Daniel, C. and Triboi, E. 2000.

In non starch polysaccharides, such as arabinoxylans (AX), laccase catalyzes the oxidative gelation of feruloylated arabinoxylans by dimerization of their ferulic esters. These cross links have been found to greatly increased the maximum resistance and decreased extensibility of the dough. The resistance was increased due to the crosslinking of AX via ferulic acid and resulting in a strong AX and <b>gluten</b> <b>network.</b> Although laccase is known to cross link AX, under the microscope {{it was found that the}} laccase also acted on the flour proteins. Oxidation of the ferulic acid on AX to form ferulic acid radicals increased the oxidation rate of free SH groups on the gluten proteins and thus influenced the formation of S-S bonds between gluten polymers. Laccase is also able to oxidize peptide bound tyrosine, but very poorly. Because of the increased strength of the dough, it showed irregular bubble formation during proofing. This was a result of the gas (carbon dioxide) becoming trapped within the crust and could not diffuse out (like it would have normally) and causing abnormal pore size. Resistance and extensibility was a function of dosage, but at very high dosage the dough showed contradictory results: maximum resistance was reduced drastically. The high dosage may have caused extreme changes in structure of dough, resulting in incomplete gluten formation. Another reason is that it may mimic overmixing, causing negative effects on gluten structure. Laccase treated dough had low stability over prolonged storage. The dough became softer and this is related to laccase mediation. The laccase mediated radical mechanism creates secondary reactions of FA-dervived radicals that result in breaking of covalent linkages in AX and weakening of the AX gel.|$|E

Egg solids, chiefly the egg white solids {{combined with the}} moisture in the egg, are considered structure-forming materials that help significantly to produce proper volume, grain, and texture.” The egg yolk contributes proteins, fats, and emulsifiers to the dough. Emulsifying agents are essential to doughnut formation because they prevent the fat molecules from separating from the water molecules in the dough. The main emulsifier in egg yolk is called lecithin, which is a phospholipid. “The fatty acids are attracted to fats and oils (lipids) in food, while the phosphate group is attracted to water. It is this ability to attract both lipids and water that allow phospholipids such as lecithin to act as emulsifiers.” The proteins from both the egg yolk and the egg whites contribute {{to the structure of}} the dough through a process called coagulation. When heat is applied to the dough, the egg proteins will begin to unfold, or denature, and then form new bonds with one another, thus creating a gel-like network that can hold water and gas.Shortening is responsible for providing tenderness and aerating the dough. In terms of its molecular structure, “a typical shortening that appears solid room temperature contains 15-20% solids and, hence, 80-85% liquid oil…this small amount of solids can be made to hold all of the liquid in a matrix of very small, stable, needlelike crystals (beta-prime crystals).” This crystalline structure is considered highly stable due to how tightly its molecules are packed. The sugar used in baking is essentially sucrose, and besides imparting sweetness in the doughnut, sugar also functions in the color and tenderness of the final product. Sucrose is a simple carbohydrate whose structure is made up of a glucose molecule bound to a fructose molecule. Milk is utilized in the making of doughnuts, but in large scale bakeries, one form of milk used is nonfat dry milk solids. These solids are obtained by removing most of the water from skim milk with heat, and this heat additionally denatures the whey proteins and increases the absorption properties of the remaining proteins. The ability of the casein and whey proteins to absorb excess water is essential to prolonging the doughnut's freshness. The major whey protein in the nonfat milk solids is known as beta-lactoglobulin, and a crucial feature of its structure is that there exists a single sulfhydryl group that is protected by the alpha helix, and when heating of the milk solids occurs, these groups participate in disulfide exchanges with other molecules. This interchange prevents the renaturation of the whey proteins. [...] If the crosslinking of the sulfide groups does not occur, the whey proteins can rebond and weaken the <b>gluten</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E
