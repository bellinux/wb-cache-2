She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two children because they would interfere with her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>family.</b> Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process that would have given Tom his freedom.|$|E

5|$|Freeborn Roman {{women were}} {{considered}} citizens throughout the Republic and Empire, {{but did not}} vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, {{as indicated by the}} phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos ("children born of two Roman citizens"). A Roman woman kept <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> name (nomen) for life. Children most often took the father's name, but in the Imperial period sometimes made their mother's name part of theirs, or even used it instead.|$|E

In 1978, Lynn Johnston, living in Lynn Lake, Manitoba, began For Better or For Worse, which was noted for {{following}} {{the lives of the}} Patterson family as they grew older in real time, and dealt with real-life issues.

25|$|The {{poems of}} Isabella were {{discovered}} when the authorities entered her estate {{to investigate the}} murder. There are ten sonnets and three poems, which were published posthumously. She {{has been associated with}} the 1500s literary movement known as Petrarchism, a revival of Petrarch's model launched by Pietro Bembo. Although her form, vocabulary and phrases follow the Petrarchist fashion of the period, she is distinguished by her dramatic tone, demonstrated by medieval poets such as Dante Alighieri and Jacopone da Todi. Her poetry is very personal, influenced by <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> condition and forced isolation; she wrote on impulse in order to vent her frustration, without any literary adornment or formal elegance.|$|E
25|$|In Mother Küsters Goes to Heaven (Mutter Küsters Fahrt zum Himmel), a melodrama, Emma Küsters {{becomes the}} center of media and {{political}} attention after her husband, a factory worker, killed his supervisor or his supervisor's son and then himself when lay offs were announced. The film drew on both Sirk's melodramas and Weimar era workers' films, connecting the genres to tell a political coming of age story about Mother Küsters, who seeks to understand what led to her husband's actions and how to respond. The film is very critical of the era's politics and media, as the people to whom Emma Küsters turns all exploit her and her experience. The media, communists, anarchists and even <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> members all take advantage of Mother Küsters's tragedy to advance their own agendas.|$|E
50|$|A {{year after}} {{arriving}} in Berlin, Reuveny realized {{that the story of}} the past the city made her want to tell would have to be <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>familys</b> story.

25|$|After Jefferson died on July 4, 1826, {{his only}} {{official}} surviving daughter, Martha Jefferson Randolph, inherited Monticello. The estate was encumbered with debt and Martha Randolph had financial problems in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> {{because of her}} husband's mental illness. In 1831 she sold Monticello to James Turner Barclay, a local apothecary. Barclay sold it in 1834 to Uriah P. Levy, the first Jewish Commodore (equivalent to today's admiral) in the United States Navy. A fifth-generation American whose family first settled in Savannah, Georgia, Levy greatly admired Jefferson and used his private funds to repair, restore and preserve the house. The Confederate government seized the house as enemy property {{at the outset of}} the American Civil War and sold it to Confederate officer Benjamin Franklin Ficklin. Levy's estate recovered the property after the war.|$|E
25|$|Joan was {{the widow}} of Robert de Harley of Willey and had a {{daughter}} and heiress, Alice, who married Sir Hamo Peshall or Hamon Peshale. Joan brought a range of properties, acquired from <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> and her first husband, which must have greatly increased Darras's comfort and security while she was alive. She had {{a considerable amount of}} jointure property from her first marriage – in Shropshire at Harley, Gretton, Willey and Kenley, and in Worcestershire part of a manor at Hampton Lovett, known as Over Hall. Some of theses properties passed to Roger Willey, a relative of Sir Robert Harley, in 1400, presumably on Joan's death: Willey was a business associate of Darras. The Hampton Lovett property, however, was destined for Alice, Joan and Robert Harley's daughter, who married Sir Hamo Peshall.|$|E
25|$|Family, or lack thereof, remains {{important}} throughout both Hilde's {{childhood and}} adulthood. Hilde's childhood is laden with abuse and patriarchal superiority. This {{is represented by}} her father's harmful actions and her mother's unwillingness to ask her brothers to do housework. In the ideal fascist society the family unit mimicked the hierarchical structure of the state. In Hilde's case, the state was stronger and more stable than <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> unit. This is evident at {{the climax of the}} novel, when she is having an inner struggle about choosing to do what was right by Germany's standards or by Hannes' standards. In the end she chose Germany's — her family life was too weak and dysfunctional {{to stand up to the}} beliefs instilled by the state and the only morals she was aware of were state-taught.|$|E
50|$|During {{the same}} year, the Hen Coop {{received}} three readers' letters seeking personal advice. Manning suggested a new column exclusively devoted to personal advice.
