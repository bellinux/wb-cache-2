40|$|Lost circulation, {{which is}} the loss of well {{drilling}} fluids to the formation while drilling, is a common problem encountered while drilling geothermal wells. The rapid detection of the loss of well drilling fluids is critical to the successful and cost-effective treatment of the wellbore to stop or minimize lost circulation. Sandia National Laboratories has developed an instrument to accurately measure the outflow rate of drilling fluids while drilling. This instrument, the <b>Rolling</b> <b>Float</b> Meter, has been under development at Sandia since 1991 and is now available for utilization by interested industry users. This report documents recent <b>Rolling</b> <b>Float</b> Meter design upgrades resulting from field testing and industry input, the effects of ongoing testing and evaluation both in the laboratory and in the field, and the final design package that is available to transfer this technology to industry users...|$|R
6000|$|This may be {{the reason}} why, as we {{observed}} during our short stay here, several mornings after it had blown something hard in the night, the sands were covered with country people running to and fro {{to see if the}} sea had cast up anything of value. This the seamen call [...] "going a-shoring;" [...] and it seems they do often find good purchase. Sometimes also dead bodies are cast up here, the consequence of shipwrecks among those fatal rocks and islands; as also broken pieces of ships, casks, chests, and almost everything that will <b>float</b> or <b>roll</b> on shore by the surges of the sea.|$|R

The practical problems of the Normandy Landings were solved by Royal Navy researchers, who built floating concrete caissons (Mulberries) and <b>floating</b> pontoons (Swiss <b>Roll)</b> along which trucks could drive from ship to shore, as described in Gerald Pawle's book The Secret War (1957).|$|R
30|$|The {{expected}} maximum rotations for the {{pontoon bridge}} in Seattle, WA, USA, are 2.2 ° in pitch and 1.1 ° in yaw [8]. The estimated roll demand on the CESuRa system is small, because, when the <b>floating</b> span <b>rolls,</b> {{most of the}} rotation is manifested in the twisting of the transition span structure. The CESuRa track bridge rests on the transition span {{at a distance of}} approximately L from the bridge joint, as shown in Fig.  9, so the roll rotation that it needs to accommodate is only approximately θroll*L/Lts, where Lts is the length of the transition span, 2 L is the length of the track bridge and θroll is the roll rotation of the floating span. In practice, L[*]≪[*]Lts, so the roll demand on the CESuRa system is small compared with the pitch demand.|$|R

5000|$|In 1934, the {{leadership}} of the Spetzmashtrest lent its attention to improving the conditions in the factories at which the tanks were produced. They purchased foreign equipment for two new wings of the No. 37 Factory, as well as increasing the number of workers and engineering/ technical personnel. These measures, however, did not improve the situation; the number of assembled tanks was significantly lower than planned. The Office of Motorization and Mechanization of the Red Army noted the insufficiency of the technical and general management at the No. 37 plant, and a lack of planning during the production process and [...] "storming through" [...] the operation. As a result, mid 1934 was marked by a change in leadership of the plant, and only {{towards the end of the}} year there had been a positive trend in the manufacturing process. Also, in 1934, slight changes were made to the T-37A design: the thickness of the sides and the front were increased to 10 mm, the curved stern piece hulls were replaced with stamped ones, and the over-track <b>floats</b> were <b>rolled</b> back and stuffed with cork, and they have become empty on the inside.|$|R

All of the coating described in these articles was applied by a knife over blanket technique. In the work described herein, other application techniques were used, including <b>floating</b> knife, re-verse <b>roll,</b> and transfer coating. Tearing strengths were measured, and pene-tration studied by the stereo technique described previously. High tearing strengths could be obtained {{by all of the}} coating techniques, but no simple relationship existed between tearing strength and degree of penetration. Certain of the techniques created a porosity in the penetrated coating which is believed to be responsible for the high tearing strengths obtained...|$|R

In all more than 70 drivers in 6 different variants of passenger cars had been making a total of about 2500 lane changes and 500 tests on secondary roads. Objective data were measured during the tests, and the drivers' subjective impressions were recorded as well. Objective characteristics were then defined and correlated with the subjective impressions. Of all the objective characteristics identified, the following had the biggest effect on the drivers' subjective impressions: (a) Delay between steering wheel angle and yaw velocity; (b) delay between steering wheel angle and transverse velocity; (c) <b>Floating</b> angle; (d) <b>roll</b> velocity. The correlation was most pronounced for professional test drivers. The data presented here provide a host of information on the interdependences between drivers' actions, drivers' sensations, vehicle response, road characteristics and driver characteristics that could not be fully analyzed in the earlier publicationSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 4481 (161) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekDEGerman...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this D-extended essay {{has been carried out}} as part of the project “Linguistics in the Midnight Sun” at the Department of Languages and Culture, Luleå University of Technology. The aim of this essay was to investigate into the use of verbs of motion in emotion metaphors. The sixteen verbs studied are: climb, crawl, dive, float, fly, go, hop, jump, leap, plunge, roll, run, stagger, swim, tiptoe and walk. Verbs of motion are used because they are essential for the construal of the emotion following the human tradition of expressing the abstract, the emotion, in terms of the concrete, the motion. Furthermore, verbs of motion are often used because the behavioural response to emotional impact is used as source domain for the metaphor. Climb, fly, go, hop, jump & run are used in metaphors for ANGER/FURY. Crawl, leap, run, stagger, tiptoe & walk are used in metaphors for FEAR. <b>Float,</b> jump, leap, <b>roll</b> & walk are used for JOY/HAPPINESS and go & walk are used for SADNESS. The connections with specific emotions seem to arise out of the semantic parameters of each verb. The majority of the emotion metaphors in this study express basic negative emotions such as ANGER and FEAR. The human mind uses concrete experience to express the abstract. The human being visualizes the emotion as being inside a person, as surrounding the person or as making the person perform a movement. In this study, the majority of the studied verbs visualize a movement associated with an emotion. Understanding a metaphor is an advanced cognitive process based on pre-understanding, ability for abstract thinking and ability for sorting out one single cognitive model of the verb knowing that each verb has several possibilities, obviously the human mind is able to perform a very advanced process within a fraction of a second.

40|$|The use of {{wind power}} is {{in a period}} of rapid growth {{worldwide}} and wind energy systems have emerged as a promising technology for utilizing offshore wind resources for the large scale generation of electricity. Drawing upon the maturity of wind turbine and floater technologies developed by the wind energy and oil and gas industries, respectively, large offshore wind energy systems have been developed and are being proposed for operation in offshore areas where environmental restrictions are less restrictive, large wind resources exist, and open sea areas are available for wind farm development. A fully coupled dynamic analysis technique was developed to predict the response of a floating wind turbine system in a stochastic wind and wave environment. This technique incorporated both non- linear wave loading on the submerged floater and the aerodynamic loading on the wind turbine. A tension leg spar buoy was designed to support the wind turbine. This design was chosen due to its relatively small size and hence lower potential cost per wind turbine. The system's tethers were attached to the ends of spokes which radiated out from the spar cylinder. This arrangement of lines and spokes promised to be very stiff in the roll and pitch modes of motion. (cont.) The fully coupled analysis technique was used to evaluate the feasibility of the chosen floater design. Damping properties of the combined floater / wind turbine system were determined by conducting simulated free decay tests for the different modes of motion and wind turbine operating conditions. Numerical simulations for operational conditions were also carried out. The response of the floating wind turbine to three different sets of environmental conditions was determined and compared to a fixed base system. Additional simulations were conducted to determine extreme wind and wave event response. Stiffness of the <b>floating</b> system in <b>roll</b> and pitch was found to be a desirable attribute. The results of the analysis demonstrated that the tension leg spar buoy has the potential to support a wind turbine in an offshore environment without adversely affecting the loading on the system components. by Jon E.

40|$|On November 23, 1998, an 18, 000 -foot-deep wild-cat {{natural gas}} well being drilled near Bakersfield, CA blew out and caught fire. All {{attempts}} to kill this well failed, and the well continues to flow under limited control, producing {{large volumes of}} natural gas, salt water, and some oil. The oil {{and some of the}} water is being separated and trucked off site, and the remaining gas and water is being burned at the well head. A relief well is being drilled approximately one-quarter mile away in an attempt to intercept the first well. If the relief well is successful, it will be used to cement in and kill the first well. Epoch Wellsite Services, Inc., the mud-logging company for the initial well and the relief well, requested Sandia's rolling float meter (RFM) for these critical drilling operations. The RFM is being used to measure the mud outflow rate and detect kicks while drilling the relief well, which will undoubtedly encounter reservoir conditions similar to those responsible for the blow out. Based on its prior experience with the RFM, Epoch believes that it is the only instrument capable of providing the level of accuracy and response to mudflow needed to quickly detect kicks and minimize the risk of a blowout on this second critical well. In response to the urgent request from industry, Sandia and Epoch technicians installed the RFM on the relief well return line, and completed its initial calibration. The data from the RFM is displayed in real-time for the driller, the companyman, and the toolpusher via Epochs RIGWATCH Drilling Instmmentation System. The RFM has already detected several small kicks while drilling toward the annulus of the blown out well. A conventional paddle meter is located downstream of the RFM to provide redundancy and the opportunity to compare the two meters in an actual drilling operation, The relief well is nearing 14, 000 feet deep, targeting an intercept of the first well near 17, 600 feet. The relief well is expected to be completed in about 30 days. Several other Sandia instruments being developed for geothermal drilling are also being evaluated during this operation, Successful performance of these instruments on this important drilling job will reinforce our efforts to commercialize this technology for the geothermal and oil and gas drilling industries. Sandia's <b>Rolling</b> <b>Float</b> Meter was developed through the Lost Circulation Technology Program sponsored by the U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Geothermal Technologies. It monitors drilling fluid returns to rapidly detect loss of circulation during geothermal drilling. Lost circulation is particularly prevalent in geothermal wells, and can add as much as 10 % to the total cost of drilling the well. Consequently, rapid detection and treatment of lost circulation is necessary for cost- effective geothermal drilling. Sandia has been evaluating and demonstrating the capabilities of the RFM to the geothermal industry for several years. In addition to lost circulation, the RFM is also useful for accurately detecting well kicks. Contacts have been made with mud logging companies that are involved with both geothermal and oil and gas drilling operations...|$|R
