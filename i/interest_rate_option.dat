40|$|We {{provide the}} first formal {{investigation}} {{of the consequences of}} negative interest rates in the Eurozone on the pricing of interest rate options. Since the money market rates settled in negative territory and other market segments experienced negative yields, the broader financial community has had to face an unknown environment. The well-known Black–Scholes (BS) framework has become unfeasible for <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>option</b> valuation. First of all, no-arbitrage properties are breached, allowing arbitrage opportunities. More, the BS framework’s assumption of a log-normal distribution of the underlying rates does not stand with negative interest rates. We argue that the most notable approach which allows <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>option</b> pricing is [Bachelier, L (1900). Théorie de la speculation, 3 rd Annales scientifiques de l’École Normale Supérieure 17, 21 – 86. ], which assumes a normal distribution of the underlying rates. We demonstrate that the Bachelier model represents an answer to the critical issues that are raised in our study. Still, we highlight that it is far from being an accurate pricing model.

40|$|In recent years, Indian {{corporates}} {{and institutions}} have issued {{a large number}} of exotic bonds with a variety of embedded <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options.</b> Pricing the embedded <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> is a pre-requisite for valuing these bonds. The pricing of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> is quite complex and depends crucially on the dynamics of <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> International studies show that no model of these dynamics is valid world-wide.

40|$|Despite investors' {{willingness}} {{to hold a}} variety of financial assets and risks, a significant share of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> exposures remains {{in the hands of}} dealers. This concentration of risk makes the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> market an ideal place to explore the effects of dealers' dynamic hedging on underlying markets. Using data from a global survey of derivatives dealers and other sources, this article estimates the potential impact of dynamic hedging by <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> dealers on the fixed-income market. The author finds that for short-term maturities, turnover volume in the most liquid hedging instruments is more than large enough to absorb dealers' dynamic hedges.

We investigate these issues using daily bid and ask prices of euro ([euro]) <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> caps/floors. We find a clear smile pattern in <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options.</b> The shape of the smile varies over time and is affected in a dynamic manner by yield curve variables and the future uncertainty in the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> markets; it also has information about future aggregate default risk.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to {{examine the effect of}} liquidity on <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>option</b> prices, and to determine whether it is driven by a common systematic factor. Using daily bid and ask prices of euro (€) interest rate caps/floors, we document a negative effect of liquidity on option prices – illiquid options trade at higher prices relative to liquid options, after controlling for the volatility smile and term structure variables. This is opposite to the evidence for other assets such as equities, bonds and currency options. We also identify a systematic common factor that drives liquidity, across option maturities and strike rates. This liquidity factor is driven by the changes in uncertainty in the equity and fixed income markets.

40|$|On June 23 1989, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange {{introduced}} a new option on short-term interest rate.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about pricing {{interest}} rate options {{in a negative}} interest rate environment and about pricing foreign exchange barrier options. Conventional <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>option</b> pricing models are unable to price interest rate options in the current negative interest rate environment. Displaced versions and free boundary versions of the conventional models are proposed as a solution. Also normal models are proposed as a solution. Moreover, {{it is important to}} use risk metrics consistent with the model. Foreign exchange barrier options are priced with local volatility, stochastic volatility and stochastic local volatility models. The valuation of a proprietary trading model is compared with industry standards such as the local volatility model and the constant parameter SABR model. Furthermore, it is compared with an extension of the SABR model with time dependent parameters. This time dependent SABR model can be calibrated to volatilities of multiple expiries, in contrast to the constant parameter SABR model. Finally, a local volatility component is added to guarantee a perfect calibration. Applied MathematicsEEMCSDelft University of Technolog...|$|E

We find that, in this market, the implied volatility smiles are asymmetric, and are steeper on the ask-side. Liquidity variables have significant explanatory power for both curvature and asymmetry of the smiles. This effect too is stronger on the ask side. Thus, liquidity effects contribute to explaining the smile in these interest rate options. The stronger influence of liquidity and other economic variables on the ask-side indicates that ask-prices are more relevant for these markets, consistent {{with the fact that}} most of the customers are buyers of these interest rate options. In addition, the shape of the implied volatility smile has information about future levels of the term structure and the uncertainty in the market. To our knowledge, this is the first study relating liquidity and other economic variables to implied volatility smiles in interest rate options.

40|$|The South African <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{market has}} mainly {{been focused on}} vanilla <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{products}} and hence {{can be seen as}} underdeveloped in this regard when compared, for instance, to the associated equity market. Market participants subscribe this aspect to a lack of demand and sophistication of investors within the market. This is, however, expected to change given the influx of international banks into the South African market {{over the past couple of}} years. The current market methodology, for the pricing of vanilla <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options</b> in the South African market, is the standard Black model with some mechanism to incorporate <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> smiles. This mechanism is typically in the form of the SABR model. The most signi cant drawback of this approach is the fact that it models each forward rate in isolation. Hence, there is no way to incorporate the joint dynamics between different forward rates and consequently cannot be used for the pricing of exotic <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>options.</b> In anticipation of these new market developments, we explore the possibility of calibrating the LIBOR market model to the South African market.

40|$|In {{this paper}} UK data {{is used to}} compare two {{potential}} sources of information regarding market uncertainty about future short interest rates. One is the so-called risk-neutral density function (RND) derived from <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>option</b> prices, {{the other is the}} distribution of bids submitted to an auction of short-term Treasury bills. More specifically, time series of RND standard deviations and auction bid standard deviations are compared. The results suggest that in some periods the auction bid standard deviations co-moved with those of the RNDs. Thus, in principle, auction bid standard deviations may be useful to get a picture of market uncertainty about future short rates {{even in the absence of}} well-developed interest rate options markets. In the Supplement, encouraged by the above results, the author uses Hungarian T-bill auction data to check whether auction bid dispersion measures in Hungary make any sense as indicators of market uncertainty about future interest rates. Lacking any RND data for this country, this can only be done in indirect ways. These include looking at the correlations of auction dispersion measures of different T-bill maturities, comparing the time series of these measures and bid-ask spreads (another possible indicator of uncertainty) and conducting an intuitive consistency check for a certain time period. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the static and dynamic accuracy of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>option</b> pricing {{models in the}} U. S. dollar interest rate cap and floor markets. Alternative one-factor and two-factor term structure models of the spot and the forward rate are evaluated {{on the basis of}} their out-of-sample predictive ability in terms of pricing and hedging performance. In addition, the models are evaluated based on the stability of their parameters, the presence of systematic biases, and their numerical complexity and computational efficiency. The tests are conducted on daily data from March-December 1998, consisting of actual cap and floor prices across both strike rates and maturities. Results show that fitting the skew of the underlying interest rate distribution provides accurate pricing results within a one-factor framework. However, for hedging performance, introducing a second stochastic factor is more important than fitting the skew of the underlying distribution. Overall, the one-factor lognormal model for short term interest rates outperforms other competing models in pricing tests, while two-factor models perform significantly better than one-factor models in hedging tests. Modeling the second factor allows a better representation of the dynamic evolution of the term structure by incorporating expected twists in the yield curve. Thus, the interest rate dynamics embedded in two-factor models appears to be closer to the one driving the actual economic environment, leading to more accurate hedges. This constitutes evidence against claims in the literature that correctly specified and calibrated one-factor models could replace multi-factor models for consistent pricing and hedging of interest rate contingent claims. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} and tests consumption-based pricing kernels used in common equilibrium {{interest rate term structure}} models. In contrast to previous papers that use return orthogonality conditions, estimation {{in this paper}} is accomplished using moment conditions from a consumption-based option pricing equation and market prices of interest rate options. This methodology is more sensitive to preference misspecification over states associated with large changes in consumption than previous techniques. In addition, this methodology provides a large set of natural moment conditions to use in estimation and testing compared to an arbitrary choice of return orthogonality conditions (e. g. instruments selected) used in GMM estimation. Eurodollar futures option prices and an estimated joint model of quarterly aggregate consumption and three month Eurodollar rates suggest are used to estimate and test pricing kernels based on logarithmic, power, and exponential utility functions. Using the market prices of interest rate options, evidence is found which is consistent with the equity premium puzzle; very high levels of risk aversion are needed to justify the observed premium associated with an investment position positively correlated with aggregate consumption. In addition, evidence is found which is consistent with the riskfree rate puzzle: at high levels of risk-aversion for power or exponential utility, negative rates of time preference are needed to fit the observed low riskless interest rates. These results suggest that typical term structure models are misspecified in terms of assumed preferences. This may have deleterious effects on model estimates of the interest rate term structure {{estimates and}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>option</b> prices. ...|$|E
