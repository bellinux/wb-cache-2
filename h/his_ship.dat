5|$|During {{the events}} of Halo 4, the Ur-Didact is accidentally {{released}} from his Cryptum by the Master Chief and Cortana. He immediately retakes control of the Prometheans, forms an alliance with the Storm Covenant, and attacks the UNSC Infinity. After being repelled, the Didact uses <b>his</b> <b>ship,</b> the Mantle's Approach, to retrieve the Composer from the UNSC Station Ivanoff in orbit around Halo Installation 03, followed by the Master Chief and Cortana. After retrieving the Composer, the Didact heads to Earth. Though {{he is able to}} fire the Composer at mid-west North America, digitizing over seven million people, the Chief and Cortana are able to destroy <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> and the Composer with a Havok nuclear warhead. Before <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> explodes, the Didact is incapacitated and falls into a slipspace portal underneath the Composer.|$|E

500|$|At 02:16 Mikawa conferred {{with his}} staff about whether they should turn to {{continue}} the battle with the surviving Allied warships and try to sink the Allied transports in the two anchorages. Several factors influenced his ultimate decision. <b>His</b> <b>ships</b> were scattered and would {{take some time to}} regroup. [...] <b>His</b> <b>ships</b> would need to reload their torpedo tubes, a labor-intensive task that would take some time. Mikawa also did not know the number and locations of any remaining Allied warships and <b>his</b> <b>ships</b> had expended much of their ammunition.|$|R

5|$|As the {{sun rose}} at 04:00 on 2 August, firing broke out once again between the French {{southern}} division of Guillaume Tell, Tonnant, Généreux and Timoléon and the battered Alexander and Majestic. Although briefly outmatched, the British ships were soon joined by Goliath and Theseus. As Captain Miller manoeuvred <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> into position, Theseus briefly came under fire from the frigate Artémise. Miller turned <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> towards Artémise, but Captain Pierre-Jean Standelet struck his flag and ordered his men to abandon the frigate. Miller sent a boat under Lieutenant William Hoste to take possession of the empty vessel, but Standelet had set fire to <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> as he left and Artémise blew up shortly afterwards. The surviving French ships of the line, covering their retreat with gunfire, gradually pulled to the east away from the shore at 06:00. Zealous pursued, {{and was able to}} prevent the frigate Justice from boarding Bellerophon, which was anchored at the southern point of the bay undergoing hasty repairs.|$|E
5|$|Astorias bridge crew called general {{quarters}} upon sighting the flares {{south of}} Savo, around 01:49. At 01:52, {{shortly after the}} Japanese searchlights came on and shells began falling around the ship, Astorias main gun director crews spotted the Japanese cruisers and opened fire. Astorias captain, awakened to find <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> in action, rushed to the bridge and ordered a ceasefire, fearful that <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> might be firing on friendly forces. As shells continued to cascade around <b>his</b> <b>ship,</b> the captain ordered firing resumed {{less than a minute}} later. Chōkai, however, had found the range, and Astoria was quickly hit by numerous shells and set afire. Between 02:00 and 02:15, Aoba, Kinugasa, and Kako joined Chōkai in pounding Astoria, destroying the cruiser's engine room and bringing the flaming ship to a halt. At 02:16, one of Astorias remaining operational main gun turrets fired at Kinugasas searchlight, but missed and hit Chōkais forward turret, putting the turret out of action and causing moderate damage to the ship.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} {{one of the}} French ships had {{successfully}} escaped, but the other was still under pursuit, Captain Charles Linois of Atalante attempting a number of tactics to drive off his opponent but without success. Eventually, after a chase lasting nearly two days, the French ship came within range of the much larger British 74-gun third rate HMS Swiftsure and despite a brave defence was soon forced to surrender after suffering more than 40 casualties. Although he had surrendered <b>his</b> <b>ship,</b> Linois was widely praised for his actions in defending <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> against such heavy odds.|$|E

5|$|Elphinstone rapidly took {{advantage}} of the confusion Harriers attack had created, passing Aalbers' bow and raking <b>his</b> <b>ship.</b> Elphinstone then threw his sails back, halting <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> and allowing Greyhound to maintain a position across Pallas bow from which he could inflict severe damage on the Dutch frigate without coming under fire himself. As the damage and casualties mounted on Pallas, Harrier joined the attack. Gunfire from the Dutch ship gradually slackened, and finally stopped at 06:10, the Dutch flag was struck from the mast and Pallas surrendered with over 40 casualties from a crew of 250 (including 50 local recruits). Throughout the engagement, Victoria and Batavier had kept up a constant but inefficient fire on Harrier, Troubridge waiting until the Dutch flagship surrendered before counterattacking.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, Taylor was {{selected}} for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. In the 4×200m freestyle relay, he helped his team win bronze. There were no Olympic Games in 1916 because of the First World War. Taylor joined the Royal Navy in 1914 and kept fit by swimming around the ships when <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> was anchored at Scapa Flow. He {{was present at the}} Battle of Jutland. A popular story tells that {{during the course of the}} battle, <b>his</b> <b>ship,</b> HMS St. Vincent, was sunk and while the survivors waited for two hours to be rescued, Taylor swam around encouraging his crewmates. However, this story is probably a myth as HMS St Vincent was not sunk at the Battle of Jutland. He was transferred to HMS Ramillies where he remained until he was demobilised.|$|E

25|$|When the Greeks {{arrived at}} Catana, Leptines, the admiral, marshaled <b>his</b> <b>ships</b> and {{advanced}} on the Carthaginians. Although the Greek fleet was outnumbered, their ships were larger and heavier, and carried more soldiers and missile troops on board. Dionysius, planning to make {{full use of}} <b>his</b> heavier <b>ships</b> and larger missile troop contingent, had ordered Leptines to keep <b>his</b> <b>ships</b> in close order when engaging the Carthaginians. Seeing the Greeks deploy for action, Mago ordered his fleet to sea and started to form up the battle line.|$|R
5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> Fram into the Arctic pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E
5|$|In the Age of Sail, {{deception}} {{was often}} used by ships, and paint was applied ad hoc by ships' captains for temporary tactical advantage. A ship might be painted {{to look like}} another, it might have its cannon ports hidden by painted canvas to look harmless, or it might have additional cannon ports painted on to appear more powerful. For example, {{in one of his}} battles during 1778–1782, American privateer Jonathan Haraden hid the guns of <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> the General Pickering, to appear {{as if it were a}} slow merchant ship. Haraden allowed <b>his</b> <b>ship</b> to be approached at close range by a much faster British privateer, then he quickly pulled the painted canvas away and delivered a full broadside, capturing the enemy.|$|E
