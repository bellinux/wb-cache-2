5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits {{were identified in}} and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chamber. Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated from between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated from between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that it had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it came {{to be used as a}} well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E
5|$|In the ground, they dig for {{earthworms}} and grubs, {{and they}} search for beetles, cicada, crickets, flies, weta, spiders, caterpillars, slugs and snails on the ground. They will also feed on berries and seeds. To find prey, the great spotted kiwi use their scenting skills or feel vibrations {{caused by the}} movement of their prey. To do the latter, a kiwi would stick its beak into the ground, then use its beak to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. As they are nocturnal, they do not emerge until thirty minutes after sunset to begin the hunt. Kiwis will also swallow small stones, which aid in digestion.|$|E

5|$|Trapped {{refugees}} began {{piling up}} bodies as barricades {{and tried to}} <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground to hide. Some managed to escape that first night, while U.S. troops turned searchlights on the tunnels and continued firing, said Chung Koo-ho, whose mother died shielding him and his sister. By the second day, the gunfire was reduced to potshots and occasional fusillades when a trapped refugee moved or tried to escape. Some also recall planes returning that second day to fire rockets or drop bombs. Racked with thirst, survivors resorted to drinking blood-filled water from a small stream running under the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Dick about his {{relationship}} with Betina. Veronica talks to one of Betina’s friends, who says that Dick mistreated her, and Betina’s goal was for Dick to get her pregnant so she could get him in trouble. Veronica asks Keith about whether or not he has resumed a relationship with Rebecca, and Veronica gets into Stanford University. Veronica is pushed into second place at the Kane scholarship after Angie. Rebecca denies having a relationship with Keith, while Angie also gets into Stanford. Wallace points out Rhonda’s sister to Veronica, but she doesn’t give Veronica any information. Veronica asks Keith to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> financial records of the bus crash victims. Veronica learns that none of the families had very much money, except for Rhonda’s family, who got a $2 million bailout from Woody (Steve Guttenberg).|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E

25|$|About 20% of the snails in a {{population}} survive to lay eggs in the 3rd year, 5% of the snails lay eggs again in the 4th year. The mortality rates decrease with age. The animals hibernate (in northern Greece) or aestivate (in Crete), but juveniles and adults show differences in their behaviour. Adults <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> soil and build an epiphragm, while juveniles search protected places under stones or leaves of low plants.|$|E
25|$|The pipe wrench, or Stillson wrench, is an {{adjustable}} wrench used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface.

25|$|The Sciaridae occur worldwide, even {{in extreme}} {{habitats}} such as subantarctic islands and mountainous regions above 4,000 m.

However, most species live in forests, swamps, and moist meadows, where {{they live in the}} foliage. They are also often found in flowerpots. In moist and shadowy areas, up to 70% of all dipteran species can be Sciaridae.|$|E

25|$|The trumpet is a {{notoriously}} hard instrument on the lips, and Armstrong suffered from lip damage {{over much of}} his life due to his aggressive style of playing and preference for narrow mouthpieces that would stay in place easier, but which tended to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> soft flesh of his inner lip. During his 1930s European tour, he suffered an ulceration so severe that he had to stop playing entirely for a year. Eventually he took to using salves and creams on his lips and also cutting off scar tissue with a razor blade. By the 1950s, he was an official spokesman for Ansatz-Creme Lip Salve.|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with such}} a drastic social experiment, and stunned by its arrest once the President dies, humans are faced with {{complete}} annihilation, as the cold wave progresses down toward the ocean floor. Scientists have to acknowledge yet another threat: that of biological devolution, turning men and women into oversized mollusks. Decision-makers are incapable of finding a global solution, but coalesce into competing factions. Two engineers personify that trend: Whitt suggests moving civilization closer to the inner molten regions; Xavier, inventor of nuclear propulsion, wants spacecraft to resettle humans on another planet. While Whitt and his secretary <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> seafloor, Xavier and his concubine Olivia (collectively dubbed X-O) make a solitary escape into the cosmos.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} was looted and damaged by stone robbery, common for pyramid complexes. The unfinished form {{with the flat}} roof offered looters a simple entry, as they could <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> substructure from its easily accessible top. The stone robbery and the lootings were apparently professionally organized, as residues were found of a workshop in the pyramid. This phenomenon possibly began {{as early as the}} First Intermediate Period and stone theft followed in the late New Kingdom, the Late Period, the reign by the Roman Empire and the Arabic Middle Ages right through the 19th century. Materials stolen from the pyramid complex could be found in nearby shaft tombs. The temple area remained comparatively unaffected, as it was mainly composed of less valuable adobes.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand all-rounder Andre Adams {{then took}} two early wickets to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Yorkshire effort, and they {{finished}} {{the second day}} on 53 for 2. The third day saw runs hit at a rate just below three an over by Yorkshire, as only Gough could take more than one wicket – ending with five for 85. Yorkshire saw out the day to end on 336 for 8, meaning that Essex {{would have to take}} twelve wickets on the final day to win the game. They only dug out seven – Tim Bresnan, Chris Silverwood and Deon Kruis frustrating them to build a further 72 runs overnight in the first innings, and following on Yorkshire withstood the spin of James Middlebrook who had to bowl 29 of 68 Essex overs. Yorkshire made their way to 238 for 5 with Phil Jaques and Anthony McGrath making half-centuries, after an opening stand of 94.|$|E
25|$|Gobies usually live in male-female pairs that {{construct}} and share burrows, similar {{to many other}} fish such as Mozambique tilapia. The burrows are used for shelters and spawning places. Gobies use their mouths to <b>dig</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea bottom, removing dead coral-fragments, rubble, and benthic algae {{in order to build}} their burrows. Gobies maintain their burrows by fanning away sand inside the burrows. Furthermore, gobies use coral rubble to block burrow entrance. A single goby carry as many as nine pieces of coral rubble per minute. Gobies also build a 6–13cm high mound over the entrance of their spawning burrow. The mound lets the water flow fast over the mound. The water flow created by the mound helps to provide oxygen to the eggs. While burrow building is a cooperative behavior done by both sexes, males usually put more effort in burrow maintenance than females. Females feed more instead, because the reproductive success is optimal when females put more energy in preparing for the reproduction. Interestingly, after spawning eggs, the roles of male and female changes. Females primarily maintain the burrow, and males mainly care for the eggs by fanning them, thereby providing oxygen. When females leave the burrow, however, the mounds lose their heights. The males then give up on the eggs and eat them, preparing for future mating opportunities. Goby burrows vary in size {{depending on the size of}} the goby species.|$|E
