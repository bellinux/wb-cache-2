The changes of deformation behaviour are explained {{on the basis of}} substructure differences after work hardening. The ''elastic moduli'' of both the high-temperature phase B 2 and the martensite B 19 ' as well as the ''easy stage of deformation'' are dependent on the work <b>hardening</b> <b>intensity</b> and these changes are related to the mobility of B 2 /B 19 ' interfaces. The martensite changes its morphology after work hardening. In contrast to a twinned martensite, typical for annealed alloys, the internally slipped martensite was detected after work hardening...|$|E
40|$|The polybag {{is widely}} used for {{seedling}} production in the Philippines. Seedlings commonly have root deformation which has adverse effects as they grow and develop into mature trees. This study assessed the influence of potting technique and <b>hardening</b> <b>intensity</b> on the growth performance of seedlings in nursery and field conditions. Seedlings of bagras (Eucalyptus deglupta) and mangium (Acacia mangium) were grown in hiko trays and 4 " x 6 " polybags at the College of Forestry nursery, Leyte State University (LSU). Kalumpit (Terminalia microcarpa) and pellita (Eucalyptus pellita) were used for a trial in the Conalum Agroforestry Farmers Association (CAFA) nursery in Inopacan, Leyte, aimed at validating LSU results {{and at the same}} time evaluating farmers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions on the use of hiko trays and polybags in seedling production. It was found that seedlings of bagras, mangium, kalumpit and pellita grown in hiko trays have smaller diameter and height compared with those in polybags at 12 weeks. Root deformation of seedlings was absent in hiko trays but high with seedlings in polybags. As perceived by both farmers and ACIAR researchers, hiko tray seedlings are of high quality exhibiting sturdy shoot, trained roots and homogenous growth...|$|E

40|$|The average {{amplitude}} of variability of BL Lac objects is larger at higher frequencies, and the spectra in the X-ray range show a <b>hardening</b> with increasing <b>intensity.</b> This {{is shown to}} be a natural consequence of the relativistic jet model proposed by Ghisellini et al.

Time-dependent properties are computed assuming that a perturbation travels at fixed speed down the jet, producing enhancements of constant {{amplitude of}} the relativistic particle density and of the magnetic field, in a slab of self-similar cone geometry. The time-dependent spectral intensities due to synchrotron radiation and first-order Compton scattering are computed numerically, and approximate analytic formulae are given. The evolution of the spectral shape with time and the light curves at fixed frequencies are presented and discussed in detail...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of the hard X-ray properties of the BL Lacertae object PKS 2155 - 304 based on measurements made in 1988 and 1989 with the Large Area Counter (LAC) on board the Ginga satellite. The source exhibited {{a high degree of}} variability with a dynamic range of a factor 7 in the 2 - 6 keV band. The fastest amplitude variation was a factor 2 decline in the intensity in this band within 4 hours. The spectrum is characterized by a break which occurs at about 4 keV. Spectral fits to the data integrated in 6400 s time bins reveal that, in common with previous observations of BL Lacertae objects, the spectral slope is generally anticorrelated with intensity {{in the sense that the}} spectrum <b>hardens</b> as the <b>intensity</b> increases.

40|$|A new {{formalism}} {{is presented}} for calculating the mean intensity spectrum and angular power spectrum of gamma-rays or neutrinos from extragalactic annihilating dark matter, {{taking into account}} the dependence of the relative motions of the annihilating particles on the annihilation cross section. To model the large scale dark matter distribution of mass and relative velocities, the halo distribution model is comprehensively summarized, and extended to include a universal radial profile of the particles' velocity variance, based on results from N-body computer simulations of dark matter halos. A velocity variance profile, associated with the NFW density profile, is proposed by enforcing a power-law profile of the pseudo phase-space density. This allows the large-scale velocity distribution to be described by virialized, gravitationally bound dark matter halos, as opposed to thermal motions used to describe the velocity distribution in the early Universe. The recent particle motion history of the Universe is presented for the described model. Sample extragalactic gamma-ray intensities from dark matter annihilation are shown for dark matter annihilating with p-wave, according to a relative-velocity-weighted annihilation cross section sigmav = a + bv^ 2, for constants a and b, with examples taken from supersymmetric models. For thermally produced dark matter, the p-wave suppresses the signal intensity. If b/a > 10 ^ 6, the p-wave <b>hardens</b> the <b>intensity</b> spectrum by an estimated factor of 1 + (6 b/a) delta_I (E_gamma), and increases the angular power spectrum by a factor also depending on new coefficients (delta_Cl) ^(1) (E_gamma) and (delta_Cl) ^(2) (E_gamma). The energy-dependence of the new p-wave coefficients delta_I, (delta_Cl) ^(1) (E_gamma), and (delta_Cl) ^(2) (E_gamma) are shown for various annihilation spectra. Sample intensity spectra are also presented for Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation. The intensity of neutrinos from dark matter annihilation is also considered. The variations between the dark matter annihilation signals for different particle phenomenologies suggest that particle physics constraints are possible from an observed indirect detection signal. Calculations of the annihilation signal from the galactic halo are also shown. The extragalactic signal's intensity is found to be consistent in magnitude with the galactic intensity?within the uncertainty of the models of the dark matter distribution?when looking out from the galactic plane. This suggests that the total cosmic signal may have significant contributions from both components...|$|R
40|$|The BL Lac object Mkn 501, one of {{the only}} three extragalactic sources (with Mkn 421 and 1 ES 2344 + 514) so far {{detected}} at TeV energies, was observed with the BeppoSAX satellite on 7, 11, and 16 April 1997 during a phase of high activity at TeV energies, as monitored with the Whipple, HEGRA and CAT Cherenkov telescopes. Over the whole 0. 1 - 200 keV range the spectrum was exceptionally hard (alpha =< 1, with F_nu ~ nu^{-alpha}) indicating that the X-ray power output peaked at (or above) ~ 100 keV. This represents a shift of at least two orders of magnitude with respect to previous observations of Mkn 501, a behavior never seen before in this or any other blazar. The overall X-ray spectrum <b>hardens</b> with increasing <b>intensity</b> and, at each epoch, it is softer at larger energies. The correlated variability from soft X-rays to the TeV band points to models in which the same population of relativistic electrons produces the X-ray continuum via synchrotron radiation and the TeV emission by inverse Compton scattering of the synchrotron photons or other seed photons. For the first time in any blazar the synchrotron power is observed to peak at hard X-ray energies. The large shift of the synchrotron peak frequency with respect to previous observations of Mkn 501 implies that intrinsic changes in the relativistic electron spectrum caused the increase in emitted power. Due to the very high electron energies, the inverse Compton process is limited by the Klein-Nishina regime. This implies a quasi-linear (as opposed to quadratic) relation of the variability amplitude in the TeV and hard X-ray ranges (for the SSC model) and an increase of the inverse Compton peak frequency smaller than that of the synchrotron peak frequency.
