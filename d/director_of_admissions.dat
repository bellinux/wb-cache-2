2500|$|In her view, {{two-thirds of}} this {{evaluation}} {{is based on}} tests, while only one third is based on grades, leading her to conclude {{at one point that}} grades were less important overall as a factor than test scores, while in a different chapter she also suggested that the high school transcript information described roughly 60% of the college's perception of a student's academic performance. Next, the composite academic index score was combined with an analysis of personal factors such as extracurricular activity or the essay, such that the academic factor was weighted 70% to 85% while the personal evaluation was weighted only 30% to 15%. Generally the particulars of the mathematical formulas are not revealed to the public, and different colleges have different formulas. Part of the purpose of algorithms is to expedite the handling of thousands of applications in a short amount of time. For example, at Dartmouth College, data goes into a master card for each application, which leads to a ready sheet, where readers summarize applications; then, an initial screening is done: top applications go directly to the <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> for approval while lackluster ones go to another director. Dartmouth uses [...] "A" [...] for accept, [...] "R" [...] for reject, [...] "P" [...] for possible, with [...] "P+" [...] and [...] "P-" [...] being variants. A committee might spend a week with the [...] "P" [...] ones, of which they only accept about a sixth, according to Hernandez.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to analyze the use and {{effectiveness}} of management techniques for the recruitment or retention of college students. Data were collected from 227 <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> and 51 <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> enrollment management. An instrument consisting of 41 questionnaire items was developed from a review of the literature. Data obtained by the questionnaire were analyzed using both frequency and percentile analysis. Additional analysis was conducted to determine if <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> and <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> enrollment management use and/or judge the effectiveness of management techniques differently. Findings 1. Management by objectives, performance appraisal, job analysis and job descriptions, management information systems, organizational development, systems analysis, and program budgeting were techniques used by a majority of the respondents. 2. Management by objectives, performance appraisal, job analysis and job descriptions, management information systems, organizational development, systems analysis, and program budgeting were judged by a majority of the respondents to be moderately or very effective. 3. Enrollment directors and admissions directors differed both on usage of management techniques and in judgments regarding the effectiveness of the techniques. Enrollment directors reported greater use of management by objectives, performance appraisal, management information systems, and organizational development which were statistically significant. The differences in judgments concerning effectiveness were attributable to a composite of the seven management techniques. 4. Enrollment managers are generally higher-level administrators having responsibility for retention, as well as recruitment, goals of the institution. Conclusions 1. The predictions of enrollment crises have already resulted in the use of management techniques by administrators responsible for recruitment or retention of college students. 2. Management by objectives, performance appraisal, job analysis and job descriptions, management information systems, organizational development, systems analysis, and program budgeting are seven management techniques that are effective tools for the management of college and university recruitment or retention efforts. 3. The <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> Enrollment Management position is representative of a move towards accountability in the area <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> work. The concept of "enrollment management" encourages the use of management techniques to meet both the recruitment and retention goals of the institution. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
