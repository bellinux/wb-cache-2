50|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>rake</b> is a {{wildland}} fire fighting tool. A <b>fire</b> <b>rake</b> has a wooden or fiberglass handle with a rake head consisting of four very sharp, serrated, triangular steel blades. It {{is used to}} rake a fire break with the sharp teeth enabling it to reach fire in undergrowth in addition to loose surface debris. Another type of <b>fire</b> <b>rake</b> which {{looks more like a}} steel rake but with sharp edges on the teeth, and is sometimes referred to as a rake hoe is called a McLeod. The teeth of the more traditional <b>fire</b> <b>rake</b> which resemble the teeth of a great white shark allow it to get deeper into the undergrowth when necessary. But the preference for one over the other is somewhat subjective.|$|E
