50|$|The Triplets are {{the first}} three extradosed {{concrete}} bridges in Bolivia. The construction of a beltway allowing traffic <b>decongestion</b> {{in the city of}} La Paz was completed in 2010. The new elevated road crosses three parallel valleys with signature bridges. These three consecutive bridges have similar features and as a result are called the Triplets. All three-span structures are made of concrete, with maximum span of 372 feet, featuring extradosed pre-stressed concrete. The structures are built using balanced cantilever segmental construction. The elevation of the bridges reaches heights between 130 and 197 ft above the bottom of the valley, which made a cable-stayed bridge option, with pylons higher than 82 ft above the deck, inappropriate for the site. Therefore, it was proposed an extradosed bridge type, which reduces the height of the pylon, and a single plane of stays to allow a more transparent view. The bridges were designed by PEDELTA.|$|E
50|$|The Philippine highway network spans over 32000 km {{across all}} {{regions of the}} Philippines. These highways, however, are mostly single and dual carriageways with many U-turn lanes and intersections slowing down traffic. Coupled with the {{increase}} in the number of vehicles and the demand for limited-access highways, the Philippine government requested the government of Japan to conduct a master plan for the development of a high standard highway network in 2009 under the Philippine Medium-Term Public Investment Plan (2005-2010). The plan calls for the promotion of national integrity by strengthening the Philippine Nautical Highway System linking roads and ferries, the <b>decongestion</b> of traffic in Metro Manila, and the improvement of accessibility to main tourist spots, among others. The Philippine expressway network master plan covers the development of high standard highways surrounding Metro Manila in Luzon, Metro Cebu in the Visayas, and the Metro Davao-General Santos area in Mindanao.|$|E
5000|$|Saint-Lô lies halfway {{along the}} Coutances-Bayeux axis (...) [...] A bypass road was {{commissioned}} in the 1980s {{to allow the}} <b>decongestion</b> of the city from the south.

50|$|In 1927 Heetderks {{spoke about}} the {{alternating}} turgescence of the inferior turbinates in 80% of a normal population. The cycle {{is the result of}} alternating congestion and <b>decongestion</b> of the nasal conchae or turbinates, predominantly the inferior turbinates, which are by far the largest of the turbinates in each nasal fossa. Turbinates consist of bony projections covered by erectile tissue, much like the tissues of the penis and clitoris. The turbinates in one fossa filled up with blood while the opposite turbinates decongested by shunting blood away. This cycle, which is controlled by the autonomic nervous system as described above, had a mean duration of two and a half hours. He further observed and documented that the turbinates in the dependent nasal fossa filled when the patient was in the lateral decubitus (lying down on your side) position. Some postulate that this alternating positional obstruction has the purpose of causing a person to turn {{from one side to the}} other while sleeping. Others note that the asymmetric airflow may have some benefit to overall olfactory sensitivity. The nasal cycle is an alternating one, with the total resistance in the nose remaining constant. In patients with a fixed septal deviation and intermittent nasal obstruction, the interplay of the nasal cycle becomes evident; the sensation of obstruction frequently mirrors the congestion phase.|$|E

50|$|A {{minimum of}} 4000 heartbeats of the newt is the {{necessary}} amount for haematological parameters {{to become stable}} {{when there is a}} shift in respiratory conditions. The colder the temperature, the harder it seems for T. carnifex to reach this 4000 beat minimum. In an experiment performed by Frangioni et al. it was observed that at 6 degrees Celsius, it took 360 minutes, whereas at 18 degrees Celsius, it only took 150 minutes. When T. carnifex are in an optimal respiratory environment (that is, exposed to air), they contain low RBC counts, as well as low hematocrit values. This implies that in these conditions, the spleen is very congested. As stated, this is because in areas of high oxygen, the newt is not in hypoxia and does need to compensate for the lack of oxygen in its surroundings. Therefore, release of oxygen from the spleen is unnecessary and not triggered. The opposite is seen when the animal is placed in a hypoxic environment. There is a release of erythrocytes from the spleen and the values in the blood are raised to high. Every time there is an increase in blood volume (created by the release of erythrocytes), there is an increase in blood pressure, and therefore they are said to have a direct relationship. Thus, if one increases, so will the other. Besides blood volume, a factor affecting blood pressure is the temperature. At lower temperatures, the newts will have a lower blood pressure, and the opposite is true for a higher temperature. Another factor is the congestion of the spleen. When congestion of the spleen rises, the pressure will fall; and vice versa. During hypoxia, {{there is a great deal}} of arterial pressure which appears when there is a quick change from an oxygenated environment to a hypoxic one. That increase is due to the swift <b>decongestion</b> of the spleen as it releases erythrocytes into the bloodstream to allow respiration within the newt. However, this increase in pressure occurred only at the 6 degree and 12 degree mark; at 18 degrees the blood actually decreased. This suggests that even though blood pressure is key in determining respiratory compensation, it is by no means the only factor, or even the most important. Although there is a decrease in blood at 18 degrees, the spleen is still emptied (as it is at any temperature). There is a decrease in blood plasma when this occurs so as to keep blood volume at a constant, or even a lowered value. In well oxygenated environments, temperature can be seen working alone, without the added challenge of a hypoxic environment. When an increase in temperature occurs in the surrounding environment of a newt, this increases metabolic activity. When there is such an increase, the spleen will empty itself of erythrocytes and the volume of red blood cells will go up. This is to assist with the greater need for consumption of oxygen. In a high temperature environment where T. carnifex is exposed to air, it can be expected that there will be a large increase in blood volume. However, the blood plasma will decrease and prevent an increase in blood pressure. In terms of compartmentalization of the newt’s respiratory systems, the systemic (lungs) and cutaneous (skin) systems work and function independently. Despite this, there is a very high correlation between the two with respect to their abilities in times of hypoxia. Both systems attempt to obtain as much oxygen as possible - cutaneous through vasodilation, and systemic through splenic <b>decongestion.</b>|$|E
