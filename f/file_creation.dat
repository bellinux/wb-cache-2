25|$|Newer {{versions}} of WMA became available: Windows Media Audio 2 in 1999, Windows Media Audio 7 in 2000, Windows Media Audio 8 in 2001, and Windows Media Audio 9 in 2003. Microsoft first announced {{its plans to}} license WMA technology to third parties in 1999. Although earlier {{versions of}} Windows Media Player played WMA files, support for WMA <b>file</b> <b>creation</b> was not added until the seventh version. In 2003, Microsoft released new audio codecs that were not compatible with the original WMA codec. These codecs were Windows Media Audio 9 Professional, Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless, and Windows Media Audio 9 Voice.|$|E

5000|$|Versioning {{file system}} : A {{versioning}} filesystem {{keeps track of}} all changes to a file and makes those changes accessible to the user. Generally this gives access to any previous version, {{all the way back}} to the <b>file's</b> <b>creation</b> time. An example of this is the Wayback versioning filesystem for Linux.|$|R

40|$|Main changes {{relative}} to 0. 6. 3 version: Iromlab is now {{compatible with the}} latest version of Isolyzer Various changes to improve conformance to PEP 8 / Pylint Changed to wheel package distributions. Since wheel distributions don't appear to support post-install steps (copying of configuration <b>files,</b> <b>creation</b> of desktop icons), these were moved to a separate configuration tool that has to be run once by the user. This is all explained in the updated documentation. A bit annoying but nothing to do about it...|$|R

5000|$|Like static {{libraries}}, import libraries for DLLs {{are noted}} by the [...]lib file extension. For example, kernel32.dll, the primary dynamic library for Windows' base functions such as <b>file</b> <b>creation</b> and memory management, is linked via kernel32.lib.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} though, were significant, {{aside from}} just {{the increase in}} disk access speed. Apple Pascal {{increased the number of}} supported file types from the original eight by introducing a two-byte code to indicate type. A timestamp feature was also added, indicating the date and time of a <b>file's</b> <b>creation</b> or last modification. This data would then be shown on a line with the filename by the CATalog command. Previously only a file's name, basic type, and size would be shown. Strangely enough, the timestamp feature was not made a part of the later DOS 3.3.|$|R

Additional features such as ability to upload and show image <b>files,</b> <b>creation</b> of blogs, and a fully functional music player where users can upload audio files within their accounts and put restrictions as to who can play these files, were also built into the application.|$|R

The foundation soil is represented by springs with linear elastic behaviour (Winkler`s theory). A programme has been developped for small computers. It consists of three moduli: preprocessing which includes data preparation with graphic treatment (network generation and renumbering, etc.); displacements and support reactions calculation for each loading system; postprocessing, including options with numerical <b>files</b> <b>creation</b> and graphical treatment of results. The stiffness of the foundation soil can vary from point to point, the plate can have variable thickness and may be actuated by a large variety of types of loads...|$|R
40|$|In Orange File System, large {{data files}} are striped across {{multiple}} servers to provide highly concurrent access, however, contents of large directories are only {{stored in a}} single server, which is becoming a bottleneck in handling {{a large number of}} requests accessing the same directory concurrently. In this paper, a scalable distributed directory for Orange File System is implemented and evaluated in a largescale system. The throughput performance is measured by a modified version of UCAR metarates benchmark. The result shows great scalability in concurrently creating and removing large numbers of files under one directory by multiple clients. On a 64 -servers setup and 128 clients accessing the same directory concurrently, the scalable distributed directory can achieve more than 8, 000 <b>file</b> <b>creations</b> per second and over 11, 000 file removals per second on average. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Version 7 extends {{support for}} {{multiple}} volumes to permit Dynamic Storage Tiering. Dynamic Storage Tiering allows root users to move files among different volumes, allocate files to different volumes at <b>file</b> <b>creation</b> time based on policy, and independently recover volumes, without altering the namespace of the file system. Version 7 {{was introduced in}} VxFS 5.0.|$|E

40|$|In {{a typical}} file system, only the {{current version of}} a file (or directory) is available. In Wayback, a user can also ac-cess any {{previous}} version, {{all the way back to}} the <b>file’s</b> <b>creation</b> time. Versioning is done automatically at the write level: each write to the file creates a new version. Wayback implements versioning using an undo log structure, ex-ploiting the massive space available on modern disks to provide its very useful functionality. Wayback is a user-level file system built on the FUSE framework that relies on an underlying file system for access to the disk. In ad-dition to simplifying Wayback, this also allows it to extend any existing file system with versioning: after being mounted, the file system can be mounted a second time with versioning. We describe the implementation of Way-back, and evaluate its performance using several benchmarks. ...|$|R

40|$|Modern day Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) pivots about {{nonlinear}} analysis and its feasibility. IDARC- 2 D {{is a widely}} used and accepted software for {{nonlinear analysis}}; it possesses many attractive features and capabilities. However, it is operated from the command prompt in the DOS/Unix systems and requires elaborate text-based input <b>files</b> <b>creation</b> by the user. To complement and facilitate the use of IDARC- 2 D, a pre-processing GUI software package (INSPECT) is introduced herein. INSPECT is created in the C# environment and utilizes the . NET libraries and SQLite database. Extensive testing and verification demonstrated successful and high-fidelity re-creation of several existing IDARC- 2 D input files. Its design and built-in features aim at expediting, simplifying and assisting in the modeling process. Moreover, this practical aid enhances {{the reliability of the}} results and improves accuracy by reducing and/or eliminating many potential and common input mistakes. Such benefits would be appreciated by novice and veteran IDARC- 2 D users alike...|$|R
