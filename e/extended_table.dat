40|$|Universal spacetimes are exact {{solutions}} to all higher-order theories of gravity. We study these spacetimes in four dimensions and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for universality for all Petrov types except of type II. We show that all universal spacetimes in four dimensions are algebraically special and Kundt. Petrov type D universal spacetimes are necessarily direct products of two 2 -spaces of constant and equal curvature. Furthermore, type II universal spacetimes necessarily possess a null recurrent direction and they admit the above type D direct product metrics as a limit. Such spacetimes represent gravitational waves propagating on these backgrounds. Type III universal spacetimes are also investigated. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions for universality and present an explicit {{example of a}} type III universal Kundt non-recurrent metric.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{present the}} Systemic Console, a new all-in-one, {{general-purpose}} software {{package for the}} anal-ysis and combined multiparameter fitting of Doppler radial velocity (RV) and transit timing observations. We give {{an overview of the}} computational algorithms implemented in the console, and describe the tools offered for stream-lining the characterization of planetary systems. We illustrate the capabilities of the package by analyzing an up-dated radial velocity data set for the HD 128311 planetary system. HD 128311 harbors a pair of planets that appear to be participating in a 2 : 1 mean motion resonance. We show that the dynamical configuration cannot be fully determined from the current data. We find that if a planetary system like HD 128311 is found to undergo transits, then self-consistent Newtonian fits to combined radial velocity data and a small number of timing measurements of transit midpoints can provide an immediate and vastly improved characterization of the planet’s dynamical state.

40|$|AbstractIn reduced-rank regression, {{a matrix}} of {{expectations}} is modeled as a lower rank matrix. In factor analysis, a covariance matrix is modeled as a linear function of a diagonal matrix and a lower rank matrix. A common set of test procedures {{can be applied to}} both models when the following conditions are met: the rank of the lower rank matrix is small, the diagonal matrix in the factor model is an identity, and the reduced-rank regression model is not replicated. This paper gives three results for making inferences under these conditions: (1) It is shown that locally best invariant test of sphericity in the factor analysis model is identical to the locally best invariant test of rank-O against rank-r in the reduced-rank model, provided that r is small. (2) An <b>extended</b> <b>table</b> of null percentiles of the likelihood ratio test statistic for rank- 1 alternatives in both models is computed. (3) Confidence intervals for parameters in a rank- 1 alternative are given. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated in a simulation study.

This Big Data Track {{submission}} {{demonstrates how}} the BTC 2014 dataset, Microdata annotations {{from thousands of}} websites, as well as millions of HTML tables are used to extend local tables with additional columns.

Or imagine you are a film enthusiast and want to extend a table describing films with attributes like director, genre, and release date of each film. The Mannheim Search Joins Engine automatically performs such table extension operations based on a large data corpus gathered from over a million websites that publish structured data in various formats. Given a local table, the Mannheim Search Joins Engine searches the corpus for additional data describing the entities of the input table.

The total new formed blood protein may amount to 30 to 40 per cent of the total diet protein intake which shows that some dogs have remarkable capacity to conserve and use diet protein. In this emergency of simultaneous depletion of hemoglobin and plasma protein levels, the dog gives preference to hemoglobin manufacture no matter what one of the listed food proteins is tested...|$|E
40|$|G. B. Riccioli's 1651 Almagestum Novum {{contains}} a table of diameters of stars measured by Riccioli and his associates with a telescope. These telescopically measured star diameters are spurious, caused by the diffraction of light waves through the circular aperture of the telescope, but astronomers of the time, including Riccioli and Galileo Galilei, were unaware of this phenomenon. They {{believed that they were}} seeing the physical bodies of stars. In the Almagestum Novum Riccioli uses these telescopically measured disks to determine the physical sizes of stars under both geocentric (or geo-heliocentric - Tychonic) and heliocentric (Copernican) hypotheses. The physical sizes obtained under the Copernican hypothesis are immense - dwarfing the Earth, the Sun, and the Earth's orbit; even exceeding the distances to the stars given by Tycho Brahe. Thus Riccioli felt that telescopic observations were an effective argument against the Copernican system.
