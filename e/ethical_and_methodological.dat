Critics felt he dismissed this source of bias, without even attempting to measure deception or self-deception (a standard practice in self-reporting psychological tests like MMPI-2).

Dresser (1981) notes that, ethically, researchers are only to use subjects in an experiment after the subject has given informed consent. However, because of its very nature, a researcher conducting a deception experiment cannot reveal its true purpose to the subject, thereby making any consent given by a subject misinformed (p. 3). Baumrind (1964), criticizing the use of deception in the Milgram (1963) obedience experiment, argues that deception experiments inappropriately {{take advantage of the}} implicit trust and obedience given by the subject when the subject volunteers to participate (p. 421).|$|E

5000|$|The first {{sense of}} {{reflexivity}} in anthropology {{is part of}} social science's more general self-critique {{in the wake of}} theories by Michel Foucault and others about the relationship of power and knowledge production. Reflexivity about the research process became {{an important part of the}} critique of the colonial roots and scientistic methods of anthropology in the [...] "writing cultures" [...] movement associated with James Clifford and George Marcus, as well as many other anthropologists. Rooted in literary criticism and philosophical analysis of the relationship of anthropologist, representations of people in texts, and the people represented, this approach has fundamentally changed <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodological</b> approaches in anthropology. As with the feminist and anti-colonial critiques that provide some of reflexive anthropology's inspiration, the reflexive understanding of the academic and political power of representations, analysis of the process of [...] "writing culture" [...] has become a necessary part of understanding the situation of the ethnographer in the fieldwork situation. Objectification of people and cultures and analysis of them only as objects of study has been largely rejected in favor of developing more collaborative approaches that respect local people's values and goals. Nonetheless, many anthropologists have accused the [...] "writing cultures" [...] approach of muddying the scientific aspects of anthropology with too much introspection about fieldwork relationships, and reflexive anthropology have been heavily attacked by more positivist anthropologists. Considerable debate continues in anthropology over the role of postmodernism and reflexivity, but most anthropologists accept the value of the critical perspective, and generally only argue about the relevance of critical models that seem to lead anthropology away from its earlier core foci.|$|E

Methods: The <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodological</b> issues addressed in the article are based on a qualitative study among indigenous Norwegian Sami people experiencing disability. The data in this study were collected through 31 semi-structured in-depth interviews with altogether 24 Sami people experiencing disability and 13 next of kin of Sami people experiencing disability (8 mothers, 2 fathers, 2 sister and 1 guardian).

40|$|Increasingly, ethnographic {{methods in}} the social {{sciences}} are being robbed of their capacity to research problematic social groups given the increased “risk governance” to <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodological</b> practices. Positivism and constructing objective realities of these groups has become the order of the day, which has resulted in a ‘conceptual distance’ from these kinds of social groups. In this article, we advocate for a return to subjectivity using ethnography, and do so through highlighting examples from our experience from numerous projects undertaken with different youth cultures where alcohol is central to individual identities and collective social norms. We show, on the one hand, that this kind of research is possible but it requires the researcher to adopt versatility and fieldwork flexibility, while on the other, in some ways to abandon their ethical conceptions of what they are expected to objectively do and instead engage with the group under study. In the paper, we challenge various <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodological</b> dilemmas related to this kind of research...|$|E

40|$|Extract] The {{appropriate}} {{conduct of}} health research in Indigenous communities {{is an ongoing}} topic of discussion, underpinned by <b>ethical,</b> epistemological <b>and</b> <b>methodological</b> issues.

Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council's (NHMRC) 'Road Maps I and II: Strategic Framework for Improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health through Research' provide researcher guidelines to ensure the needs and concerns of Indigenous Australian (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) communities are met.

40|$|Abstract: Diabetes is {{the most}} {{significant}} chronic disease and the global prevalence is increasing. Diabetes is associated with debilitating long term complications and other comorbidities that cause high rates of morbidity and mortality. Keeping blood glucose and other metabolic parameters within an acceptable, personalised range is important to comfort and quality of life but can be challenging, especially during end-of-life care. Guidelines can help clinicians make appropriate care decisions; however, there is little research about what constitutes best practice diabetes care at the end-of-life: existing recommendations and guidelines blend the best available evidence with consensus opinion. In addition, there are important <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodological</b> considerations concerning research involving vulnerable people at the end-of-life. Chapter 3 describes the <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> <b>methodological</b> issues that needed to be considered when developing guidelines for managing diabetes at the end-of-life and the contribution interviews with dying people and their family carers made to developing a guiding philosophy and to person-centred guidelines...|$|E

40|$|Researching {{ethnicity}} and health presents significant <b>ethical,</b> conceptual <b>and</b> <b>methodological</b> challenges. While the potential contribution of research evidence to tackling ethnic inequalities in health is recognised, there are widespread concerns regarding the <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> scientific rigour {{of much of}} this research and its potential to {{do more harm than}} good. The introduction of guidance documents at critical points in the research cycle - including within the peer-review publication process - might be one way to enhance the quality of such research.

The checklist was positively received by authors and reviewers, the majority of whom reported it to be comprehensible, relevant and potentially useful in improving the quality of published research. However, participation in the pilot was poor, suggesting that the impact of such a checklist would be very limited unless it was perceived to be an aid to authors and reviewers, rather than an additional burden, and was strongly promoted by journal editors...|$|R
