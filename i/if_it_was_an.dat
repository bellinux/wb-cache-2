5|$|The {{most recent}} {{substantial}} {{revision of the}} election law came in February 2015, and was partially upheld by the Constitutional Court in September 2015. An element of preferential voting was introduced by letting voters choose not only {{for a list of}} candidates, but also a single member of the same list. If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10%, they are elected as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> open list system. The list ranking is maintained for those candidates that do not meet this quota.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} d'Hondt {{formula is}} applied to the vote (except for the twelfth constituency in which national minority representatives are elected), with a five-percent election threshold in each constituency. Since 2015, the parliamentary elections have an element of preferential voting by letting voters choose not only for a list of candidates, but also a single member of the same list. If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10%, they are elected as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> open list system. The list ranking is maintained for those candidates that do not meet this quota.|$|E
25|$|The {{hostage crisis}} was {{resolved}} {{by a combined}} police and military intervention, which was able to rescue 10 hostages. The end of the crisis saw the deaths of five hostages, including Hamill, {{as well as all}} 16 hostage takers. It is unclear if the five deaths among the hostages was a consequence of the intervention or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> act commited by the inmates.|$|E

25|$|The film {{also made}} many {{references}} to the political situation in Europe. Turkey, which was a neutral country during the war but a rival of the Soviet Union in the Cold War, was portrayed as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> Axis state; the Turkish ambassador even greeted Hitler {{in the name of}} İsmet İnönü. The Nazi sympathies of Vatican ambassador Cesare Orsenigo were emphasized as well. Churchill, seen as an enemy after his 1946 Fulton Speech, was portrayed in a highly negative fashion.|$|E
25|$|In Ng Chee Tiong Tony v. Public Prosecutor (2007), Justice Lee Seiu Kin {{set aside}} a trial judge's {{decision}} as he held that the judge had descended into the arena and joined in the fray. This {{was evident in the}} manner the trial judge had questioned the witnesses. There were excessive questions by the judge, especially some in the nature of a cross-examination. The conclusions formed by the judge also arose out of the line of questioning that she herself had adopted. The High Court also mentioned that it was the duty of the Prosecution to bring out the evidence to prove its case and not the judge's duty to do so, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> attempt to make up for any shortfall in the conduct of the case by the prosecutor.|$|E
25|$|Although WTTV was the longer-established {{of the two}} stations, Tribune {{chose to}} keep the Fox {{affiliation}} on WXIN {{due in part to}} WTTV's then-weaker analog signal {{in the northern part of}} the market. Additionally, the NFL on Fox, until the 2014 implementation of Fox/CBS cross-flex scheduling, could only carry two Indianapolis Colts home games with National Football Conference (NFC) opponents each year as the team is part of the National Football League's American Football Conference (AFC), so the need for Fox to have an analog-era VHF affiliate in the market was less important than <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> NFC market. WTTV merged its operations with those of WXIN in 2004, when the latter moved its operations into new facilities at 6910 Network Place at the Intech Park office development on the city's northwest side.|$|E

25|$|Tanith is briefly {{visited in}} Ghostmaker, and {{described}} by the Ghosts in various novels. It was a heavily forested world located in the Sabbat Worlds, a cluster of planets in the Segmentum Pacificus. The main export of Tanith was nalwood, which becomes extremely rare after the planet's destruction. Nalwood trees were capable of uprooting and moving; entire forests migrating and making paths through the forests useless as the constant movement erased them. As a result of this, the Tanith have {{a strong sense of}} direction, bred into them by adapting to this environment. It is assumed that Tanith had one major sea or ocean and polar ice caps. Although Tanith's oceans are never mentioned, Trooper Lesp is said to have come from a coastal settlement called Tanith Longshore, where he worked in the fishing industry; confirming that there was at least one sea on Tanith's surface. The capital city of Tanith – surrounded by a giant wall, presumably to keep the nalwood trees from moving into the city – was Tanith Magna. The world was governed by an Elector, and the main governmental building appears to be the Assembly (although Rawne mentions a place called the Elector's Palace when under the influence of psykers on Monthax). It is unclear {{as to whether or not}} the Elector was elected as the title sounds, or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> inherited position like a king. Tanith was split up into counties, not unlike Ireland (Counties Pryze and Cuhulic are mentioned). Each city on Tanith had a Militia, from which a number of Ghosts (including Corbec, Larkin, Mkvenner and Rawne) are drafted into the Imperial Guard. Tanith's native wildlife included larisel, small animals hunted by woodsmen – for their fur and possibly for food – and shoggy; small amphibian creatures with bulging eyes that dwelled by woodland pools in Tanith's forests.|$|E
500|$|Most {{recent studies}} have disputed that the tower was ever part of a church, arguing instead {{that it was a}} small Norman keep. Architecturally, the tower closely resembles other square keeps of the period. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> ecclesiastical building, it would have been {{extremely}} large in comparison {{with the rest of the}} relatively small church, and there is no evidence to indicate that it ever had a religious function.|$|E

The album's 12th track, [...] "One More Last Kiss", contains longing lyrics discussing Durand's final moments with a lover. Its composition consists of guitar passages {{similar to the}} majority of those on the album.

500|$|Actor John Barrowman {{himself was}} {{a key factor in}} the {{conception}} of Captain Jack. Barrowman says {{that at the time of}} his initial casting, Davies and co-executive producer, Julie Gardner had explained to him that they [...] "basically wrote the character around [...] ". Davies had singled out Barrowman for the part. On meeting him, Barrowman tried out the character using his native Scottish accent, his normal American accent, and an English accent; Davies decided it [...] "made it bigger <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> American accent". Barrowman recounts Davies as having been searching for an actor with a [...] "matinée idol quality", telling him that [...] "the only one in the whole of Britain who could do it was you". A number of television critics have compared Barrowman's performances as Captain Jack to those of Hollywood actor Tom Cruise.|$|E
500|$|When {{the news}} of the {{imminent}} death sentence arrives, Zeenat is compelled to tell the truth to Meera. Meera is shocked beyond belief to hear Zeenat's words. The fact that her friendship was based on false pretenses is what hurts her more. She immediately refuses to sign the maafinama (statement of forgiveness). She makes it clear that she wants to hurt her husband's murderer, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> accident, because of how much she is hurting in her new, veiled life. She leaves for the haveli. Zeenat, initially, is deeply hurt from Meera's decision but eventually accepts it as fate and decides to leave for her hometown. Meera later has a change of heart, perhaps because of her disillusionment at Randhir's willingness to [...] "sell" [...] her to Chopra. She gets encouragement from her paternal grandmother and hurries towards the railway station, where she meets Zeenat and gives her the signed statement of forgiveness. Zeenat extends her hand from the train and Meera grabs it and climbs aboard, presumably running away from the only life she has ever known, as the train speeds up into the distance.|$|E
500|$|John Barrowman {{appears as}} Captain Jack Harkness, a {{character}} introduced in [...] "The Empty Child", where {{he joined the}} TARDIS crew for the final five episodes of the series. In naming the character, Davies drew inspiration from the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness. Jack's appearances were conceived {{with the intention of}} forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero, and Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character. Following on that arc, the character's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous, publicity materials asking, [...] "is he a force for good or ill?" [...] Barrowman himself was a key factor in the conception of Captain Jack. Barrowman says {{that at the time of}} his initial casting, Davies and co-executive producer, Julie Gardner had explained to him that they [...] "basically wrote the character around [...] ".

500|$|After the Bears punted on {{the opening}} drive, the Packers reached Chicago's five-yard line, but Rodgers was intercepted by Chris Conte. Chicago scored on the {{following}} possession with Forté's four-yard run. In the second quarter, Rodgers was intercepted by Tim Jennings. After the Packers scored on Mason Crosby's 33-yard field goal, Devin Hester fumbled on the kickoff, but recovered; the Bears {{would be forced to}} punt. After Green Bay reached Chicago's 17-yard line, Rodgers was hit by Julius Peppers, with the ball leaving his hand as his arm went forward; the players did not attempt to recover the ball, as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> incompletion, but the referees did not consider the play dead. Jarrett Boykin subsequently picked up the ball, and scored on the play. On the Bears' next drive, Cutler's pass to Alshon Jeffery was stripped by Tramon Williams, and was recovered by Morgan Burnett. Crosby scored the final score of the first half with a 27-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bears regained the lead with Forté's five-yard touchdown run. Both teams exchanged scores on the next two drives of the game, with the Packers scoring on Rodgers' seven-yard touchdown throw to Randall Cobb, followed by Forté's one-yard touchdown run, ending the quarter with the Bears leading 21–20. On the first play of the final quarter, Cutler threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall, which the Packers retaliated with Eddie Lacy's six-yard touchdown run. After the Bears punted, the Packers reached the Bears' 48-yard line with 48 seconds left. Defensive coordinator Mel Tucker called a blitz, but Conte failed to apply man-to-man coverage, allowing Cobb to score the game-winning touchdown. However, the Packers failed the two-point conversion, making the score 33–28. The Bears received the ball with 38 seconds left, and reached the Packers' 45-yard line, where Cutler's Hail Mary pass for [...] Marshall was intercepted by Sam Shields as time expired.|$|E
