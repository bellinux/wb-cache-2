5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{is a form}} of elastic scattering; {{the outgoing}} X-rays have the same energy, and thus same wavelength, as the incoming X-rays, only with altered direction. By contrast, inelastic scattering occurs when energy is transferred from the incoming X-ray to the crystal, e.g., by exciting an inner-shell electron to a higher energy level. Such inelastic scattering reduces the energy (or increases the wavelength) of the outgoing beam. Inelastic scattering is useful for probing such <b>excitations</b> of matter, but not in determining the distribution of scatterers within the matter, which is the goal of X-ray crystallography.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{switched}} <b>excitation</b> {{method for}} linear frequency modulated <b>excitation</b> of ultrasonic transducers in pulse compression systems is presented that is simple to realise, yet provides reduced signal sidelobes at {{the output of}} the matched filter compared to bipolar pseudo-chirp <b>excitation.</b> Pulse compression signal sidelobes are reduced through the use of simple amplitude tapering {{at the beginning and end}} of the <b>excitation</b> duration. Amplitude tapering using switched <b>excitation</b> is realised through the use of intermediate voltage switching levels, half that of the main <b>excitation</b> voltages. In total five <b>excitation</b> voltages are used creating a quinary <b>excitation</b> system. The absence of analogue signal generation and power amplifiers renders the <b>excitation</b> method attractive for applications with requirements such as a high channel count or low cost per channel. A systematic study of switched linear frequency modulated <b>excitation</b> methods with simulated and laboratory based experimental verification is presented for 2. 25 MHz non-destructive testing immersion transducers. The signal to sidelobe noise level of compressed waveforms generated using quinary and bipolar pseudo-chirp <b>excitation</b> are investigated for transmission through a 0. 5 m water and kaolin slurry channel. Quinary linear frequency modulated <b>excitation</b> consistently reduces signal sidelobe power compared to bipolar <b>excitation</b> methods. Experimental results for transmission between two 2. 25 MHz transducers separated by a 0. 5 m channel of water and 5 % kaolin suspension shows improvements in signal to sidelobe noise power in the order of 7 - 8 dB.

The results show that the <b>excitation</b> from OAM can provide approximately 64 per cent of the required energy of the observed CW <b>excitation,</b> while the energy from AAM <b>excitation</b> is comparable with that of the observed CW <b>excitation</b> sometimes, but it is far less than that of the observed one at other times. The multitaper coherence analysis method is also used to investigate the relationship between the observed CW <b>excitation</b> and the geophysical <b>excitation</b> derived from OAM and AAM in the frequency domain. The results show that there is a high coherence (0. 52) between the OAM <b>excitation</b> and the observed one during 1985 - 1995, while large fluctuations of the coherence and linear trend of the coherent phases exist between the AAM <b>excitation</b> and the observed one during 1962 - 2000.

The lower <b>excitation</b> wavelength, 532 nm, corresponds to <b>excitation</b> 270 me V above the band gap. The higher energy, 405 nm, corresponds to <b>excitation</b> 1000 me V above the band gap.

While <b>excitation</b> at 485 nm produces the known four-state scheme (S- 2 -> hot S- 1 -> S- 1 -> S- 0), excess energy <b>excitation</b> led to additional dynamics occurring with a time constant of 2. 8 ps (400 nm <b>excitation)</b> and 4. 9 ps (266 nm <b>excitation),</b> respectively. This process is ascribed to a conformational relaxation of conformers generated by the excess energy <b>excitation.</b> The zeaxanthin S* state was observed regardless of the <b>excitation</b> wavelength, but its population increased after 400 and 266 nm <b>excitation,</b> suggesting that conformers generated by the excess energy <b>excitation</b> are important for directing the population toward the S* state. The S- 2 -S- 1 internal conversion time was shortened from 135 to 70 fs when going from 485 to 400 nm <b>excitation,</b> as a result of competition between the S- 2 -S- 1 internal conversion from the vibrationally hot S 2 state and S 2 vibrational relaxation.
