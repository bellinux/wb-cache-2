In this paper, the effect of <b>Gaussian</b> <b>blurring</b> on the extraction of peaks and pits from digital elevation models (DEMs) is studied. First, a mathematical morphological-based algorithm to extract peaks and pits from DEMs is developed. <b>Gaussian</b> <b>blurring</b> is then implemented on the global digital elevation model (GTOPO 30) of Great Basin using Gaussian kernels of different sizes and standard deviation values. The number of peaks and pits extracted from the resultant DEMs is computed using connected component labeling and the results are compared. The application of <b>Gaussian</b> <b>blurring</b> to perform the treatment of spurious peaks and pits in DEMs is also discussed.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a computationally efficient al-gorithm for smoothly space-variant <b>Gaussian</b> <b>blurring</b> of images. The proposed algorithm uses a specialized filter bank with optimal filters computed through principal component analysis. This filter bank approximates perfect space-variant <b>Gaussian</b> <b>blurring</b> to arbitrarily high accuracy and at greatly reduced computational cost {{compared to the}} brute force approach of employing a separate low-pass filter at each image location. This is particularly important for spatially variant image pro-cessing such as foveated coding.

25|$|Gaussian {{smoothing}} {{is commonly}} used with edge detection. Most edge-detection algorithms are sensitive to noise; the 2-D Laplacian filter, built from a discretization of the Laplace operator, is highly sensitive to noisy environments. Using a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>Blur</b> filter before edge detection aims to reduce the level of noise in the image, which improves {{the result of the}} following edge-detection algorithm. This approach is commonly referred to as Laplacian of Gaussian, or LoG filtering.|$|E
25|$|There is {{support for}} several methods of {{sharpening}} and blurring images, including the blur and sharpen tool. The unsharp mask tool {{is used to}} sharpen an image selectively— it only sharpens areas of an image that are sufficiently detailed. The Unsharp Mask tool is considered to give more targeted results for photographs than a normal sharpening filter. The Selective <b>Gaussian</b> <b>Blur</b> tool works in a similar way, except it blurs areas of an image with little detail.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Gaussian</b> <b>blur</b> {{effect is}} {{typically}} generated by convolving an image with a kernel of Gaussian values. In practice, {{it is best}} {{to take advantage of the}} Gaussian blur’s separable property by dividing the process into two passes. In the first pass, a one-dimensional kernel is used to blur the image in only the horizontal or vertical direction. In the second pass, the same one-dimensional kernel is used to blur in the remaining direction. The resulting effect is the same as convolving with a two-dimensional kernel in a single pass, but requires fewer calculations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gaussian</b> <b>blurring</b> is {{commonly}} used when reducing {{the size of an}} image. When downsampling an image, it is common to apply a low-pass filter to the image prior to resampling. This is to ensure that spurious high-frequency information does not appear in the downsampled image (aliasing). <b>Gaussian</b> <b>blurs</b> have nice properties, such as having no sharp edges, and thus do not introduce ringing into the filtered image.|$|R

While accurate length measurements can be calculated from cells in 2 D culture, measurements in tissue or 3 D culture are inherently difficult due to optical distortions. This study uses a novel combination of image processing techniques to rectify optical distortions and accurately measure cilia length from 3 D images. Methods Point spread functions and experimental resolutions were calculated from subresolution microspheres embedded in 3 D agarose gels for both wide-field fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopes. The degree of axial smearing and spherical aberration was calculated from xy : xz diameter ratios of 3 D image data sets of 4 μm microspheres that had undergone deconvolution and/or <b>Gaussian</b> <b>blurring.</b> Custom-made 18 and 50 μm fluorescent microfibers were also used as calibration objects to test the suitability of processed image sets for 3 D skeletonization. Microfiber length in 2 D was first measured to establish an original population mean. Fibers were then embedded in 3 D agarose gels to act as ciliary models. 3 D image sets of microfibers underwent deconvolution and <b>Gaussian</b> <b>blurring.</b> Length measurements within 1 standard deviation of the original 2 D population mean were deemed accurate. Finally, the combined method of deconvolution, <b>Gaussian</b> <b>blurring</b> and skeletonization was compared to previously published methods using images of immunofluorescently labeled renal and chondrocyte primary cilia. Results Deconvolution significantly improved contrast and resolution but did not restore the xy : xz diameter ratio (0. 80). Only the additional step of <b>Gaussian</b> <b>blurring</b> equalized xy and xz resolutions and yielded a diameter ratio of 1. 02. Following image processing, skeletonization successfully estimated microfiber boundaries and allowed reliable and repeatable measurement of fiber lengths in 3 D. We {{also found that the}} previously published method of calculating length from 2 D maximum projection images significantly underestimated ciliary length. Conclusions This study used commercial and public domain image processing software to rectify a long-standing problem of 3 D microscopy. We have shown that a combination of deconvolution and <b>Gaussian</b> <b>blurring</b> rectifies optical distortions inherent in 3 D images and allows accurate skeletonization and length measurement of microfibers and primary cilia that are bent or curved in 3 D space. </p...|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to being circularly symmetric, the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>blur</b> {{can be applied to}} a two-dimensional image as two independent one-dimensional calculations, and so is termed separable filter.
