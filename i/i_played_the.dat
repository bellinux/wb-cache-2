5|$|Asked {{what impact}} {{the money would}} have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play the}} same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> game, and what I did on the field.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{watching}} {{the tape of}} the beating, LAPD chief of police Daryl Gates said: I stared at the screen in disbelief. <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E
25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way <b>I</b> <b>played.</b> <b>The</b> reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E

500|$|For the {{recording}} session, Dylan invited Mike Bloomfield from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band to play lead guitar. Invited to Dylan's Woodstock {{home for the}} weekend to learn new material, Bloomfield recalled, [...] "The first thing I heard was 'Like a Rolling Stone'. I figured he wanted blues, string bending, because that's what I do. He said, 'Hey, man, I don't want any of that B.B. King stuff'. So, OK, I really fell apart. What the heck does he want? We messed around with the song. <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> way that he dug, {{and he said it}} was groovy." ...|$|E
500|$|Augustus' famous {{last words}} were, [...] "Have <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> part well? Then applaud as I exit"—referring to the play-acting and regal {{authority}} {{that he had}} put on as emperor. Publicly, though, his last words were, [...] "Behold, I found Rome of clay, and leave her to you of marble." [...] An enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with Augustus' body from Nola to Rome, and {{on the day of}} his burial all public and private businesses closed for the day. Tiberius and his son Drusus delivered the eulogy while standing atop two rostra. Augustus' body was coffin-bound and cremated on a pyre close to his mausoleum. It was proclaimed that Augustus joined the company of the gods {{as a member of the}} Roman pantheon. The mausoleum was despoiled by the Goths in 410 during the Sack of Rome, and his ashes were scattered.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} then added tambourine, conga drum and bongos over the coda. This last {{section of the}} song came about while the group were working in the studio. Lennon, who was {{otherwise}} highly critical of [...] "Hello, Goodbye", approved of the addition, saying: [...] "The best bit was the end, which we all ad-libbed in the studio, where <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> piano. Like one of my favourite bits on 'Ticket to Ride', where we just threw something in at the end." [...] In McCartney's recollection, the coda [...] "didn't sound quite right" [...] until Emerick increased the reverberation on the tom-tom drums, at which point, [...] "it just came alive." [...] Everett cites the [...] "Maori finale" [...] {{as an example of}} the Beatles' pioneering use of codas in their recordings; in this instance, they provided [...] "the cold ending followed by an unrelated coda", having similarly pioneered the [...] "fade-out–fade-in coda" [...] at the end of [...] "Rain" [...] and [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever".|$|E

500|$|The {{influential}} distortion {{sound of}} the guitar track was created after guitarist Dave Davies sliced the speaker cone of his guitar amplifier with a razor blade and poked it with a pin. The amplifier was affectionately called [...] "little green", after {{the name of the}} amplifier made by the Elpico company, and purchased in Davies' neighbourhood music shop, linked to a Vox AC-30. In 2014, Dave Davies accused brother Ray of lying about participating in Dave's guitar distortion sound. Dave wrote on his Facebook page, [...] "My brother is lying. I don't know why he [...] does this but it was my Elpico amp that I bought and out of frustration I cut the speaker cone up with a razor blade and I was so shocked and [...] surprised and excited that it worked that I demonstrated the sound to Ray and [...] Pete [...] … Ray liked the sound and he had written a riff on the piano which formed the basis of the song 'You Really Got Me' and <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> riff on my guitar with my new sound. I alone created this sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Ross favorably {{compared}} the recording sessions to his past in school. He mused, [...] "it's like everybody is a student: You {{walk into a}} session, and it's all about the subject at hand." [...] The remastered album version featured a new guitar solo, composed by producer Bink!. Bink! is most famous for his contributions to Jay-Z's album, The Blueprint, which has been described a [...] "pioneering album" [...] by Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal and was West's big break as a producer. West and Bink! originally became friends while producing another Jay-Z album, [...] in the late 1990s. Bink! described that the two producers quickly developed a mutual respect for each other. Bink! commented on {{the first time he}} showed the composition to West, saying [...] "the reaction I got from him after <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> beat for the first time was real intense." [...] Immediately Bink! knew that West was going to use the production. Initially, he wasn't sure whether or how West was going to use the song for his album, and expressed surprise that West dropped the song as a free track prior to the album's release.|$|E
500|$|Nixon infused {{elements}} of those literatures into the Dimitri and Natalie romance with as well. [...] "There's a gothic quality to it", she said, {{referring to the}} couple. [...] "It's Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Everybody loves somebody who has a past and a secret- and certainly Dimitri does- which we haven't divulged yet. That heightens ones interest and suspense. It's a special situation but what really makes it special is the actor's talent, personalities, good looks, and chemistry." [...] Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character, Michael Nader mostly {{stayed away from the}} press in order to help maintain that image. Whenever he did do an interview, he discussed the character {{in such a way as}} to add more mystery. Nader compared Dimitri to the Dynasty character he once portrayed, Dex Dexter. On Dynasty, [...] "John James (Jeff Colby) played the 'aw, shucks;' nice guy, and <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> guy who was on the edge, who would take care of business and not take any bull", he said. [...] "Dimitri is sort of a darker Dex. Though I don't know exactly how dark to make him yet." [...] Nader, as an actor, also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character. [...] "The more we see of him, the more he inspires us", Broderick said. [...] "It's just a wonderful marriage of actor and character He's giving us so many levels and such depth, that it's a challenge. But it's exciting. Dimitri is one of the characters that is so much fun to write." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early in {{his career}} at Hardin–Simmons, Turner and {{teammate}} A. J. Roy encouraged each other in practice sessions by referring to each other by nicknames. Turner was given the nickname [...] "Bulldog", and Roy was known as [...] "Tiger". Turner later recalled his college experience as follows: [...] "We got room, board and tuition, {{but we had to}} buy our own books and we were supposed to take care of two jobs. I had to sweep out the gym and wait tables, but I kind of farmed out the sweeping after a while. It was tough but I loved it.

So I played five or six tracks on the next show and immediately I received mail from people demanding that I never play stuff like that again. Whenever that happens I always go in the opposite direction, so I played more and it was great!

2500|$|Depeche Mode's origins date to 1977, when schoolmates Vince Clarke and Andy Fletcher {{formed a}} Cure-influenced band called No Romance In China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass. Fletcher would later recall, [...] "Why am I in the band? It was {{accidental}} {{right from the}} beginning. I was actually forced {{to be in the}} band. <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> guitar and I had a bass; {{it was a question of}} them roping me in." [...] In 1979, Clarke played guitar in an [...] "Ultravox rip-off band", The Plan, with friends Robert Marlow and Paul Langwith. In 1978–79, Martin Gore played guitar in an acoustic duo, Norman and the Worms, with school friend Phil Burdett on vocals. In 1979, Marlow, Gore and friend Paul Redmond formed a band called the French Look, with Marlow on vocals/keyboards, Gore on guitar and Redmond on keyboards. In March 1980, Clarke, Gore and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards and Fletcher on bass.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lowering}} of Boat 9 at 1:30a.m. with about 56 aboard was supervised by Murdoch, possibly with Moody assisting. [...] Boatswain's mate Albert Hames {{was put in}} charge with Able-Bodied Seaman George McGough at the tiller. Most passengers were women, with two or three men who entered when no more women came forward. One elderly woman refused to board, making a great fuss, and retreated below decks. May Futrelle, the wife of novelist Jacques Futrelle, was likewise initially reluctant to board; but after her husband told her, [...] "For God's sake, go! It's your last chance! Go!", an officer forced her into the boat. The millionnaire Benjamin Guggenheim brought Léontine Aubart, his French mistress, and her maid, Emma Sägasser, to Boat 9 before retiring to his stateroom with his valet, Victor Giglio. Both men removed their life jackets and put on their evening clothes. Guggenheim told a steward, [...] "We've dressed in our best, and are prepared to go down like gentlemen. There is grave doubt that the men will get off. I am willing to remain and play the man's game if there are not enough boats for more than the women and children. I won't die here like a beast. Tell my wife <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> game out straight and to the end. No women shall be left aboard this ship because Ben Guggenheim was a coward." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Leslie Moore on Tumblr, Cainon Lamb recalled how he started working on the Boyz II Men's sample and how his work reached Knowles. He said that he began working on [...] "Countdown" [...] during the night preceding the 2010 BET Awards. He was in the studio, listening to Boyz II Men's song, [...] "Uhh Ahh". He commented: [...] " [...] starts with a countdown of '10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'. So I thought, 'Wow, that could be something. Just the countdown itself.'" [...] Once the countdown was in the computer, he slightly increased the pace at which it was played, added some snare drum taps to it, and started a beat. After that, he sent the song to his publisher, EMI Music. The latter {{was impressed with the}} instrumental and went on saying: [...] "I had a meeting this morning with Beyoncé and I played a couple other songs I had and she wasn't really feeling them. When <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> beat that you sent me, you should have seen how she went crazy! She started dancing and bouncing up and down and just doing all kind of stuff. She loved that beat!" [...] On the request of his publisher, Lamb made [...] "a female version of the countdown part". Terius Nash wrote the verses and two days later, Knowles went in the studio and recorded it.|$|E

5000|$|Breau's fully matured {{technique}} {{was a combination}} of Chet Atkins's and Merle Travis's fingerpicking and Sabicas-influenced flamenco, highlighted by right-hand independence and flurries of artificial harmonics. His harmonic sensibilities were a combination of his country roots, classical music, modal music, Indian, and jazz, particularly the work of pianist Bill Evans. Breau often adapted Evans's compositions, such as [...] "Funny Man", for guitar. Breau said in relation to this, [...] "I approach the guitar like a piano. I've reached a point where I transcend the instrument. A lot of <b>the</b> stuff <b>I</b> <b>play</b> on <b>the</b> seven-string guitar is supposed to be technically impossible, but I spent over twenty years figuring it out. <b>I</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> guitar like a piano, there's always two things going on at once.
