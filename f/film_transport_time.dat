The electrodes were of similar thickness (2 ím) and sensitized with zinc(II) meso-tetrakis(3 -carboxyphenyl) porphyrin, while the electrolyte was I-/I 3 - in 3 -methoxypropionitrile.

40|$|<b>Transport</b> <b>time</b> scales such as {{flushing}} time and residence time {{are often used}} to explain variability in phytoplankton biomass. In many cases, empirical data are consistent with a positive phytoplankton–transport time relationship (i. e., phytoplankton biomass increases as <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> increases).

We present a simple conceptual model, in both mathematical and graphical form, to help explain why phytoplankton may {{have a range of}} relationships with <b>transport</b> <b>time,</b> and we apply it to several real systems.

In this study, we present and evaluate a novel automated measurement system for selective vertical Thoron (Tn) profiles near the earth's surface and demonstrate its suitability for the direct and reliable determination of <b>transport</b> <b>times</b> within a natural grassland canopy. For the first time, we perform a rigorous determination of systematic and random uncertainties of Tn (and Rn) concentrations under field conditions {{for this type of}} measurement system. The obtained median precisions for three concentration classes (> 100 Bq m&minus; 3 , 100 – 15 Bq m&minus; 3 &minus; 3 ) were 8. 8 %, 23. 2 % and 132. 1 % for Tn (and 16. 6 %, 25. 0 %, 99. 2 % for Rn). We calculate in-canopy <b>transport</b> <b>times</b> (&tau;) and propagate it's uncertainty from the individual errors of the Tn concentration measurements. A quality assessment of &tau; for the field experiment revealed a good data quality with 44 % of the relative uncertainties below 50 %.

BackgroundPre-hospital ECG decreases door-to balloon (D 2 B) time for STEMI patients. However, obtaining a PH ECG might prolong scene time. We investigated the impact of obtaining a PH ECG on both scene and <b>transport</b> <b>times</b> for patients with chest pain suspected of cardiac origin. MethodsCity of San Diego Emergency Medical System runsheets of patients with chest pain from January 2003 to April 2008 were analyzed. The scene <b>times</b> and <b>transport</b> <b>times</b> were compared before (from January 2003 to December 2005) and after (from January 2006 to April 2008) implementation of the PH ECG. Among patients with a PH ECG, median scene <b>times</b> and <b>transport</b> <b>times</b> were compared in patients with and without STEMI. ResultsThere were 21, 742 patients evaluated for chest pain during the study period. Implementation of PH ECG resulted in minimal increases in median scene time (19 min, 10 s vs. 19 min, 28 s, p = 0. 002) and <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> (13 min, 16 s vs. 13 min, 28 s, p = 0. 007). However, compared with chest pain patients, in STEMI patients (n = 303), shorter median scene time (17 min, 51 s vs. 19 min, 31 s, p < 0. 001), <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> (12 min, 34 s vs. 13 min, 31 s, p = 0. 006), and scene-to-hospital time was observed (30 min, 45 s vs. 33 min, 29 s, p < 0. 001).

We build upon the classical isolation-by-distance regression model by asking how much additional variability in genetic differentiation is explained when adding <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> as predictor. We explored the extent to which gene flow is dependent upon seasonal changes in ocean circulation. Because oceanographic transport between two sites is inherently asymmetric, we also compare the explanatory power of models using the minimum or the mean <b>transport</b> <b>times.</b> Finally, we compare the direction of connectivity as estimated by the oceanographic model and genetic assignment tests. We show that the minimum <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> had higher explanatory power than the mean <b>transport</b> <b>time,</b> revealing the importance of considering asymmetry in ocean currents when modelling gene flow. Genetic assignment tests were much less effective in determining asymmetry in gene flow. Summer-derived <b>transport</b> <b>times,</b> in particular for the month of June, which had the strongest current speed, greatest asymmetry and highest spore production, resulted in the best-fit model explaining twice the variability in genetic differentiation relative to models that use geographic distance or habitat continuity.

40|$|The current report {{deals with}} the effect of <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> and {{associated}} <b>transport</b> conditions on animal welfare and meat quality. The work {{is part of the}} EU EU and Animal Welfare Agency /Swedish Board of Agriculture, funded project CATRA (QLK 5 — 1999 - 01507 : Minimising stress inducing factors on cattle during handling and transport to improve animal welfare and meat quality: www. bt. slu. se/catra/). The project was composed of eight work packages: Baseline survey, Effect of <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> (below 14 hours and long distance more than 14 hours), Effect of vibration and motion (to be conducted both in laboratory and field conditions), Optimising pre-and post-transport handling, Air quality in the vehicles, cattle transport logistics including route optimisation, and development of control system. The purpose of the project was to gather sufficient data and to develop methods for controlling and minimizing stress inducing factors during handling and transport of cattle; develop guide-lines and recommendation for end-users, such as meat and vehicle industries and the policy makers, to improve animal welfare and meat quality on the European level. This could be fulfilled through optimization of design of handling areas, transport vehicles, and transport-associated conditions, and by promoting an IT-supported effective logistic system. Hence cattle welfare and meat quality will be improved, thereby enhancing the economic competitiveness of producers and abattoirs. As part of CATRA, this part of the project is the work done in Sweden regarding the effect of <b>transport</b> <b>time,</b> with the objective of determining the effect of <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> (up to ll hours) on animal welfare and post mortem meat quality, when cattle are transported from farms to abattoirs by commercial vehicles. The ultimate objective is to optimise <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> in relation to welfare and meat quality taking into consideration other stress inducing factors. Animals on which the experiments performed were cows, heifers, bulls and calves. Response parameters that were considered were: blood parameters (cortisol, glucose, lactate, CK,), clinical parameters (heart rate, postural stability), meat parameters (bruising score, PH- 24, tenderness), and ethological parameters. Input parameters considered were parameters for loading facilities (ramps, lifts), penning systems (stocking density, social group, standing orientation, design of loading compartment), air quality (air speed, relative humidity, evenness of temperature in the compartment, level of NH 3, CO 2), vibration, <b>transport</b> <b>time,</b> resting time, and feeding regimes. Simultaneous and continuous measurement of heart rate, body temperature, air quality parameters, and video recording was conducted from farm to the abattoirs. Blood samples were taken before and after transport, and also during resting. The results obtained indicated that the transport and handling events are stressful for the animals as a whole, and loading and un-loading are among the most stressful events in the studied conditions. Regarding <b>transport</b> <b>time,</b> the results showed that <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> after six hours is particularly stressful for the animals when transported with usual vehicles without special equipments. In this case, it was reported a significant correlation between <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> and animal stress evaluated by physiological parameters. However, less detrimental effect of <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> on meat quality has been observed. It may therefore be concluded that <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> has influences more on animal welfare than meat quality when transported in conventional vehicles. Transport preceding and initiating conditions and processes such as keeping system, preparation, loading, planning and management, as well as unloading and lairage {{at the end of the}} transport chain are important challenges bearing various possibilities to improve welfare and meat quality. Loading and unloading facilities (such as ramp, driveways, and side-block) and quality, of floor have significant influence on both welfare and meat quality. Cattle from tied housing systems are more stressed by transport than untied cattle and there is a greater risk to develop bad carcass- and meat quality. As regard to air quality, the concentration level of ammonia and carbon dioxide increase with <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> and it occasionally passes the acceptable level when only natural ventilation is used. During the field experiment no detectable methane has been found. To prevent thermal stress, the installation of mechanical ventilation system (both for cooling and heating purposes) is recommended. The conclusions deduced from the current studies are as follows: - Transport conditions, as a whole is stressful for animals and compromise their welfare. - Loading and unloading activities are the most stress inducing factors identified using the heart rate measurements and behaviour observations - Result of the analysis of blood parameters showed that level of stress correlates with <b>transport</b> <b>time.</b> Calves are most sensitive to <b>transport</b> <b>time</b> followed by bulls, and cows are relatively less sensitive to transport length. - <b>Transport</b> <b>time</b> after six hours is stressful for the animals when transported with usual vehicles without special equipments.
