5|$|The {{restaurant}} carriages of the NSS {{were open}} to everyone, but dining was so expensive that only passengers travelling in first class used the service. Usually, three or four dishes were offered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> carriages. A four-course dinner cost five Norwegian kroner in the 1920s, which was expensive at the time. Warm dishes, such as soups and sauces, were usually prepared at a small stove <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> carriage's kitchen. On busy days, prepared steaks were delivered from rail depots.
