In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (<b>electrowinning).</b>|$|E

Several industrially important active metals (which react strongly with water) are produced commercially by electrolysis of their pyrochemical molten salts. Experiments using electrorefining to process spent nuclear fuel have been carried out.

5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore {{in a heap}} leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an <b>electrowinning</b> facility.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, a process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and <b>electrowinning</b> (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.|$|E
5|$|While {{mercury and}} zinc {{minerals}} {{are found in}} large enough quantities to be mined, cadmium is too similar to zinc and therefore is always present in small quantities in zinc ores from where it is recovered. Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran. At {{the current rate of}} consumption, these reserves are estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use. In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan. Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper <b>electrowinning</b> processes and by recovery from effluents. Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.|$|E

Considering the cathode dimensions (10. 0 cm * 10. 0 cm * 1. 25 cm), rather high volumes of solution (> 1 litre) can be treated with flow rates up to 1. 6 l/min. The process yield is obviously related to the solution concentration; it has been observed that, starting with a solution containing 200 ppm of Co 2 +, the yield is initially ~ 35 - 40 %, but it decreases to ~ 20 % when 80 % of the initial cobalt content has been <b>electrowon.</b> The yield increases up to ∼ 50 % if the carbon electrode is coated by cobalt.

Worldwide, 95% of the zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits, in which sphalerite (ZnS) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper, lead and iron.

50|$|The ores {{are treated}} by a sulfatizing roast in a {{fluidized}} bed furnace to convert copper and cobalt sulfides into soluble oxides and iron into insoluble hematite. The calcine is subsequently leached with sulfuric acid from the spent copper recovery electrolyte. Oxide concentrates are introduced at this leaching step {{to maintain the}} acid balance in the circuit. Iron and aluminum are removed from the leach solution {{by the addition of}} lime, and copper is <b>electrowon</b> on copper cathodes. A part of the spent electrolyte enters the cobalt recovery circuit and is purified by the removal of iron, copper, nickel, and zinc prior to the precipitation of cobalt as its hydroxide. This is accomplished by the addition of more lime to raise the pH until the remaining copper precipitates. This copper is sent back to the copper circuit. As more lime is then added, a copper-cobaltite precipitates and is fed back to the leaching process. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) is added (along with some metallic cobalt as a catalyst) to precipitate nickel sulfide (NiS). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) are then added to precipitate zinc sulfide (ZnS). Lime is then added to saturation to precipitate cobalt(II) hydroxide (Co(OH)2). In the final stages, this cobalt hydroxide is redissolved and the metal is refined by electrolysis. The resulting cobalt cathodes are crushed and vacuum degassed to obtain a pure cobalt metal.|$|R
40|$|The Intec Copper Process is an {{environmentally}} advantageous hydrometallurgical {{process for the}} production of high purity copper and associated precious metals from copper sulphide concentrates. The process uses a mixed chloride-bromide lixiviant in an elegant cyclic circuit to leach the copper into solution, rejecting the iron as stable hematite rather than as unstable jarosite. After purification of the pregnant liquor, copper is <b>electrowon</b> at London Metal Exchange Grade A purity, while the anodic energy of the cell is stored as the soluble species, Halex TM, for recycle as the regenerated lixiviant to the leach circuit. Both gold and silver are leached and recovered directly from this cyclic process without resorting to cyanide leaching of the residue. No liquid emissions result from the Intec Copper Process, whilst spent air and water vapour from the leach are released to the atmosphere. The sulphur in the minerals reports to the solids residue in elemental form, without the need for expensive handling of voluminous gaseous sulphur dioxide streams found in smelters. A significant difference to competing smelting and hydrometallurgical processes is that any mercury entering the process from the sulphide concentrate feed is recovered rather than reporting directly to waste or polluting the environment. Outside the process circuit itself, the Intec Copper Process has several notable environmental advantages over competing technologies: 1. Flexibility of scale with low capital and operating costs allow operation directly at the mill head at production rates as low as 15 000 tpa, significantly reducing environmental impacts from concentrates transport. 2. The ability to handle low-grade and dirty concentrates often allows greater recoveries in the mill, improving both the economics and environmental acceptability of a mine by reducing metal losses to tailings. 3. A comparison of the total energy requirements of the Intec Copper Process with those of competing technologies shows that the Intec Copper Process has the lowest energy consumption of any of the known hydrometallurgical processes, as well as improving upon pyrometallurgy under appropriate conditions...|$|R
40|$|Industries such as {{mining and}} {{industrial}} minerals, metallurgical, photo processing, textile, leather and chemical produce wastewater containing heavy metals that are hazardous to {{man and the}} environment. Photo processing waste effluents arise from X-ray, lithographic and photo processing operations. The photosensitive medium used in these operations is an emulsion of fine Ag halide matrix in gelatin. During fixing, the Ag" is removed by the fixer solution. The developer and bleach solutions also contain the Ag heavy metal. The recovery of Ag" from such wastewater may be done by electro-winning, metallic replacement, evaporation, ion exchange, reverse osmosis and electrodialysis. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the application of electro-winning technique for selective removal of Ag metals from photo processing effluent. The laboratory scale electro-winning cell was a beaker of 12. 7 cm in diameter and having a capacity of 250 ml. The anode was of stainless steel of size 7. 5 x 4. 5 cm 2. A carbon plate of 1 cm thick (7. 5 x 4. 5 cm 2 ") of 99. 5 % carbon was used as the cathode. The circuit consisted of an electrolyte bath a precision type milli-ammeter and an adjustable resistant in series, and a voltmeter connected across the electrodes in the bath. During the electrolysis, samples were taken after 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120 & 180 minutes intervals respectively at each of the current density values corresponding to 10, 20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 65, 70, 75, 80, 90, 100 & 110 From each solution three aliquots were pipeted out & analyzed In the electro-chemical method the <b>electrowinned</b> solution was filtered and the residue was treated with. Ammonium Nitrate reagent In the third approach the photo processing effluent was subjected to electro-winning process using a current: voltage ratio of 2. 2 to 2. 8. In the first approach, industrial photo processing effluent having 2400 -Pfm of Ag was subjected to electro-winning technique at current density of 82 mA/cm 2. However in three hours, only 14 % of Ag was deposited on the cathode and considerable amount of precipitate was visible {{at the bottom of the}} cell. This black precipitate resembled typical AgS precipitate and is thought to be formed due to oxidation of S 203 to elemental sulfur that preferentially binds with Ag". The interference from S drastically reduced the recovery potential of Ag at the investigated process condition thus rendering the process technically aid economically non viable. In the second approach, the same effluent was subjected to an electro chemical method giving 14 % of Ag deposition on cathode and 72 % of Ag was extracted from chemical methods. However the use of number of expensive chemicals and heating make this method economically less attractive. The use of very low voltage with a current: voltage ratio of 2. 2 - 2. 8 does not provide sufficient energy for oxidation of S 203 thus avoiding S interference on Ag" reduction. Under this process condition, a remarkable Ag recovery of 86 % was achieved at the current density of 82 mA/cm 2. The developed process conditions prove the technical feasibility of electro winning for Ag recovery and stimulate further investigations into optimization of cell configurations for industrial application...|$|R
2500|$|Solvent {{extraction}} – <b>electrowinning</b> (often {{referred to}} as [...] "SX–EW") is a process frequently applied for recovering copper from low-grade and/or oxidised copper ore.
