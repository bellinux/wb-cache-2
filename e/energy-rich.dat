5|$|Banksia inflorescences are <b>energy-rich</b> {{sources of}} food, and B. aquilonia nectar is a likely food item of the {{endangered}} mahogany glider (Petaurus gracilis), {{as well as many}} other mammals and birds. Avian species observed visiting the flower spikes include the bridled honeyeater, white-cheeked honeyeater, eastern spinebill and rainbow lorikeet.|$|E
5|$|In July, {{the diet}} {{switches}} increasingly to fruit. The protein needed for egg-laying {{and for the}} chicks to grow is replaced by fruit sugar which helps the birds to fatten for migration. Aphids are still taken while they are available, since they often contain sugars from the plant sap on which they feed. Blackcaps eat {{a wide range of}} small fruit, and squeeze out any seeds on a branch before consuming the pulp. This technique makes them an important propagator of mistletoe. The mistle thrush, which also favours that plant, is less beneficial since it tends to crush the seeds. Although any suitable fruit may be eaten, some have seasonal or local importance; elder makes up {{a large proportion of the}} diet of northern birds preparing for migration, and <b>energy-rich</b> olives and lentisc are favoured by blackcaps wintering in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The redox {{energy from}} NADH and FADH2 is {{transferred}} to oxygen (O2) in several steps via the electron transport chain. These <b>energy-rich</b> molecules are produced within the matrix via the citric acid cycle but are also produced in the cytoplasm by glycolysis. Reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm can be imported via the malate-aspartate shuttle system of antiporter proteins or feed into the electron transport chain using a glycerol phosphate shuttle. Protein complexes in the inner membrane (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase) perform the transfer and the incremental release of energy is used to pump protons (H+) into the intermembrane space. This process is efficient, but {{a small percentage of}} electrons may prematurely reduce oxygen, forming reactive oxygen species such as superoxide. This can cause oxidative stress in the mitochondria and may contribute to the decline in mitochondrial function associated with the aging process.|$|E
5|$|Most of the bivalve larvae that hatch from eggs in {{the water}} column feed on diatoms or other phytoplankton. In {{temperate}} regions, about 25% of species are lecithotrophic, depending on nutrients stored in the yolk of the egg where the main energy source is lipids. The longer the period is before the larva first feeds, the larger the egg and yolk need to be. The reproductive cost of producing these <b>energy-rich</b> eggs is high and they are usually smaller in number. For example, the Baltic tellin (Macoma balthica) produces few, high-energy eggs. The larvae hatching out of these rely on the energy reserves and do not feed. After about four days, they become D-stage larvae, when they first develop hinged, D-shaped valves. These larvae have a relatively small dispersal potential before settling out. The common mussel (Mytilus edulis) produces 10 times as many eggs that hatch into larvae and soon need to feed to survive and grow. They can disperse more widely as they remain planktonic for a much longer time.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is <b>energy-rich,</b> with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E
5|$|After {{hatching}} {{the chick}} is brooded by a parent {{until it is}} large enough to thermoregulate efficiently, and in some cases defend itself from predation. This guard stage lasts a short while for burrow-nesting species (2–3 days) but longer for surface nesting fulmars (around 16–20 days) and giant petrels (20–30 days). After the guard stage both parents feed the chick. In many species the parent's foraging strategy alternates between short trips lasting 1–3 days and longer trips of 5 days. The shorter trips, which are taken over the continental shelf, benefit the chick with faster growth, but longer trips to more productive pelagic feeding grounds are needed for the parents to maintain their own body condition. The meals are composed of both prey items and stomach oil, an <b>energy-rich</b> food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items, and gives procellariids and other Procellariifromes their distinctive musty smell. Chick development is quite slow for birds, with fledging taking place at around 2 months after hatching for the smaller species and 4 months for the largest species. The chicks of some species are abandoned by the parents; parents of other species continue to bring food to the nesting site after the chick has left. Chicks put on weight quickly and some can outweigh their parents; although, they will slim down before they leave the nest. All procellariid chicks fledge by themselves, and there is no further parental care after fledging. Life expectancy of Procellariidae is between 15 and 20 years; although, the oldest recorded member was a northern fulmar that was over 50 years.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis {{prefers to}} eat {{crayfish}} and other crustaceans, but also takes aquatic insects and small fish. Outside the nesting season, the diet is highly variable, as abundance {{and types of}} prey depend on the both region and habitat. In Los Llanos, located {{on the border of}} Colombia and Venezuela, the most frequent prey are insects, such as fly larvae and beetles. Generally in North America the main prey are crustaceans, mostly crayfish. In the Everglades and cypress swamps, the diet is primarily made up of crayfish, while those that feed in willow ponds eat predominantly fish. American white ibises that feed in mangrove swamps focus on crabs. The tactile nature of the ibis's probing for food in mud means that it catches prey that are too slow to evade the ibis once located by its bill. In the Everglades, this means that crayfish make up {{a large part of the}} diet, but a more diverse array of invertebrates are taken in coastal areas. Although crayfish are sought by foraging ibises, prey switching to fish does occur if fish are found in great abundance. It is unclear whether the fish are more easily caught if overcrowded, or whether sheer numbers of fish mean that ibises are catching them instead of crayfish—normally, fish are more agile than crayfish and hence elude the ibis's bill more easily. Fish are a more <b>energy-rich</b> source of food for the American white ibis. In the breeding season, American white ibises in a colony at Pumpkinseed Island travelled further to forage in freshwater wetlands and catch crayfish, than nearby saltwater areas where fiddler crabs predominated, indicating their benefit was worth the extra energy expended in fetching them for their young. This travel results in the wholesale transport of nutrients across the landscape by the colony; in a successful breeding year the colony at Pumpkinseed Island was estimated to have contributed a third as much phosphorus to the neighboring estuary as other environmental processes.|$|E
25|$|Algae fuel, algal biofuel, or algal oil is an {{alternative}} to liquid fossil fuels that uses algae as its source of <b>energy-rich</b> oils. Also, algae fuels are {{an alternative}} to commonly known biofuel sources, such as corn and sugarcane.|$|E
25|$|As taste senses both harmful and {{beneficial}} things, all basic tastes {{are classified as}} either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on our bodies. Sweetness helps to identify <b>energy-rich</b> foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons.|$|E
25|$|SCO: India and Pakistan, both {{declared}} Nuclear Weapons States, {{have started}} the process towards full membership to Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) at the 2015 SCO summit in Ufa. The accession process {{is expected to}} be completed before the 2017 SCO summit in Astana. India's SCO membership is expected to reinforce India's influence in <b>energy-rich</b> Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|The {{second half}} of {{glycolysis}} {{is known as the}} pay-off phase, characterised by a net gain of the <b>energy-rich</b> molecules ATP and NADH. Since glucose leads to two triose sugars in the preparatory phase, each reaction in the pay-off phase occurs twice per glucose molecule. This yields 2 NADH molecules and 4 ATP molecules, leading to a net gain of 2 NADH molecules and 2 ATP molecules from the glycolytic pathway per glucose.|$|E
25|$|The EU {{has five}} key points in its energy policy: {{increase}} {{competition in the}} internal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems {{to respond to a}} crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with <b>energy-rich</b> states in Central Asia and North Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing renewable energy commercialisation; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{consumption}} of {{large quantities of}} any <b>energy-rich</b> food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can {{increase the risk of}} weight gain and possibly obesity. Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter, a fat which is removed during chocolate refining, then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk as well, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that the long necks of sauropod dinosaurs may have evolved specifically for browsing the foliage of the typically very tall A. mirabilis and other Araucaria trees. The <b>energy-rich</b> Araucaria leaves required long digestion times and were low in protein. This and the global distribution of vast forests of Araucaria makes it likely {{that they were the}} primary food sources for adult sauropods during the Jurassic. Juveniles, however, which lacked the bulk of the adults and required larger amounts of proteins for growth, probably subsisted on other plants.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the life}} that covers {{the surface of the}} Earth depends {{directly}} or indirectly on photosynthesis. The most common form, oxygenic photosynthesis, turns carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into food. It captures the energy of sunlight in <b>energy-rich</b> molecules such as ATP, which then provide the energy to make sugars. To supply the electrons in the circuit, hydrogen is stripped from water, leaving oxygen as a waste product. Some organisms, including purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria, use an anoxygenic form of photosynthesis that uses alternatives to hydrogen stripped from water as electron donors; examples are hydrogen sulfide, sulfur and iron. Such extremophile organisms are restricted to otherwise inhospitable environments such as hot springs and hydrothermal vents.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fields}} were {{stripped}} of their fertility, however, the city found itself positioned {{next to one of}} the largest oil fields ever produced in Oklahoma, the Healdton Oil Field. After its discovery in 1913, entrepreneurs and wildcatters flooded the area, and Carter County quickly became the largest oil-producing county in Oklahoma, and has remained so ever since. Ardmore has remained an energy center for the region ever since, with the region's natural wealth giving birth to such energy giants as Halliburton and the Noble Energy companies, among others. Ardmore also learned the perils of being <b>energy-rich</b> with yet another disaster in 1915, when a railroad car containing casing gas exploded, killing 45 people and destroying much of downtown, including areas rebuilt after the 1895 fire. The disaster, which made national news, gave residents the resolve to establish the city's first fire department to ensure that such events would not recur in the future. The city has not experienced any major setbacks since the 1915 fire, save a 1995 tornado that nearly destroyed the Uniroyal Goodrich (now Michelin) tire plant in west Ardmore. Despite a shift at the plant working at the time, miraculously no one was killed as the tornado ripped through the area, due to the public being alerted by area news and tornado sirens. On April 22, 1966, Ardmore was the site of the worst plane crash in Oklahoma history, which killed 83 people.|$|E
500|$|Aboriginal {{people made}} use of the trees through eating the roots of young plants and by {{consuming}} secretions from the trunk that were induced by wounds. Fibre obtained from the species was used to make nets. [...] The leaves have also been used for fodder, and Queensland farmers often leave bottle trees as a potential food source when land is cleared. During drought conditions, whole trees have been felled to feed stock. The soft edible pulp inside the trunk is exposed by removing the bark. The pulp is <b>energy-rich</b> but protein-poor, and occasional cases of nitrate poisoning have led to cattle deaths.|$|E
500|$|Plants {{and various}} other groups of {{photosynthetic}} eukaryotes collectively known as [...] "algae" [...] have unique organelles known as chloroplasts. Chloroplasts {{are thought to be}} descended from cyanobacteria that formed endosymbiotic relationships with ancient plant and algal ancestors. Chloroplasts and cyanobacteria contain the blue-green pigment chlorophyll a. Chlorophyll a (as well as its plant and green algal-specific cousin chlorophyll b) absorbs light in the blue-violet and orange/red parts of the spectrum while reflecting and transmitting the green light that we see as the characteristic colour of these organisms. The energy in the red and blue light that these pigments absorb is used by chloroplasts to make <b>energy-rich</b> carbon compounds from carbon dioxide and water by oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that generates molecular oxygen (O2) as a by-product.|$|E
500|$|After hatching, the chick, {{which is}} semi-altricial, is brooded and guarded {{for three weeks}} until it {{is large enough to}} defend and thermoregulate itself. During this period the parents feed the chick small meals when they relieve each other from duty. After the {{brooding}} period is over, the chick is fed in regular intervals by both parents. The parents adopt alternative patterns of short and long foraging trips, providing meals that weigh around 12% of their body weight (around [...] ). The meals are composed of fresh squid, fish and krill, as well as stomach oil, an <b>energy-rich</b> food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items by most Procellariiformes, and gives them their distinctive musty smell.|$|E
500|$|Great {{white sharks}} are {{carnivorous}} and prey upon fish (e.g. tuna, rays, other sharks), cetaceans (i.e., dolphins, porpoises, whales), pinnipeds (e.g. seals, fur seals, and sea lions), sea turtles, sea otters (Enhydra lutris) and seabirds. Great whites {{have also been}} known to eat objects that {{they are unable to}} digest. Juvenile white sharks predominantly prey on fish including other elasmobranchs, as their jaws are not strong enough to withstand the forces required to attack larger prey such as pinnipeds and cetaceans until they reach a length of [...] or more, at which point their jaw cartilage mineralizes enough to withstand the impact of biting into larger prey species. Upon approaching a length of nearly , great white sharks begin to target predominately marine mammals for food, though individual sharks seem to specialize in different types of prey depending on their preferences. They seem to be highly opportunistic. These sharks prefer prey with a high content of <b>energy-rich</b> fat. Shark expert Peter Klimley used a rod-and-reel rig and trolled carcasses of a seal, a pig, and a sheep from his boat in the South Farallons. The sharks attacked all three baits but rejected the sheep carcass.|$|E
2500|$|Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, {{commonly}} {{known by the}} abbreviations RuBisCO, RuBPCase, or RuBPco, is an enzyme involved in the first major step of carbon fixation, a process by which atmospheric carbon dioxide is converted by plants and other photosynthetic organisms to <b>energy-rich</b> molecules such as glucose. [...] In chemical terms, it catalyzes the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (also known as RuBP). It {{is probably the most}} abundant enzyme on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Petroleum is used mostly, by volume, for {{producing}} fuel oil and gasoline, both important [...] "primary energy" [...] sources. 84 {{percent by volume}} of the hydrocarbons present in petroleum is converted into <b>energy-rich</b> fuels (petroleum-based fuels), including gasoline, diesel, jet, heating, and other fuel oils, and liquefied petroleum gas. The lighter grades of crude oil produce the best yields of these products, but as the world's reserves of light and medium oil are depleted, oil refineries are increasingly having to process heavy oil and bitumen, and use more complex and expensive methods to produce the products required. Because heavier crude oils have too much carbon and not enough hydrogen, these processes generally involve removing carbon from or adding hydrogen to the molecules, and using fluid catalytic cracking to convert the longer, more complex molecules in the oil to the shorter, simpler ones in the fuels.|$|E
2500|$|FAO reports Israel {{dairy farms}} {{are the most}} {{productive}} in the world, with a yield of [...] milk per cow per year. This survey over 2001 and 2007 was conducted by ICAR (International Committee for Animal Recording) across 17 developed countries. The survey found that the average herd size in these developed countries increased from 74 to 99 cows per herd between 2001 and 2007. A dairy farm {{had an average of}} 19 cows per herd in Norway, and 337 in New Zealand. Annual milk production in the same period increased from [...] per cow in these developed countries. The lowest average production was in New Zealand at [...] per cow. The milk yield per cow depended on production systems, nutrition of the cows, and only to a minor extent different genetic potential of the animals. What the cow ate made the most impact on the production obtained. New Zealand cows with the lowest yield per year grazed all year, in contrast to Israel with the highest yield where the cows ate in barns with an <b>energy-rich</b> mixed diet.|$|E

50|$|Food webs {{describe}} {{the transfer of}} energy between species in an ecosystem. While a food chain examines one, linear, energy pathway through an ecosystem, a food web is more complex and illustrates all of the potential pathways. Much of this transferred energy comes from the sun. Plants use the sun’s energy to convert inorganic compounds into <b>energy-rich,</b> organic compounds, turning carbon dioxide and minerals into plant material by photosynthesis. Plant flowers exude <b>energy-rich</b> nectar above ground and plant roots exude acids, sugars, and ectoenzymes into the rhizosphere, adjusting the pH and feeding the food web underground.|$|E

50|$|The use {{of tools}} has been {{interpreted}} {{as a sign of}} intelligence, and it has been theorized that tool use may have stimulated certain aspects of human evolution, especially the continued expansion of the human brain. Paleontology has yet to explain the expansion of this organ over millions of years despite being extremely demanding in terms of energy consumption. The brain of a modern human consumes about 13 watts (260 kilocalories per day), a fifth of the body's resting power consumption. Increased tool use would allow hunting for <b>energy-rich</b> meat products, and would enable processing more <b>energy-rich</b> plant products. Researchers have suggested that early hominins were thus under evolutionary pressure to increase their capacity to create and use tools.|$|E
