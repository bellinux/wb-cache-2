50|$|A FDDI network {{contains}} two rings, {{one as a}} secondary backup in case the primary ring fails. The primary ring offers up to 100 Mbit/s capacity. When a network has no requirement for the secondary ring to do backup, it can also carry data, <b>extending</b> <b>capacity</b> to 200 Mbit/s. The single ring can extend the maximum distance; a dual ring can extend 100 km. FDDI had a larger maximum-frame size (4,352 bytes) than the standard Ethernet family, which only supports a maximum-frame size of 1,500 bytes, allowing better effective data rates in some cases.|$|E

30|$|It {{is evident}} that {{selection}} of higher dimension pipe than actually required as far as economical point of view can increase the resilience of network. Hence, minimizing the cost and maximizing the resilience of the network will be more appropriate if the network is to be designed based on not only economical point of view but also resilience of the system. Reliability of the system can be increased by providing stand-by pumps and storage facilities if water source is reliable. But {{in the case of}} components such as pipes and valves, economical and technical feasibility of providing stand-by pipes and valves is herculean task. It is difficult and too costly to have parallel pipe for each pipe or even for some critical pipes. In case of possible situations to have parallel pipes, the house connections taken from the main pipe cannot be shifted to parallel pipe at the time of failure or abnormal operating condition. Hence, it is wise to size the pipe to have additional capacity at the design stage itself. The question of <b>extending</b> <b>capacity</b> of pipe can be achieved by formulating design problem as a multi-objective problem. This paper uses these three existing measures which address the resilience of water distribution network.|$|E
30|$|A {{possible}} {{disregard of}} the temporal scale of analysis can also be observed in model specification. The econometrics of the Wagner–Kaldor law is again edifying and intended for a relationship on very long horizon between output and ratio of government spending to gross domestic product (GDP). In its formalization, the main difficulty stems from the non-unitary evolution of the involved variables. Although the potential output registered an obvious increasing trend, the share of government expenditure in GDP cannot extend unlimitedly. At superior development stages, despite the increasing per-capita income, the social acceptability of taxation decelerates, tending toward an asymptotical level. (Normally, it is situated under unity, which is its maximum potential limit.) This trend seems {{to be linked to}} the <b>extending</b> <b>capacity</b> of the private sector to provide some public goods and services, and enforcing democratic control on government decisions. Consequently, in modeling the size of the government in relation to economic growth long term, the threshold regression methods are more suitable (Christie 2011) as well as nonlinear functions (Kuckuck 2012; Hajamini and Falahi 2014; Aghion et al. 2016), including the logistic one (Florio and Colautti 2002; Magableh 2006). In this context, notably, is the conclusion drawn by Fölster and Henrekson (2001): The relationship between government expenditure and growth is negative in rich countries.|$|E
40|$|Sand {{production}} by soil erosion in small watershed {{is a complex}} physical process. There are few physical models suitable to describe {{the characteristics of the}} intense erosion in domestic loess plateau. Introducing support vector machine (SVM) oriented to small sample data and possessing good extension property can be an effective approach to predict soil erosion because SVM has been applied in hydrological prediction to some extent. But there are no effective methods to select the rational parameters for SVM, which seriously limited the practical application of SVM. This paper explored the application of intelligence-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in automatic selection of parameters for SVM, and proposed a prediction model by linking PSO and SVM for small sample data analysis. This method utilized the high efficiency optimization property and swarm paralleling property of PSO algorithm and the relatively strong learning and <b>extending</b> <b>capacity</b> of SVM. For an example of Huangfuchuan small watershed, its intensive fragmentation and intense erosion earn itself the name of "worst erosion in the world". Using four characteristics selection algorithms of correlation feature selection, the primary affecting factors for soil erosion in this small watershed were determined to be the channel density, ravine area, sand rock proportion, and the total vegetation coverage. Based on the proposed PSO-SVM algorithm, the soil erosion modulus in the small watershed was predicted. The accuracy of the simulation and prediction was good, and the average error was 3. 85 %. The SVM predicting model was based on the monitoring data of sand production. The construction of the SVM erosion modulus prediction model for the small watershed comprehensively reflected the complex mechanism of soil erosion and sand production. It had certain advantage and relatively high practical value in small sample prediction in the discipline of soil erosion...|$|E

40|$|We {{live in a}} {{world of}} becoming. The future is not given, but forms {{continuously}} in dynamic processes where path dependence plays a major role. There are many different possible futures. What we actually end up with is determined in part by chance and in part by the decisions we make. To make sound decisions we require models that are flexible enough to identify opportunities and to help us choose options that lead to advantageous alternatives. This way of thinking differs from traditional cost-benefit analysis that employs net present value calculations to choose on purely economic grounds, without regard to future consequences. Time and dynamic behaviour introduce a separate perspective. There is a focus on change, and decisions acquire windows of opportunity: the right decision at the right time may lead to substantial change, while it will have little effect if too early or too late. Modelling needs to reflect this dynamic behaviour. It is the perspective of time and dynamics that leads to a focus on sustainability, and thereby the role hydrogen might play in a future energy system. The present work develops a particular understanding relevant to energy infrastructures. Central elements of this understanding are: - Competition - Market preference and choice beyond costs - Bounded rationality - Uncertainty and risk - Irreversibility - Increasing returns - Path dependence - Feedback - Delay - Nonlinear behaviour Change towards a “hydrogen economy” will involve far-reaching change away from our existing energy infrastructure. This infrastructure is viewed as a dynamic set of interacting technologies (value sequences) that provide services to end-users and uphold the required supply of energy for this, all the way from primary energy sources. The individual technologies also develop with time. Building on this understanding and analysis, an analytical tool has emerged: the Energy Infrastructure Competition (EICOMP) model. In the model each technology is characterised by a capacity, an ordered-, and an actually delivered volume of energy services. It is further characterised through physical description with parameters like efficiency, time required for <b>extending</b> <b>capacity</b> and improvement by learning. Finally, each technology has an attractiveness, composed of costs, quality and availability, that determines the outcome of competition. Change away from our present energy infrastructure into a sustainable one based on renewable energy sources, will entail substantial change in most aspects of technology, organisation and ownership. Central results from the overall work are: - Change is dynamic and deeply influenced through situations with reinforcing feedback and path dependence. Due to this, there is a need for long-term perspectives in today's decision making: decisions have windows of opportunity and need to be made at the proper time. - Strategies aimed at achieving change should team up with reinforcing feedback and avoid overwhelming balancing feedback that counteracts change. - The EICOMP model is now available as a tool for furthe analysis of our existing energy infrastructure and its dynamic development into possible, alternative energy futures. As the model is intended for practical guidance in decisions, a central practical aim has been to allow it to be used close to where decisions are actually made; i. e. decentralised and locally in firms and in public institutions. In this respect much effort has been made in an attempt to make it transparent and easy to communicate. - The EICOMP model may be used to analyse situations of reinforcing feedback throughout the alternative energy infrastructures that we may come to have in the future.
