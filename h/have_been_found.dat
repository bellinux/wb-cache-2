5|$|Aetosaur fossils <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> on all continents except Australia and Antarctica, {{giving them}} a nearly {{worldwide}} distribution during the Late Triassic. Many aetosaur remains <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> from the Chinle Group in the southwestern United States. Most fossils <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> from Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Some remains have also been found from Utah, particularly in Canyonlands National Park and Zion National Park. Aetosaurs are also known from the Newark Supergroup along the East Coast of the United States in states such as Connecticut and North Carolina. Two genera are known from Greenland: Aetosaurus and Paratypothorax. They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> from the Fleming Fjord Formation in Jameson Land. Longosuchus is the only aetosaur known from Africa, with scutes having been found from the late Carnian Timesgadiouine Formation in Morocco. During the Late Triassic, Morocco {{would have been in}} close proximity with the Newark Supergroup of North America in the supercontinent of Pangaea. It is also possible that Desmatosuchus was present in Africa, as fossils <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> from the Zarzaitine Series in Algeria that were referred to the genus.|$|E
5|$|Many coins <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> in {{northern}} Ethiopia and Eritrea, the central region of Aksum, though Aksumite coins {{are reported to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> in Arato and Lalibela. Many coins have been also found further afield. Numerous hoards of coins (always gold save one silver coin) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> in Southern Arabia, much more than in Aksum itself, attesting perhaps to an Aksumite presence {{in parts of the}} region (perhaps supporting the use of titles claiming control over parts of South Arabia from GDRT's time). The hoards may be the remnants of hoards left in Kaleb's time (perhaps used to pay soldiers), when it was under an Aksumite governor. Outside of the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula, coins <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> as far as Israel, Meroe, Egypt, and India. Silver and copper coins are mainly found in Aksum, though some can be traced to Palestinian pilgrim centers.|$|E
5|$|A {{missense}} mutation R174Q, a nonsense mutation R156X, and three single residue deletions DE167, DK175 and DK176, {{all in the}} C-terminal actin-tropomyosin interacting domain, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> in patients with distal arthrogryposis.|$|E

5|$|Animal remains <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> in {{the wreck}} of the Mary Rose. These include the skeletons of a rat, a frog and a dog. The dog, a mongrel between {{eighteen}} months and two years in age, was found near the hatch to the ship's carpenter's cabin and is thought to have been brought aboard as a ratter. Nine barrels <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> to contain bones of cattle, indicating that they contained pieces of beef butchered and stored as ship's rations. In addition, the bones of pigs and fish, stored in baskets, have also been found.|$|E

5|$|At {{least two}} species of bird lice, Colpocephalum cooki and Ciconiphilus temporalis <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> as ectoparasites. Healthy adult birds have no natural predators, and the only {{recorded}} causes of premature mortality are due to the direct or indirect actions of humans; such as, poisoning, shooting, or electrocution when the birds accidentally fly into overhead electricity wires. Captive birds <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> to be susceptible to avian influenza (H5N1) and high mortality was noted at a facility in Cambodia, with two-thirds of infected birds dying. The longest recorded life span in captivity was 43 years.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> {{to be effective}} against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> to be effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurid fossils <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> {{across the}} globe in North America, Europe, Africa, Japan, China, Mongolia, Manchuria, Madagascar, Argentina, and Antarctica, with fossilized teeth giving {{credence}} {{to the possibility that}} they inhabited Australia as well. They first appeared in the mid-Jurassic Period (late Bathonian stage, about 167 million years ago) and survived {{until the end of the}} Cretaceous (Maastrichtian stage, 66 ma), existing until the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The presence of dromaeosaurids as early as the Middle Jurassic has been suggested by the discovery of isolated fossil teeth, though no dromaeosaurid body fossils <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> from this period.|$|E

5|$|Few dinosaur remains <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> in Scandinavia. The {{mainland}} {{of western}} Denmark is an unlikely region to find dinosaur remains, since the Mesozoic sediments there are marine Maastrichtian chalk. Fossils of non-dinosaurian marine animals, including mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> in these deposits. Mesozoic deposits in Scania, Sweden, are much richer in fossils, {{including those of}} dinosaurs. The Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea {{was part of the}} same land mass as Scania (the Scandinavian-Russian continent), and has a similar geology. The southwestern part of the island is the only place in Denmark which has yielded dinosaur remains.|$|E
