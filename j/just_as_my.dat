25|$|I was {{initiated}} into a college secret societyâ€”a {{couple of hours}} of grotesque and good-humored rodomontade and horseplay, in which I cooperated as {{in a kind of}} pleasant nightmare, confident, even when branded with a red-hot iron or doused head-over heels in boiling oil, that it would come out all right. The neophyte is effectively blindfolded during the proceedings, and at last, still sightless, I was led down flights of steps into a silent crypt, and helped into a coffin, where I was to stay until the Resurrection...Thus it was that <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> father passed from this earth, I was lying in a coffin during my initiation into Delta Kappa Epsilon.|$|E
500|$|In 1929, the {{building}} became vacant, {{and was given}} to Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, by his father, King George V. The king had originally expressed surprise at Edward's request asking him [...] "What could you possibly want that queer old place for? Those damn weekends I suppose", but then smiled and gave his permission. Edward's previous residence had been York House, part of St. James's Palace in London, which he had thought [...] "more an office than a home." [...] He would later write that he [...] "created a home at the fort <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> father and grandfather had created one at Sandringham... here I spent some of the happiest days of my life." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{burst out}} with an exclamation that stopped me, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> pen touched the paper.|$|E
60|$|SYNORIX. And I am <b>just</b> <b>as</b> sure, <b>my</b> lord, I struck him. (Aside.) And I may strike {{your game}} {{when you are}} gone.|$|R
60|$|She {{ought to}} be <b>just</b> <b>as</b> much <b>my</b> Princess <b>as</b> she is yours now, for you are a man of your word,' said the youth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fiddlestick," [...] said Michael. [...] "My {{father is}} my father; but Joseph is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> much <b>my</b> uncle <b>as</b> he's yours; {{and you have}} no right to sequestrate his person." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> {{hand was}} on the door, she caught fast hold of my dress and stopped me.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> shape you see [...] Raking up leaves, I saw, when {{fresh and}} free, [...] Those memory weaves Into grey ghosts by me, [...] Raking up leaves.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hold the}} spool, sir. But <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> captain says. With these grey hairs of mine 'tis not worth while disputing, 'specially with a superior, who'll ne'er confess." ...|$|E
6000|$|Says I, [...] "Old man, I'll {{be frank}} with you. This AIN'T <b>just</b> <b>as</b> near <b>my</b> idea of bliss as I {{thought it was}} going to be, when I used to go to church." ...|$|R
50|$|Kerbis was {{inspired}} by, worked for, and studied under {{some of the}} most significant modernist architects of the 20th century, including Frank Lloyd Wright, Carl Koch, Walter Gropius, and Mies Van Der Rohe. Their influences are evident in many of Kerbis's designs. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>Mies</b> Van Der Rohe developed used minimal structural framework balanced against free flowing space, the Rotunda Building takes a similar approach. The influence of her teacher, Walter Gropius, is seen in the simplistic and aesthetically pleasing, yet functional design of Mitchell Hall, the US Air Force Academy dining hall.|$|R
60|$|He {{might as}} well have said, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> politely, that <b>my</b> seeing her, even to say good-by, was undesirable.|$|R
60|$|Could {{it be that}} I was laboriously working my {{way into}} some new trap? Were the {{messages}} spurious, after all? And then, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> hope and courage had ebbed to their lowest, I saw two things.|$|E
60|$|He was not ten paces from me, {{facing in}} the {{opposite}} direction; and what cruel freak of fate should have caused him to turn about <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> eyes topped the roof's edge I may not even guess.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{said the}} colonel loftily, [...] "that {{it was held}} {{by a grant from}} Charles the Fifth of Spain, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> propahty on the James River was given to my people by King James of England, sah!" ...|$|E
60|$|Here was a {{piece of}} rare good fortune, the {{coincidence}} of which seemed to add another link to the chain of circumstance. As it happened I had with me the six sovereigns which I had <b>just</b> drawn <b>as</b> <b>my</b> week's pay.|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> I {{finished}} <b>my</b> narrative, {{and before}} {{he had time to}} comment on it, there came a violent knocking at the door.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is odd {{with what}} torture I write this letter. I feel inclined, nevertheless, to protract the operation, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> if <b>my</b> doing so could {{put off the}} {{catastrophe}} which has so long embittered my life. But--it must be told, and it shall be told briefly.|$|R
6000|$|... "She has {{no need of}} it," [...] said he. [...] "Heaven {{bless her}} and her husband!" [...] But <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> first impulse had been to pity her, so was his. [...] "Poor girl, poor girl! Poor Rick! Poor Ada!" ...|$|E
6000|$|While the police-officer {{was still}} pondering in solitude, I was sent for to see Mr. Franklin in the library. To my unutterable astonishment, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> hand {{was on the}} door, it was {{suddenly}} opened from the inside, and out walked Rosanna Spearman! ...|$|E
60|$|At {{four o'clock}} I made the {{alarming}} discovery {{that the great}} B-Ocean reel was freezing, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> other one had frozen on my first swordfish the year previous. Captain Dan used language. He threw up his hands. He gave up. But I did not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Granny Fox {{is getting}} old and timid. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> if <b>my</b> eyes aren't <b>as</b> sharp as hers! I'd {{like to see}} Farmer Brown's boy get near me when I am really on the watch," [...] said Reddy Fox to himself. And then he crept a little nearer to the open door.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can {{preach the}} word of the Lord <b>just</b> <b>as</b> well without <b>my</b> coat, and I can throw rowdies out the door a little better in my shirt-sleeves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's <b>just</b> <b>as</b> much <b>my</b> dream <b>as</b> it ever was, Herbert Dodd, {{to take up}} mine with you! Remember for me that I can do with it, my dear, that my idea is {{for even}} as much as that of you!" [...] she had cried; [...] "remember that for me, Herbert Dodd; remember, remember!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... (12) Right about Pope's Ode. But {{what can}} you give? The Dying Christian? {{or one of his}} inimitable courtesies? These last are fairly odes, by the Horatian model, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> dear Meddowes is an ode in the name {{and for the sake of}} Bandusia.|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact this wall fell in <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> son Roderick, the last of us, was passing down the stairs. With the curiosity of youth he had lingered for a few moments to watch the sad scene below, a delay which nearly cost him his life.|$|E
6000|$|... "I con-grat-u-late you," [...] replied Tiktok. [...] "I can-not help be-ing your in-fer-i-or for I am a mere ma-chine. When I am {{wound up}} I do my du-ty by go-ing <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> ma-chin-er-y {{is made to}} go. You have no i-de-a how full of ma-chin-er-y I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank'ee, lass," [...] {{said the}} captain, as he {{set down the}} {{sea-chest}} and seated himself thereon; [...] "they're pretty enough to look at, d'ye see, but they're raither in the way <b>just</b> now, <b>as</b> <b>my</b> second mate once said of the rocks when we were cruising {{off the coast of}} Norway in search of a pilot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My {{father is}} tolerable, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> usual, and <b>my</b> little Alwyn {{is getting more}} delicious every day. He will be so delighted to see Monsieur. I have told him so many stories about him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--he {{makes me}} feel the same faith: that what I lose will be {{returned}} to me. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> I found <b>my</b> cloak. And that if I enter into an undertaking, it will be successful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am; I {{like to know}} it. You {{will give}} my duty to her, Miss Sophy, and thank her--oh! so much,"--and Judith clasped her hands--"for all she and you and Mrs Carbonel have been to me. You seemed to bring the light back to me, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> faith was growing slack and dull." ...|$|E
6000|$|With {{his arms}} easily about her, {{but with her}} weight against his shoulder, they and their love veiled from the basket-parties by the darkness, he said, quiveringly: [...] "See, my arms are a little house for you, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> hand was a little house for your hand, once. My arms are the walls, and your head and mine {{together}} are the roof." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{even now}} {{after all these}} years, when I think of these two, so young, so fair, so simple, and of their love, I feel a pang. It tears my heart <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> heart is torn when on certain nights I watch the full moon shining on the lagoon from an unclouded sky. There is always pain in the contemplation of perfect beauty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And why can't it be right?" [...] said Moulder. [...] "They're {{paid for}} it; it's their duties; <b>just</b> <b>as</b> it's <b>my</b> duty to sell Hubbles and Grease's sugar. It's {{not for me}} to say the sugar's bad, or the samples not equal to the last. My duty is to sell, and I sell;--and it's their duty to get a verdict." ...|$|R
60|$|Q. Is {{not this}} <b>just</b> <b>as</b> when <b>my</b> father bids me be naught if I will: but if I be naught he will beat me for it?--A. Yes; or like that saying of Joshua, 'If it seem evil unto you {{to serve the}} Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve'; serve your sins at your peril (Josh 24:15).|$|R
6000|$|Her meaning was {{as clear}} as if she said: [...] "I need you, for I love you. Come to me." [...] And her prayer filled him with pain as well as pleasure. He was a soldier and under orders from his chief, {{therefore}} he said: [...] "Dear girl, there is a sick man far up on the mountain-side {{with no one to}} care for him but a poor old herder who is in danger of falling sick himself. I must go back to them; but, believe me, I will come <b>just</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>my</b> duties will let me. You understand me, don't you?" ...|$|R
