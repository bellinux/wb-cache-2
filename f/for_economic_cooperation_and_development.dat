25|$|The Millennium Summit Declaration was, however, {{only part}} of the origins of the MDGs. More ideas came from Adam Figueroa, Organization <b>for</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (OECD), the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. A series of UN‑led {{conferences}} in the 1990s focused on issues such as children, nutrition, human rights and women. The OECD criticized major donors for reducing their levels of Official Development Assistance (ODA). UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan signed a report titled, We the Peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century. The OECD had formed its International Development Goals (IDGs). The two efforts were combined for the World Bank's 2001 meeting to form the MDGs.|$|E
25|$|GIZ mainly {{operates}} {{on behalf of}} the Federal Ministry <b>for</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (BMZ). At the national level, GIZ, however, is also commissioned by other government departments, e.g. the Federal Foreign Office, the Federal Ministry for the Environment (BMUB), or the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), as well as by German states and municipalities. At the international level, GIZ cooperates with the European Union, UN agencies, other international institutions such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFFATM), and foreign governments. The cooperation with private enterprises is an emerging field, promoted under the name of sustainable development. The GIZ is set up with International Services (IS) and the Public Private Partnership (PPP) in this area.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{government}} {{budget cuts}} {{have taken their}} toll. Israel was amongst the top-ranked nations in international rankings for science and mathematics performance in the 1960s, but dropped to 33 out of 41 nations in the 2002 survey. Wages for Israeli teachers are low compared to other industrialized countries, especially due to {{the small amount of}} frontal teaching hours with respect to other developed countries (the salary per hour {{is similar to that of}} the OECD standards), according to a survey of the Organization <b>for</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development.</b> The government-appointed Dovrat Commission, led by Shlomo Dovrat, concluded in 2004, that the key to improving Israeli education is not more money but better-quality teaching. The recommendations included a reform giving school principals the right to fire teachers of poor quality, and reward better ones with higher pay. These moves have been blocked by Israel's teachers' unions, which have paralyzed schools with a series of long strikes, mostly blocking the proposed reforms.|$|E

25|$|Total US {{investment}} in venture capital amounted to US$48.3 billion in 2014, for 4 356 deals. This represented ‘an increase of 61% in dollars and a 4% increase in deals over the prior year,’ reported the National Venture Capital Association. The Organisation <b>for</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> estimates that venture capital {{investment in}} the United States had fully recovered by 2014 to pre-recession levels. The National Venture Capital Association has reported that, in 2014, venture capital {{investment in the}} life sciences was at its highest level since 2008: in biotechnology, $6.0 billion was invested in 470 deals and, in life sciences overall, $8.6 billion in 789 deals (including biotechnology and medical devices). Two-thirds (68%) of the investment in biotechnology went to first-time/early-stage development deals and the remainder to the expansion stage of development (14%), seed-stage companies (11%) and late-stage companies (7%). However, it was the software industry which invested in {{the greatest number of}} deals overall: 1 799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1 005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the State of California, which alone concentrates 28% of US research.|$|E
25|$|The body of {{scientific}} evidence concluding that GM foods are safe {{to eat and}} do not pose environmental risks is wide. Findings from the International Council of Scientists (2003) that analyzed a selection of approximately 50 science-based reviews concluded that “currently available genetically modified foods are safe to eat,” and “there {{is no evidence of}} any deleterious environmental effects having occurred from the trait/species combinations currently available.” The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) supported the same consensus a year later in addition to recommending the extension of biotechnology to the developing world. Similarly, the Royal Society (2003) and British Medical Association (2004) found no adverse health effects of consuming genetically modified foods. These findings supported the conclusions of earlier studies by the European Union Research Directorate, a compendium of 81 scientific studies conducted by more than 400 research teams did not show “any new risks to human health or the environment, beyond the usual uncertainties of conventional plant breeding.” Likewise, the Organization <b>for</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> in Europe (OECD) and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics (1999) did not find that genetically modified foods posed a health risk.|$|E
25|$|The Taiwanese {{education}} {{system has been}} praised for various reasons including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering Taiwan's economic development while creating one of the world’s most highly educated workforces. The country has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where the university acceptance rate has increased from around 20 percent before the 1970s to 49 percent in 1996 and over 90 percent since 2006, {{among the highest in}} Asia. The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries in the world with 68.5% of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend university. Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree where 45 percent of Taiwanese aged 25–64 hold a bachelors degree or higher compared with the average of 33 percent among member countries of the Organization <b>for</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (OECD). On the other hand, the system has been criticized for placing excessive pressure on students and eschewing creativity in favor of rote memorization. In addition, the system has been criticized for producing an excess supply of over-educated university graduates and a higher unemployment rate. With a large supply of university graduates seeking a limited demand of prestigious white collar jobs in an environment that is increasingly losing its competitive edge has led many degree holders ending up with lower end jobs with salaries far beneath than their expectations. Taiwan’s universities have also been under criticism {{for not being able to}} fully meet the requirements and demands of Taiwan’s 21st century fast-moving job market citing a skills mismatch among a large number of self-assessed overeducated university graduates that don't fit the demands of the modern Taiwanese labor market. The Taiwanese government has also been criticized for undermining the economy as it has been unable to produce enough jobs to meet the demands of numerous underemployed university graduates.|$|E
40|$|A {{descriptive}} study allowed {{to estimate the}} risks of formation of PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) in the traditionally smoked fish consumed {{in the area of}} Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire. The study was carried out from surveys on processing methods of fresh fish into smoked fish in the production areas. It took place from September 2009 to March 2012 on three smoking sites: Port-Bouët in the South of Abidjan, Ile Boulay, Abobo-Doumé and Koweït in the South-West of Abidjan and Abobo-Macaci in the North of Abidjan. The main risk factors which were identified in the formation of PAH, are the stakeholders, the smoking sites, the technologies, the handling and the storing. The black color and bitter taste of the fish were identified as sensory indicators of PAH formation in smoked fish.
