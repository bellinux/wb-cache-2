5|$|In late 1899, MacLaren {{joined a}} private cricket tour of America and Canada {{organised}} by the cricket-playing Indian prince Ranjitsinhji. The following March, {{he was appointed}} as an assistant secretary at Lancashire. The position was a sinecure; his main role was to coach the first eleven which effectively meant that he was paid to play cricket, despite his amateur status. Surviving records do not indicate his salary, but some sources suggest he was paid comfortably more than Lancashire's leading professionals. In addition, MacLaren worked as a journalist for the Daily Express, reporting on matches in which he played, a common practice at the time for amateurs. Resuming sole control over the Lancashire side, and freed from his teaching responsibilities, MacLaren played {{from the beginning of}} the 1900 season, planning meticulously in a bid to lead Lancashire to the County Championship. His batting form suffered initially, but the team dominated the start of the season. Commentators gave much of the credit to MacLaren's captaincy. However, he was severely criticised for conservative tactics in one game, when he was reluctant to attempt to force a win. In the latter stages of the season, MacLaren scored prolifically, making a succession of high scores at rapid pace. He ended the 1900 season with 1,554 runs at 36.13. During that season, the leading Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold had been no-balled for throwing, but MacLaren defended him in the press. At a meeting of county captains in December, MacLaren was the only representative to defend the legality of Mold's bowling action, and in 1901, Mold was again no-balled and his career was effectively over. MacLaren struggled with injury in 1901, and his batting form suffered. He frequently dropped low in the batting order, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the season before he began to score runs regularly. His captaincy was criticised after some tactical decisions which were either unconventional or unsuccessful, and he clashed with the Lancashire committee over the poor state of Old Trafford's pitch. In total, he scored 1,069 first-class runs at 31.44.|$|E
25|$|On 28 November {{he faced}} a court martial on board Gladiator at Portsmouth. The charge {{was that he}} had failed to follow orders to proceed to Quebec to bring home a convoy. He argued that the reason he had not sailed was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the year and that the weather was bad. The court {{accepted}} his reasoning and acquitted him.|$|E
25|$|On March 13, 1865, the Confederate Congress passed General Order 14 by {{a single}} vote in the Confederate senate, and Jefferson Davis signed the order into law. The order was issued March 23, but as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the war, only a few African American {{companies}} were raised in the Richmond area before the town was captured by the U.S. Army and placed back under U.S. control.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the 11th {{century that}} a single {{anonymous}} scholar appears to have brought together these and numerous other poems and fitted them into an elaborate prose framework – partly of his own composition and partly drawn from older, no longer extant sources (i.e. the tochomlaidh referred to above by O'Curry), paraphrasing and enlarging the verse. The result was the earliest version of LGE. It was written in Middle Irish, a form of Irish Gaelic used between 900 and 1200.|$|E
25|$|When the Second Boer War {{broke out}} in South Africa in October 1899, a Liberal MP, Leonard Courtney, invited Hobhouse to become {{secretary}} of the women's branch of the South African Conciliation Committee, {{of which he was}} president. She wrote <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the summer of 1900 that I first learnt of the hundreds of Boer women that became impoverished and were left ragged by our military operations… the poor women who were being driven from pillar to post, needed protection and organized assistance.|$|E

Early production models had some teething troubles in service, as ground crew learned to service and adjust the new gears, and pilots to operate them. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> 1917 before {{a version of the}} gear that could operate twin guns became available, so that the first Sopwith Camels had to be fitted with the Sopwith-Kauper gear instead.|$|E

25|$|Clarke and Warne put on 100 runs {{between them}} in the {{afternoon}} session, with Clarke making a century. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon before England finally made some inroads, with Matthew Hoggard striking {{either side of the}} tea interval. Shane Warne was out leg before wicket just prior to the break. Michael Clarke was caught by Ashley Giles after tea, having made 124 runs, and with the score at 505 for 8. Hoggard and James Anderson took a wicket each to clean up the tail within eight overs, so that Australia were all out for 513 runs from 165.3 overs.|$|E
25|$|On May 15, 2007, NetBank {{received}} a warning from the Nasdaq stock market because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> filing {{its most recent}} quarterly report. NetBank {{received a}} similar notice from Nasdaq in March 2007 {{because it did not}} file its 2006 annual report on time. The report was delayed because the company needed to find a new independent auditor following the resignation of Ernst & Young LLP in November 2006. NetBank hired Porter Keadle Moore LLP as its new independent auditor in February 2007. NetBank said it planned to file the annual and quarterly reports by the end of June 2007.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} May 2015, {{the plane}} had traversed Asia. It made an {{unscheduled}} stop in Japan to await favourable weather over the Pacific, increasing the expected number of legs of the journey to 13. The aircraft began the flight from Japan to Hawaii on 28 June 2015 (29 June, Japan local time). With Borschberg in the cockpit, it reached Hawaii on 3 July, setting new records for the world's longest solar-powered flight both by time (117 hours, 52 minutes) and distance (7,212km; 4,481mi). The flight's duration was also a record for longest solo flight, by time, for any aircraft. During that leg the plane's batteries were damaged by overheating because they were packed in too much insulation. New parts had to be ordered, and as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the season, with days shortening in the northern hemisphere, the plane was grounded in Hawaii. The US Department of Transportation stored the aircraft in a hangar at Kalaeloa Airport on Oahu.|$|E

25|$|Leopold I {{had warned}} Eugene to act cautiously, {{but when the}} Imperial {{commander}} learnt of Sultan Mustafa II's march on Transylvania, Eugene abandoned all ideas of a defensive campaign and moved to intercept the Turks as they crossed the River Tisza at Zenta on 11 September 1697. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> {{the day before the}} Imperial army struck. The Turkish cavalry had already crossed the river so Eugene decided to attack immediately, arranging his men in a half-moon formation. The vigour of the assault wrought terror and confusion amongst the Turks, and by nightfall, the battle was won. For the loss of some 2,000 dead and wounded, Eugene had inflicted approximately 25,000 casualties on his enemy—including the Grand Vizier, Elmas Mehmed Pasha—annihilating the Turkish army. Although the Ottomans lacked western organisation and training, the Savoyard prince had revealed his tactical skill, his capacity for bold decision, and his ability to inspire his men to excel in battle against a dangerous foe.|$|E
500|$|When the Persians saw the Allied fleet rowing towards them, {{they decided}} to seize the {{opportunity}} to attack, even though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the day, as they thought they would win an easy victory. They quickly advanced on the much smaller Allied fleet. However, the Allies {{had come up with}} a tactic for this situation, where they turned their [...] "bows on to the barbarians, [...] they drew their sterns together in the middle". This is usually taken to mean that they formed into a circle, with their rams pointing outwards; Thucydides reports that in the Peloponnesian War, Peloponnesian fleets twice adopted a circular formation, with their sterns together. However, Herodotus does not actually use the word circle, and Lazenby points out the difficulty of forming a circle of 250 ships (the Peloponnesian fleets had 30–40 ships). It is thus possible the Allies formed into more of a crescent formation, with the wings drawn back to prevent the Persian ships sailing around the Allied line. Whatever the case, it seems likely that this maneuver was intended to negate the superior Persian seamanship, and perhaps specifically the use of diekplous.|$|E
2500|$|Upon landing, Caesar left Quintus Atrius {{in charge}} of the beach-head and made an {{immediate}} night march [...] inland, where he encountered the British forces at a river crossing, probably somewhere on the River Stour. The Britons attacked but were repulsed, and attempted to regroup at a fortified place in the forests, possibly the hillfort at Bigbury Wood, Kent, but were again defeated and scattered. As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the day and Caesar was unsure of the territory, he called off the pursuit and made camp.|$|E

5000|$|For example, {{suppose that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> {{the game with}} a score of 21-10 and the losing team scores a touchdown, making the score 21-16. The scoring team will usually attempt the {{two-point}} conversion, because if successful, a three-point deficit later could be matched with one field goal; failure to convert would result in a five-point deficit that could be surmounted with another touchdown - a situation no worse than the four-point deficit achieved with a kicked extra point.|$|R
2500|$|In late summer, 55 BC, {{even though}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the campaigning season, Caesar {{decided to make}} an {{expedition}} to Britain. He summoned merchants who traded with the island, but they were {{unable or unwilling to}} give him any useful information about the inhabitants and their military tactics, or about harbours he could use, presumably not wanting to lose their monopoly on cross-channel trade. He sent a tribune, Gaius Volusenus, to scout the coast in a single warship. He probably examined the Kent coast between Hythe and Sandwich, but was unable to land, since he [...] "did not dare leave his ship and entrust himself to the barbarians", and after five days returned to give Caesar what intelligence he had managed to gather.|$|E
2500|$|On December 29, 1897, Bailey Gatzert was {{approaching}} Portland from Astoria and {{passing through the}} draw of the swinging railroad bridge. [...] With 60 passengers on board, the steamer blew the whistle signal to open the bridge, and when the draw swung open, the vessel proceeded through {{on the east side}} of the bridge pier. [...] Before the steamer was halfway through, the drawbridge swung back, smashing into the vessel’s superstructure and jamming the steamer up against the bridge. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the evening, and except for the crew, everyone on board was asleep. [...] The bridge was opened again, and the steamer was able to proceed. [...] Although some cabins were crushed, there were no fatalities and only two people were hurt, neither of them seriously. [...] At the time, Bailey Gatzert was valued at $110,000.|$|E
2500|$|An {{experimental}} line, with a sixth return wire, was run {{between the}} Euston terminus and Camden Town station of the London and North Western Railway on 25 July 1837. The actual distance {{was only one}} and a half-mile (2.4km), but spare wire had been inserted in the circuit to increase its length. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the evening before the trial took place. Mr Cooke was in charge at Camden Town, while Mr Robert Stephenson and other gentlemen looked on; and Wheatstone sat at his instrument in a dingy little room, lit by a tallow candle, near the booking-office at Euston. Wheatstone sent the first message, to which Cooke replied, and 'never' said Wheatstone, 'did I feel such a tumultuous sensation before, as when, all alone in the still room, I heard the needles click, and as I spelled the words, I felt all {{the magnitude of the}} invention pronounced to be practicable beyond cavil or dispute.' ...|$|E

[...] This saying reached the ears of Allen, who soon after {{paid a visit to}} the house of Mr. Wall, and was introduced to Penniman. There was a mutual and agreeable surprise, both manifestly pleased with the tone of thought and conversation, which ran on with a natural flow, and developed traits of kindred sympathies of intellect and feeling. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the evening before Mr. Allen rose.

2500|$|The 1988 season {{would be}} Alboreto's final year with Ferrari. With the McLarens of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost {{dominating}} the season, the Ferrari team only managed a single win {{during the year}} at the Italian Grand Prix which Berger won from Alboreto in second place. After a disappointing '88 season with Ferrari, the team refused to offer the Italian a new contract and so Alboreto looked elsewhere for a drive. This announcement came at the French Grand Prix in July and pit lane rumours had Michele re-joining Tyrrell for 1989 (ironically it was in France where Alboreto finished 3rd and Berger a distant 4th, {{the only time in}} 1988 the Italian would finish in front of the Austrian in a race where both finished). After France he received an offer from Frank Williams, head of the Williams team who would have exclusive use of the new V10 Renault engine in 1989. Later that year before the Italian GP at Monza, Alboreto had not received any word from Williams and requested confirmation of his seat at the team. Williams replied by saying that [...] "he wanted him" [...] and [...] "not to move". The Brit, however, went back on his word and at Monza announced he had signed Belgian Thierry Boutsen instead while also confirming that the teams number 2 driver, Alboreto's former Lancia sportscar team mate Riccardo Patrese, would be staying with the team. As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> the season, Alboreto was left with very little options for the coming season.|$|E
