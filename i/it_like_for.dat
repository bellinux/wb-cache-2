40|$|A {{widespread}} assumption {{in current}} philosophy of {{mind is that}} a conscious state’s phenomenal properties vary with its representational contents. In this paper, I present (rather dogmatically) an alternative picture that recognizes two kinds of phenomenal properties that do not vary concomitantly with content. First, it admits phenomenal properties that vary rather with attitude: what <b>it</b> is <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me to see rain is phenomenally different from what <b>it</b> is <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me to remember (indistinguishable) rain, which is different again form what <b>it</b> is <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me to visualize (indistinguishable) rain – where these differences cannot {{be traced back to}} variations in content. Secondly, {{there is a kind of}} phenomenal property that varies neither with content nor with attitude but is altogether invariant across all conscious states: a substantive phenomenal commonality among what <b>it</b> is <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me to see, remember, and visualize rain, cats, or dogs. This substantive commonality, I will suggest, is the for-me-ness component of what <b>it</b> is <b>like</b> <b>for</b> me to have any of these experiences. I will close by discussing the interrelations among these three concentric layers of phenomenality: content-based, attitude-based, and for-me-ness...|$|R

5000|$|Transformance cannot effect psychotherapeutic change {{without the}} {{requisite}} and crucial act of meta-therapeutic processing, or metaprocessing for short. Metaprocessing {{is the cornerstone}} of AEDP methodology. The intent of metaprocessing is to maximize the power of transformance moments by exploring the experience of having the experience as it is happening (for example, the therapist may ask, [...] "what is <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> you to have had this deep emotional experience right now?"), especially in the context of experiences that are therapeutic or positive. [...] Slowing down the emotional experience (somatic, emotional, cognitive) through [...] "moment-to-moment tracking", not only primes its neuroplastic potential, but allows the therapist to help the patient maintain a well-regulated, as opposed to overwhelming, emotional experience (dyadic affect regulation). A second form of relational metaprocessing asks the patient what it was like “to do this with me?” (“dyadic affective reflective process”) which further [...] "undoes the patient’s aloneness", while also strengthening the attachment bond for further emotional work. Empirical studies confirm clinical observations that positive emotions naturally arise following metaprocessing. Positive emotions fortify the patient's healing experience and promote enhanced resilience.|$|E
