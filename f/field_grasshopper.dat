40|$|Analysis of size of {{offspring}} reared {{through three}} laboratory generations from {{populations of the}} <b>field</b> <b>grasshopper</b> Chorthippus brunneus from 27 sites around the British Isles showed that offspring were larger towards the cooler-wetter conditions in the western and northern limits of the range. This variation had a significant genetic component. There was a trade-off between clutch size and offspring size between and within populations. Under favourable thermal and feeding conditions maternal fitness was optimal when individuals produced the largest clutches of the smallest eggs, but under poor conditions maternal fitness was optimal when individuals produced small clutches of very large offspring. Calculation of geometric mean fitness over time indicated that having larger offspring near {{to the edge of}} the range could be advantageous as a conservative risk-spreading strategy. As well as geographic variation in egg size, significant environment-genotype interactions in egg size in relation to temperature were observed...|$|E

40|$|The paddy <b>field</b> <b>grasshopper</b> Oxya velox fed {{ad libitum}} on fresh {{leaves of the}} grass Digitaria is reared in the {{laboratory}} from hatching to death. A female grows to a maximum size of 218 ± 40 mg wet weight on the 240 th day, while a male attains a maximum of 132 ± 17 mg weight on the 149 th day. Total food intake amounts to 1341 and 557 mg dry grass for a single female and a single male respectively. Feeding rate averages 167 mg wet grass/g wet weight of grasshopper/day. Assimilation efficiency amounts to 27 % in both sexes. Unassimilable faeces amount to 1 g for a female and 0. 4 g for a male. About 32 % of the assimilated food is used for total growth in either sex. Exuviae amount to 4 % and 5 % of the assimilated food in the female and the male respectively. The average amount of (dry) body substance used for reproduction is 82 mg in fertilized and 10 mg in the parthenogenetic female. A fertilized female consumes more food than a virgin. A female produces 3. 5, egg pods on a average, each containing about 4 eggs. About 14 % of the assimilated food energy is required for reproduction by a female and 3 % by a male. At death the male contains 26 % and the female 12 % of the assimilated food energy respectively.

40|$|Green treefrogs (Hyla cinerea) and {{grasshoppers}} (Melanoplus differentialis and Conocephalus fasciatus) commonly {{observed in}} Arkansas rice fields, are dispersal vectors for Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomens, a causal agent of anthracnose of northern jointvetch. Treefrogs and grasshoppers captured from rice or soybean fields with diseased northern jointvetch {{were placed in}} containers in contact with healthy northern jointvetch plants. An average of 90 % of northern jointvetch plants was infected by the pathogen with up to 10 lesions per plant using treefrog vectors. Experiments were done in the greenhouse on frog dispersal by monitoring disease development from a point source in closed rice-weed patches. Treefrogs dispersed the pathogen from the source plant to healthy plants resulting in 95 % infection. In the <b>field,</b> <b>grasshoppers</b> were frequently observed feeding on anthracnose lesions. In six separate experiments, approximately 20 % of <b>grasshoppers</b> collected from <b>fields</b> with diseased northern jointvetch transferred the disease after feeding or contacting healthy plants. By feeding pathogen-free grasshoppers on anthracnose lesions, we found that 66 % of these grasshoppers transferred the disease to healthy plants. The grasshopper may be important in spreading the inoculum among weed patches. Green treefrogs appear to be efficient vectors of the disease because they preferred northern jointvetch plants as shelter...|$|R

50|$|Stegodyphid spiders (Genus Stegodyphus) {{have been}} shown to act cooperatively to trap and collect insect prey species. These social arachnids {{cooperate}} both by spinning communal webs on which to catch prey and by moving together to catch large prey in the <b>field,</b> such as <b>grasshoppers.</b> These spiders do not monopolize certain parts of the web, meaning any individual can use a variety of locations to lie in wait for prey. When prey is captured in the field, it usually requires at least two spiders to be brought back to the nest to be shared among the rest of the colony.|$|R
40|$|Amensalism may {{be common}} between non-trophically linked animals in natural ecosystems, where {{variation}} among species in body sizes and foraging modes may {{give rise to}} one-sided interference. However, species and ecosystem-level consequences of animal-animal amensalism are largely unknown. In a Tibetan alpine meadow, dominant herbivorous grasshoppers trigger a death feigning anti-predator response of co-occurring grassland caterpillars despite posing no consumptive threat. We hypothesized that: 1) grasshoppers reduce the performance of caterpillars while incurring no cost to themselves; and 2) this amensalism reduces top-down control of plant composition and biomass. We tested these hypotheses by factorial manipulation of both herbivores within replicate <b>field</b> enclosures. <b>Grasshoppers</b> significantly suppressed caterpillar feeding, growth rate, survival, reproductive effort and delayed metamorphosis. In contrast, grasshopper performance was unaffected by the caterpillars. Suppression of caterpillar feeding decreased overall herbivore suppression of plant biomass by 58 % and shifted the functional composition of the plant community (i. e. increased sedge: forb ratio). These results suggest that consideration of non-trophic interactions such as amensalism will help predict the consequences of species losses for the structure and functioning of ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{conservation}} {{strategies for}} grassland birds in agricultural landscapes require understanding how nesting success varies among different grassland habitats. A key component {{to this is}} identifying nest predators and how these predators vary by habitat. We quantified nesting activity of obligate grassland birds in three habitats [remnant prairie, cool-season grass Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields, and pastures) in southwest Wisconsin, 2002 - 2004. We determined nest predators using video cameras and examined predator activity using track stations. Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) nested primarily in CRP <b>fields,</b> and <b>Grasshopper</b> Sparrow (A. savannarum) in remnant prairies. Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) nested evenly across all three habitats. Daily nest survival rate for Eastern Meadowlark varied by nesting stage alone. Daily nest survival rate for Grasshopper Sparrow varied by nest vegetation and distance to the nearest woody edge; nest survival was higher near woody edges. In CRP fields, most predators were grassland-associated, primarily thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). In pastures, one-third of the nest predators were grassland-associated (primarily thirteen-lined ground squirrels) and 56...|$|R
40|$|Predators of herbivorous {{animals can}} affect plant populations by {{altering}} herbivore density, behavior, or both. To test whether the indirect effect of predators on plants arises from density or behavioral responses in a herbivore population, we experimentally examined {{the dynamics of}} terrestrial food chains comprised of old <b>field</b> plants, leaf-chewing <b>grasshoppers,</b> and spider predators in Northeast Connecticut. To separate the effects of predators on herbivore density from the effects on herbivore behavior, we created two classes of spiders: (i) risk spiders that had their feeding mouth parts glued to render them incapable of killing prey and (ii) predator spiders that remained unmanipulated. We found {{that the effect of}} predators on plants resulted from predator-induced changes in herbivore behavior (shifts in activity time and diet selection) rather than from predator-induced changes in grasshopper density. Neither predator nor risk spiders had a significant effect on grasshopper density relative to a control. This demonstrates that the behavioral response of prey to predators can have a strong impact on the dynamics of terrestrial food chains. The results make a compelling case to examine behavioral as well as density effects in theoretical and empirical research on food chain dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{compiled}} excellent taxonomic keys for identifying various grasshopper groups in North America: slantfaced and bandwinged adults by Otte (1981), spurthroated adults by Brooks (1958), and {{the identification of}} nymphs of the genus Melanoplus by Hanford (1946). Others have used hatching dates and developmental charts to aid in grasshopper identification. For Wyoming and Montana, excellent examples are the charts developed by Newton (1954) and the charts modi-fied for use in Colorado by Capinera (1981). Many of the identification aids are not commonly avail-able and are technical and difficult to use in a field situa-tion because of bulk and terminology. Also, the field person attempting to use such identification aids usually is a temporary summer employee {{with little or no}} back-ground in entomology. Although scientists have computer mapping technology and sophisticated methods of conducting grasshopper surveys, grasshoppers still need to be identified at each survey stop. A small, easy-to-use reference such as this one will help in the identification process. Used in combination, the seasonal occurrence chart (table 1) and the Pocket Hopper Helper can help a <b>field</b> person identify <b>grasshopper</b> species in the field.

50|$|The LUBILOSA team {{continued}} to look for opportunities to test Metarhizium against locusts and <b>grasshoppers.</b> <b>Field</b> trials were conducted against Senegalese grasshoppers, African rice grasshoppers (Hieroglyphus daganensis), variegated grasshoppers, Sahelian tree locusts (Anacridium melanorhodon), brown locusts and desert locusts. These trials demonstrated that Metarhizium at a dosage of 50 g/ha could reduce grasshopper populations and those of tree locusts by 80-90% within two to three weeks. Population level control was more difficult to achieve with other locusts, but a significant effect was demonstrated on hopper bands notwithstanding the great difficulties in tracking individual bands. Some trials against Senegalese grasshoppers included the chemical insecticide fenitrothion for comparison. Because of its rather short persistence, this chemical {{turned out to be}} much less effective than commonly believed. It was highly effective in producing an immediate sharp reduction in population densities, but continued hatching and remigration into the treated plots caused these densities to start increasing again after less than a week, until they reached or exceeded the original levels after about two to three weeks. Metarhizium, on the other hand, reduced population levels at a slower rate, but maintained low levels for at least one and a half months. The half-life of its spores on the vegetation was estimated at more than 7 days under rainy season conditions in the Sahel and, of course, some conidia must survive between seasons.|$|R
5000|$|Alder Gulch (alternatively called Alder Creek) is a {{place in}} the Ruby River valley, in the U.S. state of Montana, where gold was {{discovered}} on May 26, 1863 by William Fairweather and a group of men including Barney Hughes, Thomas Cover, Henry Rodgers, Henry Edgar and Bill Sweeney who were returning to the gold <b>fields</b> of <b>Grasshopper</b> Creek, Bannack, Montana. They {{were on their way to}} Yellowstone Country from Bannack but were waylaid by a band of Crow Indians. After being ordered out of Crow hunting grounds, they crossed the East Slope of the Tobacco Root Mountains and camped for the night in Elk Park, where William [...] "Bill" [...] Fairweather and Henry Edgar discovered gold, while the remaining party was out hunting for meat. Agreeing to keep the new discovery quiet the group of miners returned to the town of Bannack for supplies. Unfortunately word leaked out about the new strike, and miners followed the Fairweather party out of town. The party stopped at the Point of Rocks, part way between Bannack and Alder Gulch, and established the Fairweather Mining District in a miners meeting. It was agreed that the discoverers were entitled to two claims and first choice. The first stampede of miners reached Alder Gulch June 6, 1863 and the population swelled to over 10,000 in less than 3 months. The [...] "Fourteen Mile City" [...] ran the length of the gulch, and included the towns of Junction City, Adobe Town, Nevada City, Central City, Virginia City, Montana, Bear Town, Highland, Pine Grove French Town, Hungry Hollow, and Summit. Upon arrival the miners lived in brush wickiups, dugouts and under overhanging rocks until cabins could be built. The first structure built in Virginia City was the Mechanical Bakery. Virginia City, and Nevada City were the centers of commerce during the height of the Alder Gulch gold rush. In the first year the area had over 10,000 people living there. Montana Territory was established in May 1864, and the first territorial capital was Bannock. The capital then moved to Virginia City, where it remained until 1875. The Alder Gulch diggings were the richest gold placer deposits ever discovered, and in three years $30,000,000 was taken from them, with $10,000,000 taken out in the first year. Nowadays, except during summertime, the streets of Virginia City are usually quiet and relatively few visitors find their way to the 16 ton granite monument that marks the spot of that incredible discovery of May 26, 1863.|$|R
40|$|Nosema locustae, a {{protozoan}} parasite of grasshoppers, {{is used as}} a bioinsecticide. In {{the present}} study, the persistence of N. locustae spores in soil and the interaction of these spores with the indigenous soil microflora were examined with various forms of microscopy and staining. Fluorescence microscopy was found to be better than phase-contrast or bright-field microscopy for detecting and viewing spores in soil. Fluorescein isothiocyanate was a better fluorescent stain than acridine orange or fluorescein diacetate; water-soluble aniline blue did not stain spores. The eight bright-field microscopy stains tested (phenolic erythrosin, phenolic rose bengal, malachite green, crystal violet, safranin, Congo red, methyl red, and eosin B) were not satisfactory, as spore staining characteristics were either poor or masked by overstained soil debris. A procedure was developed which allowed spores to be extracted from soil with a peptone-phosphate buffer, recovered on a membrane filter, and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate for microscopic counting. This procedure was used to assess the persistence of N. locustae spores in field and laboratory soils. The number of N. locustae spores in a laboratory model soil system persisted at a high level for over 8 weeks when the soil was incubated at 5 °C but exhibited a 1, 000 -fold decrease after 1 week of incubation at 27 °C. Persistence was related to the temperature-dependent activity of the indigenous soil microflora, which, on the basis of microscopic observations, appeared to prey on N. locustae spores. N. locustae spores were detected in an N. locustae-treated field soil at a low level consistent with the level for laboratory soil incubated at 27 °C, and they persisted at this level for over 2 months. No spores were detected on vegetation from this field or in the soil from an adjacent, nontreated control field.

Postembryonic development, fecundity {{and food}} consumption of Dichroplus exilis (Orthoptera: Acrididae) under controlled conditions. Dichroplus exilis {{is a widely}} distributed species in Southern South America. Although {{there have been reports}} of D. exilis as an agricultural pest, some recent observations suggest that the damage attributed to D. elongatus may actually have been caused by D. exilis. This study was conducted to determine the postembryonic life cycle stages, fertility and food consumption of this species under controlled conditions (30 °C, 14 L- 10 D, 40 % RH). Individuals employed belong to the laboratory-hatched first generation (F 1), from adults (n= 64, &# 9792;= 28, &# 9794;= 36) collected in natural grasslands near Rafaela, Santa Fe province in North- Eastern Argentina. Three cohorts of 16, 17 and 20 individuals were monitored independently in acetate tubes on a daily basis, until death of the last insect. Average fecundity was 381. 84, 38. 54 eggs per female. Egg-pod incubation time was 14. 4, 1. 08 days and six nymphal instars were recorded. Nymphal development time was 41. 38, 0. 71 days (I= 8. 73, 0. 20; II= 6. 38, 0. 24; III= 5. 64, 0. 33; IV= 7. 15; 0. 43; V= 9. 76, 0. 54; IV= 7. 85, 0. 95). The recorded food consumption was 9. 89, 1. 08 (mg/ind/day) for nymphs IV, 18. 04, 0. 73 (mg/ind/day) for nymphs V-IV, 16. 76, 1. 06 (mg/ind/day) for pre-reproductive males, 28. 09, 1. 81 (mg/ind/day) for pre-reproductive females, 7. 71, 0. 91 (mg/ind/day) for reproductive males and 13. 06, 0. 71 (mg/ind/day) for reproductive females, while the average adult food consumption, regardless of sex and reproductive status, was 16. 41, 4. 32 mg/day. Average food consumption of adult females was 17. 47, 1. 15 mg, and was significantly higher than that of males (10. 83, 0. 91 mg).
