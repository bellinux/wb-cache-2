Interactions among staff at the sites were conveyed in real time by video and audio, and by the networked workstations; and the interactions were recorded and played back, and digital indexes of the records were prototyped. The live and recorded interactions permitted communications among the connected spaces, as well as asynchronous participation. Recording and retrieval, integrated with persistent live connection, was a major distinguishing feature between Media Space and videoconferencing as it was understood at the time.|$|E

40|$|Background/Purpose: In {{the context}} of the European Biodiversity policy, the Green Infrastructure Strategy is one {{supporting}} tool to mitigate fragmentation, inter-alia to increase the spatial and functional connectivity between protected and unprotected areas. The Joint Research Centre has developed an integrated model to provide a macro-scale set of indices to evaluate the connectivity of the Natura 2000 network, which forms the backbone of a Green Infrastructure for Europe. The model allows a wide assessment and comparison to be performed across countries in terms of structural (spatially connected or isolated sites) and functional connectivity (least-cost distances between sites influenced by distribution, distance and land cover). Main conclusion: The Natura 2000 network in Europe shows differences among countries in terms of the sizes and numbers of sites, their distribution as well as distances between sites. Connectivity has been assessed {{on the basis of a}} 500 m average inter-site distance, roads and intensive land use as barrier effects as well as the presence of "green" corridors. In all countries the Natura 2000 network is mostly made of sites which are not physically connected. Highest functional connectivity values are found for Spain, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. The more natural landscape in Sweden and Finland does not result in high <b>inter-site</b> <b>network</b> connectivity due to large inter-site distances. The distribution of subnets with respect to roads explains the higher share of isolated subnets in Portugal than in Belgium.

40|$|Architecting {{dependable}} systems II,, Lecture {{notes in}} computer science, Vol. 3069, (State-of-the-Art survey), Springer-VerlagIndustrial distributed automation applications call for reusable software components, without endangering dependability. The DepAuDE architecture provides middleware to integrate fault tolerance support into such applications {{based on a}} library of detection, reconfiguration and recovery functions, and a language for expressing non-functional services, such as configuration and fault tolerance. At run time, a middleware layer orchestrates the execution of recovery actions. The paper further provides a hierarchical model, consisting of a dedicated intra-site local area network and an open <b>inter-site</b> wide area <b>network,</b> {{to deal with the}} different characteristics and requirements for dependability and quality-of-service, when such applications rely on off-the-shelf communication technology to exchange management or control information. The middleware can be dynamically reconfigured when the environment changes. This methodology has been integrated in the distributed automation system of an electrical substation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The PhD study {{focuses on}} {{long-term}} settlement histories {{in the late}} prehistory of South East Bulgaria, based upon three contrasting microregions. Two {{of them have been}} destroyed by intensive coal mining, which has necessitated the application of GIS as a rescue tool to reconstruct the landscape. The third, undestroyed microregion was included in the study to enable the comparison of settlement patterns in three neighbouring valleys. The main research aims are the social and economic aspects of the human/landscape interrelation, as well as the patterns of change and continuity from the initial occupation {{at the beginning of the}} Neolithic until the end of the Late Bronze Age. Along with the GIS technique, which proved to be a relevant analytical tool, a set of modern interpretative modes in archaeology was applied to achieve the research targets. The general and specific approaches in the study are prompted by the state of the primary data, which but rarely allows precise contextual analysis. As a result of the introduction of the concepts of landscape archaeology and social practices in the studies of Bulgarian late prehistory, it was possible to establish crucial links between the identity of people, places and objects. The identification of a suite of social practices has integrated the Bulgarian evidence in a broader context of human development and has contributed to the radical re-interpretation of most of the current explanations of the evidence at the study area. The reconstruction of past landscapes in the three microregions, together with the newly reconciled concepts of landscape and environment, have facilitated the reconstruction of past settlement patterns, resource potential and <b>inter-site</b> transport <b>networks.</b> Through the evaluation and re-interpretation of site evidence for all settlements and burials, it was possible to make a comparative interpretation of diachronic changes in settlement, society, material culture and landscapes.
