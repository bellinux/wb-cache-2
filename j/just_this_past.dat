In 2016, the company underwent an organizational shift and announced Hilf was leaving the company to “pursue new opportunities.” In an email to GeekWire, Hilf wrote, “For me personally, when I joined, I made a commitment to build the cloud business here at HP for three years, and I’m now 3 years and one month in, and we have had very strong growth - <b>just</b> <b>this</b> <b>past</b> June HPE Helion was recognized as a leader in the private cloud market for the third year in a row.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Chris Wallace of Fox News, the civil rights activist the Reverend Jesse Jackson said that he regretted that coverage given to the Sherrod incident had overshadowed more important federal actions that month. The government had settled longstanding claims of racial discrimination in programs of USDA and the Department of Interior. Jackson noted the landmark nature of the national settlements of these cases and that {{tens of thousands of}} people benefited from the compensation for previous injustices. He said: <b>Just</b> <b>this</b> <b>past</b> Thursday the black farmers got a $1.2 billion settlement, the American Indians a $3.2 billion settlement, for race discrimination. We're not discussing all the facts... 100,000 black farmers get no press. Native Americans get no press. We're still arguing about how fast or slow the White House reacted. Also the Spooner's testimony - this white family farmer, Eloise and Mr. Spooner - I thought their stepping up to the plate in alliance with Sherrod was a great news story that none of us should miss.|$|E

The cast of the one-act (Ashley E., Jerry L., and Mya P.) scored straight superiors at both the district level and the state level, making a mark on the already prestigious and well-represented troupe 3910.|$|E

40|$|Minneapolis. Both are {{interested}} in the theory and the application of general equilibrium models. Kehoe's RePEc/IDEAS entry, Prescott's RePEc/IDEAS entry. EconomicDynamics: Depressions have recently received a lot of interest, witness the special issue of the Review of Economic Dynamics in 2002 and now the book you have edited. Why this sudden interest? Timothy Kehoe, Edward Prescott: In 1999 Hal Cole and Lee Ohanian published a paper in the Quarterly Review of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis that broke a long standing taboo. They analyzed the U. S. Great Depression using the neoclassical growth model. What they found was fascinating. Productivity recovered by 1935, but labor supply remained depressed by 25 percent and did not begin to recover until 1939. An important question is why. Another important question, of course, is why productivity fell so sharply starting in 1929. The Cole and Ohanian study motivated us to organize a conference at Minneapolis Fed in 2000 at which people presented analyses of great depressions in other countries using the neoclassical growth model. Six of the studies were from the interwar period and the other three from the postwar period. We encouraged the authors to work more on their papers and to submit revised versions to RED. With the help of the graduate students in our workshop, we edited a special volume of RED with these studies. <b>Just</b> <b>this</b> <b>past</b> year, we have published a book with revised versions of Hal and Lee's original article and the articles in the RED volume, as well as si...|$|E
