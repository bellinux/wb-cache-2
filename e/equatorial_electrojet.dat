Following ISGI (2016), a day is considered quiet if mean(aa)< 13 nT and ∑p < 6 were fulfilled over a 48 -h interval (CC 48 day). In this manner, we can ensure that the chosen day has no significant disturbances 12 h {{before and after the}} day of interest. Here, p should not be mistaken with the time harmonic p, and it denotes a weight assigned to an individual aa value according to ISGI (2016). For the chosen day, mean(aa) = 3 nT and ∑p = 0.

Therefore {{understanding}} how severe such storms could be {{is important to}} a wide range of space weather data and forecast end-users. Extreme value statistical (EVS) methods are therefore applied to a global set of geomagnetic observatory data to determine the one in 100 and one in 200 year extreme values in the north, east and horizontal field strengths and their time rates-of-change. We use one-minute digital data from geographically widely distributed observatories with typically a few decades of digital operations. Individual generalised Pareto distribution functions are fitted to the tail of each observatory data distribution, above some threshold marking the onset of extreme activity for that location. We discuss the return levels, for the one in 100 and one in 200 year events, with respect to the geographical distribution of the observatories, the proximity to auroral and <b>equatorial</b> <b>electrojets</b> and compare results with a separate EVS study of European-only magnetic observatory dat...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{division of}} the ionosphere into dynamo and motor regions is performed {{on the base of}} empirical models of space distributions of ionospheric parameters. Pedersen and Hall conductivities are modified to represent an impact of acceleration of the medium because of Ampére's force. It is shown that the currents in the F 2 layer are greatly reduced for processes of a few hours duration. This reduction is in particular important for the night-side low-latitude ionosphere. The International Reference Ionosphere model is used to analyze the effect quantitatively. This model gives a second high conducting layer in the night-side low-latitude ionosphere that reduces the electric field and <b>equatorial</b> <b>electrojets,</b> but intensifies night-side currents during the short-term events. These currents occupy regions which are much wider than those of <b>equatorial</b> <b>electrojets.</b> It is demonstrated that the parameter &sigma;d=&sigma;P+&sigma;H&Sigma;H/&Sigma;P that involves the integral Pedersen and Hall conductances &Sigma;P, &Sigma;H ought to be used instead of the local Cowling conductivity &sigma;C in calculations of the electric current density in the equatorial ionosphere. We may note that Gurevich et al. (1976) derived a parameter similar to &sigma;d for more general conditions as those which we discuss in this paper; a more detailed description of this point is given in Sect. 6. Both, &sigma;d and &sigma;C, appear when a magnetic field line is near a nonconducting domain which means zero current through the boundary of this domain. The main difference between &sigma;d and &sigma;C is that &sigma;d definition includes the possibility for the electric current to flow along a magnetic field line in order to close all currents which go to this line from neighboring ones. The local Cowling conductivity &sigma;C corresponds to the current closure at each point of a magnetic field line. It is adequate only for a magnetic field line with constant local conductivity at the whole line when field-aligned currents do not exist because of symmetry, but &sigma;C=&sigma;d in this case. So, {{there is no reason to}} use the local Cowling conductivity while the Cowling conductance &Sigma;C=&Sigma;P+&Sigma;H 2 /&Sigma;P is a useful and well defined parameter...|$|R

30|$|To {{determine}} the Sq source, we exploit the S 3 D method presented in (Koch and Kuvshinov 2013). It {{is an attractive}} alternative to the classic potential method of (Gauss 1838) as used for example by (Schmucker 1999). The potential method is not capable of dealing with a 3 -D conductivity model as a priori information, which is of particular importance {{to account for the}} ocean effect (Kuvshinov 2008). The reader is referred to the explanation of the S 3 D method in (Koch and Kuvshinov 2013) for further details. The Sq source is represented by a specific set of 11 SH coefficients for the 24 -h time harmonic and by sets of 12 SH coefficients {{for the rest of the}} five time harmonics (12, 8, 6, 4.8, 4 h), as suggested by (Schmucker 1999). It is noted here that for the Sq source determination, we use only mid-latitude observatories in between ± 6 ° and ± 60 ° dip latitude to avoid effects from polar and <b>equatorial</b> <b>electrojets.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{fundamental}} assumption {{underlying the}} magnetotelluric (MT) method is that external source fields have wavelengths that are large {{compared to the}} fundamental length scale characterizing electromagnetic (EM) induction in the Earth—that is, the skin depth (e.g., Weidelt and Chave 2012). With the assumption of a quasi-uniform source, the impedance (transfer function, TF, relating electric to magnetic fields at a point on the Earth’s surface) is well defined and independent of the actual (large-scale) spatial structure of the source fields. Because EM induction in a conductor is a diffusive process, the impedance and other uniform source TFs used in MT (e.g., vertical magnetic field TFs) should be very smooth functions of frequency (Weidelt 1972). Indeed, excessively rapid variations in TF curves estimated from field data are often taken as evidence of source complications, most often due to relatively short-wavelength anthropogenic EM signals such as electric trains (e.g., Larsen et al. 1996; Egbert 1997; Egbert et al. 2000). Possible biases in MT TFs due to complications in naturally occurring external sources are also occasionally considered, but generally only at long periods (>  1000  s) and near the auroral or <b>equatorial</b> <b>electrojets</b> (e.g., Viljanen 2012, and references therein).|$|R
40|$|Ground-based {{observations}} of geomagnetic field (B field) are usually a superposition of signatures from different source current {{systems in the}} magnetosphere and ionosphere. Fluctuating B fields generate geoelectric fields (E fields), which drive geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) in technological conducting media at the Earth's surface. We introduce a new Fourier integral B field model of east/west directed line current systems over a one-dimensional multilayered Earth in plane geometry. Derived layered-Earth profiles, given in the literature, are needed to calculate the surface impedance, and therefore reflection coefficient in the integral. The 2003 Halloween storm measurements were Fourier transformed for B field spectrum Levenberg-Marquardt least squares inversion over latitude. The inversion modeled strengths of the <b>equatorial</b> <b>electrojets,</b> auroral electrojets, and ring currents were compared to the forward problem computed strength. It is found the optimized and direct results match each other closely and supplement previous established studies about these source currents. Using this model, a data set of current system magnitudes {{may be used to}} develop empirical models linking solar wind activity to magnetospheric current systems. In addition, the ground E fields are also calculated directly, which serves as a proxy for computing GIC in conductor-based networks...|$|R

Observations by radar, rockets, satellites, and geomagnetic observatories are used to study EEJ.|$|E
30|$|The {{second problem}} is the {{relation}} {{of this type of}} pulsations to known current systems and their variations at different timescales. The bibliography on a possible relation of wave geomagnetic phenomena with global current systems, such as auroral and <b>equatorial</b> <b>electrojets,</b> storm-time current systems, and solar quiet system, includes several hundred publications (see e.g., Stening 1995; Hamid et al. 1967). However, this problem is far from being solved. On the one hand, a correlation exists between the intensities of current fluctuations at different frequencies. This result is reproduced both in the well-known correlations of pulsations amplitudes with geomagnetic indexes (Rostoker 1995) and in the analysis with more complicated techniques like empirical mode decomposition (EMD) undertaken by Alberti et al. (2016) for both disturbed and quiet conditions. On the other hand, Pc 4 (Kokubun et al. 1989) and low-latitude Pi 2 pulsations (Kwon et al. 2013) are regularly generated at a quiet background. Besides, different current systems are interrelated (Stening 1995); they demonstrate a complicated spatiotemporal evolution (Kamide and Kokubun 1996), resulting in a non-trivial frequency dependence of the corresponding indexes (Takalo et al. 1994; Consolini et al. 1996). Thus, the correlations of Pc 3 n_L occurrence with AE and local activity index K, found in the present study, can be used only as a qualitative indicator of the existence of an intra-magnetospheric source for these pulsations, but they do not localize this source in a particular current system and/or specify the parameters of transition processes, necessary for Pc 3 n_L generation.|$|R
40|$|The {{measurements}} of ionospheric drift and convection using the digital doppler interferometer at the Wireless and Radio Science centre (Waras) at UTHM, {{is used to}} provide high temporal and spatial resolution {{measurements of}} the dynamics of the ionosphere at the Parit Raja station in Batu Pahat, Johor. These measurements include Doppler shifts, angles of arrival, as well as group ranges from the significant numbers of ionospheric echo sources simultaneously at the same time. By employing Doppler inteferometry reception technique at four receivers connected to four spaced antennas nearby, it is possible to identify the three dimensional locations of various scattering points reflected back from the ionosphere as a result of vertically-incident HF waves transmitted at frequencies of 5. 9 MHz, 7 MHz, and 8 MHz. These three frequencies cover the local F-layers since the critical frequencies lie between 6 MHz and 8 MHz for this local station. The technique of Doppler interferometry treats signal returns from the ionospheric F-region as reflections from individual scatterers. Spectral analysis is performed on the complex voltages generated from the four receivers’ in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) detectors to produce Doppler frequency functions. Both spectral phase functions and amplitude functions are generated using Fast Fourier Transform or FFT by the receivers from the Doppler frequency functions. This will then result in a skymap display containing echo coordinates ranges and Doppler shifts. By further processing of the echoes, drift velocities which can be deduced by a least-squares fitting algorithm can be found. The behaviour of the plasma movements under certain variations of the geomagnetic and solar activities can also be studied so as to be able to estimate the influence of geomagnetic storms and <b>equatorial</b> <b>electrojets</b> on the ionosphere, which is vital for navigation, surveillance and telecommunications...|$|R

It is observed that, the stratospheric temperature at ~ 30 km over Trivandrum shows a sudden cooling prior to the SSWs and the CEJs of maximum intensity which occurs around this time. In general stronger CEJs are associated with more intense SSW events. The stratospheric zonal mean zonal wind over Trivandrum also exhibits a distinctly different pattern during the SSW period. These circulation changes are proposed to be conducive for the upward propagation of the lower atmospheric waves over the equatorial latitudes. The interaction of such waves with the tidal components at the upper mesosphere and its subsequent modification are suggested to be responsible for the occurrence of CEJs having planetary wave periods...|$|R
