40|$|Guanine nucleotide-binding {{proteins}} (G-proteins) {{are known}} to act as important modulators of insulin release from the islets of Langerhans. We have recently found that the deoxynojirimycin-derivative <b>emiglitate,</b> a recognized inhibitor of intestinal alpha-glucosidehydrolase activity, is a powerful inhibitor of glucose-induced insulin release. With the use of isolated mouse islets the present investigation was performed in a primary attempt to elucidate whether this inhibitory mechanism in some way {{was linked to the}} beta-cell G-protein system. Treatment of freshly isolated islets with pertussis toxin (PTX), which is known to inactivate the G (i) -proteins, abolished the inhibitory effect of the alpha(2) -adrenoceptor agonist clonidine on insulin release stimulated by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX {{in the presence of the}} protein kinase C activator TPA and even changed it into an increase. <b>Emiglitate</b> did not display any inhibitory action on insulin release induced by these secretagogues. Similarly, clonidine-induced inhibition of glucose stimulated insulin release was reversed by PTX. However, PTX did not influence the suppressive action of <b>emiglitate</b> on glucose-induced insulin secretion. In contrast, the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin totally abolished the inhibitory effect of <b>emiglitate,</b> but not that of the glucose analogue mannoheptulose, on glucose-induced insulin release. Moreover, the stimulatory effect of forskolin and cholera toxin (CTX) (activator of G (s) -proteins) on the secretion of insulin was markedly enhanced in the presence of <b>emiglitate.</b> In conclusion, our results suggest that the inhibitory effect of <b>emiglitate</b> on glucose-induced insulin release is not directly related to the G(s) -proteins, but most likely exerted solely through the selective suppression of lysosomal aglucosidehydrolase activity, a step in between the proximal and the distal G(i) -proteins, in glucose induced stimulus-secretion mechanisms. Our data also suggests that the inhibitory action of <b>emiglitate</b> on glucose stimulated insulin release can be compensated for by an increased sensitivity of the cyclic AMP-protein kinase A pathway. Hence, <b>emiglitate</b> might indirectly elicit an increased activity of the G(s) -proteins to facilitate the secretory process...|$|E
40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to a possible relationship between lysosomal function and stimulation of secretory processes in endocrine cells. The last few years it has become increasingly evident that the secretion of insulin from the pancreatic beta-cell is the result of a very complex cascade of events, the details of which are far from elucidated and indeed may include the participation of the lysosomal system. We report here, with a combined in vitro and in vivo approach, that selective inhibition of islet lysosomal glycogenolytic acid glucan- 1, 4 -alpha-glucosidase activity by the long-acting 1 -deoxynojirimycin derivative <b>emiglitate</b> induces a profound suppression of nutrient-induced insulin release. In islet homogenate <b>emiglitate</b> strongly and dose-dependently inhibited the activity of acid glucan- 1, 4 -alpha-glucosidase (EC 50 approximately 10 (- 6) M) without affecting other classical lysosomal enzyme activities. The emiglitate-induced inhibition curve for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from isolated islets was remarkably similar to the inhibition curve for acid glucan- 1, 4 -alpha-glucosidase. Moreover, insulin release stimulated by the nonglucose nutrient secretagogues, leucine, and alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) was totally suppressed by <b>emiglitate.</b> In contrast, receptor activated insulin secretion induced by the insulinotropic hormone cholecystokinin (CCK- 8) was unaffected by the drug. Further, parenteral pretreatment of mice with <b>emiglitate</b> markedly suppressed the insulin secretory response to an iv injection of glucose or KIC, whereas the response to an iv injection of CCK- 8 was unaffected. In accordance with this, islets isolated from emiglitate-treated mice showed a reduced activity of acid glucan- 1, 4 -alpha-glucosidase and, moreover, such islets incubated in vitro, secreted less insulin in response to glucose than did control islets. Finally, pretreatment of mice with purified fungal acid glucan- 1, 4 -alpha-glucosidase, enzyme replacement, brought about a markedly increased insulin secretory response after an iv injection of KIC, whereas the insulin response after CCK- 8 injection was unaffected. Taken together with previous observations, the present data strongly suggest that islet lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidehydrolases are involved in the multifactorial process of nutrient-induced insulin secretion. The existence of hitherto unresolved and complex interactions between different beta-cell organelles in the insulin secretory processes should be thoroughly reevaluated...|$|E
40|$|The pseudotetrasaccharide acarbose, {{previously}} {{known as}} a potent inhibitor of intestinal alpha-glucoside hydrolases, was investigated with regard to its influence on islet lysosomal enzyme activities and the insulin secretory processes. We observed that acarbose was a potent inhibitor of mouse islet lysosomal acid glucan- 1, 4 -alpha-glucosidase activity, EC 50 approximately 5 mumol/l, {{as well as of}} acid alpha-glucosidase activity. In contrast, acarbose did not influence other lysosomal enzyme activities such as acid phosphatase and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. Neutral alpha-glucosidase (endoplasmic reticulum) was only moderately inhibited in homogenate and was unaffected in intact islets. Incubation of isolated mouse islets with acarbose revealed that the pseudotetrasaccharide was a strong inhibitor of glucose-induced insulin secretion, EC 50 approximately 500 nmol/l, and a significant inhibition was already observed at a concentration of acarbose as low as 100 nmol/l. The acarbose analogue maltotetrose did not influence either glucose-induced insulin release or islet lysosomal enzyme activities. Further, acarbose as well as two other alpha-glucoside hydrolase inhibitors, the deoxynojirimycin derivatives miglitol and <b>emiglitate,</b> did not affect islet glucose oxidation at low or high glucose levels. Acarbose also inhibited insulin release induced by the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, whereas insulin secretion stimulated by the cholinergic muscarinic agonist carbachol or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine was unaffected by the drug. Moreover, complementary in vivo experiments showed that pretreatment of mice with acarbose to allow for endocytosis of the compound markedly suppressed the insulin secretory response to an intravenous glucose load.
