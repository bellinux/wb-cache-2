5|$|Potassium can be {{detected}} by taste because it triggers {{three of the five}} types of taste sensations, according to concentration. Dilute solutions of potassium ions taste sweet, allowing moderate concentrations in milk and juices, while higher concentrations become increasingly bitter/alkaline, and finally also salty to the taste.

5|$|The {{global market}} for {{brachytherapy}} reached US$680 million in 2013, {{of which the}} <b>High-Dose</b> Rate (HDR) and LDR segments accounted for 70%. Microspheres and electronic brachytherapy comprised the remaining 30%. One analysis predicts that the brachytherapy market may reach over US$2.4 billion in 2030, growing by 8% annually, mainly driven by the microspheres market as well as electronic brachytherapy, which is gaining significant interest worldwide as a user-friendly technology. The word brachy is Greek for short distance.|$|E
5|$|The {{degree of}} {{ovulation}} suppression in progestogen-only contraceptives {{depends on the}} progestogen activity and dose. Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives—traditional progestogen only pills, subdermal implants Norplant and Jadelle, and intrauterine system Mirena—inhibit ovulation in about 50% of cycles and rely mainly on other effects, such as thickening of cervical mucus, for their contraceptive effectiveness. Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives—the progestogen-only pill Cerazette and the subdermal implant Nexplanon—allow some follicular development but more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low-dose progestogens. <b>High-dose,</b> progestogen-only contraceptives—the injectables Depo-Provera and Noristerat—completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation.|$|E

5|$|VKORC1 polymorphisms explain 30% of {{the dose}} {{variation}} between patients: particular mutations make VKORC1 {{less susceptible to}} suppression by warfarin. There are two main haplotypes that explain 25% of variation: low-dose haplotype group (A) and a <b>high-dose</b> haplotype group (B). VKORC1 polymorphisms explain why African Americans are on average relatively resistant to warfarin (higher proportion of group B haplotypes), while Asian Americans are generally more sensitive (higher proportion of group A haplotypes).

5|$|In rodents and primates, {{sufficiently}} {{high doses}} of amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by dopamine terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function. There {{is no evidence that}} amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, large doses of amphetamine may indirectly cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, and increased autoxidation of dopamine. Animal models of neurotoxicity from <b>high-dose</b> amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature≥40°C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40°C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species, disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing blood–brain barrier permeability.|$|E
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. <b>High-dose</b> continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.|$|E

5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of <b>high-dose</b> hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E

Fully 36 rats were evenly divided into 9 groups. Right MCLs of groups 1 to 6 and 8 were transected, while that of groups 7 and 9 remained intact. After surgery, group 1 was treated with 1 session of <b>high-dosed</b> laser; group 2 with 9 sessions of low-dosed laser; group 3 with an herbal plaster; groups 4 and 5 received combined treatments of groups 1 and β and 2, and 3 respectively; groups 6 and 7 received only bandaging; groups 8 and 9 received placebo laser and no treatment, respectively. All MCLs were subjected to biomechanical testing at 3 weeks postsurgery. Results revealed significant differences among groups in ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and stiffness (p < 0. 01). Combination of multiple low-dosed laser treatment with herbal treatment (group 5) resulted in higher UTS than either no treatment (groups 6 and 8), single <b>high-dosed</b> laser treatment (group 1), multiple low-dosed laser treatment (group 2), or herbal treatment (group 2) alone.

40|$|This trial should assist {{clarification}} of whether <b>high-dosed</b> vitamin C as an antioxidant {{has a positive}} effect on ischemia-/reperfusion injury in orthotopic liver transplantation. Over a period of half an hour, we infused 7. 5 g of vitamin C into 10 patients during the anhepatic phase of liver transplantation. The control group of 20 patients received no vitamin C. We took blood from the patients at 7 different points during the transplantation (preoperative, 15 minutes after explantation of the liver, 5 minutes before reperfusion, 5 minutes after reperfusion, 15 minutes after reperfusion, 60 minutes after reperfusion, 240 minutes after reperfusion) and measured the thiobarbiturate reactive substances, superoxidedismutase and myeloperoxidase as markers for oxidative stress. The interleukin- 6 concentration in plasma was determined as an unspecific parameter for systemic inflammation and the two groups compared. The following questions were of interest: 1. Does the intraoperative application of vitamin C have {{a positive effect on}} the level of transaminases as a marker of postoperative liver function? 2. Can intraoperative administration of vitamin C reduce the number of free radicals in blood serum/plasma? 3. How does <b>high-dosed</b> vitamin C influence systemic inflammation? GOT and GPT values were used as markers of postoperative liver function. We ascertained no significant difference between the two groups during a 24 -hour period, so that a positive effect of <b>high-dosed</b> vitamin C on the rise of transaminases as parameters of liver function must be negated. It must be discussed, whether transaminases are an adequate marker of ischaemia-/reperfusion injury, as from the measured parameter of oxidative stress, only the superoxidedismutase displayed a moderate correlation or a correlation to transaminases, the thiobarbiturative reactive substances and the myeloperoxidase predominantly displayed weak or absent correlation. Our trial was unable to determine conclusively, whether vitamin C reduces the number of free radicals in blood plasma. The examination must be repeated with a greater number of patients. For the comparison of the two groups we used the maximum rise of each parameter. 4 hours after reperfusion we observed a significantly lower increase in thiobarbituratic reactive substances in the vitamin C group, which indicates a reduction of lipid peroxidation. Myeloperoxidase concentration is significantly lower in the group treated with vitamin C. It appears that vitamin C almost completely inhibits the activation of neutrophils. No significant difference between the two groups was observed in the superoxidedismutase concentration in blood plasma. Based on our data, vitamin C does not appear to influence systematic inflammation positively, however the findings should be confirmed by assessing further inflammation parameters...|$|R

The average seawater volume in each basin was 9 m 3 {{with an average}} water residence time of about 2 h. A tidal regime resembling that in the fjord was maintained in the basins, and waves were generated regularly. NH 4 NO 3 and H 3 PO 4, at a constant molar NP ratio of 16 : 1, was added into 6 basins at concentrations 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ŠM DIN above the background DIN concentration during 1 z years. Two mesocosms were kept as control treatment. Marine communities were introduced into the basins two {{years prior to the}} start of nutrient dosage. The effects of nutrient enrichment were few and only marginal during the first year of nutrient addition, while some effects became more obvious during the second year. The growth rate of the periphyton and fast-growing macroalgae communities was stimulated by nutrient enrichment, while the response was less evident among the perennial fucoids. The structure of the macroalgal communities, however, did not change during 16 months' measurements. In contrast, growth on artificial rock substrates during the same period of time revealed intensive growth of the fast-growing Ulva lactuca in <b>high-dosed</b> basins compared with low-dosed and control basins, which were dominated by the fucoid Fucus serratus.
