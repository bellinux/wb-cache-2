During the period of August- September 1999, seven instrument groups of MDOBO were deployed at the target position, at 80 - 1000 meter distances from the telemetry system, with several meters allowances using a deep-towing unit. To install the instrument at the exact location, the mother ship of deep-towing unit was precisely navigated. The extension cables were also dropped from the deep-towing unit. The ROV Kaiko- 10 K extended multi-conductor extension cables from instrument units towards the ocean-bottom telemetry system and connected them to undersea mateable connectors on the junction box.

40|$|A {{geophysical}} survey presents many challenges. A scientist {{must be able}} to not only understand the theory and nature of the geophysics being applied but must also be able to identify features of interest in a dataset. It is also of extreme importance to be able to determine where, in the subsurface, the features identified in the data occur. This research is designed in an attempt to identify the locations of subsurface heterogeneities that affect <b>geophysical</b> <b>instrument</b> response. An experiment was conducted in which topography, magnetics, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), and electromagnetic induction (EM) data were collected over a defined survey line. An excavator with a modified flat-bladed bucket was used to remove, or skim, a 5 to 10 cm thick layer of material from the survey line. Upon removal of the material, datasets from the above mentioned instruments were again collected along the same survey line. This process was repeated for 10 skims, resulting in a total of 11 sets of data for each instrument. Having collected data with various instruments in the same location as material was progressively removed allowed for an empirical study with the goal of noting how the response of each instrument changed with respect to the removal of material. By observing how the anomalies changed in the data from one skim to the next, {{a better understanding of the}} location of the causative heterogeneities could be had. Data for each instrument was compared to the equivalent data collected from each subsequent skim to determine how similar or different the data appeared as the depth of the trench increased. The experiment also sought to determine if the topographic variations, or roughness, along the survey line had any impact of the geophysical signals. The data collected from each instrument were compared to the topographic roughness of the survey line for the corresponding skim...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{three-dimensional}} mapping of archaeological structures through the 3 D inversion of surface apparent resistivity measurements. The main goal of the thesis is the assessment of a practical process that will combine the collection and the processing of 3 D resistivity data from archaeological sites, in a relatively swift manner. An introduction to the basic theory and {{the principles of the}} electrical resistivity method is initially presented. The choice of recording the three dimensional variation of the apparent resistivity through the conduct of parallel and/or orthogonal tomographies is justified. A modified technique for the collection of parallel and/or orthogonal 2 D geoelectrical tomographic data is presented. The technique is based on a suitable modification of an existing <b>geophysical</b> <b>instrument.</b> It was applied in practice for the collection of real data from different archaeological places in Greece. The Finite Element Method was selected for calculating the electrical responses of models that simulate common archaeological structures. The adjoint equation technique was incorporated into the FEM framework in order to calculate the elements of the Jacobian matrix. The basic principles of the inversion theory are presented while a smoothness constrained inversion technique for reconstructing the true geoelectrical structure in archaeological sites is described. The information context and the resolution of the parallel and orthogonal tomographies, regarding their ability to map the three-dimensional variation of the archaeological structures, was studied through the sensitivity analysis and the 3 D inversion of synthetic and real data. The optimum way of collecting, processing and interpretating the parallel tomographic data gathered from archaeological sites is fully analyzed. The advantages and the disadvantages of the quasi- 3 D and the real- 3 D inversion models are determined by analyzing synthetic as well as real data. Finally the basic steps of an improved algorithm for the fast 3 D inversion of the dense parallel and/or orthogonal 2 D tomographies are presented in detail. The basic idea of the algorithm is based in avoiding the calculation of specific Jacobian matrix elements with very small absolute values. The reliability of the proposed algorithm is examined with extensive tests on synthetic and on real data which were collected from various archaeological sites of Greece, using different electrode configurations. ...|$|E

[...] 23 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 4 appendicesThe TOMO-ETNA {{experiment was}} devised to {{image of the}} crust underlying the volcanic edifice and, possibly, its plumbing system by using passive and active refraction/reflection seismic methods. This experiment included activities both on-land and offshore with the main objective of obtaining a new high-resolution seismic tomography to improve {{the knowledge of the}} crustal structures existing beneath the Etna volcano and northeast Sicily up to Aeolian Islands. The TOMO-ETNA experiment was divided in two phases. The first phase started on June 15, 2014 and finalized on July 24, 2014, with the withdrawal of two removable seismic networks (a short period network and a broadband network composed by 80 and 20 stations respectively) deployed at Etna volcano and surrounding areas. During this first phase the oceanographic research vessel (R/V) “Sarmiento de Gamboa” and the hydro-oceanographic vessel (H/V) “Galatea” performed the offshore activities, which includes the deployment of ocean bottom seismometers (OBS), air-gun shooting for wide angle seismic refraction (WAS), multi-channel seismic (MCS) reflection surveys, magnetic surveys and ROV (remotely operated vehicle) dives. This phase finished with the recovery of the short period seismic network. In the second phase the broadband seismic network remained operative until October 28, 2014, and the R/V “Aegaeo” performed additional MCS surveys during November 19 - 27, 2014.

40|$|The {{geophysical}} {{data acquisition}} system named GILDA (<b>Geophysical</b> <b>Instrument</b> for Low power Data Acquisition) has been developed by the Osservatorio Vesuviano, department of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia in Naples (INGV). The main goal of this project was to study, develop and produce a {{data acquisition system}} specifically devoted to multiparametric volcano monitoring. INGV policy is to share this instrument and the relative know-how in frameworks of collaborative activities with other institutions involved in geophysical monitoring and research. The first step of the GILDA project has been the realization of an high-resolution seismic datalogger, with 4 channels, different possible sampling rates from 40 sps to 1000 sps, about 132 dB of dynamic range and a very low power consumption of about 840 mW at full performances. The GILDA datalogger is a multiboard system composed of a 24 bit sigma-delta ADC board, a central processing unit board based on an ARMv 7 core, a timing board for GPS synchronization and a GPS board realized with a Trimble Lassen iQ unit. A module for remote GPS installation is also available allowing placement of the instrument in vaults and areas not covered by GPS signal. The last upgrade {{of the system is}} an external board for local data storage based on an SD/SDHC memory card allowing up 32 GB of data (in a typical usage this allows about 1. 5 years of storage). At present other instruments are under study for the GILDA project, in particular a multichannel acquisition system specially designed for array applications and another one designed for geochemical data acquisition. The overall production costs of the datalogger system is of about 2500 €, making it a very competitive solution for purposes of low budget experiments or seismic networks. It is a very good trade-off among performances, power requirement and costs. The multiboard approach of the datalogger further reduces running costs of the system because in case of faults it is always possible to repair or change only the broken board instead of repair or change the whole object. Data acquisition of the system uses the Earthworm suite running a specialized home developed module. Both are open source software that may be used without any additional fee and they may be run on a GNU/Linux operating system. These conditions allows for further cost reductions compared to some commercial solutions using proprietary and license charged softwares...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of oceanic spreading centres and subsurface melt distribution within newly formed crust is largely understood from marine seismic experiments. In Iceland, however, sub-aerial rift elevation allows both accurate surface mapping and {{the installation of}} large broadband seismic arrays. We present a study using ambient noise Rayleigh wave tomography to image the volcanic spreading centres across Iceland. Our high resolution model images a continuous band of low seismic velocities, parallelling all three segments of the branched rift in Iceland. The upper 10 km contains strong velocity variations, with shear wave velocities 0. 5 km[*]s$^{− 1 }$ faster in the older non-volcanically active regions compared to the active rifts. Slow velocities correlate very closely with geological surface mapping, with contours of the anomalies parallelling {{the edges of the}} neo-volcanic zones. The low-velocity band extends to the full 50 km width of the neo-volcanic zones, demonstrating a significant contrast with the narrow (8 km wide) magmatic zone seen at fast spreading ridges, where the rate of melt supply is similarly high. Within the seismically slow rift band, the lowest velocity cores of the anomalies occur above the centre of the mantle plume under the Vatnajökull icecap, and in the Eastern Volcanic Zone under the central volcano Katla. This suggests localisation of melt accumulation at these specific volcanic centres, demonstrating variability in melt supply into the shallow crust along the rift axis. Shear velocity inversions with depth show that the strongest velocity contrasts are found in the upper 8 km, and show a slight depression in the shear velocity through the mid crust (10 – 20 km) in the rifts. Our model also shows less intensity to the slow rift anomaly in the Western Volcanic Zone, supporting the notion that rift activity here is decreasing as the ridge jumps to the Eastern Volcanic Zone.

40|$|The Baza basin {{is a large}} Neogene {{intramontane basin}} in the Bétic Cordillera of {{southern}} Spain that formed during the Tortonian (late Miocene). The Bétic Cordillera was produced by NW–SE oblique convergence between the Eurasian and African Plates. Three seismic reflection lines (each 18 km long; vibroseis method) were acquired across the Baza basin to reveal {{the architecture of the}} sedimentary infill and faulting during basin formation. We applied rather conventional CDP data processing followed by first arrival P-wave tomography to provide complementary structural information and establish velocity models for the post-stack migration. These images show a highly asymmetric structure for the Basin with sediments thickening westward, reaching a maximum observed thickness of > 2200 m near the governing Baza Fault zone (BFZ). Three major seismic units (including several subunits) on top of the acoustic basement could be identified. We use stratigraphic information from the uplifted block of the BFZ and other outcrops at the basin edges together with available information from neighboring Bétic basins to tentatively correlate the seismic units to the known stratigraphy in the area. Until new drilling or surface outcrop data is not available, this interpretation is preliminary. The seismic units could be associated to Tortonian marine deposits, and latest Miocene to Pleistocene continental fluvio-lacustrine sediments. Individual strands of the BFZ truncate the basin sediments. Strong fault reflections imaged in two lines are the product of the large impedance contrast between sedimentary fill and basement. In {{the central part of the}} Basin several basement faults document strong deformation related to the early stages of basin formation. Some of these faults can be traced up to the shallowest imaged depth levels indicating activity until recent times. © 2017 Elsevier B. V.

The considerable distance between the Descartes site and previous Apollo landing sites would be beneficial for the network of <b>geophysical</b> <b>instruments,</b> portions of which were deployed on each Apollo expedition beginning with Apollo 12.|$|R
