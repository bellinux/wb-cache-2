60|$|The {{creature}} thrashed up, wore {{round with}} a clatter and rattle, and lay <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> within ear-shot.|$|E
60|$|Another moment, and the {{rattling}} chain {{caused a}} tremor through the vessel, which ceased when the anchor touched bottom, and they rode <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} a hail {{came from the}} vessel {{anchored}} ahead of them. Bob went to the bulwark. The brig had swung <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind,</b> and was broadside on with the other craft.|$|E
60|$|When they swung out {{upon the}} long pike leading due north, Wallace drew his breath with a gasp, and bent his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the <b>wind.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wind pennant-a small wind {{indicator}} {{balanced on}} a pivot, usually fitted <b>to</b> the mast <b>head,</b> <b>to</b> indicate <b>wind</b> direction. Can {{be made of}} plastic, stainless steel or sail cloth.|$|R

6000|$|... "Then you'd {{better get}} down on to the wheel-case {{bracings}} with your grip. I don't know how they're {{going to take you}} off, but I guess they'll shoot her up <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> and you'll have to jump." ...|$|E
60|$|When the Madras was a mile away, the {{schooner}} was lying, {{thrown up}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind,</b> fifty {{yards from the}} brig; and her boats were already engaged in picking up the swimmers. Suddenly the brig gave a heavy lurch.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll touch now," [...] said Elsie a {{few minutes}} later; and Andrew dipped the pole, then threw it down and lowered the jib. The boat came round <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind,</b> and the anchor went down with a rattle of running chain.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gills!' {{said the}} Captain, hurrying {{into the back}} parlour, and taking him by the hand quite tenderly. 'Lay your <b>head</b> well <b>to</b> the <b>wind,</b> and we'll fight through it. All you've got to do,' said the Captain, with the solemnity {{of a man who}} was {{delivering}} himself of one of the most precious practical tenets ever discovered by human wisdom, 'is <b>to</b> lay your <b>head</b> well <b>to</b> the <b>wind,</b> and we'll fight through it!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two on them pills taken now, {{and two in}} the morning," [...] {{continued}} the captain, gravely, rolling a bolus in his fingers, [...] "will bring yer <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the <b>wind</b> again. Yer fallin' to leeward all the time, and ye want to brace up." ...|$|R
60|$|Sure enough, in {{less than}} fifteen minutes the Dunkery Beacon signalled that she would lay to, and before long the two vessels, their engines stopped and their <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> the <b>wind,</b> lay rising and falling on the waves, and near enough to speak to each other.|$|R
60|$|Watching {{for another}} {{lull in the}} blast, the hermit at last gave the order, and round they came as before, <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind,</b> but not quite so easily, and Nigel {{felt that they had}} {{narrowly}} escaped overturning in the operation.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{the last}} gun had been fired, the three vessels had been laid <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> but, when Bob's boat reached {{the side of the}} polacre, they were again put on their course and headed southwest, keeping within a short {{distance}} of each other.|$|E
6000|$|Strange consorts rode {{beside us}} [...] And brought us evil luck; [...] The witch-fire climbed our channels, [...] And danced on vane and truck: [...] Till, {{through the red}} tornado, [...] That lashed us nigh to blind, [...] We saw The Dutchman plunging, [...] Full canvas, <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|But {{in another}} half hour Vincent had to bring the boat's <b>head</b> up <b>to</b> the <b>wind,</b> lower the lug, and tie down the last reef.|$|R
50|$|A {{technique}} {{used to make}} these boats ultra-light is balsa wood cored hulls. A criticism is that the boats need to be reefed in relatively lower <b>winds,</b> when <b>heading</b> <b>to</b> the <b>wind.</b> Proponents argue that the Santa Cruz more than makes up for this deficiency in the downwind leg of a race.|$|R
50|$|Next {{the girls}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> a <b>wind</b> tunnel, <b>to</b> film a {{potential}} commercial for Rice Cakes. Sophie tells Viola {{that people have}} died from using a wind tunnel, causing her to perform badly. Daisy is deemed the best, and wins tickets to a private fashion party, choosing to take Sophie with her.|$|R
60|$|He busied {{himself with}} the bucket while Frank steered the boat, and {{an hour or so}} later they ran into a little {{sheltered}} inlet where they brought her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> and pitched the anchor over. After that they bailed out the half-swamped canoe, and, dropping into her, paddled ashore.|$|E
60|$|The {{order was}} {{repeated}} by the mate, who sprang {{to the wheel}} and assisted in obeying it. Round came the gallant ship with a magnificent sweep, and in another moment {{she would have been}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind,</b> when a sudden squall burst upon her broadside and threw her on her beam-ends.|$|E
60|$|The Sea-horse {{was lying}} <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> {{a mile and}} a half away, and the two prizes ran rapidly up to her. They were {{received}} with a tremendous cheer from the men closely packed along her bulwarks. O'Grady at once lowered a boat and was rowed to the Sea-horse, taking Terence with him.|$|E
60|$|These, however, {{had ceased}} rowing. Frank, {{as he saw}} the {{brigantine}} bowing over, had shouted to Purvis to put the boat's <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the <b>wind,</b> doing the same himself. A few seconds afterwards the squall struck them {{with such force that}} some of the oars were wrenched from the hands of the men, who were unprepared for the attack.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the skiff}} put {{out from the}} vessel's side, and the two men, keeping her <b>head</b> well <b>to</b> the <b>wind,</b> pulled lustily for shore. Lawless turned to a loiterer.|$|R
60|$|A big whitecap broke just beyond, washing {{over the}} barge {{and leaving the}} Alma half swamped. The men cast off, cursing him as they ran up their sail. Rasmunsen cursed back and fell to bailing. The mast and sail, like a sea anchor, still fast by the halyards, held the boat <b>head</b> on <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> and sea {{and gave him a}} chance to fight the water out.|$|R
60|$|The try-sail {{was soon}} on deck, {{and then the}} Seabird was brought up into the wind, the weather fore-sheet hauled aft, the mizzen sheeted almost fore and aft, and the Seabird lay, <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind,</b> rising and falling with a gentle motion, in strong {{contrast}} to her impetuous rushes when under sail.|$|E
60|$|Mossamedes forged ahead, and Kit {{wondered}} whether Don Erminio {{knew where he}} went. On the whole, he thought the captain did not know; sometimes one must blindly trust one's luck. She came round again, lurched by the turmoil on a sand, and steamed <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind.</b> Then Miguel {{came to the door}} of the wheel-house.|$|E
60|$|Sail was got off her, {{and a man}} {{placed in}} the chains, and {{soundings}} taken. This was continued until the water shoaled to eight fathoms, when the brig was brought up, <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind,</b> and the anchor let go. Then an anchor watch of four men was set, {{and the rest of}} the crew allowed to turn in.|$|E
6000|$|We now {{tried to}} put the ship's <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the <b>wind</b> and [...] "lay to," [...] by which landsmen will {{understand}} that we tried to face the storm, and remain stationary. But the gale was so fierce that this was impossible. The last rag of sail was blown away, and then there was nothing left for us but to show our stern to the gale, and [...] "scud under bare poles." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{clinging}} like grim {{death to}} the gunwale, we just managed to keep inside the boat, but it was exhausting work. Hector said that pirates and other seafaring people generally lashed the rudder to something or other, and hauled in the main top-jib, during severe squalls, and thought we ought {{to try to do}} something of the kind; but I was for letting her have her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the <b>wind.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Dan, I {{am going}} <b>to</b> bring her <b>head</b> up <b>to</b> the <b>wind,</b> so {{get ready to}} throw off that halyard and gather in the sail as it comes down. That's right, man, now down with the mast." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} {{afterward}} he completed his four-point bearing, and the Cetacea stopped, <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind,</b> with a rattle of running chain. The sea was comparatively smooth in {{the lee of}} the land, and ran in a long swell that broke into a curl of foam here and there. Bethune took up the glasses and turned them on the beach.|$|E
60|$|The brig {{continued}} her course, {{four or five}} hundred yards farther then, as {{the banks of the}} inlet closed in, Fairclough gave orders for the anchors to be let go. Everything had been prepared for this order, and the anchors at once dropped and, as soon as fifty fathoms of chain had been run out, the brig swung round <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was a sharp, hissing {{sound as}} {{the line of}} white water {{approached}} them, and then the squall struck them with such force and fury that the lads instinctively grasped at the shrouds. The mizzen had brought the craft in a moment <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind,</b> and Joe Chambers and the two sailors at once lowered it and stowed it away.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as the}} Adamant {{was brought}} up with her <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the <b>wind</b> she opened fire upon the repeller. The latter vessel could easily have sailed out {{of the range of}} a {{motionless}} enemy, but her orders forbade this. Her director had been instructed by the Syndicate to expose his vessel to the fire of the Adamant's heavy guns. Accordingly the repeller steamed nearer, and turned her broadside toward the British ship.|$|R
40|$|Birds {{in flight}} are {{proposed}} {{to adjust their}} body orientation (<b>heading)</b> and airspeed <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> conditions adaptively according to time and energy constraints. Airspeeds in goal-directed flight are predicted to approach or exceed maximum-range airspeeds, which minimize transport costs (energy expenditure per unit distance) and should increase in headwinds and crosswinds. Diagnosis of airspeed adjustment is however obscured by uncertainty regarding birds' goal-directions, transport costs, interrelations with orientation strategy and the attainability of predicted behaviour. To address these issues, we tested whether gulls minimized transport costs through adjustment of airspeed and <b>heading</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> conditions during extended inbound flight over water (180 - 360 km) to their breeding colony, and introduce a methodology to assess transport (energy) efficiency given wind conditions. Airspeeds, heading, flight mode and energy expenditure were estimated using GPS tracking, accelerometer and wind data. Predicted flight was determined by simulating each trip according to maximum-range airspeeds and various orientation strategies. Gulls employed primarily flapping flight (93 %), and negotiated crosswinds flexibly to exploit both high altitude tailwinds and coastal soaring opportunities. We demonstrate that predicted airspeeds in heavy crosswinds depend strongly on orientation strategy and presumed preferred direction. Measured airspeeds increased with headwind and crosswind similarly to maximum-range airspeeds based on full compensation for wind drift, yet remained ∼ 30 % lower than predicted by all strategies, resulting in slower and 30 - 35 % costlier flight. Interestingly, more energy could be saved through adjustment of airspeed (median 40 %) than via orientation strategy (median 4 %). Therefore, despite remarkably flexible reaction <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> at sea, these gulls evidently minimized neither time nor energy expenditure. However, airspeeds were possibly over-predicted by current aerodynamic models. This study {{emphasizes the importance of}} accounting for orientation strategy when assessing airspeed adjustments <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> and indicates that either the cost or adaptive ‘currency’ of extended flight among gulls may require revision...|$|R
