5|$|At {{the same}} time as his work on the Scott Building, Alexander was asked to take up the {{challenge}} of completing the Smithsonian Institution Building, the progress of which had bogged down under architect James Renwick, Jr. In August 1853, Alexander accepted, and by 1855, the Smithsonian Building was complete. During construction, Alexander slightly altered Renwick's original design by placing the Smithsonian's main lecture hall on the second floor. The change allowed for superior acoustics and a wider space than could be found on the first floor. To support the large lecture hall and the central core of the building, Alexander arranged for the installation of <b>fireproof</b> masonry-encased iron structural columns. These would prove their value on January 24, 1865, when a fire broke out on the roof above the lecture hall. The resulting blaze destroyed the hall and damaged {{much of the rest of}} the structure. Thanks to the <b>fireproof</b> columns, however, the Smithsonian building did not collapse.|$|E

The new technology uses a foamy solution sprayed directly onto asbestos-containing <b>fireproofing.</b> After absorbing into the <b>fireproofing,</b> the foam chemically digests asbestos fibers and dissolves them into harmless minerals. The process is the first to chemically destroy asbestos without first removing the <b>fireproofing...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{buildings}} are considered <b>fireproof</b> by the New York City Fire Department because partitions between individual units {{are designed to}} stop the spread of flames, also known as compartmentalization. This is evidenced by a 2004 fire caused by a cigarette, where no one was seriously injured because the fire was self-contained.|$|E
50|$|According to the FEMA fire {{incident}} {{report on the}} subject, unusually good application of <b>fireproofing</b> on support members was a significant mitigating factor.

50|$|Spray <b>fireproofing</b> {{products}} {{have not been}} qualified {{to the thousands of}} firestop configurations, so they cannot be installed in conformance of a certification listing. Therefore, firestopping must precede <b>fireproofing.</b> Both need one another. If the structural steel is left without <b>fireproofing,</b> it can damage fire barriers and a building can collapse. If the barriers are not firestopped properly, fire and smoke can spread from one compartment to another.|$|R
5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives and <b>fireproof</b> casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese of the Tang period {{employed}} complex chemical formulas for {{an array}} of different purposes, often found through experiments of alchemy. These included a waterproof and dust-repelling cream or varnish for clothes and weapons, <b>fireproof</b> cement for glass and porcelain wares, a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes of underwater divers, a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas. The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as porcelain was invented in China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it.|$|E

5|$|Abraham Henthorn Stott, {{the son of}} a stonemason, {{was born}} in nearby Shaw and Crompton in 1822. He served a seven-year {{apprenticeship}} with Sir Charles Barry, before starting a structural engineering practice in Oldham in 1847 that {{went on to become the}} pre-eminent mill architect firm in Lancashire. Philip Sydney Stott, third son of Abraham and later titled as Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet, was the most prominent and famous of the Stott mill architects. He established his own practice in 1883 and designed over a hundred mills in several countries. His factories, which improved upon his father's <b>fireproof</b> mills, accounted for a 40% increase in Oldham's spindles between 1887 and 1914.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{becoming}} a naturalized American citizen in 1916, Raymond became the honorary consul for the Czechoslovak Republic, representing {{the government of}} T. G. Masaryk. This gave him influence outside those circles normally associated with an architect of his age. From 1928 to 1930, Raymond designed and remodelled the American, Soviet and French embassies. He also undertook work for the Rising Sun Petroleum Company, designing 17 earthquake-proof and <b>fireproof</b> employee houses, the general office building, the manager's residence and two prototype service stations, one in steel {{and the other in}} concrete. All were constructed in an International Modern Style.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Clifford's Tower and the Waud {{house were}} {{purchased}} by the county of Yorkshire {{at the cost of}} £8,800 (£665,000 at 2009 prices). The new prison buildings, designed by architects P. F. Robinson and G. T. Andrews, were constructed in a Tudor Gothic style, including a gatehouse 35 feet (11 metres) high and a radial prison block, protected by a long, high stone wall. The prison, considered to be the strongest such building in England, was built entirely of stone to be both secure and <b>fireproof.</b> Dark grey gritstone was used in the construction to produce a forbidding appearance, although the prison itself was considered healthy and well ventilated.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{assessment}} of <b>fireproofing</b> materials performance is addressed. A methodology based on a combined experimental and numerical approach is presented and applied for characterizing the <b>fireproofing</b> behavior of a novel inorganic formulation based on basalt fibers and silica aerogel. A {{modified version of the}} ASTM E 162 standard fire test was used to expose specimens of <b>fireproofed</b> steel board to a steady radiation source. Experimental results were used to validate a simplified mono-dimensional model which allowed simulating more severe conditions and different protection configurations. A specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI) was evaluated in order to support the effective design of passive fire protections and to compare the performance of manufactured products against that of commercial <b>fireproofing</b> materials...|$|R

5|$|In the 1898, A Murray {{became part}} of the Fine Cotton Spinners' and Doublers' Association Limited (FCSDA). The mill complex began to decline in the early 20th century as the canal basin was filled in and Little Mill burnt down. The mill was {{replaced}} with the earliest mill in Greater Manchester that was built to use mains electricity. The mill complex continued producing cotton until the 1950s. The mills were later leased out to other companies and in some cases allowed to fall into disrepair. Between 2000 and 2003, Urban Splash redeveloped <b>Fireproof</b> and Doubling Mill into offices, winning a RIBA Award. The rest of the complex underwent a £17M regeneration between 2004 and 2006 and are proposed to be used as flats and a hotel.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the electrical {{supply to the}} line and stations would be provided by a dedicated generating station at St George's Road, Southwark. This idea was abandoned in 1902 and electricity was instead provided by Lots Road Power Station, operated by the UERL. Six ventilation fans were installed along the line to draw 18,500 cubic feet per minute through the tunnels and out through exhausts placed {{on the roof of}} the stations. Fresh air was drawn back down from the surface via the lift and staircase shafts, thus replenishing the air in the tunnels. To reduce the risk of fire, the station platforms were built of concrete and iron and the sleepers were made from the <b>fireproof</b> Australian wood Eucalyptus marginata or jarrah.|$|E
5|$|The first mill on the site, Old Mill, {{was begun}} in 1797, {{and is the}} world's oldest {{surviving}} urban steam-powered cotton spinning factory. After Old Mill opened, the company continued to expand and prosper, and by 1806 the complex was {{the largest in the}} world, employing about 1,000 people at its peak: Decker Mill was opened in 1802, New Mill in 1804, Little Mill in 1822, and Doubling and <b>Fireproof</b> Mill in 1842. The main complex formed a quadrangle surrounding a private canal basin linked under the road to the Rochdale Canal, which opened in 1804. The canal basin was used to deliver raw cotton and coal and to transport spun cotton away from the complex.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own <b>fireproof</b> machine room. The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced air ventilation system was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|In December 1852, {{the mill}} complex was valued at £75,000; when George Murray died in 1855, {{two of his}} three sons – James and Benjamin – {{inherited}} the complex. By 1881, A & G Murray had become registered as a limited liability company and the running of it was mostly {{in the hands of}} manager Herbert Dixon, who had joined the company in 1876, as the Murray family played less of a role. Under Dixon the company modernised and used new technology and was the reason for the firm's continued success. The use of new, more efficient technologies resulted in the further reduction of the workforce so that by 1897, A & G Murray only employed 500 people. In 1887, <b>Fireproof</b> Mill and Doubling Mill were leased by A & G Murray Ltd to C E Bennet.|$|E
5|$|Strickland did {{not take}} into account the swampy lowland and high water table that characterizes the terrain around New Orleans, and so during its career the New Orleans Mint {{building}} has encountered numerous structural problems from the shifting soil beneath its foundation. In the 1840s the building was reinforced with iron rods inserted between the floors. In 1854, the federal government hired West Point engineering graduate (and Louisiana native) Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard to <b>fireproof</b> the building, rebuild the arches supporting the basement ceiling and install masonry flooring. Beauregard completed the work in conjunction with Captain Johnson K. Duncan by 1859. During this period, the Mint's heavy machinery was converted to steam power so a smokestack (since demolished) was built at the rear of the structure to carry away the fumes.|$|E

50|$|Spray <b>fireproofing</b> of {{structural}} steel is most efficiently accomplished before interior partitions are built, otherwise {{a conflict with}} fire stops in firewalls could result. Firestops must adhere to the bare, dry, unobstructed surfaces of the fire barrier which is penetrated (e.g., metal decking), or adjacent to an interface of two fire barriers at which fire stopping is required (e.g., beams). Spray <b>fireproofing</b> cannot be applied prior to fire stopping at these surfaces, as the <b>fireproofing</b> would obstruct adherence of the fire stop materials to the fire barrier surfaces. Spraying the upper room perimeter with <b>fireproofing</b> may also result in covering of wall/ceiling joints and through penetrations that require fire stopping. These joints are then not visually observed and not provided with proper fire stopping, violating the fire integrity of the passive fire barrier.|$|R
