25|$|During the caution, Mark Martin <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pits {{to change}} all four tires, because he was afraid he ran over debris from the incident, as well as flat-spotting the tires when he locked up the brakes and slid {{sideways}} to avoid it.|$|E
25|$|A {{short time}} later, shoe store manager Johnny Brewer {{observed}} Oswald acting suspiciously as police cars passed nearby with sirens blaring. Oswald then <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Texas Theatre without purchasing a ticket. The police were notified by the theater's cashier and responded by surrounding the theater. Oswald was arrested {{after a brief}} struggle.|$|E
500|$|Mike Chang's {{first major}} storyline {{was the most}} widely praised of the episode. West said Shum [...] "really showed his acting chops", and Urban thought the [...] "plot worked well", though she heaped scorn {{on the notion that}} [...] "any college would {{consider}} glee club a detriment" [...] in an application. Mike's [...] "Cool" [...] performance was very well received. Berk called it a [...] "spectacular audition" [...] and Bell said it was [...] "one of the highlights of the episode"; she also noted that the episode [...] "really solidified" [...] Mike and Tina's relationship, though she also pointed out that Tina was [...] "the most neglected member of the entire cast". Mike's scenes in the dance studio were even more highly praised than [...] "Cool". The first, when Mike [...] "dances alone and imagines Tina and his dad in the room with him" [...] was described as [...] "really beautiful" [...] by Benigno. Fallon characterized it as [...] "a standout scene": [...] "the performer dances out his life frustrations, pirouetting-as-catharsis until he realizes that the only place he feels happy is on stage. It's a trademark Glee moment." [...] Hyman agreed, and wrote, [...] "When he <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio and started dancing by himself, without music, it reminded me of how special a show Glee can be". Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter lauded the subsequent scene in the studio with his mother as the [...] "most touching part" [...] of the storyline, and more than one reviewer admitted shedding tears, including Reiter.|$|E

50|$|Along its way, State Route 143 {{passes through}} the western half of Meigs County and <b>ducks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> extreme southwestern portion of Athens County. There is no portion of this state highway that is {{included}} within the National Highway System, a network of routes deemed most important for the country's economy, mobility and defense.|$|R
2500|$|Promoted by Samuel Duncan Parnell {{as early}} as 1840, when {{carpenter}} Samuel Parnell refused to work more than {{eight hours a day}} when erecting a store for merchant George Hunter. He successfully negotiated this working condition and campaigned for its extension in the infant Wellington community. A meeting of Wellington carpenters in October 1840 pledged [...] "to maintain the eight-hour working day, and that anyone offending should be <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> harbour". New Zealand is reputed to be the first country in the world to have adopted the eight-hour working day.|$|E
2500|$|Stirling, {{hearing the}} shots reacted quickly. [...] Roe was sent with four others {{to prevent the}} group {{escaping}} south and guard the pack horses at the ford. [...] The governor and 14 others in a line abreast then ambushed the surprised Aborigines who had crossed the river. [...] Ellis had been dislodged from his horse but Norcott continued pushing the group into the river where they were caught in a withering crossfire. [...] The flood-scoured slopes gave the men, women and children little cover {{as they tried to}} hide behind what logs or bushes there were. [...] Many <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water, holding their breath as long as they could. [...] Some tried to float downstream out of range, but the water was too shallow to permit their escape. [...] They, too, were shot. Roe's journal records [...] "Very few wounded were suffered to escape". [...] Soldiers fired indiscriminately at those caught in the ambush and, when all had been slain, the posse remounted to chase the others who had fled north into the bush. [...] By 10:05 am it was all over and, because of the serious condition of two of the European wounded, Stirling decided to return immediately to Mandurah.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the season}} three episode [...] "Asian F", Mike Chang has {{his first major}} storyline which became the most widely praised storyline of the episode. Abby West of Entertainment Weekly said Shum [...] "really showed his acting chops", and Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News thought the [...] "plot worked well", though she heaped scorn {{on the notion that}} [...] "any college would {{consider}} glee club a detriment" [...] in an application.

50|$|By day nine-year-old Akira Ijuyin is {{a normal}} student at Clamp School, but at night he becomes the mysterious thief 20 Masks. His thefts are usually subject {{to the whims of}} his two mothers, which Akira pulls off without any true {{objections}} or interactions. One night Akira <b>ducks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room of five-year-old Utako Ōkawa in an attempt to hide from the police.|$|R
50|$|On 31 August 2008, the Great British Duck Race {{was held}} near Hampton Court Palace in London. The race broke {{the world record}} {{for the number of}} ducks used together, with a total of 250,000. The ducks used in the race were a bright blue color, after {{stewards}} in the previous year faced problems from spectators throwing their own <b>ducks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water.|$|R
50|$|Tony Mareda, Jr., {{a former}} Olympic athlete and world-renowned private detective, is driving {{across the country}} when he is {{attacked}} by mobsters. Chased to the sleepy backwater town of Beamsville, Tony <b>ducks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> local drive-in theater, where he is followed by his pursuers. As Tony takes out the hit men amidst the parked cars, a pink meteor roars overhead and crashes in the nearby woods.|$|R
60|$|Minnie Rauskukle, plump, hearty Minnie, heiress to {{the general}} store, gave {{evidence}} by bridling and straightening her pigeon-like body that {{she was aware of}} Milt behind her. He did not speak to her. He <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> door of the Old Home Poolroom and Restaurant.|$|E
60|$|The Tonbridgian's {{rigidity}} {{had given}} place to spasmodic efforts to rise. He got on one knee, and his gloved hand roamed feebly about {{in search of}} a hold. It was plain that he had shot his bolt. The referee signed to his seconds, who <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ring and carried him to his corner. Sheen walked back to his own corner, and sat down. Presently the referee called out his name as the winner, and he went across the ring and shook hands with his opponent, who was now himself again.|$|E
60|$|Ponta lashed out, {{right and}} left, savagely as ever, and though Joe blocked the blows, {{such was the}} force of them that he was knocked {{backward}} several steps. Ponta was after him with the spring of a tiger. In the involuntary effort to maintain equilibrium, Joe had uncovered himself, flinging one arm out and lifting his head from beneath the sheltering shoulders. So swiftly had Ponta followed him, that a terrible swinging blow was coming at his unguarded jaw. He ducked forward and down, Ponta's fist just missing {{the back of his}} head. As he came back to the perpendicular, Ponta's left fist drove at him in a straight punch that would have knocked him backward through the ropes. Again, and with a swiftness an inappreciable fraction of time quicker than Ponta's, he ducked forward. Ponta's fist grazed the backward slope of the shoulder, and glanced off into the air. Ponta's right drove straight out, and the graze was repeated as Joe <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> safety of a clinch.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's our supper," [...] cried Frank, {{tossing a}} large <b>duck</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> canoe; [...] "and there's a bite for the men," [...] he added, sending a huge gray goose <b>into</b> <b>the</b> midst of them. [...] "I saw {{a herd of}} {{reindeer}} {{on the other side}} of the point; but the ice closed up the passage, and prevented me from getting within range. It will stop our further progress for to-night too; so I waited to advise you to camp here." ...|$|R
50|$|The River Swale {{has been}} known to be subject to {{flooding}} and is monitored closely by the Environment Agency. Although Great Langton is located in a primary area for fishing, no local residents are in the trade. The River Swale also attracts large numbers of <b>duck</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> village, commonly seen around winter. The ducks tend to arrive around mid-September having travelled around 2000 mi from central CIS. They return around April, the journey taking several weeks.|$|R
5000|$|Stevens did {{not have}} any formal {{training}} in photography and served for a time as the road manager for The Lovin' Spoonful. He realized he [...] "had an eye" [...] for photography. Some of Stevens' photos have been considered iconic. One is of Paul McCartney <b>ducking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> arms of his wife Linda during the couple's arrest for marijuana possession on Aug. 10, 1972 after a Wings concert in Gothenburg, Sweden. Stevens was Wings' official tour photographer.|$|R
5000|$|Describing the {{circumstances}} surrounding the photo, Brooks said, [...] "I took the picture quickly, hid the camera under my coat and <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> crowd. A lot of people would have liked to wreck that picture." ...|$|E
50|$|At lap 130, Foyt, Rutherford, and Bobby Unser {{were running}} 1st-2nd-3rd. Al Unser dropped out on lap 131 {{with a broken}} valve, {{bringing}} out the caution for a tow-in. Foyt <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pits, and Rutherford was now the leader again.|$|E
50|$|During the caution, Mark Martin <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pits {{to change}} all four tires, because he was afraid he ran over debris from the incident, as well as flat-spotting the tires when he locked up the brakes and slid {{sideways}} to avoid it.|$|E
50|$|Thousands upon {{thousands}} of mallard, pintail, green-winged teal, and ring-necked <b>ducks</b> flock <b>into</b> <b>the</b> managed wetlands; while the wood duck lives throughout the tree-lined slough channels.|$|R
50|$|At the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, both teams' star quarterbacks are preoccupied. Dave Walecki (Ken Howard) {{is having}} marital difficulties, while Jim McCauley (Tom Selleck) is {{involved}} in a shady deal with a management firm. Meanwhile, a national gambling syndicate attempts {{to find a way to}} stop the heavily favored Cougars from winning the game. All these plots are connected by a police chase of a killer who has attempted to evade law enforcement by <b>ducking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> crowd.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Oregon won {{a school}} record 13 games and saw junior quarterback Marcus Mariota win the school's first Heisman Trophy. That same year, the Ducks made the first ever College Football Playoff and beat the {{defending}} champion Florida State Seminoles 59-20 in the 2015 Rose Bowl semi-final. The loss to Oregon ended the Seminoles 29 game win streak and moved <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> final. They made the first ever CFP National Championship Game where they lost 42-20 to Ohio State.|$|R
50|$|On {{the next}} green flag pit stop around lap 90, Rutherford {{was on the}} {{receiving}} end of good luck. He <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pits under green, but seconds later the caution came out for a spin by Jan Opperman, which allowed Rutherford to pit with little time lost.|$|E
50|$|Senna {{immediately}} began to draw away, while Mansell slipped back through the field. On lap 14, with a 6.5 second lead, Senna suddenly <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pits with a slowly deflating right rear tire. Despite a quick change, he re-entered in eighth place, twenty seconds behind the new leader, René Arnoux.|$|E
50|$|Arie Luyendyk began {{charging}} {{through the}} field, and by lap 10, was already amongst the top ten. Two spins slowed the early running. Paul Durant blew an engine down the backstretch on lap 11, <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> warm-up lane, but spun {{in his own}} fluid. On the restart, Danny Ongais lost control, and spun harmlessly through turn four.|$|E
5000|$|He did so {{much better}} than they did that they became envious and told the coachman that he had said he could get for the king seven silver ducks that belonged to a troll, and which the king had long desired. The coachman told the king. When the king insisted that he do it, he demanded wheat and rye, rowed over the lake, in the {{kneading}} trough, to the troll's place, and lured <b>the</b> <b>ducks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trough using the grain.|$|R
50|$|Leela and the others, {{running from}} <b>the</b> robot horde, <b>duck</b> <b>into</b> a movie theater, where Fry is seeing {{a movie with}} his Lucy Liu robot. Everyone <b>ducks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{projection}} room. Zoidberg discovers a five-ton bag of popping corn, and sends it pouring onto the robots on the theater floor. The robots eat their way {{out from under the}} corn and start shooting popcorn kernels from their mouths at the room. Fry's Lucy Liu-bot points the projector at the other robots, and the heat causes the popcorn to pop, bursting the robots. At the request of the real Lucy Liu, Fry blanks his now-damaged robot. A hypocritical Bender begins dating Lucy Liu's head much to Fry's anger.|$|R
50|$|Every year, the Auburn Historical Association hosts {{an annual}} Duck Race near Massabesic Lake. It {{starts at the}} Griffin Mill Bridge over the Little Massabesic Brook-Sucker Brook where a truck dumps {{thousands}} of rubber <b>ducks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> brook, and the race ends at a finish line {{on the other side}} of the waterfall.

There are also games for younger kids, and visitors are able to access the Griffin Free Public Library.|$|R
50|$|As {{the race}} {{prepared}} {{to go back to}} green on lap 164, a handful of drivers <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit area to top off their fuel, in hopes of going the distance without another pit stop. Dario Franchitti and J. R. Hildebrand were among those who gave up their track position, and topped off their fuel.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} 20 laps, Johnny Rutherford held a {{comfortable}} lead over Tom Sneva, and was pulling away at will. Third place was now being dueled out between Gary Bettenhausen and Gordon Johncock. In the final stages, Rick Mears <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pits for an unscheduled stop {{to change a}} punctured tire, which dropped him from contention.|$|E
50|$|On lap 183, Danny Sullivan blew {{an engine}} down the frontstretch, spewing a huge cloud of smoke. Leader Michael Andretti took {{advantage}} of the break, and <b>ducked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pits for needed fuel. Andretti's stop was quick, and he came back out onto the track in second. He lined up just behind leader Rick Mears for the restart.|$|E
50|$|The Dakota {{killed the}} three {{children}} and an adult left in the Broberg cabin, {{and went on to}} loot the Lundborg cabin. The elder Lundborg had evacuated his remaining family and hidden with Anna Stina Broberg in a slough. They were shot at but no one was hit. Surrounded by open ground, Peter Broberg and the Oman family were trapped in their cabin. Late that afternoon three Dakota approached the Oman home. The six settlers inside managed to <b>duck</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cellar through a trapdoor, and listened as the place was shot up and looted.|$|R
50|$|Between Columbia and Centerville, the Duck {{cuts through}} the Western Highland Rim and is joined by several major tributaries, notably the Piney River. Downtown Centerville is located high above the Duck River bottoms. Below Centerville, the Duck again enters a fairly rural, {{somewhat}} remote area. Its largest single tributary, the Buffalo River, reaches its confluence with the Duck in southern Humphreys County, {{just a few miles}} from the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>Duck</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Tennessee River. The area of the mouth of the Duck is part of the Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge. The total length of the Duck River is over 240 mi.|$|R
25|$|After killing Tippit, Oswald {{was seen}} {{traveling}} on foot toward the Texas Theater on West Jefferson Blvd. About 1:35p.m. Johnny Calvin Brewer, {{who worked as}} a manager at Hardy's Shoe Store in the same block as the Texas Theater on Jefferson Blvd. saw Oswald turning his face away from <b>the</b> street and <b>duck</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> entranceway of the shoe store as Dallas squad cars drove up the street with sirens on. When Oswald left the store, Brewer followed Oswald and watched him go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Texas Theater movie house without paying while ticket attendant Julie Postal was distracted. Brewer notified Postal, who in turn informed the Dallas Police at 1:40p.m.|$|R
