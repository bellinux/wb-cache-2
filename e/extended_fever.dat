Case in point: the show’s fifteen-minute “Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love” number, {{better known as the}} “Montage” since it actually consists of musical numbers within numbers, monologues, lyrical fragments and all-out dance sequences." [...] The LA Times describes the number as [...] "dazzling". Hi-Def Digest wrote [...] "arguably the show's most exuberant song, 'Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love,' is a clever, catchy celebration of adolescent agony". Florida Theatre On Stage wrote [...] "Another memorable stretch was the <b>extended</b> <b>fever</b> dream of internal monologues about adolescence “Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love.” Besides the perfect staging and performances, it highlighted the fluid lighting design by Paul Black (including considerable backlighting) and split-second calls of stage managers Brandy Demil and Michael J. Iannelli." [...] The New York Times wrote [...] "Driven by the rush of Mr. Bennett’s dynamic choreography, the mesh of story and songs is wonderfully seamless, especially in extended montages like the frenetic opening, “I Hope I Get It,” and “Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love,” a complex salute to the million and one pains of growing up." [...] RecordOnline wrote [...] "Most impressive might have been the wondrous [...] "Montage Part 1: Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love." [...] The ensemble packed great energy into this number, which sheds the innocence from the stage and turns the dancers into professionals." ...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{strains of}} spotted fever group rickettsiae were studied to {{gain insight into}} the extent of {{variation}} of their properties. Two standard strains of Rickettsia rickettsii and one strain of Rickettsia conorii were included among the eight for comparison. The molar percentage of guanine plus cytosine for each strain {{did not differ significantly}} from that for R. rickettsii, 32. 6 +/- 0. 7 %. Two strains caused <b>extended</b> <b>fever</b> in guinea pigs, one strain caused fever of short duration, and the other strains induced little or no fever. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the detergent-solubilized rickettsial proteins indicated that the protein content of all strains, except the two strains of R. rickettsii, were different, particularly in the molecular weight range of 40, 000 to 60, 000. Virulent strains produced large clear plaques in Vero cells monolayers; the strains of low virulence generally produced smaller or more turbid, or both, plaques. On the basis of agglutination reactions with rabbit antisera, the eight strains were placed into five serotypes. These results indicate considerable heterogeneity in properties of spotted fever group rickettsiae in the United States...|$|E
50|$|Cabin fever is an idiomatic {{term for}} a claustrophobic {{reaction}} that takes place when a person or group ends up in an isolated or solitary location, or stuck indoors in confined quarters for an <b>extended</b> period. Cabin <b>fever</b> describes the extreme irritability and restlessness a person may feel in these situations. Cabin fever is also associated with boredom.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{prospective}} {{observational study}} was conducted to examine whether asymptomatic VZV reactivation occurs in immunocompetent children hospitalized in an ICU and its impact on clinical outcome. A secondary aim was to test the hypothesis that vaccinated children have a lower risk of reactivation than naturally infected children. Forty immunocompetent paediatric ICU patients and healthy controls were enrolled. Patients were prospectively followed for 28 days. Clinical data were collected and varicella exposure was recorded. Admission serum levels of TNF-a, cortisol and VZV-IgG were measured. Blood and saliva samples were collected for VZV-DNA detection via real-time PCR. As a comparison, the detection of HSV-DNA was also examined. Healthy children matched for age and varicella exposure type (infection or vaccination) were also included. VZV reactivation was observed in 17 % (7 / 39) of children. Children with VZV reactivation had <b>extended</b> duration of <b>fever</b> (OR = 1. 17; 95 % CI, 1. 02 – 1. 34). None of the varicella-vaccinated children or healthy controls had detectable VZV-DNA in any blood or saliva samples examined. HSV-DNA was detected in saliva from 33 % of ICU children and 2. 6 % of healthy controls. Among children with viral reactivation, typing revealed wild-type VZV and HSV- 1. In conclusion, VZV reactivation occurs in immunocompetent children under severe stress and is associated with prolonged duration of fever...|$|R

The incidence of dengue has multiplied many times over the last five decades at an alarming rate. In the endemic areas, waves of infection occur in epidemics, with thousands of individuals affected, creating a huge burden on the limited resources of a country&# 39;s health care system. While the illness passes off as a simple febrile episode in many, a few have a severe illness marked by hypovolemic shock and bleeding. Iatrogenic fluid overload in the management may further complicate the picture. In this severe form dengue can be fatal. Tackling the burden of dengue is impeded by several issues, including a lack of understanding about the exact pathophysiology of the infection, inability to successfully control the vector population, lack of specific therapy against the virus, and the technical difficulties in developing a vaccine. This review provides an overview on the epidemiology, natural history, management strategies, and future directions for research on dengue, including the potential for development of a vaccine.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} in the Nakuru District of the Kenyan Highlands, the major milk sources for the Nairobi milk market, were to evaluate current dairy cattle rearing and feeding practices, and suggest efficient feeding management strategies on large and small-scale commercial dairy farms. 139 small-scale farms with 738 dairy cows were surveyed and 6 large-scale dairy farms with 4379 dairy cattle. On the small farms, high mortality rates, cost of AI, and disease were the major causes of poor reproduction leading {{to a lack of}} replacement stock. Feeding systems used were: 24 % free grazing system, 33 % semi-zero grazing, 40 % zero grazing, and 3 % rotational grazing, but limited feeds were available – crops and feed crop residues, cut grass on the roadside, neighbouring farms with some purchased hay and straws in the dry season. After weaning, feed supplements were rarely given to calves, priority being given to milking cows, explaining the few replacement stock kept and their high mortality. The six large scale farms were from 200 to 3500 acres with milk production, cereal crops, fodder crops, the scale of replacement dairy stock and hay to other dairy farms the main activities with land allocated 65 % to livestock, 20 % to cash crops (Barley and Wheat), 10 % to fodder crops and 5 % to other land-uses. Replacement heifers for sale were insufficient to meet demands from small-scale farms. Grazing systems were mainly extensive with supplements fed at milking.   All the farms depended on planted forage grasses, mainly: Rhodes grass, Star grass, Sudan grass and Kikuyu grass. Calf mortality rate (10 - 18 %) was high caused mostly by respiratory diseases and East Coast <b>Fever.</b> <b>Extended</b> age at first calving (> 31. 8 ± 4. 5 months), long calving intervals (> 406 days) and low average milk yields (6. 81 /day ± 3. 9) for all breeds, occurred. Production and reproductive performances needs to be addressed by proper nutrition. Suitable pasture grasses, legumes and fodder crops not currently being used have been identified as potential options to complement the existing pasture. Among these are: Guinea grass (panicum maximum), Cynodon dactylon, Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), Naivasha star grass (Cynodon plectostachyus) and Rhodesian star grass (Setaria sphacelata). Other studies examining supplementation of animals on low quality pastures with the above feeds resulted in increased body weights and milk yields. The greatest potential seems to be supplementing with home-grown proteinaceous feedstuffs such as Leucaena leucocephala, Calliandra, Sesbania or food crop residues like groundnut, cassava, sweet potato vines or pigeon-pea leaves and stems. Farmers could increase their pasture land productivity by establishing fodder grass, fodder shrubs and food crops as intercropping, hedgerows and along contour bands.
