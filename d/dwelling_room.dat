60|$|At {{the most}} wretched hour between a black {{night and a}} wintry morning in the year 1777, Mrs. Dudgeon, of New Hampshire, is sitting up {{in the kitchen and}} general <b>dwelling</b> <b>room</b> of her farm house on the {{outskirts}} of the town of Websterbridge. She is not a prepossessing woman. No woman looks her best after sitting up all night; and Mrs. Dudgeon's face, even at its best, is grimly trenched by the channels into which the barren forms and observances of a dead Puritanism can pen a bitter temper and a fierce pride. She is an elderly matron who has worked hard and got nothing by it except dominion and detestation in her sordid home, and an unquestioned reputation for piety and respectability among her neighbors, to whom drink and debauchery are still so much more tempting than religion and rectitude, that they conceive goodness simply as self-denial. This conception is easily extended to others--denial, and finally generalized as covering anything disagreeable. So Mrs. Dudgeon, being exceedingly disagreeable, is held to be exceedingly good. Short of flat felony, she enjoys complete license except for amiable weaknesses of any sort, and is consequently, without knowing it, the most licentious woman in the parish on the strength of never having broken the seventh commandment or missed a Sunday at the Presbyterian church.|$|E

60|$|Minister Anderson's {{house is}} in {{the main street of}} Websterbridge, not far from the town hall. To the eye of the eighteenth century New Englander, it is much grander than the plain {{farmhouse}} of the Dudgeons; but it is so plain itself that a modern house agent would let both at about the same rent. The chief <b>dwelling</b> <b>room</b> has the same sort of kitchen fireplace, with boiler, toaster hanging on the bars, movable iron griddle socketed to the hob, hook above for roasting, and broad fender, on which stand a kettle and a plate of buttered toast. The door, between the fireplace and the corner, has neither panels, fingerplates nor handles: it is made of plain boards, and fastens with a latch. The table is a kitchen table, with a treacle colored cover of American cloth, chapped at the corners by draping. The tea service on it consists of two thick cups and saucers of the plainest ware, with milk jug and bowl to match, each large enough to contain nearly a quart, on a black japanned tray, and, {{in the middle of the}} table, a wooden trencher with a big loaf upon it, and a square half pound block of butter in a crock. The big oak press facing the fire from the opposite side of the room, is for use and storage, not for ornament; and the minister's house coat hangs on a peg from its door, showing that he is out; for when he is in it is his best coat that hangs there. His big riding boots stand beside the press, evidently in their usual place, and rather proud of themselves. In fact, the evolution of the minister's kitchen, dining room and drawing room into three separate apartments has not yet taken place; and so, from the point of view of our pampered period, he is no better off than the Dudgeons.|$|E

50|$|In the ﬁeld of schooling, too, it {{was also}} the central village of Altenkirchen that was at ﬁrst {{dominant}} in the Kohlbach valley; it got its own school in 1716, which schoolchildren from Frohnhofen could also attend. Attempts as early as the 18th century by Frohnhofen to set its own school up did not meet with success. According to details in the Altenkirchen parish register, one of the applicants for a teaching post was supposedly an übergeschnappter Student (the ﬁrst word means “crazy”, “loopy”) from Fürth who wore a long, pleated frock coat. By 1802, a teacher named Friedrich Rindt Fuß had been secured, and he stayed for quite a long time, repeatedly being granted a new appointment. School records from 1823 say that the said Mr. Rindt had been named “provisory schoolteacher” for Frohnhofen. This teacher lived and was fed at ﬁrst in turns at his pupils’ houses, and was also paid one Gulden for each pupil each year, and thus with roughly 50 pupils, he got about 50 Gulden each year. From the year 1835 comes a compilation of his later emoluments: 30 Gulden from the municipal coffers, three cords of wood from the municipal forest and 36 Simmer (or ﬁve sevenths of a hectolitre) of grain. Also among the teacher’s beneﬁts were the free use of his service dwelling (built onto the herdsman’s house) worth 8 Gulden, the use of a garden at a scheduled rental price of 7 Gulden and 14 Kreuzer and the use of 1.2 ha of cropland as well as a 0.6 ha meadow, each worth 20 Gulden. Next to the very simple <b>dwelling,</b> <b>room</b> for teaching was brought into being in 1823 at the herdsman’s house. In 1841, a schoolhouse was built on the street now known as Binderstraße with a teacher’s dwelling in accordance with what was laid out at the time by the Kingdom of Bavaria; a belltower was also built on top. It had only one room for sometimes as many as 80 schoolchildren. An “extraordinary visitation” in 1910 complained that there were no spittoon, no wastepaper basket and no handkerchief available, and that the benches were old and therefore unsuitable. In 1912, the livingroom at the front was attacked by dry rot. The walls were painted over with hydrochloric acid (HCl) after the plaster had been stripped off. The ﬂoor was torn out and built all over again, with the ﬂoorboards having been soaked beforehand in creosote. Only in 1936 did the municipality get a schoolhouse with better premises, on today’s Schulstraße (“School Street”). This building, too, had a small belltower built on top. In the course of the 1970 school reform in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the Frohnhofen school was closed. The primary school pupils now attend school in Altenkirchen, while the Hauptschule students go to the Schönenberg-Kübelberg school centre.|$|E

Samara University is established in samara town, Afar region and has an average daily radiation of 6. 10 kwh/m 2, sun shine duration of about 10 hours. This condition invites the use of photovoltaic system as an alternative primary energy source to replace the existing diesel generator supply system.

40|$|The {{problem of}} wooden towers {{belongs to the}} more {{combined}} questions than it seems, particulary when it's considered against a broad comparative background. In the late 12 th century began to appear little "conoidal" strongholds, which are regarded as the prototypes of the castles with the dwelling towers by some scholars or as some reduction of the larger constructions by the others. The towers performed the dwelling and defensive function. Their distant patterns can be recovered in the West-European constructions dated back as early as {{to the end of}} the 10 th century. Recent excavations (Siedląeków) threw a little more light upon the questions of the so called knights' strongholds both in formal and functional aspects, and the new studies supported the supposition that defensive and dwelling towers were located also within the ramparts along side the ground-floor dwelling and husbandry constructions (Kaszowo, Raciąż, Chmielno). Thus the functional character of the towers extends and they can be regarded as the last defence objects which usually played a role of the watching posts. The material concerning the towers is to be divided into two groups: 1. towers survived until nowadays or readable while excavating, 2, information about the towers derived from the wrlsten and iconographic sources as well as from the toponomastic names. In the north-east region of the Baltic the towers occured in number, along the important water routes, especially along those leading from the Finnish Bay inside Russia. The towers from this region can be cinsidered as the examples of the earliest constructions of this kind. That type of construction is know also from Finland, Estonia and Sweden and dates back to the 11 th or 12 th century at least. The towers standing along the Swedish water routes controlled and blocked the fords. The former investigations provided the ascertainment that the towers were built in the laft constructions, in three or more floors with the <b>dwelling</b> <b>room.</b> In a case of necessity they were used as the pi. sons. The problem of the wooden or stone towers is still an open question and one may suggest that the further investigations will bring new determinations.

40|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} af the stronghold at Raciąż, {{province of}} Bydgoszcz, {{have been conducted}} for the past nine years. The Raciąż stronghold is situated on Przyarcz Lake {{and it is now}} connected with the mainland by the narrow strip of the ground. Up to now some signifficant portion of the stronghold inner maidan was excavated and four complete houses as well as fragment of another one were uncovered. The area of the maidan is ca 2000 square meters. The stronghold, constructions are dated to the period between 1256 (a firé recorded in Kronika Wielkopolska - Great Polish Chronicle) and 1300 (last fire which definitely brought the stronghold existence to an end) The Raciąż houses were exceptionally big, 16 - 22 meters long and 7 - 10 meters wide. Such dimensions suggest that the houses must have consisted of many rooms, at least of two. As far as few wooden fragments indicate they were built in the laft construction {{as well as in the}} wattle coated with a clay one. Floors were mainly of clay, seldom of wood. Nearly in all cases the cellars were revealed underueath the houses, on average 3 x 3 meters dimension and f-a 1, 60 to 1, 80 meters deep. The cellars were dug under the floors in the central parts of the houses. Only in house nr 2, consisted of the smithy and <b>dwelling</b> <b>room,</b> the cellar was situated under the latter room. House nr 1 was probably constructed upon the stone foundation. It was the smallest object and its dimensions were 7 x 9 meters. It is reasonably suspected that it could be the several-floor construction, perhaps the dwelling tower. For it stood opposite to the entrance gate, on the another side of the maidan it could be the last defending point of the stronghold. In the Western part of the maidan a house with outbuilding was uncovered. It was the smithy with the two-room dwelling house. In the Eastern part two houses were standing. One was furnished with the domelike stove and with firebed interpreted as the kitchen-bakery. The other one had a separated porch or hallway. In the latter house the numerous bones lying in anatomical arrangement were föund. It could be the tworoom (household and dwelling) house with separated dwelling part furnished with a hearth. Almost in all houses were found big quantities of burned corn| grains lying i in regular concentrations. Therefore one can conclude that these were the stocks of corn held in the bags or in the large wooden vessels. In some houses the readible traces of consumption survived in the form of bones lying regularly along the walls. They perhaps do not highly attest to the contemporary hygiene. The furniture of the houses, consisti'g mainly of the objects typical for the stronghold garrison, then the lack of any handicraft workshop, except the smithy, emphasize the military nature of the Raciąż stronghold.
