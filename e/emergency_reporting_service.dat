40|$|Web-based {{communication}} {{can provide}} better reporting on disasters, coordination of responses, dissemination of information, and social networking to deliver assistance. When individuals need help for medical emergencies or fires, most U. S. residents reach for their phones to dial 911. But when natural disasters, public health threats, or terrorist attacks occur that effect thousands of individuals or more, 911 operators cannot handle all the requests. Such disasters may require massive coordination {{of public and}} private agencies, plus cooperation from millions of citizens. Public use of Web-based social computing services, such as MySpace or Facebook, has spread to hundreds of millions of users. This suggests that local, state, and federal agencies could build community response grids (CRGs) where residents could report incidents in seconds, receive emergency information, and request resident-to-resident assistance. The current Internet and World Wide Web have proven effective for many purposes, but government agencies have been slow to adopt social computing for national security, disaster response, and emergency relief (1). CRGs should be more than an <b>emergency</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>service</b> as already proposed (2). They should also be more than the U. S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Information Network (3), which focuses, like some European (4) and Asian (5) initiatives, on networking for professionals. CRGs would not duplicate DHS’s CitizenCorps. gov, which is designed to build local volunteer groups for emergency response but doesn’t include online reporting or resident-toresident assistance. Community members (who would register in advance) could use Web-based computers, mobile devices, and cell phones to give and get text messages, photos, or videos. The site would support coordination as emerging software tools could enable agencies to integrate B. Shneiderman was the founding director of the Human...|$|E

30|$|Sharing images {{between the}} {{healthcare}} organisations creates new challenges regarding quality control, trust, workflow management, legal issues, reimbursement and interoperability of electronic patient records (EPR), radiology information systems (RIS) and PACS. The most important {{challenge is to}} ensure that reporting of images outside the organisation does not in any way reduce the quality of radiology services provided to the citizen [6]. The benefits of inter-organisational image sharing are: the availability of sub-specialist opinions and specialist case transfer in case {{there is a lack of}} particular local knowledge, provision of on-call <b>emergency</b> <b>reporting</b> and radiological <b>services</b> to remote rural communities, improvement of the reporting capacity of healthcare organisations, and balancing the workload across radiology departments [6, 8]. The technical issues in sending and receiving the images seem to be almost solved: well established digital imaging and communication standards and standard profiles like XDS-I allow image sharing between organisations [7].|$|R

5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived {{half a mile from}} the crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped in their seats and the survivors were crying out for help. Survivors later commented that it took about half an hour for rescue teams to arrive. Initial <b>reports</b> to <b>emergency</b> <b>services</b> <b>reported</b> that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed. Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 {{was in charge of the}} initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than seven hundred Nassau County police officers arrived to help. Other companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: We {{examined}} how adults using <b>emergency</b> food <b>services</b> <b>report</b> discrimination {{and how these}} reports {{may be associated with}} well-being. Methods: Data come from a survey (n= 318) and from five focus groups of adults using emergency food services, conducted between 2003 - 2004. The survey included measures derived from the Everyday Discrimination Scale and the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Focus groups were analyzed with content analysis. Results: The survey data suggest that everyday discrimination was associated with the CES-D, conditional on covariates. Focus group data are consistent with the survey results and suggest several avenues for future research, including how some individuals may forgo access to food and medications in order to protect their dignity in the face of discrimination. Conclusions: Qualitative and quantitative data converge into a similar theme - discrimination may be an important factor associated with well-being...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} present the Cognitive LF-Ant {{protocol}} for <b>emergency</b> <b>reporting</b> in healthcare wireless sensor networks.

The intra-cluster <b>emergency</b> <b>reporting</b> is inspired by the different capabilities of leg-manipulated ants. The inter-cluster reporting is aided by the cooperative modulation diversity with spectrum sensing, which can detect new <b>emergency</b> <b>reporting</b> requests and forward them. Simulations results show the decrease of average delay time as the probability of opportunistic access increases, which privileges the <b>emergency</b> <b>reporting</b> related to the patients with higher priority of resources’ usage. Furthermore, the packet loss rate is decreased by the use of cooperative modulation diversity with spectrum sensing...|$|R

40|$|Various {{kinds of}} media and metadata, such as pictures, videos, and geo-location, can be {{attached}} to <b>emergency</b> <b>reports</b> to the police using dedicated platforms, social networking sites, or general communication apps such as WhatsApp. Although potentially a very useful source of information for law enforcement agencies, this also raises considerable concerns regarding surveillance and privacy in public spaces: It exhorts citizens to establish a supervisory gaze over anyone, at any time, and anywhere. This chapter analyses these concerns using theories from surveillance studies. It considers the (surprisingly high) applicability of panoptical theories by Foucault and others {{to the effects of}} increased visibility of citizens in public spaces. This analysis importantly reveals how discriminatory tendencies might be introduced and exacerbated. Attention is then paid to Deleuze’s ‘societies of control’ and related notions such as database surveillance, surveillance assemblages, and predictive policing. This analysis shows that the enrichment of <b>emergency</b> <b>reports</b> with media and metadata from smartphones can pressurize people into conformity, erode the presumption of innocence, and diminish societal trust. Furthermore, this process will disproportionality affect already disadvantaged groups and individuals. Policy makers are advised to implement enriched <b>emergency</b> <b>reports</b> carefully...|$|R
