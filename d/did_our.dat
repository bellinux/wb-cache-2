500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, the Supremes {{recorded}} the single [...] "Where <b>Did</b> <b>Our</b> Love Go". The song was originally intended by Holland-Dozier-Holland for the Marvelettes, who rejected it. Although the Supremes disliked the song, the producers coerced them into recording it. In August 1964, while the Supremes toured as part of Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars, [...] "Where <b>Did</b> <b>Our</b> Love Go" [...] reached {{number one on the}} US pop charts, much to the surprise and delight of the group. It was also their first song to appear on the UK pop charts, where it reached number three.|$|E
500|$|Alistair Taylor (Epstein's assistant) later {{admitted}} that financial mistakes were made: [...] "We <b>did</b> <b>our</b> best; {{some people have}} said it wasn't good enough.

"Where <b>Did</b> <b>Our</b> Love Go" [...] was {{followed}} by four consecutive US number-one hits: [...] "Baby Love" [...] (which was also a number-one hit in the UK), [...] "Come See About Me", [...] "Stop!

This nucleus was increased to ₱7,140 by donations made by Pablo Rodríguez, Andrés Hermosa, and Juan Morales. After Benavides' death, in the same year, his confreres carried on - albeit with small funds - in order to realize his idea. As Fr.

500|$|Kavner {{was then}} {{cast as a}} sidekick to Tracey Ullman in The Tracey Ullman Show, which debuted on Fox in 1987. Kavner {{described}} the show as, [...] "like being back in school, {{a chance to play}} a wide variety of characters, some really vicious people, to not rest on laurels, to not play it safe". Kavner commented, [...] "What I do is not mimicry or an impersonation, but more of an assimilation. [...] {{we did a lot of}} looking at people to find out who to base our characters on. We <b>did</b> <b>our</b> homework on our lunch hour." [...] She received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Best Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Strange Bird, unlike its brief chart history, was overwhelmingly positive. The enthusiastic response even caught the band by surprise; Williams told Rip It Up [...] "I {{could see a}} few holes in the album and I'd say, 'how come {{no one else has}} picked this up?'" [...] Reviewers, however, focused on the positives; Guy Garvey of The Independent said [...] "My favourite of the year is Augie March's Strange Bird", while David Fricke wrote in Rolling Stone of [...] "luxuriant melees of chiming guitars, mountain-stream voices and keyboard grandeur". Donovan said the band found it hard to take the positive reviews too seriously; [...] "if we <b>did</b> <b>our</b> heads would explode or overinflate", he told Beat.|$|E

500|$|James Madigan, {{the visual}} effects supervisor, {{approached}} the series as a feature film, observing that [...] "every {{aspect of the}} production took meticulous care with every detail, the costumes, the set dressing, the acting, and the attention to historical fact. As you worked on it, you really got the feeling that Rome was {{going to look like}} something we had never seen on TV before, so our vfx approach very much wanted to respect that." [...] Madigan attempted to seamlessly mesh the visual effects with the physical sets and depend less on CGI. A friend told Madigan that after seeing the pilot, [...] "he didn’t see any vfx shots, even though there are dozens of shots throughout episode 1. That means we <b>did</b> <b>our</b> job well." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1997, Blink-182 would enter an {{extended}} period of touring to support their second studio album, Dude Ranch. The group had played a handful of dates on the Vans Warped Tour 1996, a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music. However, upon Dude Ranch release and popularity, Blink-182 would play every date of the 1997 tour worldwide with the bands NOFX and Social Distortion. The group were gone from their hometown of San Diego for nearly nine months straight beginning in late 1997. [...] "When we <b>did</b> <b>our</b> longest tour stretch, it was right when I started dating my fiancee," [...] recalled vocalist/guitarist Tom DeLonge. [...] "We were all new and in love, and I had to leave. It was just, [...] "Hey, I'll see you in nine months." [...] It was really hard." ...|$|E
500|$|Fincher, Fischer and Vanderbilt {{spent months}} {{interviewing}} witnesses, {{family members of}} suspects, retired and current investigators, the only two surviving victims, and the mayors of San Francisco and Vallejo. Fincher said, [...] "Even when we <b>did</b> <b>our</b> own interviews, we would talk to two people. [...] One would confirm some aspects of it and another would deny it. Plus, so much time had passed, memories are affected and the different telling of the stories would change perception. So when there was any doubt we always went with the police reports". During {{the course of their}} research, Fincher and Fischer hired Gerald McMenamin, an internationally known forensic linguistics expert and professor of linguistics at California State University Fresno, to analyze the Zodiac's letters. Unlike document examiners in the 1970s, he focused on the language of the Zodiac and how he formed his sentences in terms of word structure and spelling.|$|E

As tradition ever since, Arsenal goalkeepers have always washed their jerseys before each game. The Arsenal captain, Buchan, praised the Cardiff team saying [...] "My congratulations to Cardiff City on being the first club in history to take the Cup out of England. We <b>did</b> <b>our</b> very utmost to prevent them from doing so, but we did not succeed. As, however, the trophy is gone to Cardiff, there is no one who more heartily congratualtes them than the captain of the losers. Cardiff played an honest, clean game, each member of the team obviously striving to do his utmost and my final works are Good luck to the City and good luck to Wales and its Association football now that they have the Cup." ...|$|E
500|$|The new {{script was}} then pitched to the BBC. The pitch tape they made {{was based on}} the same pitch used by The Muppet Show. This was done as a tribute to it, with Miller arguing that when The Muppet Show did it, [...] "it just must have just knocked the socks off the people who saw it, because it's like nothing you've ever seen before, and we thought: 'Why fix what ain't broke, so we <b>did</b> <b>our</b> own very British version of that." [...] The {{producers}} liked it but did not fully understand what the show was about. Miller, Brown and a third writer, Daniel Peak began to write scripts over a period of four years. A pilot was eventually filmed and the BBC commissioned a full series, targeted at adults. Despite the adult nature, Miller did not want to make the show too crude. Eight episodes were filmed so as to spread the cost of making the series over each episode.|$|E
500|$|After House of Music was released, Tony! Toni! Toné! {{experienced}} growing tensions {{stemming from}} creative differences, business-related problems, and Saadiq's {{interest in a}} solo career. [...] "There's a quiet stress between us that no one really talks about", Saadiq told Vibe in 1997. [...] "And what's sad {{about the whole thing}} is the fact that our friendship is disintegrating. Who knows, House of Music could be the last Tony Toni Toné album." [...] The band remained committed to promoting the record into 1997, including a February 28 taped performance at VH1's Hard Rock Live special. According to Mercury vice president Marty Maidenberg, an international tour for the album had been planned by October 1996, with concert dates in Japan and the United Kingdom, but it never materialized. In November 1997, Saadiq told the Philadelphia Daily News [...] "there should have been like four singles from that album. You'll have to call Mercury on that. It went Platinum with no promotional tour. We <b>did</b> <b>our</b> job and they made their money." [...] The group disbanded shortly afterwards, and each member went on to pursue an individual music career.|$|E
