40|$|AbstractThis work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} identifying the <b>feedback</b> <b>ratios</b> in a buck converter with pulse width modulation and an inert output filter, with {{the ultimate goal of}} minimizing the duration of the transient processes. <b>Feedback</b> <b>ratios</b> in buck converters with pulse width modulation are conveniently adjustable using linear approximation for the neighborhood of the steady-state operating conditions. In the presence of an inert output filter or large input ripple, however, a pulse width modulator operates in saturation mode for a prolonged period of time (with a duty cycle of 0 or 1), which leads to losses in the estimated performance and to slowing down the transient processes. The solution we offer implies introducing a ‘fictional under-frequency’ of a pulse width modulator in order to calculate the <b>feedback</b> <b>ratios</b> separately for the transient process and, upon completion of the transient process, using the <b>feedback</b> <b>ratios</b> calculated for the base pulse width modulator frequency of conversion...|$|R

40|$|We report {{experimental}} studies {{of the influence of}} symmetric dual-loop optical feedback on the RF linewidth and timing jitter of self-mode-locked two-section quantum dash lasers emitting at 1550 nm. Various feedback schemes were investigated and optimum levels determined for narrowest RF linewidth and low timing jitter, for single-loop and symmetric dual-loop feedback. Two symmetric dual-loop configurations, with balanced and unbalanced <b>feedback</b> <b>ratios,</b> were studied. We demonstrate that unbalanced symmetric dual loop feedback, with the inner cavity resonant and fine delay tuning of the outer loop, gives narrowest RF linewidth and reduced timing jitter over a wide range of delay, unlike single and balanced symmetric dual-loop configurations. This configuration with feedback lengths 80 and 140 m narrows the RF linewidth by 4 - 67 x and 10 - 100 x, respectively, across the widest delay range, compared to free-running. For symmetric dual-loop feedback, the influence of different power split <b>ratios</b> through the <b>feedback</b> loops was determined. Our results show that symmetric dual-loop feedback is markedly more effective than single-loop feedback in reducing RF linewidth and timing jitter, and is much less sensitive to delay phase, making this technique ideal for applications where robustness and alignment tolerance are essential.

40|$|Taobao Marketplace, {{operated}} by Alibaba Group, {{is one of}} the biggest online retailers in the world. This article quantifies the welfare effects of reputation using a unique dataset of iPhone 5 posted-price transactions from Taobao Marketplace. Sellers ’ reputation is measured by iPhone 5 specific positive feedback ratios. On the demand side, I employ a nested logit model and estimate consumers ’ willingness to pay for reputation. On the supply side, reputation is modeled as an endogenous variable and cost parameters are estimated. Good reputation is found to be costly to maintain. My results suggest that it costs an average seller 120 USD (2. 5 percent of the average daily revenue of a seller) more per day to maintain his positive <b>feedback</b> <b>ratio</b> at 99. 1 rather than 98. 6 percent, a half standard deviation difference. Two counterfactual analyses are conducted to study the welfare effects of reputation. If the slope of the marginal cost of maintaining reputation is reduced by 20 percent, then the mean of the iPhone 5 positive feedback ratios increases from 99. 1 to 99. 3 percent. Both seller profits and social welfare increase significantly. Consumer welfare increases slightly, driven by the fact that the quality provision of sellers increases. The second counterfactual assumes that Taobao removes its time limit on feedback revision.

40|$|Presented in {{this work}} is a novel design {{technique}} for a low-phase-noise high-frequency CMOS voltage-controlled oscillator. Phase noise is generated from electrical noise near DC, the oscillation frequency, and its harmonics. In CMOS technology, low-frequency flicker noise dominates the close-in phase noise of the VCO. The proposed technique minimizes the VCO phase noise by seeking to eliminate the effect of flicker noise on the phase noise. This is accomplished by canceling out the DC component of the impulse sensitivity function (ISF) corresponding to each flicker-noise source, thus preventing the up-conversion of low-frequency noise into phase noise. The proposed circuit topology is {{a modified version of}} the complementary cross-coupled transconductance VCO, where additional feedback paths are introduced such that a designer can choose the <b>feedback</b> <b>ratios,</b> transistor sizes, and bias voltages to achieve the previously mentioned design objectives.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms that}} regulate tissue growth are diverse, but {{the objectives of}} growth control are generic in many tissues: to reach and stably maintain an appropriate size, to regenerate rapidly following injury, to possess appropriate proportions of different cell types, and to form specific tissue structures during development. It is known that feedback mechanisms {{play a role in}} growth control, and that cells the give rise to a tissue are organized into lineages—successive stages in which cells at each stage have the option either to self-renew or differentiate to the next stage. Negative feedback on progenitor cell self-renewal has been previously shown to confer “perfect adaptation” for steady-state size control (maintenance of an exact tissue size independent of numbers of starting cells, rates of cell division, or rates of cell death), stability, and a low steady-state load of progenitor cells (Lander, Gokoffski et al. 2009). Negative feedback is also useful for fast regeneration, and it will be shown that negative feedback can be used to approximate a bang-bang controller and therefore be used to build a tissue in the shortest time possible. This control strategy, however, suffers from inherent performance tradeoffs. Namely, rapid regeneration and robustness to parameters/initial conditions tend to be competing objectives, and certain perturbations can result in undesirable oscillations. Stem cells in lineages, such as in the olfactory epithelium (OE), are also known to undergo branching decisions (i. e. to be bipotent) (Gokoffski, Wu et al. 2011) and to receive feedback that promotes self-renewal divisions, such as by FGFs (DeHamer, Guevara et al. 1994). This study seeks to understand the role of the latter phenomenon, which amounts to a type of positive feedback. We find that mixing negative and positive feedback on progenitor self-renewal enables two distinct types of stable growth: either high or low, which we refer to as bi-modality. A critical <b>feedback</b> <b>ratio</b> sets the threshold between the two states, and spatial simulations reveal that this threshold can be used by tissues to self-organize into distinct shapes. A transient, local exogenous positive signal can boost progenitor self-renewal within a discrete zone of planar tissue, which induces bud formation and self-sustaining growth. Furthermore, these zones can self-organize in ways that control tissue shape with spatial precision – i. e. a bud elongates and maintains a constant width as growth self-sustains at its tip, neighboring elongating branches maintain even spacing, and branch numbers change according to changes in the <b>feedback</b> <b>ratio.</b> Disturbances to growth factors that regulate progenitor self-renewal have been previously shown to have morphological consequences during early branching of the olfactory epithelium (OE) (Kawauchi, Kim et al. 2009). Finally, results will be presented from counting progenitor cells in BrdU/EdU pulse-chase/fix experiments in the embryonic OE to measure regional differences in progenitor self-renewal. Preliminary data reveals high progenitor self-renewal in regions undergoing branching morphogenesis, while low self-renewal maintains cell populations in equilibrium at the anterior end of the OE...|$|E
