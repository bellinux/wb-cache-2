5|$|Although {{some work}} was done to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light <b>industrial</b> <b>use</b> before they too fell into disuse.

5|$|By 1910, {{the canal}} running through Rosendale had closed. On July5, 1911, the Jacob Rutsen house {{was hit by}} {{lightning}} and destroyed in a severe storm. The increased <b>industrial</b> <b>use</b> of Portland cement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was detrimental to Rosendale's economy, and the village lost almost 70percent of its population between 1900 and 1920; only one cement factory remained open after 1920. In April 1923, the Rosendale railroad depot and its freight house were destroyed in a fire.|$|E
5|$|Chloralkali process: The largest <b>industrial</b> <b>use</b> {{of mercury}} during the 20th century was in {{electrolysis}} for separating chlorine and sodium from brine; mercury being the anode of the Castner-Kellner process.

5|$|Steel was {{produced}} in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, <b>industrial</b> <b>use</b> only began after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the production of blister steel and then crucible steel.

5|$|The {{boundary}} between gem-quality diamonds and industrial diamonds is poorly defined and partly depends on market conditions (for example, if demand for polished diamonds is high, some lower-grade stones will be polished into low-quality or small gemstones {{rather than being}} sold for <b>industrial</b> <b>use).</b> Within the category of industrial diamonds, there is a sub-category comprising the lowest-quality, mostly opaque stones, which are known as bort.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} {{radishes}} can be pressed to extract radish seed oil. Wild radish seeds contain up to 48% oil, and while {{not suitable for}} human consumption, this oil is a potential source of biofuel.

5|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>use</b> of {{diamonds}} {{has historically been}} associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material for cutting and grinding tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more flaws and poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E

5|$|Lead is {{a common}} {{environmental}} pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include <b>industrial</b> <b>use</b> of lead, such as is found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, {{have been found to}} have unusually high blood lead levels. In August 2009, parents rioted in China after lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children living near zinc and manganese smelters. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).|$|E
5|$|Scientific Atlanta's first {{business}} {{focus was}} antennas for military and <b>industrial</b> <b>use.</b> Finances were tight at the fledgling firm. When {{they could not}} afford an automatic antenna pattern recorder, of which there was only one such machine on the market, Robinson decided to build his own. When word in the industry spread companies began contacting Scientific Atlanta. Within six months of the development of the device, Robinson sold units to Western Electric, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, General Electric, Convair, American Machine and Foundry, and many other large corporations of the era. Within eight years of operating, the firm had captured 60% of the global market share of electronic instruments for testing and designing antennas, had broken ground on a 25 acre facility in Northeast Atlanta, and had 240 employees on the payroll including 40 engineers.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} <b>industrial</b> <b>use</b> of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Most {{of these}} applications {{do not require}} large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used industrially. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications. Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances {{in the production of}} synthetic diamonds, new applications are becoming feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable for microchips, and because of its exceptional heat conductance property, as a heat sink in electronics.|$|E
