5000|$|Prior to electricity, various {{systems have}} been used for {{transmission}} of power across large distances. Chief among them were telodynamic (cable in motion), pneumatic (pressurized air), and <b>hydraulic</b> (pressurized <b>fluid)</b> <b>transmission.</b> [...] Cable cars were the most frequent example of telodynamic transmission, whose lines could extend for several miles for a single section. Pneumatic transmission was used for city power transmission systems in Paris, Birmingham, Rixdorf, Offenbach, Dresden and Buenos Aires {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. Cities in the 19th century also used <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> using high pressure water mains to deliver power to factory motors. London's system delivered 7000 hp ( [...] 5 megawatts) over a 180 mi network of pipes carrying water at 800 psi. These systems were replaced by cheaper and more versatile electrical systems, but by the end of the 19th century, city planners and financiers were well aware of the benefits, economics, and process of establishing power transmission systems.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. In {{difficult}} economic conditions, {{cost reduction}} of electricity consumption {{for the needs}} of production is an urgent task for the country’s industrial enterprises. Technical specifications of enterprises, which repair diesel locomotive <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission,</b> recommend conducting a certain amount of evaluation and regulatory tests to monitor their condition after repair. Experience shows that a significant portion of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> defects is revealed by bench tests. The advantages of bench tests include the ability to detect defects after repair, ease of maintenance of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> and relatively low labour intensity for eliminating defects. The quality of these tests results in the transmission resource and its efficiency. Improvement of the technology of plant post-repairs hydraulic tests in order to reduce electricity consumption while testing. Methodology. The possible options for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> test bench improvement were analysed. There was proposed an energy efficiency method for diesel locomotive <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> testing in locomotive repair plant environment. This is achieved by installing additional drive motor which receives power from the load generator. Findings. Based on the conducted analysis the necessity of improving the plant stand testing of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> was proved. The variants of the stand modernization were examined. The test stand modernization analysis was conducted. Originality. The possibility of using electric power load generator to power the stand electric drive motor or the additional drive motor was theoretically substantiated. Practical value. A variant of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> test stand based on the mutual load method was proposed. Using this method increases the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> load range and power consumption by stand remains unchanged. The additional drive motor will increase the speed of the input shaft that in its turn wil allow testing in closer to real conditions as a result of increased load on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission.</b> Increased load on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> will help to detect possible defects and hence will improve the quality of transmission repairs. ...|$|R

Methodology. The researchers proposed in the work a method of modifying the existing tachometer sensor of the automated microprocessor system for the locomotive <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> test-bench in the conditions of a diesel locomotive repair plant. It is applicable by substantiating the choice of the required tachometer sensor measuring method, as well as by using the necessary hardware and software to accomplish the goal with the ability to integrate into the data-measuring system for diesel locomotive <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> testing. Findings. The available equipment of the locomotive <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> test-bench allowed for design of the optical type speed sensor based on the existing sensor D- 2 MMU- 2. The factory testing with the use of a sensor prototype resulted in determination of the required and sufficient sampling time for sensor operating microcontroller. Originality. The available equipment of the locomotive <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> test-bench allowed for design of the optical type speed sensor based on the existing sensor D- 2 MMU- 2. We developed the operation algorithms for the microcontroller that processes the signals from this sensor. The sensor was factory-tested. According to the data sample obtained during the tests, we showed the possibility of reducing the sensor information retrieval frequency. Practical value. The designed sensor significantly reduces the cost of development of the diesel locomotive <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> test-bench, besides it can be used when developing similar <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> test-benches of other wheeled vehicles and the like. The designed sensor has a greater accuracy than that of D- 2 - 2 MMU and considerably lower production cost in comparison with current tachometer sensors. The measurement results are input data to perform further studies in order to determine the technical condition of UGP 750 - 1200 <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> during the factory post-repair testing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the basic}} {{structure}} of typical high-pressure gear pump, a new kind of high-pressure gear pump was designed and applied in water <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transmission</b> system. In this design, the floating plate of typical gear pump is ceramiclized to improve its wear-resisting property; the balance chamber was used to brace and lubricate the axle. Furthermore, the radial unbalanced force induced by the pressure difference of input and output is balanced by the structure of balance chamber. The dynamic characteristic of gear pump is improved and the axel wear is reduced. By using tip relief of tooth flank profile modification, the leakage rate of gear flank is effectively reduced, and the volume efficiency is improved.
