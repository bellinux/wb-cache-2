5|$|Andrew's sketch {{leads to}} the {{identification}} of the kidnapper as Joanne Ostler (Gillian Jacobs), a MIT neurologist who was previously believed deceased. Joanne tricks Ben into helping her complete an unfinished equation by using the image of his mother, who died in the car accident. Meanwhile, Walter suddenly remembers that <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the lights from former mathematician Dashiell Kim (Randall Duk Kim), an old bunkmate at St. Claire's Hospital who disappeared under similar circumstances. To discover the child's whereabouts, Olivia encourages Walter to return to St. Claire's. The visit does not go well, and Walter is held by hospital administrator Dr. Bruce Sumner (William Sadler), who remains unconvinced of Walter's sanity.|$|E
5|$|Forster's main interest, however, {{was again}} {{focused on the}} social {{behavior}} of people, as 15 years earlier in the Pacific. The national uprisings in Flanders and Brabant and the revolution in France sparked his curiosity. The journey through these regions, together with the Netherlands and England, where citizens' freedoms were equally well developed, in the end helped him to resolve his own political opinions. From that time on {{he was to be}} a confident opponent of the ancien régime. With other German scholars, he welcomed the outbreak of the revolution as a clear consequence of the Enlightenment. As early as July 30, 1789, shortly after <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the Storming of the Bastille, he wrote to his father-in-law, philologist Christian Gottlob Heyne, that it was beautiful to see what philosophy had nurtured in people's minds and then had realized in the state. To educate people about their rights in this way, he wrote, was after all the surest way; the rest would then result as if by itself.|$|E
5|$|However, Rodes beat Schurz to Oak Hill, so the XI Corps {{division}} {{was forced to}} take up positions in the broad plain north of the town, below and {{to the east of}} Oak Hill. They linked up with the I Corps reserve division of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson, whose two brigades had been sent forward by Doubleday when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Ewell's arrival. Howard's defensive line was not a particularly strong one in the north. He was soon outnumbered (his XI Corps, still suffering the effects of their defeat at the Battle of Chancellorsville, had only 8,700 effectives), and the terrain his men occupied in the north was poorly selected for defense. He held out some hope that reinforcements from Slocum's XII Corps would arrive up the Baltimore Pike in time to make a difference.|$|E

5|$|On June 11, Dodge escorted Brady to {{the mouth}} of the Fox River to confer with overall {{commander}} General Henry Atkinson. Dodge left the conference with clear authority from Atkinson to deal with the violence in the mining region. He first traveled to his home fort, at Gratiot's Grove, which he reached on June 13. The Spafford Farm massacre occurred the following day, and Dodge set out for Fort Hamilton as soon as <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it, stopping at Fort Blue Mounds for supplies. On the way to Hamilton, the soldiers passed a German immigrant, Henry Apple, exchanged greetings and kept traveling. Shortly afterwards the soldiers heard gunshots in the distance; Apple had met with a Kickapoo ambush, likely meant for Dodge himself. Dodge was probably saved by his last minute decision to make a detour from the main route. Later Apple's horse galloped wildly back past the men, wounded and carrying a large amount of blood in its saddle. The horse continued all the way to Fort Hamilton, where it raised a furor among the inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Radu is {{interviewed in}} {{this portion of}} the film, as is Tournecuillert, who speaks about his {{experiences}} in Albania, where <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the sex trafficking of girls and how some of the girls would be shot or burned to death as a warning to the other girls. He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate what will happen to others who try to escape. Matei adds that, for the sake of amusement, some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. Eugenia Bonetti, a nun, speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.|$|E

Zinovy returns and takes some time getting around to confront Katerina with what <b>he's</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> her affair. Finally she calls Sergei in, kisses {{him in front of}} her husband, some {{violence}} occurs, {{and the two of them}} are strangling Zinovy.|$|R

25|$|In 269, Ding Feng {{was ordered}} to {{garrison}} at Xu embankment (徐塘) and later attack the Jin territory of Guyang (穀陽). When the residents in Guyang learnt of the Wu army's approach, they immediately evacuated the area and Ding Feng did not obtain anything in the campaign. Sun Hao was furious when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> that, and he had Ding Feng's army guide (導軍) executed.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> a $4,000-to-win race at the {{speedway}} in Chula Vista, California. He saw {{a picture}} of a flat-wedge shaped race car that Charlie Swartz had used to win the Dirt Track World Championship in 1982, and he decided to build a race car like it for the Chula Vista race. Bloomquist won the race, lapping the field twice in the process.|$|E

25|$|In February 1864, Cosby and his brigade were {{assigned}} to the Department of Southwest Virginia and East Tennessee until September 1864, when they {{were assigned}} to the Department of West Virginia and East Tennessee {{until the end of the}} war. Cosby had between 2,000 and 4,000 men under his command at various times during this assignment. Cosby was paroled in Kentucky in May, 1865. He had disbanded his men when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia.|$|E
25|$|As {{the first}} batch of prisoners were being marched from Erfurt to Frankfort-on-the-Main, the column {{encountered}} 50 troopers of the Pletz Hussar Regiment # 3. The hussars scattered the inadequate escort and released between 4,000 and 5,000 prisoners. When <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it, an enraged Napoleon blamed Murat for the fiasco. However, Saxe-Weimar was unable to exploit this success. He tried to round up the released prisoners but they all ran away, and none could be returned to their units.|$|E

He visited 300 cities in all, including many of importance in Jewish history, such as Susa, Sura, and Pumbedita. In addition, he gathered information on many more areas that <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> in his travels, including China and Tibet. He recorded details on cultures such as that of Al-Hashishin, the hemp smokers, introducing Western Europeans to people and places far beyond their experience.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Toni Tennille was the co-writer of an ecology-themed musical, Mother Earth. At that time, Daryl Dragon (son of {{composer}} Carmen Dragon) {{was working}} as a keyboardist for the Beach Boys. When Tennille's show was preparing to move from San Francisco's Marines Memorial Theatre to Southern California's South Coast Repertory, a call was put out for a replacement keyboardist. Dragon was between tours when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the opening, met Tennille in San Francisco to audition, and landed the gig.|$|E

A contingent led by Musa ibn Musa al-Qasi, the leader of the semi-independent Banu Qasi principality to the north, joined this army despite Musa ibn Musa's political rivalry with Abd ar-Rahman, and played an important part in the campaign.|$|E
25|$|The tunnel flooded {{again the}} {{following}} year, on 12 January 1828, when six men died. Isambard was extremely lucky to survive this; the six men {{had made their}} way to the main stairwell, as the emergency exit was known to be locked. Isambard instead made for the locked exit. A contractor named Beamish heard him there and broke the door down, and an unconscious Isambard was pulled out and revived. He was sent to Brislington, near Bristol, to recuperate; there <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the competition to build what became the Clifton Suspension Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Smith has {{condemned}} Russia for barring {{entry of}} foreign Roman Catholic priests and the Saudis for treating foreign servants as slaves.

In 2003, Smith worked to extend it to 2005. He took action when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Ukrainian girls being held against their will in brothels in Montenegro. He called the Montenegrin prime minister, who ordered a raid on the operation. He has worked to secure grant funding for Project Polaris, a New York-New Jersey group combating sex trafficking.|$|E
