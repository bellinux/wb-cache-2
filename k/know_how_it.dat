Benz later emphasized: I just didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry.

So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2008, Maia launched Duo Maia with her new partner Mey Chan. Unlike Ratu, Duo Maia was conceived as a vocal group and Maia was predominantly a vocalist. Meanwhile, Mulan signed with Republik Cinta Management under Ahmad Dhani. Mulan released a solo album entitled Makhluk Tuhan Paling Seksi (God's Sexiest Creature) in 2008 and changed her stage name to Mulan Jameela. Mambo, the Ratu's original vocalist, had already released a solo album, entitled Aku Tahu Rasanya (I <b>Know</b> <b>How</b> <b>It</b> Feels) in 2006.

The film eventually emerged as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. She justified playing a minor role in the film by saying, [...] "I did Karan Arjun because I wanted to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> feels to be an ornament.
