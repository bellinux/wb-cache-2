5000|$|Thanks to its {{surrounding}} nature preserves, Sag Harbor has very rich fauna for its region. Many endangered species call Sag Harbor home {{such as the}} eastern tiger salamander which inhabits wetlands surrounding the village. The [...] "Long Pond Greenbelt", which straddles Sag Harbor's southern boundary, is a well known chain of ponds formed by a retreating glacier. Other natural sites around the village include Barcelona Neck Preserve, Millers Ground Preserve, Sag Harbor Woods Preserve and the recently acquired Cilli Farm which lies {{in the center of}} the village. Mammals which call these places home include the white-tailed deer, red fox, eastern coyote, long-tailed weasel, mink, muskrat, woodchuck, several bat species, bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises and possibly river otters which are close to local extinction in Long Island with only an estimated 8 individuals thought to have recently migrated from Connecticut. A large array of amphibian and reptilian species also live in the area, including the marbled salamander, tiger salamander, spotted salamander, box turtle, spotted turtle, gray tree frog, <b>eastern</b> <b>newt,</b> black racer snake, hognose snake and rough green snake, to name a few.|$|E
50|$|The refuge has {{a limited}} amount of {{freshwater}} cattail marsh or pond habitat. However, within its uplands, the refuge protects an extensive network of rivers, uplands and vernal pools, which provide important amphibian and reptile habitat.

40|$|Frogs, toads, and {{salamanders}} {{are well}} known for harboring an array of distasteful (and poisonous) secondary metabolites, presumably as antipredator defenses; yet few experiments have rigorously demonstrated the efficacy of amphibian chemical defenses against ecologically relevant consumers. For example, despite an absence of rigorous statistical evidence showing their distastefulness to predators, <b>eastern</b> <b>newts</b> (Notophthalmus viridescens (Rafinesque)) [...] a common salamander in lentic North American habitats [...] are assumed to tolerate diverse predator assemblages because newts secrete tetrodotoxin (TTX), a neurotoxin. Here we combine laboratory and field-based ecology with bioassay-guided separation of chemical extracts to show that <b>eastern</b> <b>newts</b> [...] although chemically protected against ecologically important consumers in lentic systems [...] nonetheless suffer substantial predation when tethered in the field. When offered newts with alternative prey (paedomorphic Ambystoma talpoideum), red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were 9 - 10 x as likely to feed on A. talpoideum as newts. Additionally, juvenile bluegill (Lepomis machrochirus) were 70 % less likely to consume newt eggs compared to control food pellets. We also show that different newt tissues were differentially palatable to predatory fish. All bluegill tested consumed a palatable control food, but only 20 % consumed dorsal skin, only 35 % ate ventral skin, but 75 % fed on newt viscera, suggesting that deterrent metabolites are concentrated in the skin. Bioassay-guided fractionation revealed that crude and water-soluble newt chemical extracts inhibited bluegill feeding, definitively establishing the chemical nature of newt antipredator defenses, although we were unsuccessful at isolating the chemical compounds responsible for unpalatability. Yet, deterrent activity in the polar but not the lipophilic chemical fraction and bioassay results demonstrating that naıve predators rapidly learn to avoid natural concentrations of TTX support the possible role of TTX in suppressing predation on newts. However, when tethered in the field, newt mortality was 55 % higher in ponds with predatory fishes than in ponds lacking fishes (62 % vs. 40 % respectively), indicating the possible existence of other predators that are resistant to (or tolerant of) newt chemical defenses. Together, these results {{stress the importance of}} rigorous, ecologically relevant, and hypothesis-driven experimentation to better understand the complexity of chemically- mediated predator-prey interactions, even for well-studied species like N. viridescens.

50|$|Although many {{salamanders}} have cryptic colors {{so as to}} be unnoticeable, others signal their toxicity {{by their}} vivid coloring. Yellow, orange, and red are the colors generally used, often with black for greater contrast. Sometimes, the animal postures if attacked, revealing a flash of warning hue on its underside. The red eft, the brightly colored terrestrial juvenile form of the <b>eastern</b> <b>newt</b> (Notophthalmus viridescens), is highly poisonous. It is avoided by birds and snakes, and can survive for up to 30 minutes after being swallowed (later being regurgitated). The red salamander (Pseudotriton ruber) is a palatable species with a similar coloring to the red eft. Predators that previously fed on it have been shown to avoid it after encountering red efts, an example of Batesian mimicry. Other species exhibit similar mimicry. In California, the palatable yellow-eyed salamander (Ensatina eschscholtzii) closely resembles the toxic California newt (Taricha torosa) and the rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa), whereas in other parts of its range, it is cryptically colored. A correlation exists between the toxicity of Californian salamander species and diurnal habits: relatively harmless species like the California slender salamander (Batrachoseps attenuatus) are nocturnal and are eaten by snakes, while the California newt has many large poison glands in its skin, is diurnal, and is avoided by snakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{brown thrasher}} {{utilizes}} its vision while scouring for food. It usually forages for food under leaves, brushes, and soil debris {{on the ground}} using its bill. It then swipes the floor in side-to-side motions, and investigates the area it recently foraged in. The brown thrasher forages in a similar method to the Long-billed thrasher and Bendire's thrasher (T. longirostre & bendirei), picking food {{off the ground and}} under leaf litter, whereas thrashers with sharply decurved bills are more likely to dig into the ground to obtain food. Foraging success is 25% greater in dry leaf litter as compared to damp leaf letter. The brown thrasher can also hammer nuts such as acorns in order to remove the shell. It has also been noted for its flexibility in catching quick insects, as the amount of vertebrae in its neck exceeds giraffes and camels. In one case, a brown thrasher was observed to dig a hole about 1.5 cm deep, place an acorn in it and hit the acorn until it cracked, considered to be a form of tool usage. In a laboratory experiment, a brown thrasher was found to be able to discern and reject the toxic <b>eastern</b> <b>newt</b> (Notophthalmus viridescens) and a palatable mimic of that species, the red salamander (Pseudotriton ruber), but continued to eat palatable dusky salamanders (Desmognathus spp.).|$|E
5000|$|P. ruber has a {{wide range}} in its {{breeding}} season, which is only limited by extremely cold temperatures. Generally, however, adult red salamanders mate annually and engage in primitive courting activities. Courtship between two red salamanders involves: [...] "A male approaches a female, rubbing his snout against her snout, cheeks, and chin. The male then moves his head and body under her chin and starts tail undulations. The female then straddles the male’s tail and the pair engages in a straddled “walk” until the male deposits sperm on the substrate. The “straddle-walk” approximately lasts two minutes and once the sperm is deposited, the female picks up the sperm cap as she moves over it and then they separate".Females are capable of long-term sperm storage and may not lay eggs for months after mating. Females typically lay eggs in the fall or early winter in headwater streams, and have very well-hidden nests. Other important behavioral aspects of P. ruber include its defensive mechanisms. In regards to mating, males appear to not be aggressive towards one another, but do occasionally court other males {{as a means of}} sperm competition to get the other male to deposit spermatophores, giving them a better chance of successful mating over their competitors. When threatened, red salamanders assume a defensive posture in which they curl their bodies, elevating and extending their rears, and placing their heads under their tails which are elevated and undulated from side to side. The coloration of the red salamander has been hypothesized to mimic that of the red eft stage of the <b>eastern</b> <b>newt</b> (Notophythalmus viridescens) which emits a powerful neurotoxin in their skin. This hypothesis, however, was heavily criticized due to significant size differences in the organisms and the differences in the species’ times of foraging ( [...] i.e. P. ruber mainly at night and the red eft mainly during the day). More recently, red salamanders have been noted to have reduced palatability, so they are considered part of a Müllerian mimicry system in which all species are unpalatable and benefit from aposematic coloration.|$|E
40|$|As both basal {{resources}} and autogenic ecosystem engineers, plants {{play an important}} role in structuring consumer communities. Plant invasion can alter important ecosystem properties such as habitat complexity, nutrient availability, and abiotic properties, and the hyper-productive, high-nutrient nature of many invaders may make the influence of these plants especially pronounced. While direct influences of these processes on competitors and predators may be relatively foreseeable, the consequences of indirect effects on consumers living within these invaded habitats are more difficult to predict. In order to determine the response of various forest floor consumers to invasion by the exotic grass _Microstegium vimineum_ we stocked large enclosures spanning eight independent invasion fronts with metamorphic individuals of three amphibian species; _Anaxyrus [Bufo] americanus_ (American toads), _Lithobates [Rana] sphenocephalus_ (southern leopard frogs), and _Notophthalmus viridescens_ (<b>eastern</b> <b>newts).</b> Using robust capture periods we tracked the survival and growth of these individuals. We also investigated the mechanisms behind these responses by tracking invertebrate abundance and abiotic factors on either side of each of these invasion fronts and performing additional manipulations, such as predator manipulations and analyses of foraging success, designed to investigate the effects of both bottom-up and top-down influences on these consumers. |$|R
40|$|Behavioral results {{obtained}} from the <b>eastern</b> red-spotted <b>newt</b> (Notophthalmus viridescens) led to {{the suggestion of a}} hybrid homing system involving inputs from both a light-dependent and a non-light-dependent mechanism. To evaluate the possible role of a receptor based on biogenic magnetite in this animal, we performed magnetometry experiments on a set of newts previously used in behavioral assays. The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) carried by these newts was strong enough to be measured easily using a direct-current-biased superconducting quantum interference device functioning as a moment magnetometer. Isothermal remanent magnetizations were two orders of magnitude higher than the NRM, suggesting that ferromagnetic material consistent with magnetite is present {{in the body of the}} newt. The NRM has no preferential orientation among the animals when analyzed relative to their body axis, and the demagnetization data show that, overall, the magnetic material grains are not aligned parallel to each other within each newt. Although the precise localization of the particles was not possible, the data indicate that magnetite is not clustered in a limited area. A quantity of single-domain magnetic material is present which would be adequate for use in either a magnetic intensity or direction receptor. Our data, when combined with the functional properties of homing, suggest a link between this behavioral response and the presence of ferromagnetic material, raising the possibility that magnetite is involved at least in the map component of homing of the <b>eastern</b> red-spotted <b>newt...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Barton Springs {{salamander}} (Eurycea sosorum) is {{a federally}} endangered species that is endemic to Barton Springs in Austin, Texas. Development within the Barton Springs watershed threatens {{the continued existence}} of E. sosorum. A factor that may be contributing to its decline is contamination from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Nearby asphalt parking lots paved with coal-tar and asphalt sealants can be sources of PAHs. Unaltered parent compounds of PAHs can have toxic effects, but oxidation and ultraviolet radiation can create degradation products 100 times more toxic than the parent compounds. The objective of this project was to determine if PAHs are potentially harmful to E. sosorum using two surrogate species. Adult <b>eastern</b> <b>newts</b> (Notophthalmus viridescens) and larval spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) were exposed to sediments with nominal concentrations of total PAHs that ranged from 0 to 1500 mg/kg under UV (290 - 400 nm) and visible (400 - 700 nm) light to determine concentration/response relationships. No statistically significant mortality occurred under any treatment. Exposure to both coal-tar sealant and UV light resulted in sublethal effects such as decreased righting ability and swimming speed. Difficulty in performing such movements would make it difficult to catch prey and increase susceptibility to predation. Exposure to UV light also resulted in elevated numbers of micronucleated erythrocytes and white blood cells. This study shows that simultaneous exposure to PAHs and UV light result in sublethal effects that could make the population of E. sosorum vulnerable to further decline...|$|R
50|$|Among others, mammal {{species that}} inhabit the greater West Island region include white-tailed deer, coyote and cottontail rabbits. the current {{population}} of white-tailed deer is quite substantial, It {{is estimated that}} there is over a thousand individuals in the deer population.

Other species endemic to the western portion of the island include grey squirrels, red squirrels, flying squirrels, mink, chipmunks, raccoons, beaver, skunks, porcupines, martens, woodchucks, muskrat, otters, and fox. The number of bird species varies according to season and migration. During spring and fall many species pass through the area on their way to southern breeding grounds. During winter months, depending on climatic conditions and availability of food in the northern Quebec, many species of birds will take up temporary residence, such as great grey owls, snow buntings, snowy owls,and others. The West Island has enough variation in suitable habitats, such as marsh, ponds, forest and field that many species of birds nest here. Various species of reptiles which can be found include garter snakes, red bellied, brown, milk and the northern water snake. Species of turtles include painted, map and snapping turtle. Amphibians include bullfrogs, green frogs, leopard frogs, spring peepers, wood frogs, and others. Salamanders such as the <b>eastern</b> <b>newt,</b> red backed salamander, blue spotted salamander are also found in the more humid habitats. In the surrounding waters of the west island, notably the Lake St. Louis side, large fish species such as northern pike, sturgeon, garfish, carp, catfish, muskellunge can be found. Given the Saint Lawrence's heavy traffic and years of mis-use, the ecoregion is negatively effected by high pollution which in turn has resulted in diminished local populations of native fauna. That said, residential development in the greater West Island suburban region (including the Vaudreuil-Soulanges area and parts of Eastern Ontario), has resulted in occasional sightings of black bears, wolves, lynx and cougars (which are generally believed to be extinct though sightings and some physical evidence suggest otherwise) as they themselves are pushed out of their habitats.|$|E
5000|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, Hox genes encode transcription {{factors that}} regulate embryonic and post-embryonic developmental processes. [...] The expression of Hox genes is regulated {{in part by}} the tight, spatial arrangement of conserved coding and non-coding DNA regions. The potential for evolutionary alterations in Hox cluster composition is viewed to be small among vertebrates. On the other hand, recent studies of a small number of non-mammalian taxa propose greater dissimilarity than initially considered. Next, generation sequencing of considerable genomic fragments greater than 100 kilobases from the <b>eastern</b> <b>newt</b> (Notophthalmus viridescens) was analyzed. Subsequently, {{it was found that the}} composition of Hox cluster genes were conserved relative to orthologous regions from other vertebrates. Furthermore, it was found that the length of introns and intergenic regions varied. In particular, the distance between HoxD13 and HoxD11 is longer in newt than orthologous regions from vertebrate species with expanded Hox clusters and is predicted to exceed the length of the entire HoxD clusters (HoxD13-HoxD4) of humans, mice, and frogs. Many recurring DNA sequences were recognized for newt Hox clusters, counting an enrichment of DNA transposon-like sequences similar to non-coding genomic fragments. Researchers found the results to suggest that Hox cluster expansion and transposon accumulation are common features of non-mammalian tetrapod vertebrates. After the loss of a limb, cells draw together to form a clump known as a blastema. This superficially appears undifferentiated, but cells that originated in the skin later develop into new skin, muscle cells into new muscle and cartilage cells into new cartilage. It is only the cells from just beneath the surface of the skin that are pluripotent and able to develop into any type of cell. Salamander Hox genomic regions show elements of conservation and variety in comparison to other vertebrate species. Whereas the structure and organization of Hox coding genes is conserved, newt Hox clusters show variation in the lengths of introns and intergenic regions, and the HoxD13-11 region exceeds the lengths of orthologous segments even among vertebrate species with expanded Hox clusters. Researchers have suggested that the HoxD13-11 expansion predated a basal salamander genome size amplification that occurred approximately 191 million years ago, because it preserved in all three extant amphibian groups. Supplementary verification supports the proposal that Hox clusters are acquiescent to structural evolution and variation is present in the lengths of introns and intergenic regions, relatively high numbers of repetitive sequences, and non-random accumulations of DNA transposons in newts and lizards. Researchers found that the non-random accretion of DNA-like transposons could possibly change developmental encoding by generating sequence motifs for transcriptional control.|$|E
40|$|The {{transcriptional}} {{promoter of}} satellite 2 from the <b>eastern</b> <b>newt,</b> Notophthalmus viridescens, was analyzed by assaying {{the activity of}} deleted or mutated satellite 2 clones in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Two elements in the promoter {{were found to be}} important for transcription. These elements have sequences that are similar to the sequences of the octamer and the proximal sequence element of vertebrate snRNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, the organization of these elements and their respective roles in transcription are the same as their organization and roles in the snRNA genes. To further investigate the relationship between the satellite 2 and snRNA gene promoters, the ability of the satellite 2 promoter to drive transcription of a true snRNA gene was tested. The satellite 2 promoter initiated transcription of the Xenopus U 1 b 2 snRNA gene as efficiently as the native U 1 b 2 promoter, and the 3 ' ends of the resulting U 1 b 2 transcripts were accurately formed. This latter result confirms that the satellite 2 promoter is a functional analog of the snRNA promoter, since 3 '-end formation of snRNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II requires that transcription be initiated from a compatible promoter. The structural and functional similarities between the satellite 2 and the snRNA gene promoters suggest that these elements are evolutionarily related.

Campbell and Lamar (2004) provided an exhaustive list of species that have reportedly been preyed upon by A. piscivorus, including cicadas, caterpillars, land snails (Euglandina rosea), catfish (Ictalurus furcatus), pike (Esox ssp.), sunfishes (Lepomis ssp.), bass (Micropterus ssp.), sirens (Siren spp.), <b>eastern</b> <b>newts</b> (Notophthalmus viridescens), brook salamanders (Eurycea spp.), Ouachita dusky salamanders (Desmognathus brimleyorum), spadefoot toads (Scaphiopus), eastern narrowmouth toads (Gastrophryne carolinensis), northern cricket frogs (Acris crepitans), West Indian treefrogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis), treefrogs (Hyla spp.), true frogs (Rana spp.), green anoles (Anolis carolinensis), skinks (Eumeces spp.), eastern glass lizards (Ophisaurus ventralis), ground skinks (Scincella lateralis), mudsnakes (Farancia abacura), hog-nosed snakes (Heterodon platirhinos), kingsnakes (Lampropeltis spp.), watersnakes (Nerodia spp.), crayfish snakes (Regina spp.), brown snakes (Storeria dekayi), gartersnakes and ribbonsnakes (Thamnophis spp.), other cottonmouths (A. piscivorus), rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.), common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), mud turtles (Kinosternon spp.), common musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus), Florida cooters (Pseudemys floridana), sliders (Trachemys scripta), eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina), Florida softshell turtles (Apalone ferox), baby American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina), chickadees (Parus spp.), cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), unidentified passerines, small ducks, juvenile anhingas (Anhinga anhinga), common egrets (Ardea alba), egrets, glossy ibises and their eggs (Plegadis falcinellus), tricolor herons (Egretta tricolor), herons and their eggs, pied-billed grebes (Podilymbus podiceps), short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda), least shrews (Cryptotis parva), southeastern shrews (Sorex longirostris), eastern moles (Scalopus aquaticus), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), rice rats (Oryzomys palustris), hispid pocket mice (Perognathus hispidus), black rats (Rattus rattus), squirrels (Sciurus spp.), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.) and bats.|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} use of amphibian {{models in}} biomedical research increases yearly, {{but there is}} a paucity of reports concerning analgesic use in many of these species. In this study, buprenorphine given by intracoelomic injection and butorphanol added to the tank water were compared for analgesic effect in the <b>eastern</b> red-spotted <b>newt</b> after bilateral forelimb amputations. Newts undergoing anesthesia but not surgery and newts having surgery but not given analgesia postoperatively were used as control groups. Animals were tested for food consumption, spontaneous movement, response to tapping on the tank, response to being touched, and body posture. Both buprenorphine by intracoelomic injection and butorphanol in tank water significantly promoted resumption of normal behavior after bilateral surgical amputation of the forelimbs. The difference between analgesic treatment and no analgesic treatment was maintained until 72 h after surgery...|$|R
