5|$|Macdonald {{was content}} to lead the Conservatives in a relaxed manner in {{opposition}} and await Liberal mistakes. He took long holidays and resumed his law practice, moving his family to Toronto and going into partnership with his son Hugh John. One mistake that Macdonald believed the Liberals had made was a <b>free-trade</b> <b>agreement</b> with Washington, negotiated in 1874; Macdonald {{had come to believe}} that protection was necessary to build Canadian industry. The Panic of 1873 had led to a worldwide depression; the Liberals found it difficult to finance the railroad in such a climate, and were generally opposed to the line anyway—the slow pace of construction led to British Columbia claims that the agreement under which it had entered Confederation was in jeopardy of being broken.|$|E

40|$|We study {{a setting}} with many countries; {{in each country}} there are firms that can sell in the {{domestic}} as well as foreign markets. Countries can sign bilateral <b>free-trade</b> <b>agreements</b> that lower import tariffs and thereby facilitate trade. We allow a country to sign any number of bilateral <b>free-trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> A profile of <b>free-trade</b> <b>agreements</b> defines the trading regime. Our principal finding is that, in symmetric settings, bilateralism is consistent with global free trade. We also explore the effects of asymmetries across countries and political economy considerations on the incentives to form trade agreements.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that bilateral <b>free-trade</b> <b>agreements</b> can undermine {{political support for}} further multilateral trade liberalization. If a bilateral trade agreement offers disproportionately large gains to key agents in a country, then their reservation utility is raised above the multilateral free-trade level, and a multilateral agreement would be blocked. Bilateral agreements between countries with similar factor endowments {{are most likely to}} have this effect. It also follows that bilateral <b>free-trade</b> <b>agreements</b> can never increase political support for multilateral free trade. Copyright 1997 by American Economic Association. ...|$|R

25|$|The first {{diplomatic}} {{contact with}} China {{was made in}} the 1970s, with full diplomatic relations established in the 1990s. Since then the two countries have been major players in strengthening the ASEAN–China relationship. Singapore and the United States share a long-standing close relationship, in particular in defence, the economy, health, and education. The United States was Singapore's third largest trading partner in 2010, behind China (2nd) and Malaysia (1st). The two countries have a <b>free-trade</b> <b>agreement,</b> and Singapore views its relationship with the United States as an important counterbalance to China's influence. A Strategic Framework Agreement between the two, signed in 2005, formalises security and defence co-operation. Singapore has pushed regional counter-terrorism initiatives, with a strong resolve to deal with terrorists inside its borders. To this end it has given support to the US-led coalition to fight terrorism, with bilateral co-operation in counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation initiatives, and joint military exercises.|$|E
25|$|The EU Commission {{decided on}} 11 March {{to enter into}} a full <b>free-trade</b> <b>agreement</b> with Ukraine within the year. On 12 March, the European Parliament {{rejected}} the upcoming referendum on independence in Crimea, which they saw as manipulated and contrary to international and Ukrainian law. The G7 bloc of developed nations (the G8 minus Russia) made a joint statement condemning Russia and announced that they would suspend preparations for the planned G8 summit in Sochi in June. NATO condemned Russia's military escalation in Crimea and stated that it was breach of international law while the Council of Europe expressed its full support for the territorial integrity and national unity of Ukraine. The Visegrád Group has issued a joint statement urging Russia to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and for Ukraine to take into account its minority groups to not further break fragile relations. It has urged for Russia to respect Ukrainian and international law and in line with the provisions of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum.|$|E

Indeed, Ukraine and the EU have already started the negotiations on new, enhanced political and <b>free-trade</b> <b>agreements</b> (Association and <b>Free-Trade</b> <b>Agreements).</b> Also, there has been some progress in liberalising the visa regime despite persistent problems in the EU Member States' visa approach towards Ukrainians.|$|R
40|$|International {{trade and}} {{fragmentation}} of production {{lead to increased}} trade in intermediate goods. Increased multi-stage production promotes the formation of <b>free-trade</b> <b>agreements</b> (FTA). In this paper, the relationship between intermediates trade and FTAs is examined with a two-step Pseudo Poisson Maximum Likelihood model. The analysis of a comprehensive dataset of pairwise trade-flow data of 70 countries from the years 1995 - 2011 shows a significant connection between trade in intermediates and the participation in <b>free-trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> A two-way relationship is identified: intermediates trade increases the probability to form a FTA and FTAs {{lead to an increase}} in intermediates trade. revised versio...|$|R
25|$|On 18 January 1973, the {{enacting}} of {{an emergency}} law saw Kekkonen's presidency extended by four years. By this time, Kekkonen had secured the backing of most political parties, but the major right-wing National Coalition Party, which Kekkonen had opposed, was still sceptical, {{and stood in the}} way of the required 5/6 majority. Concurrently, Finland was negotiating a <b>free-trade</b> <b>agreement</b> with the EEC, and as the EEC agreement promoted economic integration with the West, it was supported by National Coalition Party. Kekkonen had implied that if he did not remain president, the Soviets would not accept Finland's free trade agreement with the EEC. The tactic secured National Coalition support and the subsequent passing {{of an emergency}} law. The elimination of any significant opposition and competition meant he became Finland's de facto political autocrat. His power reached its zenith in 1975 when he dissolved parliament and hosted the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki with the assistance of a caretaker government.|$|E
