25|$|Since 2002, {{television}} programming {{trends in}} Southeast Asia began {{to undergo a}} drastic change as TV series from South Korea and Taiwan filled the slot originally reserved for Hollywood movies during prime time. Although dramas from South Korea gradually overtook those from Taiwan, much of Asia still had their <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> on Taiwanese bands such as F4, S.H.E and Fahrenheit. The breakthrough for K-pop came with the debut of TVXQ, SS501 and Super Junior, the latter hailed by the BBC as a household name in the region.|$|E

25|$|Causation: The {{lens of the}} <b>eye</b> <b>focuses</b> {{light on}} the retina.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} between {{the center of the}} lens and the retina (focal length) varies from approximately 17 mm to about 14 mm, as the refractive power of the lens increases from its minimum to its maximum. When the <b>eye</b> <b>focuses</b> on an object farther away than about 3 m, the lens exhibits its lowest refractivee power. When the <b>eye</b> <b>focuses</b> on a nearly object, the lens is most strongly refractive.|$|R

60|$|It was {{the utter}} {{weakness}} of the Indians that saved Smoke and Shorty from being overborne. In five minutes the wall of up-standing, on-struggling Indians had been changed to heaps of fallen ones that moaned and gibbered in the snow, and cried and sniveled as their staring, swimming <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> on the grub that meant life to them and that brought the slaver to their lips.

60|$|So chill a wind {{of hatred}} blew {{from the outer}} office that the normal comfort of his evening home-going was ruined. He was distressed by losing that {{approval}} of his employees to which an executive is always slave.

To-night he departed with feigned and apologetic liveliness. He was as afraid of his still-faced clerks--of the <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> on him, Miss McGoun staring with head lifted from her typing, Miss Bannigan looking over her ledger, Mat Penniman craning around at his desk in the dark alcove, Stanley Graff sullenly expressionless--as a parvenu before the bleak propriety of his butler. He hated to expose his back to their laughter, and in his effort to be casually merry he stammered and was raucously friendly and oozed wretchedly out of the door.|$|E

40|$|Augmented reality {{provides}} its user {{with additional}} information not {{available through the}} natural real-world environment. This additional information displayed to the user potentially poses a risk of perceptual and cognitive load and vision-based difficulties. The presence of real-world objects together with virtual augmenting information requires the user to repeatedly switch <b>eye</b> <b>focus</b> between the two in order to extract information from both environments. Switching <b>eye</b> <b>focus</b> may result in additional time on user tasks and lower task accuracy. Thus, {{one of the goals}} of this research was to understand the impact of switching <b>eye</b> <b>focus</b> between real-world and virtual information on user task performance. Secondly, focus depth, which is an important parameter and a depth cue, may also affect the user’s view of the augmented world. If focus depth is not adjusted properly, it may result in vision-based difficulties and reduce speed, accuracy, and comfort while using an augmented reality display. Thus, the second goal of this thesis was to study the effect of focus depth on task performance in augmented reality systems. In augmented reality environments, real-world and virtual information are found a...|$|R

50|$|Random-dot {{stereogram}} (RDS) is {{stereo pair}} {{of images of}} random dots which when viewed {{with the aid of}} a stereoscope, or with the <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> on a point in front of or behind the images, produces a sensation of depth, with objects appearing to be in front of or behind the display level.|$|E
50|$|In all microscopes {{the image}} is {{intended}} to be viewed with the <b>eyes</b> <b>focused</b> at infinity (mind that the position of the eye in the above figure is determined by the eye's focus). Headaches and tired eyes after using a microscope are usually signs that the eye is being forced to focus at a close distance rather than at infinity.|$|E
50|$|The {{visual system}} in humans allows {{individuals}} to assimilate {{information from the}} environment. The act of seeing starts when {{the lens of the}} <b>eye</b> <b>focuses</b> an image of its surroundings onto a light-sensitive membrane {{in the back of the}} eye, called the retina. The retina converts patterns of light into neuronal signals. The lens of the <b>eye</b> <b>focuses</b> light on the photoreceptive cells of the retina, which detect the photons of light and respond by producing neural impulses. These signals are processed in a hierarchical fashion by different parts of the brain, from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus, to the primary and secondary visual cortex of the brain. Signals from the retina can also travel directly from the retina to the Superior colliculus.|$|R

50|$|When the <b>eye</b> <b>focuses</b> on distant objects, {{the lens}} holds {{itself in a}} {{flattened}} shape due to traction from the suspensory ligaments.
