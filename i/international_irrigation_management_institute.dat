During the Green Revolution of the 1940s to 1970s, billions of dollars had been spent building large-scale irrigation systems. These contributed, along with new fertilizers, pesticides and high-yielding varieties of seeds, to helping many countries produce greater quantities of food crops. By the mid 1980s, however, these irrigation systems were no longer performing efficiently; IIMI's job was to find out why.|$|E

TAC was asked to advise on how to accommodate a reduction of $ 8. 5 million below the expected funding level for 1982. It did so following a detailed examination center by center. To get away from persistent marginal reductions, TAC decided to start at TAC 28 a strategic reappraisal of center programs. After considering reports from its study team on water management, and the related Steering Group, TAC decided to recommend to the CGIAR {{the creation of an}} <b>International</b> <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Management</b> Institution (IIMI), to be funded without reducing the present resources of existing centers. TAC referred a working paper on crop protection and a consultant report and workshop recommendations on plant breeders rights to the center directors, for further discussion at TAC 28. Work on plant nutrition at existing centers should have priority over creation of a new initiative in this field, but TAC would maintain a watching brief on ADAB's study of a proposal for an International Board for Soil Resource Management (IBSRAM). Questions were posed concerning the draft Quinquennial Review of IRRI, to be considered further at TAC 28. TAC asked to be kept informed about a conference on upland rice planned for Côte d'Ivoire in October. The recommendations of the Quinquennial Review of ILCA were endorsed.

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceParticipatory <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Management</b> (PIM) and <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Management</b> Transfer (IMT) are {{studied at}} three levels : the {{international}} literature, {{the policy and}} action taken in Morocco and field work in the Beni Amir large scale <b>irrigation</b> system. <b>International</b> literature argues that management will improve if users can take management decisions that are the outcome of local negotiations between stakeholders and based on local knowledge and normative frameworks. Since the 1980 s, several governments have adopted these turnover programs, often {{as part of the}} requirements of a structural adjustment package negotiated with IMF and international development banks. This shows that in many countries the tight financial situation of governments has been important for introducing PIM/IMT. The management transfer from the State to Water Users Associations (WUAs) has been more successfully achieved in some places (Mexico, Colombia and Turkey), than in other places (India, Pakistan, Philippines). Literature provides explanations as success factors for PIM/IMT like relative strength of economy and central government, higher literacy and standard of living. These factors are largely valid for Morocco and thus raises the question about the Moroccan progress in the domain of PIM in large scale irrigation. PIM policy was introduced by the government in 1990 and specified in 1995 as a policy that should be progressively spread, selective depending on location, adapted to the physical and organizational environment, contractual with the water users as partner and finally provide financial advantages for the water users. Field research took place in the Beni Amir large-scale irrigation system in Morocco, situated 200 km south east of Casablanca, where PIM policy became an issue in 1990. In the context of disengagement of the Moroccan state, objectives of the regional government agency responsible for <b>irrigation</b> <b>management</b> in the area (named ORMVAT, Office régional de mise en valeur agricole du Tadla) are to evolve from a complete State management up to farm level, to a more participatory management. Recent field work in which a check list of management tasks performed by farmers was used, showed that, contrary to the policy objectives, WUAs in the Beni Amir system are weakly involved in decision making and hardly perform tasks in <b>irrigation</b> system <b>management.</b> We found that PIM implementation in Morocco does not comply with the theoretical models that have been developed in Mexico, Turkey, the Philippines or elsewhere. This proves the hypothesis that PIM is context-specific which requires that before attempting to implement major institutional reforms in the irrigation sector, it is necessary to understand the national as well as the local context, the opportunities it offers, and the constraints it places on successful institutional reform. Even though local conditions in Beni Amir somehow fit with some points of the theory related to PIM/IMT (i. e. water scarcity should stimulate irrigation reform, the relatively good performance of the infrastructure should permit that IMT programs take off relatively “quickly”, availability of cash money for farmers to pay water fees), PIM programs did not come off the ground in Beni Amir. Case specific reasons that could explain the hesitance of PIM/IMT implementation are i) the irrigated perimeter of Beni Amir, as it is managed nowadays by the ORMVAT, functions relatively well, ii) the society is characterised by relatively strong central rule, iii) rigid labour relations in the civil service and iv) farmers are hesitant to take over the <b>irrigation</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Irrigation</b> <b>management</b> {{transfer}} {{is an important}} strategy among donors and governments to strengthen farmer control over water and irrigation infrastructure. This study seeks to understand whether <b>irrigation</b> <b>management</b> {{transfer is}} meeting the promise of its commitments. The authors use data from a survey of 68 irrigator associations and 1, 020 farm households in the Philippines to estimate the impact of <b>irrigation</b> <b>management</b> transfer on <b>irrigation</b> association performance and on rice yields. They also estimate a stochastic frontier production function to assess contributions to technical efficiency. There are three main results. First, the presence of <b>irrigation</b> <b>management</b> transfer is associated {{with an increase in}} maintenance activities undertaken by irrigation associations. Second, by increasing local control over water delivery, the presence of <b>irrigation</b> <b>management</b> transfer is associated with a 2 - 6 percent increase in farm yields. Rice production in <b>irrigation</b> <b>management</b> transfer areas is greatereven after controlling for various differences among rice farmers in transfer and non-transfer areas. Third, <b>irrigation</b> <b>management</b> transfer is, at a minimum, poverty-neutral, and may even give the asset-poor a small boost in terms of rice yields.

An international review of IMT experiences shows that {{for transfer to}} work, the irrigation system must be central to a wealth-creating agriculture within which IMT makes good economic sense to farmers. This {{is not the case}} in a majority of Africa?s smallholder schemes. Making IMT work in this context means addressing a number of challenges: smallholder dependency resulting from years of state intervention in farm operations and management, farmers? inability to depend on irrigated agriculture as their primary income source, insecure land tenure arrangements, and lack of access to credit and input and output markets Current IMT strategies which focus on investments in capacity-building and infrastructure rehabilitation alone are destined to fail. For IMT to succeed, it must be accompanied by interventions that extend beyond the irrigation sector to significantly enhance African smallholder productivity and incomes. Potential avenues for accomplishing this include strengthening access to markets and credit, promoting high-value crops, improving systems for extension and technical support, making investments in smallholder technologies, clarifying land tenure arrangements, encouraging the development of farm equity schemes, and providing necessary supports through farmers? associations...|$|R
