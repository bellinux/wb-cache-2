Retrenchment, {{introduced}} {{to alleviate the}} excessively strong demands that refinement sometimes imposes, is most easily applied ‘vertically’, i. <b>e.</b> <b>to</b> <b>individual</b> execution steps, {{without regard to the}} sequential composition of those steps. This paper addresses the issue of how system properties, akin to sets of execution sequences, can be transformed between systems through retrenchment. Property transformers based on simulation relations are introduced, as are transformers of ambivalent properties and constrained property transformers. Their theory is investigated. The simplifications in the context of regular relations are explored. A number of examples in the discrete and continuous domains are examined...|$|E

The novelty {{of this paper is to}} analyze previously unconsidered characteristics, in particular, personality traits and tasks performed at work which are taken into account in addition to the standard individual specific determinants. Results show that tasks performed at work are strong predictors of training participation while personality traits are not. Once working tasks and other job related characteristics are controlled for, the skill gap in training participation drops considerably for off-the-job training and vanishes for on-the-job training. training, personality traits, working tasks, Oaxaca decomposition...|$|E

40|$|Low-dimensional {{representations}} {{are key to}} {{the success}} of many video classification algorithms. However, the commonly-used dimensionality reduction techniques fail to account for the fact that only part of the signal is shared across all the videos in one class. As a consequence, the resulting representations contain instance-specific information, which introduces noise in the classification process. In this paper, we introduce Non-Linear Stationary Subspace Analysis: A method that overcomes this issue by explicitly separating the stationary parts of the video signal (i. e., the parts shared across all videos in one class), from its non-stationary parts (i. <b>e.,</b> specific <b>to</b> <b>individual</b> videos).

40|$|Objectives—For many years, the {{prevailing}} concept was that LDL oxidation plays {{a central role}} in atherogenesis. As a consequence, supplementation of antioxidants, particularly vitamin E, became very popular. Unfortunately, however, the major randomized clinical trials have yielded disappointing results on the effects of vitamin E on both mortality and morbidity. Moreover, recent meta-analyses have concluded that vitamin E supplementation increases mortality. This conclusion has raised much criticism, most of it relating to three issues: (1) the choice of clinical trials {{to be included in the}} meta-analyses; (2) the end point of these meta-analyses (only mortality); and (3) the heterogeneity of the analyzed clinical trials with respect to both population and treatment. Our goal was to bring this controversy to an end by using a Markov-model approach, which is free of most of the limitations involved in using meta-analyses. Methods and Results—We used a Markov model to compare the vitamin E supplemented virtual cohorts with nonsupplemented cohorts derived from published randomized clinical trials that were included in at least one of the major meta-analyses. The difference between the virtual supplemented and nonsupplemented cohorts is given in terms of a composite end point denoted quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The vitamin E supplemented virtual cohort had 0. 30 QALY (95 %CI 0. 21 to 0. 39) less than the nontreated virtual cohort. Conclusions—Our study demonstrates that in terms of QALY, indiscriminate supplementation of high doses of vitamin E is not beneficial in preventing CVD.

We give now an improved version of the method exhibiting a phenomenon of emergence of structured diversity.

In other words, even if the modification involves {{only a small number}} of individuals initially, the final pattern involves all the individuals. This behavior is easily understood in cases when the modification is concerned with some kind of symbiotic behavior, as it induces an advantage with respect to the ‘spectators’. But the phenomenon is very much general; we give examples of emergence in other contexts, involving predator/pray relations or other entangled relations, including an experimentally known example of subspecies of Escherichia coli...|$|R

40|$|In {{communities}} {{sharing a}} common energy source, the energetic equivalence hypothesis predicts that numerical abundance (N) scales with body mass (M) as M- 0. 75. However, in size-structured food webs all individuals {{do not share}} a common energy source, and the energy available (<b>E)</b> <b>to</b> larger <b>individuals</b> is constrained by inefficient energy transfer through the food chains that support them. This is expected to lead to steeper scalings of N with M. Here, we formalize and test an existing model for predicting abundance-body mass scaling, where the decline in E with M is calculated from the mean predator-prey body mass ratio (from size-based nitrogen stable isotope analysis) and trophic transfer efficiency. We show that the steep predicted scalings of abundance and body mass (N scales as M- 1. 2, B scales as M- 0. 2) in a marine food web are consistent with empirical estimates and {{can be attributed to}} the small predator-prey body mass ratio (106 : 1).

Here, we critically and systematically review the literature regarding impacts of debris from several scientific fields {{to understand the}} weight of evidence regarding the ecological impacts of marine debris. We quantified perceived and demonstrated impacts across several levels of biological organization {{that make up the}} ecosystem and found 366 perceived threats of debris across all levels. Two hundred and ninety-six of these perceived threats were tested, 83 % of which were demonstrated. The majority (82 %) of demonstrated impacts were due to plastic, relative <b>to</b> other materials (<b>e.</b> g., metals, glass) and largely (89 %) at suborganismal levels (e. g., molecular, cellular, tissue). The remaining impacts, demonstrated at higher levels of organization (i. <b>e.,</b> death <b>to</b> <b>individual</b> organisms, changes in assemblages), were largely due to plastic marine debris (> 1 mm; e. g., rope, straws, and fragments). Thus, we show evidence of ecological impacts from marine debris, but conclude that {{the quantity and quality of}} research requires improvement to allow the risk of ecological impacts of marine debris to be determined with precision. Still, our systematic review suggests that sufficient evidence exists for decision makers to begin to mitigate problematic plastic debris now, to avoid risk of irreversible harm. </p...|$|R

We split the sample, which spans 0 < z < 3 and stellar masses 108. 0 < M*/M < 1011. 5, into elliptical, irregular or starburst galaxies {{based on their}} spectral energy distributions. We find that SSFR falls with stellar mass, {{in agreement with the}} 'downsizing' paradigm. We consider the dependence of the SSFR - mass slope on redshift: for our full and elliptical samples the slope flattens, but for the irregular and starburst samples the slope is independent of redshift. The rate of SSFR evolution reduces slightly with stellar mass for ellipticals, but irregulars and starbursts co-evolve across stellar masses. Our results for SSFR as a function of stellar mass and redshift are in agreement with those derived from other radio-stacking measurements of mass-selected passive and star-forming galaxies, but inconsistent with those generated from semi-analytic models, which tend to underestimate SFRs and SSFRs.

To study the influence of VIT on specific immunoglobulin <b>E</b> (sIgE) <b>to</b> <b>individual</b> allergens before and {{after three years of}} treatment. METHODS A total of 606 patients allergic to hymenoptera venom (467 to bee, 139 to wasp) were studied. All of them received VIT (Apis or Vespula. Two patients received an extract of Polistes dominulus). Cutaneous tests (ID) and sIgE were performed in all patients and in 35 of them, sIgE <b>to</b> main <b>individual</b> hymenoptera allergens (Api m 1, Api m 2, Ves v 1, Pol d 1, Ve v 2, Ves v 5 and Pol d 5) was measured before and after 3 years of treatment. RESULTS: The treatment was completed in 462 patients. During/after treatment 141 / 73 patients sensitized to Apis and 53 / 25 to Vespula suffered spontaneous re-stings. The 95, 7 % patients sensitized to Apis and 100 % sensitized to Vespula suffered a local reaction or no-reaction. At the end of treatment, the cutaneous response (ID) and sIgE level to whole venom extract decreased significantly. Reductions in sIgE to main allergens were also observed after 3 years of treatment (Api m 1 : p < 0. 001; Api m 2 : p= 0. 0270; Ves V 5 : p= 0. 0234).

40|$|The Spanish {{government}} {{recently announced}} an official fast-track path to citizenship for any {{individual who is}} Jewish and whose ancestors were expelled from Spain during the inquisition-related dislocation of Spanish Jews in 1492. It would seem that this policy targets a small subset of the global Jewish population, i. <b>e.,</b> restricted <b>to</b> <b>individuals</b> who retain cultural practices associated with ancestral origins in Spain. However, the central contribution of this manuscript is to demonstrate {{how and why the}} policy is far more likely to apply to a very large fraction (i. e., the vast majority) of Jews. This claim is supported using a series of genealogical models that include transmissable "identities" and preferential intra-group mating. Model analysis reveals that even when intra-group mating is strong and even if only a small subset of a present-day population retains cultural practices typically associated with that of an ancestral group, it is highly likely that nearly all members of that population have direct geneaological links to that ancestral group, given sufficient number of generations have elapsed. The basis for this conclusion is that not having a link to an ancestral group must be a property of all of an individual's ancestors, the probability of which declines (nearly) superexponentially with each successive generation. These findings highlight unexpected incongruities induced by genealogical dynamics between present-day and ancestral identities. Comment: 6 page, 4 figure...|$|R

Inferences about credits are unambiguous in the latter arrangement but imperfect in the former, because alphabetical listing can reflect ordering according <b>to</b> <b>individual</b> contributions by chance. We contrast the fields of economics and psychology with marketing, a discipline heavily influenced by both. Based on archival data, consisting of more than 38, 000 journal articles, we show that the three fields have different ordering practices. In two empirical studies with 351 faculty and graduate student participants from all three disciplines, as well as in a computer simulation, we show that ordering practices systematically affect and shape the allocation of perceived contributions and credit. Whereas strong disciplinary norms in economics and psychology govern the allocation of contribution credits, a more heterogeneous picture emerges for marketing. This lack of strong norms has detrimental effects in terms of assigned contribution credits. decision making, information processing, social norms, contribution credits, authorship...|$|R
