500|$|The {{development}} of the Neon Genesis Evangelion series ran close to deadlines throughout its production run. The initial cuts {{of the first two}} episodes were screened at the second Gainax festival in July 1995, only three months before they were aired on television. By episode 13 the series began to deviate significantly from the original story, and the initial script was abandoned. The number of Angels was reduced to 17 instead of the original 28, and the writers changed the story's ending, which had originally described the failure of the Human Instrumentality Project after an Angel attack from the moon. Starting with episode 16, the show changed drastically, discarding the grand narrative concerning salvation for a narrative <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> characters. This change coincided with Anno's {{development of}} an interest in psychology after a friend lent him a book on mental illness. This focus culminated in a psychoanalysis of the characters in the two final episodes. The production ran so close to the airing deadline that the completed scenes used in the preview of the twenty-fifth episode had to be redesigned to work with the new ending. These episodes feature heavy use of abstract animation, flashbacks, simple line drawings, photographs and fixed image scenes with voice-over dialogue. Some critics speculated that these unconventional animation choices resulted from budget cuts, but Toshio Okada stated that Anno [...] "couldn't decide the ending until the time came, that's his style". These two episodes sparked controversy and condemnation among fans and critics of the series, including significant vitriol directed at Anno himself. Hideaki Anno and Studio Gainax released in 1997, two animated feature films: [...] and The End of Evangelion.|$|E
2500|$|Human {{security}} {{focuses on}} the serious neglect of gender concerns under the traditional security model. Traditional security’s focus on external military threats to the state has meant {{that the majority of}} threats women face have been overlooked. It has recently been argued that these forms of violence are often overlooked because expressions of masculinity in contexts of war have become the norm. By <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual,</b> the human security model aims to address the security concerns of both women and men equally. However, as of recent conflicts, it is believed that the majority of war casualties are civilians and that [...] "such a conclusion has sometimes led to the assumptions that women are victimized by war {{to a greater extent than}} men, because the majority of adult civilians are women, and when the populations of civilian women and children are added together, they outnumber male combatants. Furthermore, in the post-war context women survivors generally outnumber men and so it is often said that women as a group bear a greater burden for post-war recovery".Women are often victims of violence and conflict: they form the majority of civilian deaths; the majority of refugees; and, are often the victims of cruel and degrading practices, such as rape. Women's security is also threatened by unequal access to resources, services and opportunities. The UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, as of 1995, suggested that the problem is not just a social one, but requires evaluation of the political institutions which uphold unequal system of domination. Women's rights are neglected especially in the Middle East and Southeast Asian regions where customary practices are still prevalent. Although there are different opinions on the issue of customary practices, it infringes upon human security's notion where women and men are innated with equal human rights. Attempts to eradicate such violent customary practices requires political and legal approaches where human security in relation to gender should be brought up as the main source of assertion. Such cruel customary practices as honor killing, burning brides and widows, child marriage are still in existence because of women's vulnerability in economic independence and security. Human security in relationship to gender tries to overthrow such traditional practices that are incompatible to the rights of women. Also human security seeks to empower women, through education, participation and access, as gender equality is seen as a necessary precondition for peace, security and a prosperous society.|$|E

In these settings, like a class lecture or athletic competition, attention is divided between <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> and on the actions of the group. The inability to identify the split attention leads individuals to overestimate the likelihood that their peers will perceive them poorly.|$|E

5000|$|... "The {{human being}} must be {{understood}} as a social person. It is the constant search for social interaction that leads us to do what we do.

50|$|Early {{attempts}} to define social capital {{focused on the}} degree to which social capital as a resource should be used for public good or for the benefit of individuals. Putnam suggested that social capital would facilitate co-operation and mutually supportive relations in communities and nations and would therefore be a valuable means of combating many of the social disorders inherent in modern societies, for example crime. In contrast to those <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> benefit derived from the web of social relationships and ties individual actors find themselves in, attribute social capital to increased personal access to information and skill sets and enhanced power. According to this view, individuals could use social capital to further their own career prospects, rather than for the good of organisations.|$|E

5000|$|A {{major element}} of {{building}} and maintaining human resilience is public health. [...] The institution {{of public health}} {{as a whole is}} uniquely placed at the community level to foster human resilience to climate-related disturbances. As an institution, public health can play an active part in reducing human vulnerability by promoting “healthy people and healthy homes.”) Healthy people are less likely to suffer from disaster-related mortality and are therefore viewed as more disaster-resilient. Healthy homes are designed and built to maintain its structure and withstand extreme climate events. By merely <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> health of populations and assuring the durability of the homes that house these populations, at least some degree human resiliency towards climate change can be achieved.|$|E
5000|$|People with ASD process {{face and}} non-face stimuli {{with the same}} speed. In {{typically}} developing individuals, there is a preference for face processing, thus resulting in a faster processing speed in comparison to non-face stimuli.

When <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> parts of the face, persons with ASD direct their gaze primarily to {{the lower half of}} the face, specifically the mouth, varying from the eye trained gaze of typically developing people.
