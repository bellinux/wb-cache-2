The species is gregarious and depending on the conditions can be resident or nomadic. In trials of growing hybrid <b>eucalypt</b> trees in dry environments parrots, especially the Port Lincoln parrot, caused severe damage to the crowns of the younger trees during the research period between 2000–3.|$|E
5|$|The {{native forest}} in the Canberra region was almost wholly <b>eucalypt</b> species and {{provided}} a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the <b>eucalypt,</b> and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials {{of a number of}} species including Pinus radiata on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.|$|E

40|$|Eucalyptus spp genus is {{economically}} {{important to}} different industry fields. There are pests that damage {{the development of}} <b>eucalypts</b> and Glycaspis brimblecombei, a sap-sucking insect, is one of them. Studies about this insect attack to the <b>eucalypts</b> showed preferences. This work aim was to compare the preferences of the insect with thermoanalytical characteristics of different <b>eucalypts</b> (susceptible, less susceptible and resistant to Glycaspis brimblecombei) essential oils. The leaves of six species of Eucalyptus were crushed and the essential oil was extracted using Clevenger apparatus. The Shimadzu DTG- 60 H was {{used to analyze the}} samples. The results showed that the samples from more susceptible <b>eucalypts</b> had total mass loss at about 124 ºC to 156 ºC, lower than samples from more resistant <b>eucalypts</b> (from 168 ºC to 175 ºC). Furthermore, the study suggests that the susceptibility or the resistance of <b>eucalypts</b> to the pest may be related to their essential oil composition and concentration of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. 2016 Disponível online...|$|R

5|$|A small prickly leaved shrub between 0.2 and 3m (8 in to 10ft) high, G. juniperina grows {{generally}} on clay-based or alluvial soils in <b>eucalypt</b> woodland. The flower heads, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear from winter to early summer and are red, orange or yellow. Birds visit and pollinate the flowers. Grevillea juniperina plants {{are killed by}} bushfire, regenerating afterwards from seed. Grevillea juniperina adapts readily to cultivation and has been important in horticulture {{as it is the}} parent of many popular garden hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Although a honeyeater in origin, {{the striped}} honeyeater's food source is {{primarily}} insects, and its diet includes seeds and fruits {{as well as}} nectar. Its bill has evolved to a short, straight, sharply pointed shape more suited to probing crevices for insects, than to probing flower tubes. It has the honeyeater’s brush tongue and takes nectar from shallow flowers such as <b>eucalypt</b> blossoms.|$|E
5|$|Although {{recorded}} in small numbers sporadically throughout twentieth century {{it was not}} until the 1980s that Grey-headed flying foxes routinely visited Melbourne. Since the 1990s their permanent colony in Melbourne has been postulated as possibly due to habitat loss in their northern range, greater supply of reliable food by native <b>eucalypt</b> plantings and backyard fruit trees, climate change, and increase urbanisation leading to warmer temperatures.|$|E
50|$|As well as seed regeneration, <b>eucalypts</b> utilise {{vegetative}} regeneration {{to recover}} from fire depending on its intensity. <b>Eucalypts</b> can do this by basal sprouting from lignotubers or from the stem, sprouting from epicormic buds.|$|R

It has become more common in southwest Western Australia with land clearing, though has become rare around Darwin on account of urban development.|$|E
5|$|Koalas {{typically}} inhabit open <b>eucalypt</b> woodlands, and {{the leaves}} of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this <b>eucalypt</b> diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay {{for the first six}} to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} plant {{partners are}} reflected in the wide variety of habitats worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine tundra, boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (maquis), miombo woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical cloud forest, tropical dry forest, Australian <b>eucalypt</b> woodlands, and south temperate forests. Where they are introduced, they typically grow in plantations of their native host species, e.g. with pine in South Africa, Eucalyptus in Thailand, or birch in New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|In central New South Wales, the red wattlebird forages {{more often}} on the foliage of the grey gum (Eucalyptus punctata) over other trees, though it does also show some {{preference}} for narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra) if grey gum is not present. Red wattlebirds tend to oust noisy friarbirds (Philemon corniculatus) if both species were present. The red wattlebird often forages alongside the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), little friarbird (P. citreogularis), western and little wattlebirds, rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus), purple-crowned lorikeet (Glossopsitta porphyrocephala), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), pied currawong (Strepera graculina) and crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans), though they generally chase other nectar-feeding birds away from a horde of <b>eucalypt</b> flowers.|$|E
5|$|M.regularis {{is found}} in the {{south-western}} coastal regions, inhabiting <b>eucalypt</b> woodland and open forests. They nest underground and do not build mounds. Workers are active during the day and night, foraging on trees in search for prey and sweet substances such as sap and nectar. The larvae are strictly carnivorous and only eat insects that workers capture. Nuptial flight occurs around February to April, with queens shedding their wings inside the nest and mating near to their parent nest. Queens tend to look for food for their young before they hatch, taking as long as eight months to develop. Certain frog species are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies.|$|E

The fungus infiltrates the heartwood {{of the tree}} via a breach in its bark, either by a branch falling, damage from insects or mistletoe, or by mechanical damage from logging. O.nidiformis has been implicated in the heartwood rot of several species of <b>eucalypt</b> around Australia, including marri (Corymbia calophylla) in southwest Western Australia, in spotted gum (C.maculata) and messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua) in New South Wales, and in blackbutt (E.pilularis), Sydney blue gum (E.saligna), red stringybark (E.macrorhyncha) and Forth River peppermint (E.radiata) in Victoria.|$|E

5|$|Populations are dense in {{the higher}} {{mountain}} regions of Tasmania. Widespread throughout the state, their presence is known on King Island, located north-west from Tasmania. The ant prefers rural areas, found in warm, dry, open <b>eucalypt</b> woodlands; the climate provides the ant with isolation and warmth. This environment also produces the ant's food, which includes nectar and invertebrate prey. In suburban areas, this ant is found in native vegetation, and use rockeries, cracks in concrete walls, dry dirt and grass to build nests. One study found suburbs with voluminous vegetation cover such as Mount Nelson, Fern Tree and West Hobart host jack jumper populations, while the heavily urbanised suburbs of North Hobart and Battery Point, do not.|$|E
5|$|Telopea truncata, {{commonly}} known as the Tasmanian waratah, is a plant in the family Proteaceae. It is endemic to Tasmania where it is found on moist acidic soils at altitudes of 600 to 1200m (2000–4000ft). Telopea truncata is a component of alpine <b>eucalypt</b> forest, rainforest and scrub communities. It grows as a multistemmed shrub to a height of , or occasionally as a small tree to 10m (35ft) high, with red flower heads, known as inflorescences, appearing over the Tasmanian summer (November to February) and bearing 10 to 35 individual flowers. Yellow-flowered forms are occasionally seen, but do not form a population distinct {{from the rest of the}} species.|$|E
5|$|The green rosella {{generally}} breeds at {{two years}} of age, though younger birds may pair up and look for nests. The breeding season is September to January, with one brood. The nesting site is usually a hollow over 1m (3ft) deep in a tree trunk anywhere up to 30m (100ft) above the ground. The tree chosen is generally a <b>eucalypt</b> such as Tasmanian bluegum, manna gum or mountain ash (E. regnans), or myrtle beech.

5|$|Widespread across western, {{northern}} and eastern Australia, the brown honeyeater occupies {{a range of}} habitats from mangroves to <b>eucalypt</b> woodlands. It is seasonally nomadic within its local area, following flowering food plants. While it usually forages alone, it also feeds in small groups, or flocks of mixed honeyeater species. Nectar and insects form its diet. It occupies the same breeding territory each year, and lays two or three eggs in a cup-shaped nest woven from grass and soft bark. Both sexes contribute to nest building and feeding the young. It has a loud, clear, musical song, described as {{the best of all}} the honeyeaters.|$|E
5|$|A common mushroom, Mycena nargan {{is found}} growing singly or in {{clusters}} {{on the underside}} of rotting wood in wet and shaded areas, and is especially partial to Eucalyptus and Pinus pinaster. Fruit bodies usually appear from April to June. The species has been recorded from Tasmania, Victoria and southeastern South Australia. The Australian Fungimap initiative has reported isolated collections in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, although the majority of sightings have been in Tasmania and Victoria. The fungus is saprobic, meaning it derives nutrients from dead or dying organic matter. A field study conducted in Tasmania showed that it is {{much more likely to be}} found in mature <b>eucalypt</b> forest (defined as having grown at least 70 years before the last wildfire) than young, regenerating forest that had experienced clearfelling, burning, and sowing two to three years previously.|$|E
5|$|Ants of this genus are eurychoric; {{they have}} a {{widespread}} geographic distribution in many different climates, but they are usually found in dry and mesic habitats. They {{are referred to as}} a tropical genus, but the type specimen was collected from temperate Sydney. They are found in sclerophyll woodland and forests, <b>eucalypt</b> woodland, Casuarina forests, mallee, hillsides, beaches and urban areas. These ants are arboreal ants and nests are located in bark, logs, rotten wood, sand, soil, under rocks and stones, tree stumps and twigs or branches. In urban areas, colonies are found under cracked paths, inside house walls or in patio areas. Some species are considered pests, and they forage into pastures and houses where they show a preference for fluids and sweets. Ochetellus flavipes nesting habits are unique among Australian ants, and they construct small runways across the ground. These nests are structurally similar to nests built by some Polyrhachis ants, which construct platforms woven from plants that house the Hemiptera insects they attend to.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. On aworldwide basis epicormic resprouting after intense or {{crown fire}} is {{extremely}} rare, but {{is quite common}} in the <b>eucalypts.</b> Recent {{research has shown that}} the <b>eucalypts</b> have a highlymodified epicormic structure that provides the bud-forming tissues with excellent protection from heat. A small number of non-eucalypts from the Myrtaceae have also been recorded as post-fire epicormic resprouters and it was considered of interest to determinewhether this responsewas achieved through a similar or different structural adaptation. Leaf axils and epicormic structures of two species of Syncarpia and three species of Tristaniopsis were examined anatomically. Although the leaf axil anatomy of Syncarpia and Tristaniopsis was quite different (and {{different from that of the}} <b>eucalypts),</b> the epicormic structure was similar to that of the <b>eucalypts,</b> as the outer region of each epicormic strand possessed several strips of cells ofmeristematic appearance thatwere best developed in the innermost bark or even the outermost secondary xylem.
