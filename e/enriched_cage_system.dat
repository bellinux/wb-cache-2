40|$|AbstractConventional ‘battery’ cages for {{laying hens}} without perches, nests and litter {{areas have been}} banned by law {{throughout}} the European Union since 1 January 2012. As an alternative solution, enriched cage systems were introduced. Our aim was to investigate how many applications of litter substrate per day are necessary to motivate laying hens to perform dust bathing behaviour, {{and to what extent}} the hens use these offered litter areas in a species-appropriate manner. Each of the two consecutive experiments was conducted for 12 months, during which 20 (experiment 1) and 40 (experiment 2) laying hens of the strains Lohmann Selected Leghorn (LSL) and Lohmann Brown Classic (LB) were housed in 10 units of the <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> HÜK 125 / 80 (2 hens/unit [(experiment 1], 4 hens/unit [experiment 2], same strain per unit). In defined daily application frequencies from one to four times (11 : 00 a. m., 1 : 00 p. m., 3 : 00 p. m. and 5 : 00 p. m.) over the laying period, 50 g conventional feed per application were applied as litter substrate onto each 925 cm 2 sized mat. The hens were recorded weekly by digital video systems. Results showed that the mean duration of dust bathing behaviour lasted 05 : 58 min in experiment 1 and 04 : 59 min in experiment 2. Litter application frequency had a significant effect on the dust bathing duration as well in experiment 1 (P< 0. 05) as experiment 2 (P< 0. 01). For both experiments the number of dust baths increased with the maximum number of litter applications per day and this linear trend is significant for experiment 2 (P< 0. 001). A high percentage of interrupted and early terminated dust bathing bouts were observed, mostly induced by a conspecific. The mean interruption duration was 00 : 18 min for experiment 1 and 00 : 45 min for experiment 2. The daily litter application frequency had no significant effect on the duration of interruptions for neither experiment but on the number of interruptions. According to the results of this study, litter applications at least twice a day can be recommended, and sufficiently sized dust bathing mats should be offered to laying hens housed in cage systems.

The eggs were from the final laying hybrid ISA Brown reared in the <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> under experimental conditions. An age of laying hens was from 48 to 54 weeks. Egg weight and its components were measured on scales type KERN 440 - 35 N, with an accuracy of 0. 01 g and a maximum weight of 400 g. Egg white weight was calculated. The thickness and strength of the egg shell were measured from the dried samples at 55 °C. From each egg shell were cut 3 pcs of samples in the equatorial plane, one sample from the blunt end and one sample from the sharp end. Egg shell thickness was measured by test instrument SOME, type 60 / 0. 01 mm with a range of 0 - 10 mm. Egg shell strength was measured according to test instrument Instron with the small body, having a diameter 4. 48 mm to exert pressure on the egg shell. The obtained data were assessed in the program system SAS, version 8. 2. Based on the results observed in egg weight of our experiment we can conclude that in the group with share 5 % of rape cakes was non-statistically significant (p > 0. 05) decreased egg weight compared to the control group. Egg weight was reduced in the group with share 10 % of rape cakes, which confirmed a statistically significant difference compared to egg weight of control group (p ˂ 0. 05). The differences among experimental groups with share 5 % and 10 % of rape cakes in feed mixture and as well as to control group were not statistically significant (p > 0. 05) in weight of egg yolk, egg white, egg shell and egg shell strength.

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} {{the welfare of}} laying hens raised in battery cages {{have led to the}} development of <b>enriched</b> <b>cages</b> that allow hens to perform natural behaviors including nesting, roosting, and scratching. This study was conducted to compare indices of production and welfare in birds housed in 2 different <b>caging</b> <b>systems.</b> Shaver White hens were housed from 21 to 61 wk in either conventional battery cages (n = 500; 10 cages; 5 hens/cage; floor space = 561. 9 cm(2) /hen) or <b>enriched</b> <b>cages</b> (n = 480; 2 cages; 24 hens/cage; floor space = 642. 6 cm(2) /hen) and were replicated 10 times. <b>Enriched</b> <b>cages</b> provided hens with a curtained nesting area, scratch pad, and perches. Production parameters and egg quality measures were recorded throughout the experiment. Plumage condition was evaluated at 37 and 61 wk. Bone quality traits and immunological response parameters were measured at 61 wk, and 59 and 61 wk, respectively. Hen-day egg production, feed consumption, egg weight, and percentage of cumulative mortality of laying hens were not affected by the cage designs. Specific gravity and the percentage of cracked and soft-shelled eggs were also similar between the 2 housing systems. The incidence of dirty eggs was, however, significantly higher (P < 0. 0001) in <b>enriched</b> <b>cages</b> than in conventional cages. Feather scores were similar between birds except for the wing region, which was higher (P < 0. 05) for hens housed in conventional cages.

The research found that when comparing feed consumption, 16 bird densities having 144. 2 in. per bird reveal a significant difference at the 1 % level when compared to the remaining groups. Furthermore, feed to egg conversions for 16 birds cage densities reveal a significant difference at the 1 % level when compared to the other bird densities.

40|$|We {{tested the}} general {{assumption}} that enrichment {{of the housing}} environment is rewarding to laboratory rats, Rattus norvegicus. We used the behavioural response {{in anticipation of a}} forthcoming reward as a measure of the rewarding property of a simple <b>enriched</b> <b>cage.</b> For this, a Pavlovian conditioning schedule was applied to announce the oncoming transfer to an <b>enriched</b> <b>cage.</b> The response of rats in anticipation of this transfer was compared with that of rats that expected sexual contact, transfer to a standard cage or forced swimming. We also characterized the behavioural profile of the anticipatory response, because until now only general descriptions of this behaviour have been available. The strong increase in activity in anticipation of both an <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> and sexual contact and the similar response in terms of the behavioural elements analysed indicate that the appraisal of access to an <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> shares a common denominator with the perception of sexual contact. Because sexual contact is generally accepted to have highly rewarding properties to rats, we concluded that the <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> is highly rewarding as well. The anticipatory response for sexual contact or an <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> was clearly different from the anticipation for access to a standard cage or a forced swim session, indicating that the anticipatory response is related to the positive nature of the stimulus.

While adoption of <b>caging</b> <b>systems</b> with increased spatial complexity seems uncontroversial from a welfare perspective, effects of such housing on the development and task performance of experimental animals remains unclear. In this study, we investigate differences in key behaviours and cognitive performance between Lister Hooded rats housed in traditional (single-shelf) cages (‘basic’) and those housed in larger cages with an additional shelf (‘enriched’). We found minor differences in maternal behaviour, such as nursing and offspring development. Further, we compared task performance in females, using a hippocampus-dependent task (T-maze) and a hippocampus-independent task (Novel Object Recognition, NOR).

In this regard the introduction of efficient measures to reduce eggshell contamination by S.

The hot air pasteurization can be a viable alternative for the decontamination of the surface of the egg shell.

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop innovative techniques to remove surface contamination of shell eggs by hot air under natural or forced convection. Initially two simplified finite element models describing the thermal interaction between the air and egg were developed, respectively for the natural and forced convection. The numerical models were validated using an egg simulant equipped by type-K thermocouple (Chromel/Alumel). Once validated, the models allowed the selection of a thermal cycle with an inner temperature always lower than 55 °C. Subsequently a specific apparatus composed by two hot air generators, one cold air generator and rolling cylinder support, was built to physically condition the eggs. The decontamination power of the thermal treatments was evaluated on shell eggs experimentally inoculated with either Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and on shell eggs containing only the indigenous microflora. The applicability of treatments was further evaluated by comparing quality traits of treated and not treated eggs immediately after the treatment and after 28 days of storage at 20 °C.

In study I, it was shown that male Beagle dogs increased their activity (steps/hour) and frequency of active behaviours when they had access to an outdoor kennel compared to when they were kept only indoors. Male Sprague Dawley rats were kept in several alternative housing systems for 4 - 10 weeks; a furnished pen (study II), two or four connected Makrolon type IV <b>cages</b> (study III), <b>Enriched</b> Rat <b>Cage</b> <b>System</b> and Scantainer NOVO cages (study IV), in groups of four (study III) or eight (studies II-IV) with control rats either housed individually (study II) or in pairs (studies III, IV) in standard cages. In study III half of the number of rats from each cage was given moderate treadmill exercise. The cage types in study IV were also tested in Spontaneously Hypertensive rats. Compared to controls, pen-housed rats had lower body weight, increased muscle oxidative capacity and strength and a more diverse behavioural pattern. The treadmill-trained rats had lower exercise blood lactate levels and greater endurance, lower body weight and plasma insulin levels and a greater relative heart weight compared to controls. Rats living in groups of four or eight performed better in an exercise test, had more social interactions and showed more activity in the Elevated Plus Maze compared to controls (study III). In study IV, rats of both strains showed a higher home cage activity with a greater variety of active behaviours in the alternative cages. This resulted in a lower lactate response and a greater endurance in an exercise test in both strains. The hypertensive rat model was not affected by the increased activity.

Improvements are suggested for the housing systems {{as well as for the}} EU-egg code classifying systems. Housing systems should be designed according to the behavioural needs of the laying hen, as is done in the new Rondeel system in the Netherlands. Furthermore, each egg production company should be tested for laying hen welfare, and not for meeting the standard criteria of one of the housing systems. Thereby providing a more accurate estimation of the welfare of our egg producers for the consumer...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{selected}} enterprise indicators of laying were analyzed {{in terms of}} the impact of a hen housing system. For commercial egg production in the enterprise the laying hybrid Lohmann brown-LITE hen has been used since 2011. A total of 16 laying turns were included for the observation during the period of 20112014. Due to the sufficient number of data a nine-month laying batch has been chosen. The highest average number of eggs laid by one hen for the observation period was achieved in the Profit-Tier Layer <b>Cage</b> <b>System</b> by Big Dutchman (257. 0 pcs.). In the Laying battery <b>Cage</b> <b>System</b> by Kovobel the number of eggs was by 1. 3 pcs lower (255. 7 pcs). The lowest number of eggs was set down for laying hens kept in a <b>cage</b> free <b>systems</b> (249. 2 pcs). It was 7, 8 pcs and 6, 5 pcs lower respectively than with laying hens housed in the <b>cage</b> <b>systems</b> by Big Dutchman and Kovobel. The highest average intensity of laying for 9 -month laying period was found in the <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> by Big Dutchman (93. 9 %). In the <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> by Kovobel company it was 1. 0 % lower (92. 9 %). The intensity of laying at a <b>cage</b> free <b>system</b> amounted to 89. 2 % pcs. It was 4. 7 % and 3. 7 % respectively lower than when housed in the <b>cage</b> <b>systems</b> by Big Dutchman and Kovobel. For laying hens kept in a <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> the average consumption per hen in a day, for the observed period, was found out to be lower 117. 6 g for the <b>cage</b> <b>system</b> by Big Dutchman company and 117. 4 g for Kovobel. The highest average feed consumption showed 121. 5 g with laying hens kept in a <b>cage</b> free <b>system.</b> The average mortality of laying hens during the observed period was 0. 64 %...|$|R

Concentration of ammonia {{and greenhouse gases}} were investigated under the laboratory condition for hens breeding of <b>enriched</b> <b>cages,</b> in comparison with conventional breeding technology with exhaust air cross flow (1), technology for layered straw on to dropping belt (2) and technology with exhaust air under the cage’s grate (3) ...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{enrichment}} {{may affect}} infant care {{and development in}} captive primates. We investigated {{the effects of this}} factor in laboratory common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). An enriched physical environment enhanced the social activities of the marmosets and elicited a greater repertoire of behaviors, without negatively affecting the provision of infant care. In addition, infants in <b>enriched</b> <b>cages</b> displayed certain behaviors sooner than infants in non-enriched cages did, which suggests an increased developmental rate. Infants in <b>enriched</b> <b>cages</b> also ate more solid food and engaged in solitary play and exploration more than ones in non-enriched cages did. Play and exploration probably improve spatial cognition and motor skills, which, together with a higher degree of independence, may allow infants to cope better with laboratory routines and general social interactions later in life than their counterparts reared in less complex enclosures. We conclude that laboratories can significantly increase the welfare of marmosets by providing a more complex physical environment...|$|R
50|$|Standard {{laboratory}} cages prevent mice from performing several natural behaviours {{for which}} they are highly motivated. As a consequence, laboratory mice sometimes develop abnormal behaviours indicative of emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety. To improve welfare, these <b>cages</b> are sometimes <b>enriched</b> with items such as nesting material, shelters and running wheels. Sherwin and Olsson tested whether such enrichment influenced the consumption of Midazolam, a drug widely used to treat anxiety in humans. Mice in standard cages, standard cages but with unpredictable husbandry, or <b>enriched</b> <b>cages,</b> were given a choice of drinking either non-drugged water or a solution of the Midazolam. Mice in the standard and unpredictable cages drank a greater proportion of the anxiolytic solution than mice from <b>enriched</b> <b>cages,</b> presumably because they had been experiencing greater anxiety. Early studies indicated that autoimmune (MRL/lpr) mice readily consume solutions with cyclophosphamide, an immunosuppressive drug that prevents inflammatory damage to internal organs. However, further studies provided contradictory evidence.|$|R
40|$|When kept in barren and {{restrictive}} cages, animals frequently develop stereotypic behaviour {{patterns that}} {{are characterized by}} high repetition rates, conspicuous invariance and an apparent lack of function. Although millions of animals are affected, the underlying causes and mechanisms are still unclear. Growing evidence suggests that cage-induced stereotypies may reflect pathological dysfunction within basal ganglia circuitry expressed by perseverative behaviour. In order to assess whether variation in stereotypy performance and variation in perseverative behaviour may have a common cause in ICR CD- 1 mice, we assessed the effects of environmental enrichment on both phenomena. We raised 48 female ICR CD- 1 mice in standard or <b>enriched</b> <b>cages</b> from three weeks to either 6 or 11 months of age and measured stereotypy level in the home cage and perseveration on an extinction task. We further examined whether enriched rearing conditions (early enrichment) protect mice from the developing stereotypies later in life and whether stereotypies developed in barren cages would persist in an enriched environment (late enrichment) by transferring standard mice to <b>enriched</b> <b>cages</b> and vice versa for 14 weeks after completion of the extinction task. We found no evidence for a causal relation between stereotypy and perseveration in mice. However, transfer to <b>enriched</b> <b>cages</b> reduced stereotypy levels significantly both at 6 and 11 months of age indicating that stereotypies had not become established yet. Finally, we found that removing enrichments at both ages did not induce higher stereotypy levels, thereby confirming earlier reports of a neuroprotective effect of early enrichment...|$|R
40|$|Housing {{systems for}} laying hens {{have changed over}} the years due to {{increased}} public concern regarding animal welfare. In terms of sustainability, animal welfare is just one aspect that needs to be considered. Social aspects as well as environmental and economic factors need to be included as well. In this study, we assessed the sustainability of <b>enriched</b> <b>cage,</b> barn, free-range, and organic egg production systems following a predefined protocol. Indicators were selected within the social, environmental, and economic dimensions, after which parameter values and sustainability limits were set for the core indicators in order to quantify sustainability. Uncertainty in the parameter values as well as assigned weights and compensabilities of the indicators influenced the outcome of the sustainability assessment. Using equal weights for the indicators showed that, for the Dutch situation, <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> egg production was most sustainable, having the highest score on the environmental dimension, whereas free-range egg production gave the highest score in the social dimension (covering food safety, animal welfare, and human welfare). In the economic dimension both <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> egg and organic egg production had the highest sustainability score. When weights were attributed according to stakeholder outputs, individual differences were seen, but the overall scores were comparable to the sustainability scores based on equal weights. The provided method enabled a quantification of sustainability using input from stakeholders to include societal preferences in the overall assessment. Allowing for different weights and compensabilities helps policymakers in communicating with stakeholders involved and provides a weighted decision regarding future housing systems for laying hens...|$|R
