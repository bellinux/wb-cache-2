Here, we demonstrate that this effect can persist when the two parts of a <b>face</b> <b>are</b> separated by up to 80 ms of visual noise, showing that the parts of a face interact not only spatially but also temporally.

5|$|Behind {{schedule}} and over-budget, the production crew struggled to complete production {{in time for}} the already-announced premiere date that October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into the water with art director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft sank into 40–50 feet (12–15m) of water, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera for the full day's work. A few days later, Bianchi's driver fell asleep during the commute to a 6am shoot and crashed the car. The actress's <b>face</b> <b>was</b> bruised and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed for two weeks while the facial contusions healed.|$|E
5|$|Judy Taylor, {{author of}} several books about Potter and her works, observes that Potter had {{difficulty}} drawing the human form, and, {{as a result of her}} limitations, restricted depictions of Mr. McGregor in The Flopsy Bunnies to his hands and feet. Any awkwardness in their depictions was minimized by presenting his hands and feet in isolation and from the bunnies' point of view. In the few full-length illustrations of Mr. McGregor, the need to depict his <b>face</b> <b>was</b> eliminated by presenting him in the middle or far distance and from the rear.|$|E

40|$|Memory for in-group <b>faces</b> {{tends to}} <b>be</b> better than memory for out-group faces. Ackerman et al. (Psychological Science 17 : 836 – 840, 2006) {{found that this}} effect reverses when male faces display anger, {{supposedly}} due to their functional value in signaling intergroup threat. We explored the generalizability of this reverse effect. White participants viewed Black and White male or female faces displaying angry, fearful, or neutral expressions. Recognition accuracy for White male <b>faces</b> <b>was</b> better than for Black male <b>faces</b> when <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> neutral, but this reversed when the faces displayed anger or fear. For female targets, Black <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> generally better recognized than White faces, and female <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> better remembered when they displayed anger rather than fear, whereas male <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> better remembered when they displayed fear rather than anger. These findings are difficult to reconcile with a functional account and suggest (a) that the processing of male out-group <b>faces</b> <b>is</b> influenced by negative emotional expressions in general; and (b) that gender role expectations lead to differential remembering {{of male and female}} faces as a function of emotional expressio...|$|R
