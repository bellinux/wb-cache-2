5|$|<b>Gaelic</b> {{was still}} spoken widely on Arran at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. The 1901 Census reported 25–49 per cent <b>Gaelic</b> speakers on the eastern side of the island and 50–74 per cent on the western side of the island. By 1921 the proportion for the whole island had dropped to less than 25 per cent. However, Nils Holmer quotes the Féillire (a <b>Gaelic</b> almanack) reporting 4,532 inhabitants on the island in 1931 with 605 <b>Gaelic</b> speakers, showing that <b>Gaelic</b> had declined to about 13 per cent of the population. It continued to decline until the last native speakers of Arran <b>Gaelic</b> died in the 1990s. Current <b>Gaelic</b> speakers on Arran originate from other areas in Scotland. In 2011, 2.0 per cent of Arran residents aged three and over could speak <b>Gaelic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gigha has {{historically}} been a very strong <b>Gaelic</b> speaking area. Both in the 1901 and 1921 census, the island {{was reported to be}} over 75% <b>Gaelic</b> speaking. By 1971, it had dropped to the 25-49.9% range. In the 2001 census, the percentage of <b>Gaelic</b> speakers had dropped to 14%.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001 census, each island overall {{was over}} 50% <b>Gaelic</b> {{speaking}} – South Uist (71%), Harris (69%), Barra (68%), North Uist (67%), Lewis (56%) and Benbecula (56%). With 59.3% of <b>Gaelic</b> speakers or {{a total of}} 15,723 speakers, this made the Outer Hebrides the most strongly coherent <b>Gaelic</b> speaking area in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|South of Ardnamurchan, <b>Gaelic</b> {{place names}} are more common, {{and after the}} 13th century, <b>Gaelic</b> became the main {{language}} of the entire Hebridean archipelago. Due to Scots and English being favored in government and the educational system, the Hebrides {{have been in a}} state of diglossia since at least the seventeenth century. The Highland Clearances of the nineteenth century accelerated the language shift away from Scottish <b>Gaelic,</b> as did increased migration and the continuing lower status of <b>Gaelic</b> speakers. Nevertheless, as late {{as the end of the}} nineteenth century, there were significant populations of monolingual <b>Gaelic</b> speakers, and the Hebrides still contain the highest percentages of <b>Gaelic</b> speakers in Scotland. This is especially true of the Outer Hebrides, where a slim majority speak the language. The Scottish <b>Gaelic</b> college, Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, is based on Skye and Islay.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} modern era <b>Gaelic</b> had been in {{geographical}} decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands. The tradition of classic <b>Gaelic</b> poetry survived longer in Scotland than in Ireland, with the last fully competent member of the MacMhuirich dynasty, who were hereditary poets to the Lords of the Isles and then the Donalds of Clanranald, still working in the early eighteenth century. Nevertheless, interest in the sponsorship of panegyric <b>Gaelic</b> poetry was declining among the clan leaders. <b>Gaelic</b> was gradually being overtaken by Middle Scots, which became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. Middle Scots was derived substantially from Old English, with <b>Gaelic</b> and French influences. It was usually called Inglyshe and {{was very close to}} the language spoken in northern England, but by the sixteenth century it had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England. From the mid sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England. With the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came {{to be done in the}} English fashion.|$|E

5|$|Early <b>Gaelic</b> law tracts, first {{written down}} in the ninth century, reveal a society highly {{concerned}} with kinship, status, honour and the regulation of blood feuds. Scottish common law {{began to take shape}} {{at the end of the}} period, assimilating <b>Gaelic</b> and Celtic law with practices from Anglo-Norman England and the Continent. In the twelfth century, and certainly in the thirteenth, strong continental legal influences began to have more effect, such as Canon law and various Anglo-Norman practices. Pre-fourteenth century law among the native Scots is not always well attested, but extensive knowledge of early <b>Gaelic</b> Law gives some basis for its reconstruction. In the earliest extant Scottish legal manuscript, there is a document called Leges inter Brettos et Scottos. The document survives in Old French, and is almost certainly a French translation of an earlier <b>Gaelic</b> document. It retained a vast number of untranslated <b>Gaelic</b> legal terms. Later medieval legal documents, written both in Latin and Middle English, contain more <b>Gaelic</b> legal terms, examples including slains (Old Irish slán or sláinte; exemption) and cumherba (Old Irish comarba; ecclesiastic heir).|$|E
5|$|<b>Gaelic</b> football, hurling and {{handball}} are {{the best-known}} of the Irish traditional sports, collectively known as <b>Gaelic</b> games. <b>Gaelic</b> games {{are governed by}} the <b>Gaelic</b> Athletic Association (GAA), {{with the exception of}} ladies' <b>Gaelic</b> football and camogie (women's variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at the 82,500 capacity Croke Park in north Dublin. Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. During the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium in 2007–10, international rugby and soccer were played there. All GAA players, even at the highest level, are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gaelic</b> was the {{language}} of the bardic tradition, which provided a mechanism for the transference of oral culture from generation to generation. Members of bardic schools were trained in the complex rules and forms of <b>Gaelic</b> poetry. In a non-literate society they were the repositories of knowledge, including not just stories and songs, but also genealogies and medicine. They were found in many of the courts of the great lords, down to the chiefdoms of the highlands {{at the beginning of the}} period. The bardic tradition was not completely isolated from trends elsewhere, including love poetry influenced by continental developments and medical manuscripts from Padua, Salerno and Montpellier translated from Latin. The <b>Gaelic</b> oral tradition also began to manifest itself in written form, with the great compilation of <b>Gaelic</b> poetry, the Book of the Dean of Lismore produced by James and Duncan MacGregor at the beginning of the 16th century, probably designed for use in the courts of the greater chiefs. However, by the 15th century lowland writers were beginning to treat <b>Gaelic</b> as a second class, rustic and even amusing language, helping to frame attitudes towards the highlands and to create a cultural gulf with the lowlands.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Skye was {{overwhelmingly}} Gaelic-speaking, {{but this}} changed between 1921 and 2001. In both the 1901 and 1921 censuses, all Skye parishes {{were more than}} 75 per cent Gaelic-speaking. By 1971, only Kilmuir parish had more than three quarters <b>Gaelic</b> speakers {{while the rest of}} Skye ranged between 50 and 74 per cent. At that time, Kilmuir was the only area outside the Western Isles that had such a high proportion of <b>Gaelic</b> speakers. In the 2001 census Kilmuir had just under half <b>Gaelic</b> speakers, and overall, Skye had 31 per cent, distributed unevenly. The strongest <b>Gaelic</b> areas were in the north and south-west of the island, including Staffin at 61 per cent. The weakest areas were in the west and east (e.g. Luib 23 per cent and Kylerhea 19 per cent). Other areas on Skye ranged between 48 per cent and 25 per cent.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{linguists}} divide Celtic languages {{into two}} major groups, the P-Celtic, {{from which the}} Brythonic languages: Welsh, Breton, Cornish and Cumbric derive, and the Q-Celtic, from which come the Goidelic languages: Irish, Manx and <b>Gaelic.</b> The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script {{of their own and}} all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script. Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear, it belonged to the former group. Historical sources, as well as place name evidence, indicate {{the ways in which the}} Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by <b>Gaelic,</b> Old English and later Norse in this period. By the High Middle Ages the majority of people within Scotland spoke the <b>Gaelic</b> language, then simply called Scottish, or in Latin, lingua Scotica. The Kingdom of Alba was overwhelmingly an oral society dominated by <b>Gaelic</b> culture.

5|$|The Outer Hebrides have {{historically}} been a very strong Scottish <b>Gaelic</b> (Gàidhlig) speaking area. Both the 1901 and 1921 census reported that all parishes were over 75% <b>Gaelic</b> speaking, including areas of high population density such as Stornoway. However, the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 mandated English-only education, and is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. People still living can recall being beaten for speaking <b>Gaelic</b> in school.

5|$|There {{have been}} {{speakers}} of Goidelic languages in the Inner Hebrides {{since the time}} of Columba or before, and the modern variant of Scottish <b>Gaelic</b> (Gàidhlig) remains strong in some parts.

Children were being beaten for speaking <b>Gaelic</b> in school as late as the 1930s. More recently the <b>Gaelic</b> Language (Scotland) Act was enacted by the Scottish Parliament in 2005 in order to provide continuing support for the language.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no single}} British {{language}}, though English {{is by far the}} main language spoken by British citizens, being spoken monolingually by more than 70% of the UK population.

However, under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Welsh, Scottish <b>Gaelic,</b> Cornish, Irish <b>Gaelic,</b> Ulster Scots, Manx, and Lowland Scots languages are officially recognised as Regional or Minority languages by the UK Government. As indigenous languages which continue to be spoken as a first language by native inhabitants, Welsh and Scottish <b>Gaelic</b> have a different legal status from other minority languages. In some parts of the UK, some of these languages are commonly spoken as a first language; in wider areas, their use in a bilingual context is sometimes supported and/or promoted by central and/or local government policy.

5|$|As the {{tradition}} of classical <b>Gaelic</b> poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular <b>Gaelic</b> poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women, such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).|$|E

5|$|From {{the reign}} of David I (r. 1124–53), there is {{evidence}} of burghs, particularly on the east coast, which are the first identifiable towns in Scotland. Probably based on existing settlements, they grew in number and significance through the Medieval period. More than 50 royal burghs are known to have been established {{by the end of the}} thirteenth century and a similar number of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs were created between 1450 and 1516, acting as focal points for administration, as well as local and international trade. In the early Middle Ages the country was divided between speakers of <b>Gaelic,</b> Pictish, Cumbric and English. Over the next few centuries Cumbric and Pictish were gradually overlaid and replaced by <b>Gaelic,</b> English and Norse. From at least {{the reign of}} David I, <b>Gaelic</b> was replaced by French as the language of the court and nobility. In the late Middle Ages Scots, derived mainly from Old English, became the dominant language.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, Middle Scots, often simply called English, became the {{dominant}} {{language of the}} country. It was derived largely from Old English, {{with the addition of}} elements from <b>Gaelic</b> and French. Although resembling the language spoken in northern England, it became a distinct dialect from the late fourteenth century onwards. It began to be adopted by the ruling elite as they gradually abandoned French. By the fifteenth century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I onwards. As a result, <b>Gaelic,</b> once dominant north of the Tay, began a steady decline. Lowland writers began to treat <b>Gaelic</b> as a second class, rustic and even amusing language, helping to frame attitudes towards the highlands and to create a cultural gulf with the lowlands.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the name {{might be related to}} <b>Gaelic,</b> which would presumably have referred to the bishop's Scottish origins, though the legend gives him as a native Englishman.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that Ölvir may be an ancestor of the MacLeods. Until quite recently, it was commonly believed by historians that the eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods, Leod, {{was the son of}} Olaf the Black, King of Mann and the Isles. In the late 20th century, William Matheson proposed that the MacLeods descended in the male line from Ölvir Rósta, rather than Olaf the Black. Matheson proposed that, within several <b>Gaelic</b> pedigrees which record ancestors of Leod, the great-grandfather of Leod has <b>Gaelic</b> names which very likely represent the Old Norse name Ölvir. These <b>Gaelic</b> names are considered to equate to other <b>Gaelic</b> names found within the early bardic poetry of the MacLeods. About a century before, Thomas had noted the similarity in these names, when discussing Ölvir, but he did not pursue a specific link between Ölvir and the MacLeods. Matheson speculated that Leod's great-grandfather would have flourished at roughly the same time as when Ölvir is said to have fled to the Suðreyjar. Matheson noted that Leod's name is derived from the Old Norse name Ljótr: a name which Matheson considered to be rare in Scandinavia and Iceland, and even more so in Scotland. In consequence, he considered it significant that Ölvir's maternal grandfather (Ljótr 'Villain') also had this name. When comparing the relevant <b>Gaelic</b> pedigrees, Matheson noted that they were inconsistent in the generations preceding Leod's great-grandfather. In lieu of this, Matheson proposed that these inconsistencies may show that the Leod's great-grandfather was a newcomer to the Hebrides, like Ölvir.|$|E
