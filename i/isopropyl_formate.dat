The relative rate method has been also {{used to measure the}} room temperature rate coefficient for the reaction of Cl with the same esters. In addition, a series of runs conducted on the OH-initiated oxidation of <b>isopropyl</b> <b>formate,</b> isobutyl formate and n-propyl isobutyrate showed the formation of acetone from the three reactions. The formation of propanal was also observed for n-propyl isobutyrate...|$|E
