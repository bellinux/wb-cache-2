50|$|Hairlike {{pondweed}} {{is one of}} {{the more}} distinctive fine-leaved pondweeds due to the characteristically stiff leaves dominated by the midrib and open but tightly rolled stipules. However, it tends to be rarer than other fine-leaved species and often grows in mixed beds with other <b>fine-leaved</b> <b>water</b> plants such as P. pusillus and Zannichellia palustris, so it may be overlooked.|$|R
25|$|The {{most notable}} plant species {{are found in}} the alder {{woodland}} along the spring-lines on the lower valley slopes.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the possible use of plants to remediate polluted waters, a pot experiment {{was carried out}} in the laboratory with five wetland plant species, i. e., sharp dock (Polygonum amphibium L.), duckweed (Lemna minor L.), water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), <b>water</b> <b>dropwort</b> [Oenathe javanica (BL.) DC. ] and calamus [Lepironia articulata (RETZ.) DOMIN]. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and three heavy metals, cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb), were the objects of remediation. Sharp dock was found to be a good accumulator of N and P. Indeed, on a dry weight basis the shoots of sharp dock accumulated up to 6. 4 % of N and 1. 1 % of P with BCF (bioconcentration factor) values of 2235 and 1568, respectively. Water hyacinth and duckweed strongly accumulated Cd with concentrations of 462 and 14200 mg/kg, respectively, and BCF values of 1225 and 2567, respectively. <b>Water</b> <b>dropwort</b> achieved the highest concentrations of Hg, i. e., 1. 2 mg/kg with a BCF value of 807, whereas calamus achieved the highest concentrations of Pb, i. e., 512. 4 mg/kg in its roots with a BCF value of 1217. Thus, it could be concluded that the above plant species are good candidates for phytoremediation of polluted waters, as follows: sharp dock through accumulation of N and P in its shoots, water hyacinth and duckweed as hyperaccumulators of Cd, <b>water</b> <b>dropwort</b> as an hyperaccumulator of Hg and calamus as an hyperaccumulator of Pb...|$|R
5000|$|In 2009 {{scientists}} at the University of Eastern Piedmont in Italy wrote that they had identified hemlock <b>water</b> <b>dropwort</b> (Oenanthe crocata) as the plant historically responsible for producing the sardonic grin.

50|$|The {{species are}} {{abundant}} with variations from one meadow to the next. At {{the time of}} citation the meadows were reported as supporting some 75 meadow species, including some rarities such as corky-fruited <b>water</b> <b>dropwort.</b> The main grasses found are Yorkshire fog, meadow fescue, crested dog's-tail and meadow foxtail. The general meadow species found include great burnet, cowslip, devil's-bit scabious, saw-wort, lady's bedstraw and yellow rattle.|$|R
5000|$|Nabak-kimchi (...) is {{a watery}} kimchi, similar to dongchimi, in Korean cuisine.

5000|$|While {{many other}} species of <b>water</b> <b>dropwort</b> are {{extremely}} toxic, Oenanthe javanica is edible, and is cultivated in China, India, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand (ผักชีล้อม), Taiwan, and Vietnam, {{as well as in}} Italy, where its spring growths (called seri セリ in Japanese, minari [...] in Korean) are relished as a vegetable. It is one of the ingredients of the symbolic dish consumed in the Japanese spring-time festival, Nanakusa-no-sekku.|$|R
