40|$|Abstract—Research {{in damage}} of <b>gear</b> and <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> using {{vibration}} signals {{is still very}} attractive, because vibration signals from a <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> are complex in nature and not easy to interpret. Predicting <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> defects by analyzing changes in vibration signal of <b>gears</b> <b>pairs</b> in operation is a very reliable method. Therefore, a suitable vibration signal processing technique is necessary to extract defect information usually covered under noise of other <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> dynamic factors. This paper {{presents the results of}} an evaluation of vibration analysis techniques as a method for the <b>gear</b> and <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> condition assessment. The origin of vibration in <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> and useful definition of damage identification techniques are presented. The detection and assessment capability {{of some of the most}} effective vibration techniques are discussed and experimentally compared, concerning a multistage industrial gearbox. In particular, the results of estimated vibration signal processing techniques are compared. Advantages and disadvantages of estimated techniques having in mind specific limitation have been shown. Further research in damage identification of <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> have been pointed out.

40|$|Due to the {{irregularity}} of the I. C. engine torque, {{the impacts}} between the tooth of the unloaded <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> of a <b>gear</b> box produce vibrations originating an acoustic phenomenon, known as “gear rattle noise”. The paper presents a theoretical {{study on the}} dynamic behaviour of automotive transmissions focusing {{on the presence of}} oil between the impacting tooth of the meshing gears. This rattle phenomenon is particularly audible at low regimes and regards all the <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> different from the gear inserted to transmit the power. Another operating condition that manifests the gear rattle phenomenon is typically the “idle condition”, when all the <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> are meshing but without loading. The presence of oil between the impacting tooth of the <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> can play a positive role to decrease the vibrations and than the rattle noise level. In the paper some driveline complete models comprising many components as flywheel, clutch, primary and secondary shafts, are described accounting for the presence of oil lubricant between the teeth of the unloaded <b>gear</b> <b>pairs.</b> The described models consider an oil film lubrication between the tooth of the <b>gear</b> <b>pairs,</b> starting from the Reynolds equation and adopting some hypotheses regarding in particular the oil squeeze effect and also hypotheses about the teeth shape. Moreover some dissipative terms as friction and hysteresis in the clutch springs together with the oil drag torque in the gear box elements have been considered and modelled in the article...|$|R

A parameter design of cylinder <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> with small number of teeth was put forward, which was carried out by establishing a optimization model and selecting the preliminary parameters of <b>gear</b> <b>pairs,</b> and then adjusting the parameters according to the meshing interference conditions and the strength theory.

This situation is rectified by generalizing {{the concept of the}} transmission error of parallel-axis gears to a three-component transmission error for spiral bevel gears of nominal spherical involute design. A general relationship is derived which expresses the contributions to the three-component transmission error from each gear of a meshing spiral bevel pair as a linear transformation of the six coordinates that describe the deviation of the shaft centerline position of each <b>gear</b> of the <b>pair</b> from the position of its rigid perfect involute counterpart...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{article has}} carried out {{systematic}} {{research on the}} multi-tooth meshing problem of involute internal <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> with small tooth number difference of normal gear. It firstly establishes the entity assembly model of internal <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> with precise tooth profile, then determines the number of multi-tooth meshing teeth pairs with finite element software and finally analyzes the main factors and reason affecting the number of meshing teeth pairs. In the range of tooth number of internal gear equal to 40 - 200, the conclusion is that when tooth number difference equal to 1 the number of effective meshing teeth pairs is 3 - 15,when tooth number difference equal to 5 the number of effective meshing teeth pairs is 3 - 11. The main factors affecting the number of meshing teeth pairs are tooth number and tooth number difference. The fewer tooth number is and the greater tooth number difference is, the fewer the number of meshing teeth pairs is. The reason is that when tooth number is obviously reduced or tooth number difference is obviously increased, the clearance of adjacent gear surface will be greatly increased, which will cause the decrease {{of the number of}} meshing teeth pairs. Within the normal value scope of modification coefficient difference of involute internal <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> with small tooth number difference, the influence of modification coefficient difference and modification coefficient is very small. When the torque increases, the number of effective contacting teech pairs will keep unchanged. The research in this article provides reference for the calculation of loading capacity of multi-tooth meshing of internal <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> with small tooth number difference of normal gear...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical approach for lowering the outlet flow ripple of a crescent pump by applying a tandem crescent pump {{consisting of two}} <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> with an index angle between them. The outlet flow of the tandem pump is obtained by summing the flow produced by the two <b>gear</b> <b>pairs,</b> and the flow ripple of the tandem pump can be attenuated by properly selecting the design parameters {{in terms of the}} index angle and the displacement ratio between the two <b>gear</b> <b>pairs.</b> A lumped parameter model is presented for evaluating the crescent pump’s flow ripples, and experiments were performed on a single crescent pump to validate the model from the aspects of the steady-state flow-pressure characteristics and the outlet pressure ripples. In this way, the main causes of the flow ripple could be identified by comparing the kinematic flow with the actual flow evaluated by the model. Additionally, simulation results suggested that a tandem pump with an index angle of 13. 85 ° and displacement ratio of 0. 5 could lead to a more than 45 % decrease in the outlet flow ripple than a single pump with the same displacement {{in a wide range of}} operating conditions...|$|R
