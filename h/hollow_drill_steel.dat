40|$|This Master’s thesis {{has been}} {{performed}} in the <b>drill</b> <b>steel</b> production at Sandvik Materials Technology (SMT) in Sandviken. <b>Drill</b> <b>steel</b> is an important product for SMT and the demand has increased steadily {{over a long period}} and is also predicted to increase in the future. SMT has for a long time sought to increase the delivery precision of the delivered <b>drill</b> <b>steel.</b> The current delivery precision goal is to reach 95 per cent, which has not been achieved for a long time. SMT has also expressed an objective to obtain shorter lead times for the <b>drill</b> <b>steel</b> manufacturing chain, from raw material to customer, which historically has been estimated at eight weeks. The {{purpose of this study is}} to, through the execution of value stream mapping, identify suggestions for improvement that can make the production and planning process more efficient at a manufacturing company. The methods used to perform this Master’s thesis are literary studies, observations and interviews. In addition to this forecasting, ordering and delivery data collected through the systems used at SMT and also information about cycle times for the constituent processes of the <b>drill</b> <b>steel</b> flow have been gathered. The most influential theories used in this thesis, which also the authors consistently had in mind, are Lean Production, value stream mapping, inventory management principles, line balancing and SMED. The completed mapping of the company’s situation and the analysis show that customer forecasting and ordering patterns do not match for various reasons and that the balance of the <b>drill</b> <b>steel</b> flow is not optimal. On this basis, a number of improvement proposals have been established which include changes related to how the products held in stock should be controlled, how the rolling mill planning should be conducted and how the balance of the <b>drill</b> <b>steel</b> flow should be improved through increased capacity and more stable processes. The study indicates that the delivery accuracy, after implementation of the developed proposals for improvements, could be improved significantly. Throughput time for all the products could be reduced and the stability and efficiency in the production flow could increase. In addition to this, an implementation could potentially lead to lesser variations between forecasts and order quantities. Validerat; 20110217 (anonymous...|$|R
50|$|Paper drills are {{machines}} {{similar to}} a drill press that use <b>hollow</b> <b>drill</b> bits to drill through stacks of paper.

40|$|An {{in-depth}} look at {{percussive drilling}} shows that the transmission efficiency is very important; however, data for percussive drilling in hard rock or permafrost is rarely available or the existing data are very old. Transmission efficiency {{can be used as}} a measurement of the transmission of the energy in the piston to the <b>drill</b> <b>steel</b> or bit and from the bit to the rock. Having a plane and centralized impact of the piston on the <b>drill</b> <b>steel</b> can optimize the transmission efficiency from the piston to the <b>drill</b> <b>steel.</b> A transmission efficiency of near 100 % between piston and <b>drill</b> <b>steel</b> is possible. The transmission efficiency between bit and rock is dependent upon the interaction within the entire system. The main factors influencing this transmission efficiency are the contact area between cutting structure and surrounding rock (energy loss due to friction heat), damping characteristics of the surrounding rock (energy dampening), and cuttings transport. Some of these parameters are not controllable. To solve the existing void regarding available drilling data, an experiment for gathering energy data in permafrost for percussive drilling was designed. Fifteen artificial permafrost samples were prepared. The samples differed in the grain size distribution to observe a possible influence of the grain size distribution on the drilling performance. The samples were then manually penetrated (with a sledge-hammer) with two different spikes...|$|R

40|$|Among {{underground}} coal miners, {{hearing loss}} {{remains one of}} the most common occupational illnesses. In response to this problem, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) conducts research to reduce the noise emission of underground coal-mining equipment, an example of which is a roof bolting machine. Field studies show that, on average, drilling noise is the most significant contributor to a roof bolting machine operator's noise exposure. NIOSH OMSHR has determined that the <b>drill</b> <b>steel</b> and chuck are the dominant sources of drilling noise. NIOSH OMSHR, Corry Rubber Corporation, and Kennametal, Inc. have developed a bit isolator that breaks the steel-to-steel link between the drill bit and <b>drill</b> <b>steel</b> and a chuck isolator that breaks the mechanical connection between the <b>drill</b> <b>steel</b> and the chuck, thus reducing the noise radiated by the <b>drill</b> <b>steel</b> and chuck, and the noise exposure of the roof bolter operator. This paper documents the evolution of the bit isolator and chuck isolator including various alternative designs which may enhance performance. Laboratory testing confirms that production bit and chuck isolators reduce the A-weighted sound level generated during drilling by 3. 7 to 6. 6 dB. Finally, this paper summarizes results of a finite element analysis used to explore the key parameters of the drill bit isolator and chuck isolator to understand the impact these parameters have on noise.

The morphology and composition of the corrosion products were analyzed as well. It was found that the average corrosion rate of the two types of steel increased with increasing temperature of the corrosive medium, with the corrosion rate to decrease slightly within 60 ℃- 80 ℃ and keep almost unchanged above 120 ℃. At the same time, the corrosion rate of the <b>drill</b> pipe <b>steels</b> {{had little to do with}} the flow rate but increased with decreasing pH value of the corrosive medium.

The tool life of the TiN coated drill was only 81. 5 % of TiCN, and 66 % of TiAlN because of its low oxidization resistance and hardness.

40|$|Among {{underground}} coal miners, {{hearing loss}} {{remains one of}} the most common occupational illnesses. In response, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts research to reduce the noise emission of various underground coal mining equipment, an example of which is a roof bolting machine (RBM). After the removal of coal or rock, the remaining strata may be subject to fall, either from overhead (the roof) or from the side (the rib). One method used in underground coal-mines to prevent failures requires the installation of roof bolts. The roof bolting machine operator trams the machine to the required location, drills a hole into the strata, and then installs a roof bolt, supporting the roof or the rib, as the case may be. Field studies support the premise that, on average, drilling noise is the loudest noise that a roof bolting machine operator would be exposed to and contributes significantly to the operators 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 noise exposure.
