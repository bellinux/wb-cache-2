25|$|Peru is {{investigating}} claims that a beauty pageant contestant was lured to Gabon {{to become the}} lover of its 67-year-old president, Omar Bongo, and was stranded for nearly two weeks after she refused. A spokesman for Mr. Bongo said {{he was unaware of}} the allegations. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry said that Ivette Santa Maria, a 22-year-old Miss Peru America contestant, was invited to Gabon to be a hostess for a pageant there. In an interview, Ms. Santa Maria said that she was taken to Mr. Bongo's presidential palace hours after her Jan. 19 arrival and that as he joined her, he pressed a button and some sliding doors opened, revealing a large bed. She said, I told <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not a prostitute, that I was a Miss Peru. She fled and guards offered to drive her to a hotel. Without money to pay the bill, however, she was stranded in Gabon for 12 days until international women's groups and others intervened.|$|E
500|$|It {{was normal}} for Shaftesbury to {{occasionally}} disappear {{for a few}} days from time to time, so no one, other than his girlfriend was initially concerned with his disappearance. [...] "Anthony didn’t answer his telephone anymore. I was worried," [...] she says, [...] "I called again. I called England. This wasn’t like <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sure that something bad had happened." ...|$|E

He almost fell out of his chair when I told <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> only 18." [...] Molly Ringwald had also wanted to play Sloane, but {{according}} to Ringwald, [...] "John wouldn't let me do it: he said that the part wasn't big enough for me." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{fundamental}} {{thought of}} Pauline mysticism runs thus: in {{the mystery of}} [...] "I am in Christ; in <b>Him</b> <b>I</b> know myself as a being who is raised above this sensuous, sinful, and transient world and already belongs to the transcendent; in <b>Him</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> assured of resurrection; in <b>Him</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a Child of God." ...|$|R

500|$|In 1892, Warner {{returned}} to Springville {{and began to}} use his cowboy experience to [...] gamble on horse races. Although he {{had no interest in}} college, soon after coming back he was practically forced to attend Cornell University's law school, as he lost all of his money at the races. Later Warner wrote [...] "I dare not write to my father and tell <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> broke" [...] he felt {{that the only way to}} get funds was to inform his father that he decided to study law. His father, who had always wanted him to be a lawyer, sent him $100 (approximately $2,500 in 2016).|$|E
500|$|Dylan first {{performed}} [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] {{in public}} on December 4, 1965, at the Berkeley Community Theatre. Present at this concert was Joan Baez, who believed the lyrics referred to her. She said, [...] "He'd just written 'Visions of Johanna', which sounded very suspicious to me...he'd never performed it before and Neuwirth told <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{there that night}} and he performed it." [...] Heylin suggests that if Dylan performed it for anyone that night it was Allen Ginsberg, who was also present. Heylin argues Dylan considered Ginsberg {{to be an important}} influence on his songwriting at this juncture, and was keen to showcase the song for the Beat poet.|$|E
500|$|AIP heads Arkoff and Nicholson had {{originally}} contributed their {{portion of the}} budget as a tax write-off, but when they were screened the completed film they were astonished by its quality. Nicholson told Louis Heyward, [...] "It {{is one of the}} best we have gotten from England. Everybody thinks this is about the best production in the Poe series for the past few years." [...] Arkoff noted that [...] "Michael Reeves brought out some elements in Vincent that hadn't been seen in a long time. Vincent was more savage in the picture. Michael really brought out the balls in <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> surprised how terrifying Vincent was in that... I hadn't expected it." ...|$|E

500|$|Carradine {{formed an}} acting company {{that he called}} Kansas Flyer', a metaphor for a check that bounces." [...] He {{acquired}} a broken-down carousel in a junk yard in Los Angeles, and some broken horses in Kansas City. He and his entourage then headed for Drury, Kansas. The original working title of the film was Around. While exploring film title designs for the picture, Carradine came across a style called Americana. [...] "I {{was trying to figure}} out what it would look like if it said Around. Suddenly, I said to myself, 'Why am I doing this, anyway? It's right here in front of me.' I called up the title designer and told <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> changing the title to Americana." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Gunn's two-year-old daughter, Francesca, was {{diagnosed}} with leukaemia. Norwich City fans were at first astonished {{by the sight of}} the goalkeeper running out with a completely shaven head. In the words of author and Norwich supporter, Kevin Baldwin, [...] "Occasionally, the gap between the crowd and the players can cause unfortunate misunderstandings. A few months ago, Gunn shaved his head and we all laughed at <b>him</b> ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> especially keen ... to shout [...] "Baldy!" ... It now turns out that his daughter was undergoing chemotherapy at the time, which made her hair fall out. He shaved his head to show her that this was nothing to be ashamed of. Sorry, Bryan." [...] When news spread of the reason for Gunn's shaven head, he received [...] "support from the whole of the sporting world and the people of Norfolk".|$|E
500|$|Santoro was {{recommended}} by Paulo Autran, who acted {{along with him}} in the TV series Hilda Furacão. After seeing Santoro's acting, he was Bodanzky's first choice for Neto's role; [...] "I never even thought of another person. ... When I saw <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> impressed with his giving of himself to the role/character. I knew that Neto was him." [...] Santoro read the book and was [...] "shocked," [...] which led him to contact Carrano; after talking to the author, he was convinced to take the role. He found the story [...] "very moving, but kind of over the top," [...] and was worried about overacting and making the character [...] "fake." [...] To prepare himself for the role, he talked with interns and watched productions on the subject, among them the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Miloš Forman.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{they have}} evidently been {{very kind to}} <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so {{grateful}} for that that <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> sorry to do the man any harm." ...|$|R

500|$|Klowden {{recalled}} {{later that}} [...] "he was very {{down in the}} dumps about his wife. [...] He told me how he had met Northrup. He said {{he went to a}} party and got drunk and when he {{woke up in the morning}} he found Northrup was in bed with him. He was having a lot of problems with her. I remember he said to me I was the only person he knew who would set up a white silk tent for <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rather surprised when we were driving back to LA on Sunday evening, he stopped at a florist to buy some flowers for his wife." [...] In November 1950, Northrup attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills. Hubbard blamed Klowden for the suicide bid and told her to forget about him and the Foundation, but resumed the affair with her again within a month.|$|E
500|$|Membership in the Sex Pistols had a {{progressively}} destructive {{effect on}} Vicious. As Lydon later observed, [...] "Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly {{he was a}} big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the right places, adoration. That's what it all meant to Sid." [...] Westwood had already been feeding him material, like a tome on Charles Manson, likely to encourage his worst instincts. Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York. Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional codependency between the couple alienated Vicious from {{the other members of the}} band. Lydon later wrote, [...] "We did everything to get rid of Nancy.... She was killing <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> absolutely convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission.... Only she didn't want to go alone. She wanted to take Sid with her.... She was so utterly fucked up and evil." [...] Lydon also admits to regretting introducing the two in The Filth and the Fury.|$|E
500|$|Usher's stage {{performances}} {{have been}} complimented by critics for being [...] "packed with high-octane choreography {{held together by}} sleek, masterful showmanship", and his engaging skill with audiences being [...] "enough {{to pull off a}} one-man show". His performances and dancing technique have often marked comparisons to his influences Michael Jackson and James Brown. He told People Magazine in 2008 that [...] "James Brown introduced me to soul. Because of <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> given a clear view of what a real performance is and should be. I learned showmanship from him." [...] On his 8701 Evolution Tour in 2002, Larry Nager of The Cincinnati Enquirer hailed Usher's simultaneous ability, stating [...] "the 23-year-old Atlantan proved you can sing and dance at the same time. Of course, that's how James Brown, Jackie Wilson and Usher's most obvious role model Michael Jackson did it, but in today's high-tech, gimmicky concerts, it's a lost art", and claims his show [...] "ended the reign of 'Nsync, Britney {{and the rest of the}} lip-synching, teen-pop acts". Usher performed singles [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] and [...] "Yeah!" [...] at 2004 MTV Video Music Awards under a rain machine, in which he eventually threw the mic stand at a mirror during the former. Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 of their [...] "20 Best MTV VMAs Opening Performances". Chad Batka for The New York Times said [...] "He has established himself as one of R's supreme performers and craftsmen, following through on what he learned from Michael Jackson in particular: songs that alternate between choppy and smooth, vocals punctuated by exultant high whoops, a dance vocabulary." [...] Capable of playing the piano, Usher also began to adopt playing on other instruments such as the drums and the bass guitar, amid singles [...] "Good Kisser" [...] and [...] "She Came to Give It to You" [...] in 2014. The UR Experience Tour was reported to have consisted of a nine-piece band and three backing vocalists according to Billboard, in which The Guardian called him [...] "a masterful all-rounder who surrounds himself with talent on stage". Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone labels him the [...] "Award Show King", explaining [...] "His dedication to choreography dates back to the days when Janet Jackson made videos that looked like they were shot in one take. He's an entertainer that would have been stunning at any point in the last 60 years of television." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 11 October 2008, David Baddiel co-hosted Brand's show. Baddiel {{recalled}} having met Georgina Baillie at Brand's {{home and}} {{being told that}} her grandfather was actor Andrew Sachs. According to Baddiel, Baillie said [...] "Don't tell <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> here!" ...|$|E

2500|$|We'd had {{a falling}} out, I just didn't {{have time for}} <b>him</b> ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like, [...] "Fuck that guy". But he was softer—he doesn't drink alcohol anymore. He's still gnarly and idealistic and brutal but minus the alcohol that makes him this focused machine. It was just the perfect meeting of {{what we wanted to}} do and having the right guy to do it with.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} for [...] "Hotspur" [...] magazine, Merv reveals he has supported Tottenham Hotspur since the early 1980s. [...] "I went to a mate's house to watch the FA Cup Final, everyone {{in the house was}} supporting the other team except the guy I sat next to. He was English, and I told <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> with him 100 per cent. Spurs won and I've supported them ever since." ...|$|E
