500|$|If consumed, {{most of the}} {{americium}} is excreted {{within a}} few days, with only 0.05% absorbed in the blood, of which roughly 45% [...] goes to the liver and 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. The uptake to the liver depends on the individual and increases with age. In the bones, americium is first deposited over cortical and trabecular surfaces and slowly redistributes over the bone with time. The biological half-life of 241Am is 50 years in the bones and 20 years in the liver, whereas in the gonads (testicles and ovaries) it remains permanently; in all these organs, americium promotes <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> cells {{as a result of}} its radioactivity.|$|E

50|$|Histone {{methylation}} generally causes {{genes to}} turn off. Methylation of histones {{is also important}} for maintaining heterochromatin boundaries and a misregulation can lead to over expression or under expression of genes. This over expression or under expression {{can lead to the}} <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> cells within an organism. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, demethylation causes genes to turn on. This activation can be just as detrimental to cells, as their processes are disrupted by unnecessary gene products. Most histone methylation occurs in the promotor region, and is similar to cytosine methylation in process and function.|$|E
50|$|A {{carcinogen}} is any substance, radionuclide, or {{radiation that}} promotes carcinogenesis, the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> This {{may be due}} to the ability to damage the genome or to the disruption of cellular metabolic processes. Several radioactive substances are considered carcinogens, but their carcinogenic activity is attributed to the radiation, for example gamma rays and alpha particles, which they emit. Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke. Although the public generally associates carcinogenicity with synthetic chemicals, it is equally likely to arise in both natural and synthetic substances. Carcinogens are not necessarily immediately toxic; thus, their effect can be insidious.|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of Mycoplasma was first reported in samples of cancer {{tissue in the}} 1960s. Since then, several studies tried to find and prove the connection between Mycoplasma and cancer, {{as well as how}} the bacterium might be involved in the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> Several studies have shown that cells that are chronically infected with the bacteria go through a multistep transformation. The changes caused by chronic mycoplasmal infections occur gradually and are both morphological and genetic. The first visual sign of infection is when the cells gradually shift from their normal form to sickle-shaped. They also become hyperchromatic due to an increase of DNA in the nucleus of the cells. In later stages, the cells lose the need for a solid support to grow and proliferate, as well as the normal contact-dependent inhibition cells.|$|E
50|$|HDR is {{important}} for suppressing the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> HDR maintains genomic stability by repairing broken DNA strands; it {{is assumed to be}} error free because of the use of a template. When a double strand DNA lesion is repaired by NHEJ there is no validating DNA template present so it may result in a novel DNA strand formation with loss of information. A different nucleotide sequence in the DNA strand results in a different protein expressed in the cell. This protein error may cause processes in the cell to fail. For example, a receptor of the cell that can receive a signal to stop dividing may malfunction, so the cell ignores the signal and keeps dividing and can form a cancer. The importance of HDR {{can be seen from the}} fact that the mechanism is conserved throughout evolution. The HDR mechanism has also been found in more simple organisms, such as yeast.|$|E
50|$|Heightened {{expression}} of HMGA2 {{is found in}} a variety of human cancers, but the precise mechanism by which HMGA2 contributes to the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> is unknown. The same mutations that lead to pituitary adenomas in mice can be found in similar cancers in humans. Its presence is associated with poor prognosis for the patient, but also with sensitization of the cancer cells to certain forms of cancer therapy. To be specific, HMGA2-high cancers display an abnormally strong response to double strand breaks in DNA caused by radiation therapy and some forms of chemotherapy. Artificial addition of HMGA2 to some forms of cancer unresponsive to DNA damage cause them to respond to the treatment instead, although the mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs is also not understood. However, the {{expression of}} HMGA2 is also associated with increased rates of metastasis in breast cancer, and both metastasis and recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma. These properties are responsible for patients' poor prognoses. As with HMGA2's effects on the response to radiation and chemotherapy, the mechanism by which HMGA2 exerts these effects is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Oncogenesis is {{the process}} by which normal cells acquire the {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> cells leading to the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>cancer</b> or tumor (see: tumorigenesis). It is characterized by a molecular reprogramming of a cell to undergo uninhibited cell division, allowing the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a malignant mass.

40|$|Despite {{significant}} advancements in {{our understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> development, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> liver <b>cancer</b> remain largely unknown. C/EBPα is a transcription factor that regulates liver quiescence. Phosphorylation of C/EBPα at serine 193 (S 193 -ph) is upregulated in older mice and is thought to contribute to age-associated liver dysfunction. Because development of liver tumors is associated with increasing age, we investigated the role of S 193 -ph in the development <b>of</b> liver <b>cancer</b> using knockin mice expressing a phospho-mimetic aspartic acid residue in place of serine at position 193 (S 193 D) of C/EBPα. The S 193 D isoform of C/EBPα was able to completely inhibit liver proliferation in vivo after partial hepatectomy. However, treatment of these mice with diethylnitrosamine/phenobarbital (DEN/PB), which induces <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> liver <b>cancer,</b> actually resulted in earlier development of liver tumors. DEN/PB treatment was associated with specific degradation of both the S 193 -ph and S 193 D isoforms of C/EBPα through activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The mechanism of UPS-mediated elimination of C/EBPα during carcinogenesis involved elevated levels of gankyrin, a protein that was found {{to interact with the}} S 193 -ph isoform of C/EBPα and target it for UPS-mediated degradation. This study identifies a molecular mechanism that supports the development <b>of</b> liver <b>cancer</b> in older mice and potential therapeutic targets for the prevention <b>of</b> liver <b>cancer...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} genetic {{mutation}} (found in 80-90% of epithelioid sarcomas) is the inactivation of the SMARCB1 gene, or {{the loss of}} INI-1 function, which {{is thought to be}} a major contributor to disease progression. Epithelioid sarcoma typically contains chromosome 22q11.2 mutations or deletions and 8q gains, particularly i(8) (>q10). Aberrations of 18q and 8q, as well as recurrent gains at 11q13, have also been observed. The SMARCB1 gene (also termed BAF47, INI1, or hSNF5) is located on chromosome 22q11.2 and codes for a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Loss of SMARCB1 function is the most common genetic mutation observed in epithelioid sarcoma, and this dysfunction is likely a major driver of disease progression. SMARCB1 is a core protein subunit of the 15 subunit SWI/SNF (or BAF) complex involved in regulating the nucleosome architecture of our genome and {{has been shown to be}} a potent tumor suppressor gene, meaning that its primary role is to control cell division and to even halt division under appropriate circumstances (i.e. signals to over-replicate). As this tumor suppressor is commonly inactivated in epithelioid sarcoma, cell division can fail to appropriately halt, resulting in unregulated cellular growth and the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> tumors. Several research teams are currently developing techniques to reverse this loss of genetic function characteristic of epithelioid sarcoma.|$|E
5000|$|Tumours {{are formed}} by carcinogenesis, {{a process in}} which {{cellular}} alterations lead to the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer.</b> Multistage carcinogenesis involves the sequential genetic or epigenetic changes to a cell's DNA, where each step produces a more advanced tumour. It is often broken down into three stages; initiation, promotion and progression, and several mutations may occur at each stage. Initiation is where the first genetic mutation occurs in a cell. Promotion is the clonal expansion (repeated division) of this transformed cell into a visible tumour that is usually benign. Following promotion, progression may take place where more genetic mutations are acquired in a sub-population of tumor cells. Progression changes the benign tumor into a malignant tumor. A prominent and well studied example of this phenomenon is the tubular adenoma, a common type of colon polyp which is an important precursor to colon cancer. The cells in tubular adenomas, like most tumors which frequently progress to cancer, show certain abnormalities of cell maturation and appearance collectively known as dysplasia. These cellular abnormalities are not seen in benign tumors that rarely or never turn cancerous, but are seen in other pre-cancerous tissue abnormalities which do not form discrete masses, such as pre-cancerous lesions of the uterine cervix. Some authorities prefer to refer to dysplastic tumors as [...] "pre-malignant", and reserve the term [...] "benign" [...] for tumors which rarely or never give rise to cancer.|$|E
