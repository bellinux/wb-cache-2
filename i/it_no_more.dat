5|$|Further {{action was}} not taken until 1902, when new {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the Government Gazette. A new Prison Act was passed in 1903, replacing sixteen previous acts. It provided for classification of prisoners, provision of adequate work for prisoners, and the creation of the position of comptroller general of prisons, to assume the functions the sheriff had undertaken as inspector of prisons. While in theory the passing of the act should have been a landmark moment in prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document. Other problems included Fremantle Prison's inscrutability for classification, due to its design, and that the sheriff was allowed to hold the office of comptroller general of prisons, effectively making <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than a change in name.|$|E

25|$|Under the Shutrukids (c. 1210 – 1100), the Elamite empire {{reached the}} height of its power. Shutruk-Nakhkhunte and his three sons, Kutir-Nakhkhunte II, Shilhak-In-Shushinak, and Khutelutush-In-Shushinak were capable of {{frequent}} military campaigns into Kassite Babylonia (which was also being ravaged by the empire of Assyria during this period), {{and at the same}} time were exhibiting vigorous construction activity—building and restoring luxurious temples in Susa and across their Empire. Shutruk-Nakhkhunte raided Babylonia, carrying home to Susa trophies like the statues of Marduk and Manishtushu, the Manishtushu Obelisk, the Stele of Hammurabi and the stele of Naram-Sin. In 1158 BC, after much of Babylonia had been annexed by Ashur-Dan I of Assyria and Shutruk-Nakhkhunte, the Elamites defeated the Kassites permanently, killing the Kassite king of Babylon, Zababa-shuma-iddin, and replacing him with his eldest son, Kutir-Nakhkhunte, who held <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than three years before being ejected by the native Akkadian speaking Babylonians. The Elamites then briefly came into conflict with Assyria, managing to take the Assyrian city of Arrapha (modern Kirkuk) before being ultimately defeated and having a treaty forced upon them by Ashur-Dan I.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{reviewing}} the New York production generally gave it poor reviews. [...] Ben Brantley of The New York Times applauded the creative team's [...] "honorable intentions" [...] in bringing back a work {{thought to be}} [...] "terminally out-of-date", but felt both the new Mei-li and the show in general lacked personality. [...] Howard Kissel of the New York Daily News termed it [...] "an entertaining, albeit vulgar revival", and Clive Barnes of the New York Post found <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> memorable than the earlier version. [...] The review in Talkin' Broadway is scathing, criticizing Hwang's use of the songs and characters, and the orchestrations, and commenting: [...] "Hwang's book lacks much of the charm, warmth, and wit of the original, and never takes the high road where the low road will do. ... Hwang {{felt it necessary to}} reduce the original, uniquely colorful story into just another backstager with a love triangle and lame jokes." [...] Michael Kuchwara commented about Harvard in his lukewarm review for Associated Press: [...] "Then there's Linda Low's gay confidante, Harvard. [...] Talk about stereotypes. [...] If you are going to perpetuate one at least give him better jokes." [...] On the other hand, both USA Today and Time magazine gave it positive reviews. [...] The CurtainUp review was mostly positive and observed that Hwang and Longbottom [...] "were able to keep numbers like 'Chop Suey' and milk it for its razzle-dazzle fun while using its condescending stereotyping as a springboard to satirize attitudes towards Asians." [...] Brantley disagreed, writing, [...] "because the show's satiric point of view is so muddled, there's no verve in such numbers, no joy in the performing of them." ...|$|E

After one erection, that’s <b>it.</b> <b>No</b> <b>more.</b> Without Viagra, it’s even more difficult." [...] Despite one of its representatives Luz Ilagan once stated that the people should focus on his track record and not on his womanizing ways, GABRIELA national chairperson Emmi de Jesus reiterated its stance against Duterte.|$|E

Later, refusing to bow to York, Clifford exclaims [...] "May that ground gape and swallow me alive/Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father" [...] (1.1.162–163). The murder of Rutland is particularly important in terms of Clifford's pursuit of vengeance, as the scene is punctuated with a debate about the limits and moral implications of exacting revenge on someone who did no wrong in the first place; ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1950, the Almanacs were reconstituted as the Weavers, {{named after}} the title of an 1892 play by Gerhart Hauptmann about a workers' strike (which {{contained}} the lines, [...] "We'll stand <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>more,</b> come what may!"). They did benefits for strikers at which they sang songs such as 'Talking Union', about the struggles for unionisation of industrial workers such as miners and auto mobile workers. Besides Pete Seeger (performing under his own name), members of the Weavers included charter Almanac member Lee Hays, Ronnie Gilbert, and Fred Hellerman; later Frank Hamilton, Erik Darling, and Bernie Krause serially took Seeger's place. In {{the atmosphere of the}} 1950s red scare, the Weavers' repertoire had to be less overtly topical than that of the Almanacs had been, and its progressive message was couched in indirect language—arguably rendering it even more powerful. The Weavers on occasion performed in tuxedos (unlike the Almanacs, who had dressed informally) and their managers refused to let them perform at political venues. The Weavers' string of major hits began with [...] "On Top of Old Smoky" [...] and an arrangement of Lead Belly's signature waltz, [...] "Goodnight, Irene", which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950 and was covered by many other pop singers. On the flip side of [...] "Irene" [...] was the Israeli song [...] "Tzena, Tzena, Tzena". Other Weaver hits included [...] "Dusty Old Dust" [...] ("So Long It's Been Good to Know You" [...] by Woody Guthrie), [...] "Kisses Sweeter Than Wine" [...] (by Hays, Seeger, and Lead Belly), and the South African Zulu song by Solomon Linda, [...] "Wimoweh" [...] (about Shaka), among others.|$|E
