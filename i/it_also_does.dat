5|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies O. g. gloveri has a {{dark gray}} cheek and smoky yellow rostrum. O. g. brookei has an orange russet tipped nose, and light gray spotted above the eyes. The Glover's pika {{is similar to}} the Chinese red pika, but it is distinguished by its smaller auditory bullae, more slender rostrum, and longer nasals than the Chinese red pika. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not have the reddish mantle as possessed by the Chinese red pika.|$|E
5|$|For the {{purposes}} of this list, inventions are regarded as technological firsts developed in China, and as such does not include foreign technologies which the Chinese acquired through contact, such as the windmill from the Middle East or the telescope from early modern Europe. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not include technologies developed elsewhere and later invented separately by the Chinese, such as the odometer and chain pump. Scientific, mathematical or natural discoveries, changes in minor concepts of design or style and artistic innovations do not appear on the list.|$|E
5|$|The party {{supports}} {{an increase}} in police forces, and more visible police on the streets. It wants to implement tougher punishments, especially for crime regarding violence and morality offences. The party also wants to establish an ombudsman for victims and relatives, as it believes today's supportive concern focus {{too much on the}} criminals rather than the victims. It wants the police {{to be able to use}} more non-lethal weapons, such as electroshock weapons. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not accept any use of religious or political symbols with the police uniform, and wants to expel foreign citizens who are convicted of crime with a frame of more than three months imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|The tree prefers {{moist and}} loamy soils, but is {{adaptable}} {{to a very}} wide range of soil conditions and pH values. It is drought-hardy, but not tolerant of flooding. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not tolerate deep shade. In China it is often found in limestone-rich areas. The tree of heaven is found within {{a wide range of}} climatic conditions. In its native range it is found at high altitudes in Taiwan as well as lower ones in mainland China. In the U.S. it is found in arid regions bordering the Great Plains, very wet regions in the southern Appalachians, cold areas of the lower Rocky Mountains and throughout much of the California Central Valley. Prolonged cold and snow cover cause dieback, though the trees re-sprout from the roots.|$|E
5|$|With {{its form}} and {{structure}} in consideration, Rescued by Rover shows a growing understanding among directors of how stories {{can be told}} on film; that is, {{the belief that the}} audience does not need to see the family return to their home, but will instead assume this occurred while the beggar woman was returning to her hovel. While the duration of the shot does not correspond with the time necessary for the father and the family dog to travel back, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not affect the sense of realistic on-screen representation.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of routing in the {{physical}} design process, global routing and detailed routing. Global routing allocates routing resources that are used for connections. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> track assignment for a particular net.|$|E
25|$|Like {{polynomial}} interpolation, {{spline interpolation}} incurs a smaller error than linear interpolation and the interpolant is smoother. However, the interpolant {{is easier to}} evaluate than the high-degree polynomials used in polynomial interpolation. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not suffer from Runge's phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Weaknesses: This model cannot {{explain the}} {{transport}} kinetics of large protein cargo, such as collagen. This model falls short on explaining {{the observation of}} discrete compartments and polarized biochemistry of the Golgi cisternae. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not explain formation and disintegration of the Golgi network, nor the role of COPI vesicles.|$|E

25|$|The {{internet}} {{layer is}} not only agnostic of data structures at the transport layer, but <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not distinguish between operation of the various transport layer protocols. IP carries data {{for a variety of}} different upper layer protocols. These protocols are each identified by a unique protocol number: for example, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) are protocols 1 and 2, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The new {{official}} Bulgarian {{system does}} not allow for unambiguous mapping back into Cyrillic, since unlike most other systems it does not distinguish between ъ and а (both rendered as a). <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not distinguish between the digraph values of =ж>, =ш> and the value of the same Roman strings in rendering accidental clusters of separate Cyrillic letters =зх> and =сх>, as they occur in words like изход (izhod) or схема (shema).|$|E

25|$|Justice Brennan {{opened his}} {{argument}} by observing {{that although the}} NLRA does not mention lockouts, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not prohibit them. Citing no evidence, Brennan then asserted that the legislative history of the NLRA did not indicate any intention by Congress to ban lockouts. Inclusion of the term in the Taft-Hartley Act, the majority found, indicated congressional recognition of the lockout and implied that there were circumstances in which a lockout might be legally employed.|$|E
25|$|The {{market share}} of S for single family {{mortgage}} loans went from 53% in 1975 to 30% in 1990. U.S. General Accounting Office estimated cost of the crisis to around $160.1 billion, about $124.6 billion of which was directly {{paid for by the}} U.S. government from 1986 to 1996. That figure does not include thrift insurance funds used before 1986 or after 1996. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not include state run thrift insurance funds or state bailouts.|$|E

In addition, NOR VTS manages the sealanes into Hammerfest and in Bellsundet.

25|$|While Einstein's {{result is}} the same as Bradley's {{original}} equation except for an extra factor of , it should be emphasized that Bradley's result does not merely give the classical limit of the relativistic case, {{in the sense that it}} gives incorrect predictions even at low relative velocities. Bradley's explanation cannot account for situations such as the water telescope, nor for many other optical effects (such as interference) that might occur within the telescope. This is because in the Earth's frame it predicts that the direction of propagation of the light beam in the telescope is not normal to the wavefronts of the beam, in contradiction with Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not preserve the speed of light c between frames. However, Bradley did correctly infer that the effect was due to relative velocities.|$|E
25|$|At {{this moment}} most prisons in Tonga still abide {{with the old}} laissez-faire attitude. Usually having no fences, no iron bars and so forth, that makes it very easy for the inmates to escape. This system may be {{required}} to change, adapting for the influx of foreign born/raised criminals who may treat such a system with contempt, alternatively a minimum/maximum security prison system may need to be developed placing escapists or repeat offenders into closed prisons, but for the moment the jailors can trust on the goodwill of the inmates. Some are glad to be in prison, not to be bothered by demanding family members. There is no social stigma on being in prison (although that may change now too), but then of course <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not serve as a deterrent against crimes.|$|E
25|$|Before IBAN, differing {{national}} standards for bank account identification (i.e. bank, branch, routing codes, and account number) were confusing for some users. This often led to necessary routing information being missing from payments. Routing information as specified by ISO 9362 (also known as Business Identifier Codes (BIC code), SWIFT ID or SWIFT code, and SWIFT-BIC) {{does not require a}} specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>does</b> not contain check digits, so errors of transcription were not detectable and it was not possible for a sending bank to validate the routing information prior to submitting the payment. Routing errors caused delayed payments and incurred extra costs to the sending and receiving banks and often to intermediate routing banks.|$|E
