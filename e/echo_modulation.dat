After presenting {{the concept of the}} EEHG, we address several practically important issues, such as the effect of coherent and incoherent synchrotron radiation in the dispersion sections. Using a representative realistic set of beam parameters, we show how the EEHG scheme enhances the FEL performance and allows one to generate a fully (both longitudinally and transversely) coherent radiation. We then discuss application of the <b>echo</b> <b>modulation</b> for generation of attosecond pulses of radiation, and also using echo for generation of terahertz radiation.

40|$|International audience; Trains of spin echoes are {{normally}} modulated by homonuclear scalar couplings. It {{has long been}} known that <b>echo</b> <b>modulations</b> are quenched when the pulse-repetition rates are much larger than the offsets of the coupling partners, because the spin systems behave as if they consisted of magnetically equivalent spins when the offsets are suppressed. This type of quenching of the <b>echo</b> <b>modulations</b> can occur when the radio-frequency (RF) pulses are ideal, that is, when they are perfectly homogeneous, properly calibrated to induce rotations through an angle, pi, and have an RF amplitude, omega(1) =-gammaB(1), that is strong compared to the largest offset, Omega(S) =omega(0 S) -omega(RF), with respect to the carrier frequency. Recently, it was discovered that <b>echo</b> <b>modulations</b> can also be quenched when the RF pulses are nonideal, that is, when they are too weak to bring about an ideal rotation of the magnetization of the coupling partners, so that the effective fields associated with the RF pulses are tilted in the rotating frame. This phenomenon typically occurs when the pulse-repetition rates are much slower than the offset of the coupling partner. Under such conditions, it turns out, however, that for certain offsets, when the phase, Phi(S) (which arises from a free precession of the magnetization of the coupling partner, S, in the pulse interval, 2 tau, and the pulse length, tau(pi)), approaches a multiple of 2 pi, the <b>echo</b> <b>modulations</b> are restored. However, the frequencies of these <b>echo</b> <b>modulations</b> are not simply determined by the homonuclear scalar coupling, J(IS). The Fourier transforms of the echo trains (the so-called "J spectra") reveal surprising multiplet patterns, and the amplitudes of the <b>echo</b> <b>modulations</b> depend on the offsets of the coupling partners. Herein, we present a unified theory, based on an average-Hamiltonian approach, to describe these effects for two-spin systems. Experimental evidence of <b>echo</b> <b>modulations</b> in a system of two spins is presented.

The complementarity of using both these techniques greatly strengthens the conclusions reached. Since dipolar interactions are averaged out by molecular tumbling in liquid - solutions, their exploitation requires studies in rapidly frozen solutions. A variety of experiments has shown that micellar and vesicular structure is retained in these rapidly frozen solutions.

The Fourier transform of the relaxation-corrected two-pulse echo decay curve reveals peaks, at one and two times the deuterium NMR frequency, that arise from the dipolar hyperfine interaction of the deuterium nucleus with the unpaired electron spin of the nitroxide-labeled lipid. For phosphatidylcholine spin-labeled at different positions down the sn- 2 chain, the amplitude of the deuterium signal decreases {{toward the center of}} the membrane, and is reduced to zero from the C- 12 atom position onward. At chain positions C- 5 and C- 7 closer to the phospholipid headgroups, the amplitude of the deuterium signal is greater in the presence of cholesterol than in its absence.

40|$|Introduction: Quantitative T 2 mapping {{may provide}} an {{objective}} biomarker for occult nervous tissue pathology in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). We applied a novel <b>echo</b> <b>modulation</b> curve (EMC) algorithm to identify T 2 changes in normal-appearing brain regions of subjects with RRMS (N =  27) compared to age-matched controls (N =  38). Methods: The EMC algorithm uses Bloch simulations to model T 2 decay curves in multi-spin-echo MRI sequences, independent of scanner, and scan-settings. T 2 values were extracted from normal-appearing white and gray matter brain regions using both expert manual regions-of-interest and user-independent FreeSurfer segmentation. Results: Compared to conventional exponential T 2 modeling, EMC fitting provided more accurate estimations of T 2 with less variance across scans, MRI systems, and healthy individuals. Thalamic T 2 was increased 8. 5 % in RRMS subjects (p <  0. 001) {{and could be}} used to discriminate RRMS from healthy controls well (AUC =  0. 913). Manual segmentation detected both statistically significant increases (corpus callosum & temporal stem) and decreases (posterior limb internal capsule) in T 2 associated with RRMS diagnosis (all p <  0. 05). In healthy controls, we also observed statistically significant T 2 differences for different white and gray matter structures. Conclusions: The EMC algorithm precisely characterizes T 2 values, and is able to detect subtle T 2 changes in normal-appearing brain regions of RRMS patients. These presumably capture both axon and myelin changes from inflammation and neurodegeneration. Further, T 2 variations between different brain regions of healthy controls may correlate with distinct nervous tissue environments that differ from one another at a mesoscopic length-scale...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPhotogenerated {{short-lived}} radical pairs (RP) {{are common}} in biological photoprocesses such as photosynthesis and enzymatic DNA repair. They can be favorably probed by time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods with adequate time resolution. Two EPR techniques {{have proven to be}} particularly useful to extract information on the working states of photoinduced biological processes that is only difficult or sometimes even impossible to obtain by other types of spectroscopy. Firstly, transient EPR yields crucial information on the chemical nature and the geometry of the individual RP halves in a doublet-spin pair generated by a short laser pulse. This time-resolved method is applicable in all magnetic field/microwave frequency regimes that are used for continuous-wave EPR, and is nowadays routinely utilized with a time resolution reaching about 10 ns. Secondly, a pulsed EPR method named out-of-phase electron spin echo envelope modulation (OOP-ESEEM) is increasingly becoming popular. By this pulsed technique, the mutual spin–spin interaction between the RP halves in a doublet-spin pair manifests itself as an <b>echo</b> <b>modulation</b> detected {{as a function of the}} microwave-pulse spacing of a two-pulse echo sequence subsequent to a laser pulse. From the dipolar coupling, the distance between the radicals is readily derived. Since the spin–spin interaction parameters are typically not observable by transient EPR, the two techniques complement each other favorably. Both EPR methods have recently been applied to a variety of light-induced RPs in photobiology.

The lifetime of P+· is determined by measuring the decay of the EPR signals following relaxation of the initial spin polarization. All samples except one of the RC fractions show evidence of light induced charge separation and formation of chlorophyll triplet states. The lifetime of P+· {{is found to be}} biexponential with components of 1. 5 ms and 30 ms for C. tepidum and 1. 0 and 4. 5 ms for Hc. mobilis at 100 K. In both cases, the rates are assigned to recombination from F−X. The spin polarized radical pair spectra for both species are similar and those from Hc. mobilis at room temperature and 100 K are identical. In all cases, an emission/absorption polarization pattern with a net absorption is observed. A slight narrowing of the spectra and a larger absorptive net polarization is found at K-band. No out-of-phase <b>echo</b> <b>modulation</b> is observed. Taken together, the recombination kinetics, the frequency dependence of the spin polarization and the absence of an out-of-phase echo signal lead to the assignment of the spectra to the contribution from P+· to the state P+·F−X.
