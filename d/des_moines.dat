5|$|Dodd {{spent most}} of December in Iowa engaged in Town Halls. He briefly made a trip to Mountain View, California to make a speech before {{returning}} to the trails in Iowa. He participated in the last Democratic Debate before the primary season on December 13 in Johnson, Iowa. In this debate sponsored by the <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> Register, Dodd commented that Education was the most important issue to him in the campaign.

5|$|That same year, Weaver and his wife, Clara, {{celebrated their}} fiftieth wedding anniversary, {{surrounded}} by six of their children. The Iowa legislature honored him in 1909, and hung {{a portrait of}} him in the Iowa State Historical Building. He wrote a history of Jasper County, Iowa, where he lived, which was published in 1912. Weaver planned to campaign on behalf of Democratic candidates that year, but did not have the chance. On February 6, while visiting his daughter in <b>Des</b> <b>Moines,</b> he died. After a funeral at the First Methodist Church in <b>Des</b> <b>Moines,</b> Weaver was buried in that city's Woodland Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{criticism}} of players elected to the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in this period, Bancroft grades well in terms of sabermetric statistics. He finished fourth in the NL in Wins Above Replacement in 1920 (6.5) and third in 1921 (7.2) and 1922 (6.0).

5|$|The case, and {{the earlier}} Tinker v. <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> Independent Community School District, are {{considered}} landmark decisions for defining {{the right to}} expression for students in public schools. While subsequent court rulings have varied on when Hazelwood applies, the case remains a strong precedent in the regulation of student speech. However, the New Voices bill of 2016, passed by 18 states, ignores the Hazelwood decision {{and returns to the}} Tinker precedent.|$|E
5|$|US136 was {{designated}} nationally in 1951. In the Keokuk area, it was overlaid upon US61 from west of Alexandria, Missouri, over the <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> River into Iowa, and into downtown Keokuk. South of downtown, it replaced Iowa161, which crossed the Mississippi River on the Keokuk Rail Bridge. Since its designation, the route has largely remained the same. However, {{the eastern end}} changed slightly {{with the opening of}} the Keokuk–Hamilton Bridge in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Weaver and {{his wife}} moved their {{household}} in 1890 from Bloomfield to Colfax, near <b>Des</b> <b>Moines,</b> as the former Congressman took up more active management of the Iowa Tribune. The Greenback and Union Labor parties were defunct, but he still proselytized for their ideals. In August 1890, Weaver addressed a convention in <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> where former Greenbackers and Laborites gathered, although he declined their nomination for Congress. The economic conditions that had created the Greenback party had not gone away; many farmers and laborers believed their situation had gotten worse since the Long Depression began in 1873. Many farmers had joined the Farmers' Alliance, which sought to promote soft-money ideas on a non-partisan basis; rather than create a third party, they endorsed major party candidates who supported their ideas and hired speakers to educate the public. Alliance-backed candidates did well in the 1890 elections, especially in the South, where Democrats endorsed by the Alliance won 44 seats.|$|E
5|$|Deep-fried {{butter is}} a snack food {{comprising}} butter that is {{coated with a}} batter or breading and then deep-fried. The dish has been served at several fairs in the United States; among them, the State Fair of Texas in Dallas, Texas, and the Iowa State Fair in <b>Des</b> <b>Moines,</b> Iowa; {{and now it is}} served worldwide. It has a significant buttery flavor, which has been compared to that of French toast. Fried butter is a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the fair}} idea was conceived, several sites were {{considered}}. Among the sites considered within Seattle were Duwamish Head in West Seattle; Fort Lawton (now Discovery Park) in the Magnolia neighborhood; and First Hill—even closer to Downtown than the site finally selected, {{but far more}} densely developed. Two sites {{south of the city}} proper were considered—Midway, near <b>Des</b> <b>Moines,</b> and the Army Depot in Auburn—as was a site east of the city on the south shore of Lake Sammamish.|$|E
5|$|Research on {{leisure and}} {{hospitality}} situates Omaha {{in the same}} tier for tourists as the neighboring cities of <b>Des</b> <b>Moines,</b> Iowa; Topeka, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Denver, Colorado; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A {{recent study found that}} investment of $1 million in cultural tourism generated approximately $83,000 in state and local taxes, and provided support for hundreds of jobs for the metropolitan area, which in turn led to additional tax revenue for government.|$|E
5|$|Slipknot is an American {{heavy metal}} band from <b>Des</b> <b>Moines,</b> Iowa. Originally formed {{under the name}} of The Pale Ones in September 1995, Slipknot have gone through {{multiple}} line-up changes, their lineup remained unalterd from 1999 until 2010 with the death of bassist Paul Gray and the departure of Joey Jordison in 2013.

5|$|The Milam Building has {{undergone}} many events, including fires, foreclosure, and ownership changes. It {{was owned by}} Principal Mutual Life Insurance Co. of <b>Des</b> <b>Moines,</b> Iowa while {{the law firm of}} Maloney & Maloney occupied the top three floors. The 1950s had a tenancy by Mobil, Shell, the Railroad Commission of Texas, and Exxon used the building for their Texas headquarters, before they moved to Houston.

5|$|During World War II, Bachelder {{enlisted in}} the Women's Army Corps (WAC) in November 1942, at the Springfield, Massachusetts headquarters. After {{spending}} time in training at military bases in several U.S. states, she received orders assigning her to the Company 'D' WAC Detachment of the Manhattan District, United States Army Corps of Engineers. Her secret assignment was to lead a group of 15 to 20 women from the WAC, stationed in <b>Des</b> <b>Moines,</b> Iowa, to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, {{and from there to}} Santa Fe, New Mexico. She and the women under her command arrived at Los Alamos, New Mexico on October 21, 1943.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Myron entered Dewey into {{a charity}} pet {{photograph}} contest {{as a way}} to promote the library; Dewey won the contest after receiving more than 80% of the votes. Dewey's win was covered in The <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> Register, which led to increased local and state publicity in print and on television, and the library never again made an effort to increase Dewey's publicity outside of the local area. An appearance in the June/July 1990 issue of Country magazine took Dewey's story national, after which eleven people claimed to have been the person who left Dewey in the book drop {{as a way to}} protect him from the cold.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, a new {{band called}} Inveigh Catharsis formed in <b>Des</b> <b>Moines,</b> with Gray on bass, Brainard on guitar and Colsefni on drums. Jordison jammed {{occasionally}} with this group. Brainard eventually left to join Jordison and Jones in Modifidious, participating in demo recordings {{at the end}} of '93 and early in '94. During 1994 Modifidious sometimes played the same shows as Crahan's Heads on the Wall band. Gray formed a death metal band called Body Pit, soon becoming popular in the local scene. Modifidious stopped playing in the wake of death metal's increasing pull. Gray failed to get Jordison to join Body Pit, but soon after he recruited local guitar teacher Mick Thomson, the band broke up.|$|E
5|$|In early 1979, <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> fire {{officials}} {{announced that a}} hydrogen buildup caused by alkaline water leaking from the store's heating and cooling system caused the fire. Court documents filed by prosecuting attorneys in 1981 stated that an electrical malfunction caused wires that were covered in polyvinyl chloride to overheat, giving off hydrochloric acid. Lawyers representing Younkers and {{the families of the}} eleven victims sued more than 20 companies that manufactured or were associated with polyvinyl chloride, including Monsanto Company and Underwriters Laboratories. Most of those lawsuits were settled out of court in 1984, while the last suit against B.F. Goodrich was dismissed by a Polk County district judge in April 1986.|$|E
5|$|Merle Hay Plaza {{opened on}} August 17, 1959. It had 31 stores {{at the time}} of its opening, {{including}} its first anchor (Younkers), as well as a bowling alley that is still in operation today. A second anchor store opened later in 1959, as Sears moved from downtown <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> to Merle Hay Plaza. Other early tenants included a Safeway supermarket (whose space later became part of Sears), Kresge, Bishop's Buffet (which closed in 1995), and Walgreens (which was replaced by an Old Navy in 1999). A movie theater and six-story office building were added in 1965.|$|E
5|$|SeaTac/Airport {{station is}} also served by five bus routes using bus stops on International Boulevard {{to the east}} of the station. King County Metro {{operates}} three routes from the station: the RapidRide A Line, which continues north to Tukwila International Boulevard station and south to Federal Way Transit Center; route 156, which connects to Southcenter Mall, <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> and Highline College; and route 180, which connects to Burien, Kent and Auburn. Sound Transit runs two express bus routes to the station and airport terminal: route 560, which travels to West Seattle, Burien, Renton and Bellevue; and route 574, which travels south to Tacoma and Lakewood in Pierce County.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{artifacts}} {{found in}} Iowa are Clovis points, large lanceolate points found occasionally {{in all parts}} of the state except for the <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> Lobe. Possible sources of game were giant Pleistocene megafauna, including mammoth, mastodon, and giant forms of bison, all of which are now extinct. While widespread, only two Clovis sites have been excavated in Iowa. The Rummells-Maske site is a Clovis site in Cedar County; unfortunately, this site was damaged by plowing, although 20 points and point fragments were recovered. The Carlisle Clovis Cache Site in Warren County contained 38 unfinished stone tools that appear to date to the Clovis period, but these results have not yet been published.|$|E
5|$|The rich fur areas {{along the}} upper Mississippi, Minnesota, <b>Des</b> <b>Moines,</b> and Missouri Rivers, {{otherwise}} occupied by {{peoples of the}} First Nations, were exploited by independent fur traders operating from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin {{in the late eighteenth}} century. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, these traders established fur posts in the Minnesota River valley at Lake Traverse, Big Stone Lake, Lac qui Parle, and Traverse des Sioux. The large fur companies also built posts, including the North West Company's stations at Pembina and St. Joseph in the valley of the Red River. The paths between these posts became parts of the first of the Red River Trails.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{only two}} law schools, the University of Iowa College of Law and Drake University Law School, are both {{accredited}} by the American Bar Association. Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine and <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> University College of Osteopathic Medicine are the state's two medical schools. The majority of Iowa's post-secondary institutions are accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA). Most are accredited by multiple agencies, {{such as the}} Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM), and the National League for Nursing (NLNAC).|$|E
5|$|According to the 2010 United States Census estimate, {{the city}} {{population}} grew to 99,685 and the Quad Cities metropolitan area grew to 379,690. As of the 2000 census, there were 98,359 people, 39,124 households, and 24,804 families {{residing in the}} city. The population density was 1,566.5 people per square mile (604.8/km²). There were 41,350 housing units at an average density of 658.5 per square mile (254.3/km²). Davenport's population density is 30 times the average density of Iowa and 20 times the average density of the United States. However, it is about a third less than <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> and 20 percent less than Cedar Rapids, the only two cities in Iowa with higher populations than Davenport. Sioux City, the next city smaller than Davenport in population, has a density of 5 people more per square mile.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{directors}} of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., declared {{the need for a}} new building. Paul Mellon, a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its building committee, set to work with his assistant J. Carter Brown (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect. The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research. They likened the scope of the new facility to the Library of Alexandria. After inspecting Pei's work at the <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> Art Center in Iowa and the Johnson Museum at Cornell University, they offered him the commission.|$|E
5|$|Justice Harlan is {{credited}} for the establishing that the First Amendment protects {{the freedom of}} association. In NAACP v. Alabama, Justice Harlan delivered {{the opinion of the}} court, invalidating an Alabama law that required the NAACP to disclose membership lists. However he did not believe that individuals were entitled to exercise their First Amendment rights wherever they pleased. He joined in Adderley v. Florida, which controversially upheld a trespassing conviction for protesters who demonstrated on government property. He dissented from Brown v. Louisiana, in which the Court held that protesters were entitled to engage in a sit-in at a public library. Likewise, he disagreed with Tinker v. <b>Des</b> <b>Moines,</b> in which the Supreme Court ruled that students had the right to wear armbands (as a form of protest) in public schools.|$|E
5|$|Massive {{flooding}} in the Midwest {{resulted in the}} Sounds and the Iowa Cubs played a game with an official attendance of zero on June 14, 2008. Though downtown <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> was under a mandatory evacuation, team officials received permission from the city {{to play the game}} as long as no fans were allowed into Principal Park. In order to keep fans away, the lights and scoreboard were not turned on, the game was not broadcast in the local market, and a message on the team's website announced that the game was postponed. PCL Commissioner Branch Rickey III believed that {{this was the first time}} such actions were taken out of necessity. Kremblas' Sounds ended with a 59–81record, the second-lowest in the team's history.|$|E
