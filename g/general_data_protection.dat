40|$|Abstract In Poland {{there are}} only Regional Bioethical Committees. Unlike most EU {{countries}} Poland has no coordinating centre on bioethics for human research. However, the Ministry of Health and Welfare has established a Bioethics Appeals Committee. The functioning of the Bioethical Committees in Poland is regulated in detail by the Regulation of the Ministry of Health and Welfare of 1999. All regulations comply with important guidelines such as: the Helsinki Declaration, The Rules of Good Clinical Practice, EU Directives and legal regulations binding in Poland, mainly the Act of the Medical Doctor Profession and the Dentist Profession, {{as well as the}} Act of Pharmaceutical Law. In the framework of the Human Biomonitoring Programme, the application for bioethical evaluation will be submitted to the Bioethical Committee at the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine in Lodz. The <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> legislation in Poland according to the Act of the <b>Protection</b> of Personal <b>Data</b> of 29 th of August 1997 with latest amendments fulfils EU regulations. The Act also contains detailed provisions regarding the duties of the Inspector <b>General</b> for <b>Data</b> <b>Protection.</b> The paper presents data on the activities of the Bureau of the Inspector <b>General</b> for Personal <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> in 2005, 2006 and 2007. </p...|$|R
40|$|The paper, {{based on}} British Library funded research, exam-ines {{a range of}} issues {{relating}} to <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> manage-ment in UK university library and information services. A <b>general</b> description of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> legislation in the UK is followed by a brief overview of the aspects which involve personal data in libraries. The result of an impact survey of UK university libraries ranging in size are reported in detail and discussed. Institutional experiences are noted, including the penetration of information technology (IT) into library activities, together with the organisation of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> responsibilities and practice. Almost all institu-tions are registered under the <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> Act 1984 and many have someone specially designated to oversee <b>data</b> <b>protection.</b> There is extensive use of IT in the libraries surveyed, particularly for cataloguing, ordering and circu...|$|R
40|$|In the 1980 s, the EU began {{collecting}} the personal data of people arriving {{from third countries}} {{in order to control}} migratory flows within the EU. However, since the 9 / 11 attacks function creep has led to this information, which was originally collected for EU border management, being used by police authorities. Information systems such as SIS, VIS, CIS and Eurodac have been amending their own regulations to permit access by police authorities from the member states and Europol. This paper analyses the potential conflict arising from these practises and the fundamental right to <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> in the EU. First, <b>general</b> and sectoral <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> rules applicable to the data processed by SIS, VIS, CIS and Eurodac will be examined. After that, this study will assess whether allowing law enforcement authorities to access such EU information systems could violate the EU principles of necessity and purpose limitation...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the balancing between {{the right of}} access to information {{and the right to}} privacy in the context of online proactive disclosure of personal data. Proactive disclosure is understood as disclosure of information made by public authorities without a request having previously been made for such disclosure. Interestingly, the release upon request of official documents containing personal data normally does not activate <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> legis-lation in Sweden. In the case of proactive disclosure of official documents containing personal data, however, the <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> legislation must be followed. Jonason presents and analyses the legal framework, and shows how it has evolved over time. She illustrates the legal framework through the analysis of cases on proactive disclosure handled by the Swedish <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> Authority. In addition, guidelines concerning online proactive disclosure, drafted by the same authority for the benefit of local authorities, are taken into consideration. Jonason is especially interested in the balance-ing between the interest to protect privacy of the data subject and the interest of ensuring openness and transparency, and how this balancing is conveyed in the letter of the law, the preparatory works, {{as well as in the}} concrete implementation made by the <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> Authority. The conclusion reached by Jonason is that the current legal framework, constituted by different “layers”, is intricate. Changes on data processing made by public authorities should be expected, however, due to the <b>General</b> Regulation on <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> that will enter into force in 2018. This might constitute an opportunity for the legislator to rationalise the current legal framework.

40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to raise {{awareness}} of some of the legal issues around open source investigations of cybercrime and cyberterrorism. The issues raised relate to different stages of the investigation process and highlight instances within each where various types of legislation may affect the activities carried out, or the progress of a case. Rather than attempt to provide an in-depth legal analysis, the author uses UK and European law to illustrate difficulties that may be encountered or factors that may need to be considered in this particular type of investigation. <b>General</b> issues of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> and human rights are outlined and addressed and more specific topics such as lawful actions, disclosure and digital evidence are explored. The chapter also considers the reasons behind the legal issues and suggests some ways that problems may be overcome...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{communication}} systems {{and information technology}} create significant new threats to information privacy. In this paper, we discuss the need for proper privacy protection in cooperative intelligent transportation systems (cITS), one instance of such systems. We outline <b>general</b> principles for <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> and their legal basis and argue why pure legal protection is insufficient. Strong privacy-enhancing technologies need to be deployed in cITS to protect user data while it is generated and processed. As data minimization cannot always prevent the need for disclosing relevant personal information, we introduce the new concept of mandatory enforcement of privacy policies. This concept empowers users and data subjects to tightly couple their data with privacy policies and rely on the system to impose such policies onto any data processors. We also describe the PRECIOSA Privacy-enforcing Runtime Architecture that exemplifies our approach. Moreover, we show how an application can utilize this architecture by applying it to a pay as you drive (PAYD) car insurance scenario. 1...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{crowdsourcing}} have expanded rapidly allowing citizens to connect with each other, governments to connect with common mass, to coordinate disaster response work, to map political conflicts, acquiring information quickly and participating in issues that affect day-to- day life of citizens. As emerging tools and technologies offer huge potential to response quickly and on time during crisis, crisis responders do take support from these tools and techniques. The ‘Guiding Principles’ of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 - 2030 identifies that ‘disaster risk reduction requires a multi-hazard approach and inclusive risk-informed decision-making (RIDM) based on the open exchange and dissemination of disaggregated data, including by sex, age and disability, {{as well as on}} easily accessible, up-to-date, comprehensible, science-based, non-sensitive risk information, complemented by traditional knowledge.

40|$|The proceduralisation of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> {{remedies}} under EU <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> law: {{towards a}} more effective and data subject-oriented remedial system? The right to remedy breaches of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> is laid down in both Directive 95 / 46 /EC (Art. 22) and the Council of Europe <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> Convention no. 108 (Art. 8 (d)). Although <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> violations are remedied mainly at the national level, {{it is possible to}} identify a set of procedural rules on how to remedy <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> violations under EU law. Currently, there is a three-layered remedial system in place (composed of access rights, the administrative system and the court system). Worthy of attention are the EU’s <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> reforms which will introduce new provisions aimed at ‘proceduralising’ <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> remedies. This paper investigates how <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> breaches are remedied in the EU and under EU law in light of Directive 95 / 46 /EC and the proposed reforms...|$|R
5000|$|The Bahamas has an {{official}} <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> law {{that protects the}} personal information of its citizens in both {{the private and public}} sector: <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> Act 2003 (the Bahamas Law). The Bahamas Law appoints a <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> commissioner to the Office of <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> to ensure that <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> is being held. Even though there is legislation enforced in the Bahamas through the <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> Act 2003, the act lacks many enforcements since a <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> officer doesn't need to be in office nor does any group or organization need to notify the Office of <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> when a hacker has breached privacy law. Also, there are no requirements for registering databases or restricting data flow across national borders.
