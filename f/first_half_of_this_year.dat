In the National Plan for Vaccinal Prevention 2012 - 2014, which was published just before the issue of the SitI Calendar but concluded earlier (end of 2011), influenza vaccination is recommended "only" for all persons ≥ 65 years or included in one of the many at-risk categories. The issue is controversial and has generated considerable debate at national and international level. This short note discusses the logical processes and the scientific evidence in support or against the decision to extend the influenza vaccination. The Authors conclude that the epidemiological approach used by SItI experts is appropriate. In any case, further studies on the topic are strongly needed, and their results should be taken into account in the drafting of future vaccination schedules...|$|E

The ongoing economic expansion has moved into a near-record ninth year, with real output expanding vigorously, the unemployment rate hovering around lows last seen in 1970, and the underlying trends in inflation remaining subdued. Productivity-enhancing investments by businesses, spurred by the availability of new technologies at increasingly attractive prices, have held down the rise in costs and prices and have boosted living standards. Two of the major threats faced by the economy in late 1998 [...] economic downturns in many foreign nations and turmoil in financial markets around the world [...] receded over the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> The Federal Open Market Committee was concerned that as economic activity abroad strengthened, the firming of commodity and other prices might foster a less favorable inflation environment.

40|$|At the {{mid point}} of 1996 thequestion we ask is: will this year {{resemble}} 1994, whose em-ployment growth showed what {{the economy is}} capable of, or will it look like 1995, a year more typical of trends in the 1990 s? Employment grew steeply and steadily in 1994. Perhaps even more remarkably, almost all of this employment growth was full-time. Job gains were so substantial that they induced the first year-to-year increase in average family income since 1989 – hardly the “jobless recovery ” so widely reported. This employment growth also created the first sustained decline in the un-employment rate in the 1990 s. The following year was quite an-other story. Employment growth in 1995 returned to the modest rates {{that have come to}} prevail in the 1990 s. Growth {{over the course of the}} year (99, 000) was only 26 % of what it had been the previous year. In addition, the rate of part-time job creation exceeded the rate for full-time jobs. While the unemploy-ment rate continued to drift downwards, it did so more slowly than it had in 1994. The economic environment The relationship between changes in aggregate economic growth and changes in employment is not fixed through time. Nevertheless, there is a strong correlation historically. So in putting the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> in the context of employment growth of the two previous years, it would be worthwhile to look at concurrent macro economic devel-opments...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} measure {{simultaneously}} vertical profiles of ozone and further trace gases (e. g. NO 2), which are relevant in stratospheric ozone chemistry, {{we have developed}} a new balloon-borne optical sonde. Its measuring principle {{is based on the}} detection of sunlight intensity with a miniature spectrometer over a wide wavelength range (200 850 nm) during the ascent. A control unit in the sonde evaluates and preprocesses the data already on-board. Every ten seconds parts of the measured spectrum, meteorological values, and GPS information are transmitted to the ground. Height-dependent column densities of the considered trace gases can be determined using radiative transfer calculations and their inversion leads to the vertical concentration profiles. The implementation of new light-weight components and innovative techniques results in an payload weight of 2 kg, thus reaching up to 40 km altitude with comparable small balloons. It can be operated by a two-men team and is suitable for field-work with limited logistic possibilities. The new sonde closes the gap between the electrochemical sonde ECC, the world-wide standard for routine ozone measurements, and sophisticated optical sensors used on large size stratospheric balloons. Due to the necessary logistics, these balloon experiments are very expensive and can only be carried out from special balloon launching facilities. During the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> various test measurements will be performed to thoroughly check the overall technique and the analysis algorithm.
