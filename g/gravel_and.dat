5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E

5|$|The Mendips are {{the most}} southerly Carboniferous {{limestone}} uplands in Britain. They are composed of three major anticlinal structures, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The limestone is quarried for building stone and the other rocks for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate. Sand, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> peat are extracted {{in other parts of}} the county.|$|E
5|$|The soil is of marl, clay, {{and sandy}} loam, with the subsoil being <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> sand. The {{prominent}} crops are wheat, barley, and oats, {{and a smaller}} number of hops. According to the 2011 census, Steep had a population of 849 people.|$|E
5|$|Bordering Prospect Park is Devil's Dip, {{a former}} <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> clay pit. The site is {{recognised}} by Reading Borough Council {{as an area}} of wildlife and historical interest, and examples of elm, walnut, ash, horse chestnut and sycamore trees grow there. Other flora found at the site include nettle, bramble and elder, with flowers such as lesser celandine, bluebells and Queen Anne's lace appearing in the spring. Peacock butterflies and various species of woodland bird are prevalent in the area.|$|E

5|$|During the ice ages of {{the last}} two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the {{expanded}} polar ice cap several times. As the ice moved it eroded the rock, filling the river canyons with gravel. In some sections the rivers have cut through the <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> flow swiftly over bedrock, and in some areas large boulders have fallen into the rivers and formed rapids.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{resources}} include peat deposits, {{small quantities}} {{of oil and}} natural gas, granite, dolomite (limestone), marl, chalk, sand, <b>gravel,</b> <b>and</b> clay. About 70% of the radiation from neighboring Ukraine's 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster entered Belarusian territory, and {{about a fifth of}} Belarusian land (principally farmland and forests in the southeastern regions) was affected by radiation fallout. The United Nations and other agencies have aimed to reduce the level of radiation in affected areas, especially through the use of caesium binders and rapeseed cultivation, which are meant to decrease soil levels of caesium-137.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Estuary {{has one of}} {{the highest}} tidal ranges in the world, up to , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range, and the {{underlying}} geology of rock, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The tidal range means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide and the landing stage at the end of the pier has several levels to allow boats to dock at all stages of the tide.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{standing}} {{fresh water}} on Caroline Island, although the Nake and South Islets harbor underground freshwater aquifers (or Ghyben-Herzberg lenses), and wells {{have been built}} to tap drinking water for temporary settlements. Soils on Caroline are similarly poor, dominated by coral <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> sand, with significant organic content present only within stable, forested island centers. Guano deposits make island soil, where it does exist, nitrogen-rich; {{but even in the}} oldest and most vegetated regions of the atoll, soils are only a few centimeters (one or two inches) thick.|$|E
5|$|What is now MS 198 {{originally}} existed as <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> earth roads by the 1920s. The {{portions of}} the current road became parts of MS 24 and MS 15 in the 1930s and were all paved by the 1940s. US 98 was designated on these segments in 1955. Between the 1970s and 1990s, US 98 was rerouted to bypass Tylertown, Columbia, Hattiesburg, Beaumont, McLain, and Lucedale. By 1998, MS 198 was designated onto the former alignment of US 98 through these communities. The McLain section was truncated from US 98 east of town to MS 57 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E

5|$|Buildings {{and other}} {{structures}} were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E
5|$|By 2001 NFF was in {{the process}} of {{implementing}} new stadium requirements in the top leagues, and Briskeby would no longer be permitted to be used in the top tier. Ham-Kam entered an alliance with Totalprosjekt—an real estate development company working on Lillestrøm's Åråsen Stadion—who presented a concept to finance a new venue: The municipality would transfer property to a limited company jointly owned by the municipality and the major sports clubs, the real estate would be re-regulated to increase their value, and the company would use this capital to build a new professional and a new recreational stadium. Parallel with this, a municipal commission made a report that recommended a consolidation in the number of venues in town and the conversion of <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> grass fields to artificial turf. The commission recommended that a new professional football venue be built either at Briskeby or Hamar stadion.|$|E
5|$|Each season {{normally}} {{consists of}} 12 to 16 rallies driven on surfaces ranging from <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> tarmac to snow and ice. Points from these events are calculated towards the drivers' and manufacturers' world championships. The driver's championship and manufacturer's championship are separate championships, but {{are based on}} the same point system. In the current points system, points are awarded {{at the end of each}} rally to the top ten WRC (overall), junior and production car drivers that qualify as follows: 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1. Despite how many drivers are in one team, constructors can only nominate two drivers to score points for the team as well as scoring for themselves.|$|E

Low played accordion, piano, Fender Rhodes piano, organ, Wurlitzer organ, Mellotron, synthesizer, hand claps, sampler and background vocals. When <b>Gravelled</b> <b>and</b> Green was released, the Actual Tigers were Perry, Seely and Low, though the album had Cullen playing guitar drums and percussion. Eric Gardner, a Los Angeles-based drummer, replaced Cullen, {{who had previously}} studied at Seattle’s Cornish College of the Arts and left the band to study jazz.|$|R
50|$|The Actual Tigers, {{originally}} {{known as}} Willis, were an American rock band formed in 1994 in Seattle. They released two full studio albums on CD: a self-titled debut <b>and</b> <b>Gravelled</b> <b>and</b> Green, produced with Dennis Herring. The band opened for Counting Crows after their second studio CD was released and, in 2005 after the Actual Tigers had disbanded, <b>Gravelled</b> <b>and</b> Green was ranked by MSNBC {{as one of}} the top 20 albums of the past 20 years. The band played together for seven years, having a sound often compared to Paul Simon and early Wilco.|$|R
40|$|LANDSAT {{data from}} July 1973 and June 1978 for the Patuxent River Watershed of Maryland were {{processed}} {{in an effort}} to devise an economical method of monitoring the reclamation of sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> pits. ASTEP-II <b>and</b> IDIMS software were utilized to derive signatures for sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> pits <b>and</b> other land use/land cover types. Both unsupervised and supervised classifications of the two data sets were produced. Resultant statistics and color output products were compared {{in order to determine the}} extent of reclamation and expansion of sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> pits over the five-year time span and to check the locations of more recent sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> pits. Preliminary results indicate that, for a selected northern sub-acre, signatures derived for sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> pits were nearly 90 percent accurate...|$|R
5|$|Jack jumper ants are {{primarily}} active {{during the day}} and live in open habitats, nesting in bushland, woodland and dry open forests, surrounded by <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> sandy soil, which can be found in rural areas and are less common in urban areas. They prey on small insects and use their barbless stinger to kill other insects by injecting venom. Other ants and predatory invertebrates prey on the jack jumper. The average worker has a life expectancy of over one year. Workers are gamergates, allowing them to reproduce with drones, whether or not a queen is present in the colony. The ant {{is a part of the}} Myrmecia pilosula species complex; this ant and other members of the complex are known to have a single pair of chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|Near its mouth, the {{surficial}} geology in {{the vicinity}} of Nanticoke Creek mainly consists of alluvium (which mainly consists of stratified silt, sand, and gravel, with some boulders), Wisconsinan Outwash (which contains stratified sand and <b>gravel),</b> <b>and</b> urban land (which is highly disrupted by cut and fill). Further upstream, the surficial geology mainly consists of coal dumps and surface mining land (both of which are rich in rick waste), as well as a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The upper reaches of the creek mainly are around surficial geology consisting of surface mining land, bedrock, and Wisconsinan Till.|$|E
5|$|Since 1966, over 630,000 men, 100,000 tons of foodstuffs, 400,000 weapons, and 50,000 tons of {{ammunition}} had traveled {{through the maze}} of <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> dirt roads, paths, and river transportation systems that crisscrossed southeastern Laos. The trail also linked up with a similar logistical system in neighboring Cambodia known as the Sihanouk Trail. However, following the overthrow of Prince Norodom Sihanouk in 1970, the pro-American Lon Nol regime had denied the use of the port of Sihanoukville to communist shipping. Strategically, this was an enormous blow to the North Vietnamese effort, since 70 percent of all military supplies that supported its effort in the far south had moved through the port. A further blow to the logistical system in Cambodia had come {{in the spring and summer}} of 1970, when U.S. and ARVN forces had crossed the border and attacked PAVN/NLF Base Areas during the Cambodian Campaign.|$|E
50|$|Ancient deltas are {{a benefit}} to the economy due to their well sorted sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b> Sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> is often quarried from these old deltas and used in {{concrete}} for highways, buildings, sidewalks, and even landscaping.
