5|$|A new wooden {{northern}} jetty {{was added}} in 1872 which allowed {{the removal of}} the original western landing place. Another jetty was built on the south west corner in 1898 which reached deep water even at low tide, thus allowing steamers to use the pier at all states of the tide. This was <b>damaged</b> <b>in</b> a gale in 1903, and although it was rebuilt in 1909, it closed in 1916 and was dismantled in 1923. The northern jetty had also been <b>damaged</b> <b>in</b> the 1903 storm but was replaced by the present steel structure in 1905.|$|E

50|$|<b>Damage</b> <b>in</b> Kochi Prefecture reached ¥47 million (US$600,000). <b>Damage</b> <b>in</b> Ibaraki Prefecture reached ¥10.71 million (US$136,000). <b>Damage</b> <b>in</b> Wakayama Prefecture reached ¥403.64 million (US$5.15 million).|$|R
30|$|A fatigue {{analysis}} method and procedure are established for analyzing fatigue <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> deepwater test strings subjected to wave action. The {{results show that}} the fatigue <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the deepwater test string fluctuates with the water depth, and damage varies considerably with position. The <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the sections adjacent to the splash zone and the lower flex joint are much greater. The fatigue <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the deepwater test string tends to increase as the top tension decreases and with wave height. Moreover, the <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the flex joint areas is sensitive to the top tension, whereas the <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the upper sections of the test string is sensitive to the wave height.|$|R
5000|$|... in August 2007 {{flooding}} {{along the}} Blanchard River caused more than $100 million <b>in</b> <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> Findlay {{and an estimated}} $12 million <b>in</b> <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> Ottawa. Flooding in Ottawa is aggravated by the low bridge carrying County Road I-9 in Putnam County. It traps debris, forming a dam during floods. Flooding also caused <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> Findlay in March 2011.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{estimates}} that Yorktown, <b>damaged</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require {{several months of}} repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, her elevators were intact and her flight deck largely so. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked around the clock, and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state, judged good enough {{for two or three}} weeks of operations, as Nimitz required. Her flight deck was patched, and whole sections of internal frames were cut out and replaced. Repairs continued even as she sortied, with work crews from the repair ship , herself <b>damaged</b> <b>in</b> the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier, still aboard.|$|E
5|$|Havock began escorting supply convoys in June to Tobruk, Libya {{until the}} ship was <b>damaged</b> <b>in</b> October. She was {{repaired}} in time to escort a convoy to Malta during the First Battle of Sirte in December and was badly damaged by the Italian battleship Littorio whilst protecting another convoy during the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942. Repairs were attempted in Malta, but {{the ship was}} further <b>damaged</b> <b>in</b> an air raid in early April. The Admiralty decided that further attempts to repair her at Malta were pointless and ordered her to Gibraltar for permanent repairs. On 6 April, while on passage to Gibraltar, Havock ran aground near Cape Bon, Tunisia, and her crew was interned by the Vichy French at Laghouat in the Sahara.|$|E

30|$|<b>In</b> VUMAT, the <b>damage</b> {{variables}} for different failure modes {{are stored in}} different SDSVs and updated in each increment. The progression of various sub-surface damage modes can also be observed in Figure  4 and Figure  5. Damage occurs where the corresponding damage variable is larger than 0. For 45 ° fiber orientations, the sub-surface <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the Hashin-type criterion model is characterized by transversal matrix <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> Dir. 2 and subsequent shear <b>damages</b> <b>in</b> 1 – 2 and 2 – 3 planes. In the Maximum stress model, the sub-surface damage is attributed to shear <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the 1 – 2 plane, the transversal matrix damage and subsequent shear <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> 2 – 3 plane.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{developed a}} method to detect <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> suspension bridges using vibration characteristics. These bridges exhibit complex vibration and hence {{it is difficult to}} use traditional vibration based methods to detect <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> them. This research therefore proposed component specific damage indices and verified their capability to detect and locate <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the main cables and hangers of suspension bridges...|$|R

40|$|Several {{non-invasive}} markers {{have been}} proposed to assess liver <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> NAFLD. We measured by ultrasound (US) the perihepatic adipose tsssue thickness (PATT), i. e. {{the thickness of the}} fat between the abdominal muscular layer and the hepatic surface, in addition to waist circumference, BMI, biochemistry and serum adipokines, to predict the severity of liver <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> NAFLD.

40|$|An {{assessment}} of the onset of radiographic <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the large joints (hip, knees, shoulders, elbows, ankles and tarsus) in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis, {{and the relationship of}} the progression of large joint damage with joint <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> hands and feet, with physical disability, and with cumulative disease activity, was performed in a prospective 6 yr follow-up study. Large joint damage appeared to be an early phenomenon with 20 % of the patients having some <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> at least one large joint within 1 yr, and 50 % of the patients within 6 yr after disease onset. Radiographic <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> large joints was significantly related to the <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> hands and feet, the physical disability index, and the cumulative disease activity.
