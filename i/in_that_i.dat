[...] On 6 March 2009 Scott Matthewman from The Stage wrote: [...] "I am shame-faced, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> missed this intense drama serial off last week’s preview.

The director has identified that all of his films [...] "have had some odd relationship with time, usually in just a structural sense, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have always been interested in the subjectivity of time." [...] Writing for Film Philosophy, Emma Bell points out that the characters in Inception do not literally time-travel, [...] "rather they escape time by being stricken in it – building the delusion that time has not passed, and is not passing now. They feel time grievously: willingly and knowingly destroying their experience by creating multiple simultaneous existences." ...|$|E

500|$|Rogan recounted to The Irish Times {{the value}} he {{obtained}} from interviews with Morrison's first wife, {{as well as}} his partner in a later relationship, Michelle Rocca. [...] "Here was a man who had explored all these mystic religions, had undergone Gestalt therapy, who had been told by a Rosacrucian master that he had something called an 'Angelic Knot', suddenly hanging around fashionable nightclubs and being written about in gossip columns.

500|$|AIP heads Arkoff and Nicholson had {{originally}} contributed their {{portion of the}} budget as a tax write-off, but when they were screened the completed film they were astonished by its quality.

[...] Arkoff noted that [...] "Michael Reeves brought out some elements in Vincent that hadn't been seen in a long time. Vincent was more savage in the picture.

500|$|While {{writing the}} book, Gladwell noted that [...] "the biggest {{misconception}} about success {{is that we}} do it solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work." [...] In Outliers, he hopes to show {{that there are a lot}} more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to [...] "move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the [...] "man"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked what message he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, [...] "What we do as a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much as what we do for ourselves. It sounds a little trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth <b>in</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> think." ...|$|E

[...] Through 2003, he was active as inker on several Marvel Comics titles, including Daredevil (#248–300), Spider-Man 2099 (#1–25), and Spider-Girl (#1–61), and such non-superhero projects as the four-issue Marvel / Epic Comics miniseries Atomic Age (Nov. 1990 – Feb. 1991), by writer Frank Lovece and penciler Mike Okamoto, for which Williamson won a 1991 Eisner Award for Best Inker. Daredevil penciler John Romita Jr. recalled that, [...] "Working with Al Williamson was much like working with my father [...] <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt that I was protected from mistakes. ... If my art wasn’t correct, then Al would repair it. Oddly enough, Al said he never had to fix anything, claiming he just 'traced' over my pencils." [...] In a 1988 interview Williamson indeed stated that [...] "I'm just tracing [...] pencils" [...] and claimed that the only changes he made were occasionally leaving out an unnecessary background {{if he was in}} a rush.|$|E

500|$|While {{living in}} England Donen became {{a fan of}} the British variety show Beyond the Fringe and wanted to work with the show's comedy duo Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. The {{resulting}} film was Bedazzled, an updated version of the Faust legend in 1967. It was written by Cook with music by Moore, and also starred Eleanor Bron and Raquel Welch. Moore plays a lonely young man whose unrequited love of his co-worker (Bron) drives him to attempt suicide. Just then the devil (Cook) appears and offers him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. The film's fun-loving association with the Swinging London of the 1960s divided critics, but Roger Ebert called its satire [...] "barbed and contemporary... dry and understated", and overall, a [...] "magnificently photographed, intelligent, very funny film." [...] On the other hand, Time magazine called it the feeblest of all known variations on the Faust theme. The film was a hit and was especially popular among American college students. Donen considered it a favorite among his own films and called it [...] "a very personal film <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> said a great deal about what I think is important in life." [...] It was remade as Bedazzled by director Harold Ramis in 2000.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} cultural {{references to}} many American and British films. Woods becoming {{a convenience store}} clerk {{to prepare for a}} film is similar to Nick Lang (Michael J. Fox) becoming a police officer in the 1991 film The Hard Way, which Woods also starred in (interestingly, this is a reversal of roles: Woods played the cop that Lang was saddled with in the film). When Kent asks Homer if he is willing to go undercover to [...] "nail" [...] Apu, Homer replies: [...] "No way, man, get yourself another patsy!" [...] This is a reference to a line in the 1991 film JFK. The scene of Homer and Apu riding on mules to the Springfield Airport, with their luggage strapped to the mules' backs, is similar to a scene from the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia. In his Kwik-E-Mart job interview, the interviewer asks Woods why he would want to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, to which he replies: [...] "To be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm going to be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and, I kind of like to research my roles and really get into it. For instance, in True Believer I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then, the film Chaplin I had a little cameo <b>in</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> actually traveled back in time, back to the twenties, where... Well, I've said too much," [...] referencing the 1989 film True Believer and the 1992 film Chaplin.|$|E
500|$|In {{a notable}} {{contemporary}} act of conscience, Christian bushwalker Brenda Hean protested against the flooding of Lake Pedder despite threats and that {{ultimately lead to}} her death. Another was the campaign by Ken Saro-Wiwa against oil extraction by multinational corporations in Nigeria {{that led to his}} execution. So too was the act by the Tank Man, or the Unknown Rebel photographed holding his shopping bag in the path of tanks during the protests at Beijing's Tiananmen Square on 5 June 1989. The actions of United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld to try and achieve peace in the Congo despite the (eventuating) threat to his life, were strongly motivated by conscience as is reflected in his diary, Vägmärken (Markings). Another example involved the actions of Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson, Jr to try and prevent the My Lai Massacre in the Vietnam War. Evan Pederick voluntarily confessed and was convicted of the Sydney Hilton bombing stating that his conscience could not tolerate the guilt and that [...] "I guess I was quite unique in the prison system <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to keep proving my guilt, whereas everyone else said they were innocent." [...] Vasili Arkhipov was a Russian naval officer on out-of-radio-contact Soviet submarine B-59 being depth-charged by US warships during the Cuban Missile Crisis whose dissent when two other officers decided to launch a nuclear torpedo (unanimous agreement to launch was required) may have averted a nuclear war. In 1963 Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc performed a famous act of self-immolation to protest against alleged persecution of his faith by the Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem regime.|$|E

500|$|Peter Buck's {{style of}} playing guitar has {{been singled out}} {{by many as the}} most {{distinctive}} aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's [...] "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" [...] style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American folk rock band The Byrds. Buck has stated [...] " [...] Roger McGuinn was a big influence on me as a guitar player", but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including Big Star and The Soft Boys, that inspired him more. Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of Johnny Marr of alternative rock contemporaries The Smiths. While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by Marr, whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M. Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, [...] "I know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo, people go nuts, but I don't write songs that suit that, and I am not interested <b>in</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> can do it if I have to, but I don't like it." [...] Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by Paul McCartney of The Beatles and Chris Squire of Yes; Mills has said, [...] "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways [...] [...] [...] I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the kick drum, root note bass work." [...] Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said [...] "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and how she {{did not believe that}} the video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t even believe. In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you <b>in</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E
500|$|Usher and will.i.am {{shot the}} video {{the weekend of}} March 6, 2010. The video was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. In an interview with Rap-Up, Mandler said about {{the concept of the}} video: [...] "...The video is a spectacle. It really emphasizes what we love about Usher and the character and the icon that he is, and most importantly, it’s really a video that showcases his superstardom". The video was released on March 30, 2010, on VEVO and AMTV. According to Mandler, the original idea for the video was citing Max Headroom, a fictional artificial intelligence character from 1980s British television and film. The reference is made when Usher is seen on a flickering television {{at the beginning of the}} video. Mandler specified, commenting, [...] "Max Headroom was always in his room," [...] he continued, [...] "this unidentifiable room, '80s shapes. I used that for inspiration." [...] Usher stated that he wanted to do something theatrical and fun, and that while will.i.am. brought the international sound, he wanted to bring the producer into his world, [...] "working off of each other and playing off of each other as artists, but the cinematography would be artistic and incredible." [...] Mandler described the visuals in the clip as [...] "Hitchcock-ian", as well as simply capturing Usher in his element, as he said he wanted the R singer's talent to take over. He further explained, stating, [...] "The concept was to create a world where we put Usher in a space where he does what I think he does better than anyone else in the world, which is perform at a level and magnitude of a superstar and take us, the viewer, whether audible or visually, on a journey, not a ride. And, <b>in</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> wanted to create an unpredictability, so one set leads to another and another, and you never know what's gonna happen. Along the way, Usher becomes our guide. We're so focused on him, we don't notice the change. The thing is unfolding little by little, and you can't quite see far enough ahead to know what's gonna come next." ...|$|E
