5|$|For the {{production}} of the show, Gaga enlisted choreographer Richard Jackson and together with him and the Haus of Gaga, they came up with ideas regarding how the show should be constructed and what music should be performed. They also {{had to find a way}} to co-mingle all the different ideas to make a single, coherent show. For the choreography, which encompassed all the stages present, Jackson had to employ a different approach, so that the audience could see the performance <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first to use the newly {{developed}} MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan uses 32 surrounding cameras to capture actors' facial expressions <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle,</b> resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge {{whether or not they are}} lying. The game uses full motion capture actors to record the voices and movements of the characters. Over twenty hours of voice work was recorded for the game.|$|E
5|$|L.A. Noire {{is notable}} for using Depth Analysis's newly {{developed}} technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle.</b> The technology {{is central to}} the game's interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge {{whether or not they are}} lying. L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly five million copies combined. L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files, a subset of the game's cases for virtual reality support through the HTC Vive, will be released in November 2017.|$|E

5|$|In China, {{silk-worm}} farming {{was originally}} restricted to women, and many women {{were employed in}} the silk-making industry. Even though some saw {{the development of a}} luxury product as useless, silk provoked such a craze among high society that the rules in the Li Ji were used to limit its use {{to the members of the}} imperial family. For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, because of its shimmering appearance. This appearance was due to silk's prism-like shape/structure, which refracted light <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle.</b> After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society. Silk began to be used for decorative means and also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, and bow making. Peasants did not have the right to wear silk until the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).|$|E
5|$|Team Bondi {{began to}} develop L.A. Noire {{following}} their founding in 2004. Initially due {{to be published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment, the publishing rights were later handed over to Rockstar Games in September 2006. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, the work was shared between Team Bondi and multiple Rockstar studios around the world. Unlike other games by Rockstar, which run on their proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine, L.A. Noire uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software. The game is notable for being the first to use MotionScan, developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan functions by recording actors with 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle,</b> resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge {{whether or not they are}} lying. Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget at more than US $50 million, which would make it one of the most expensive video games ever made.|$|E
5|$|The {{convergence}} {{of the two}} columns on the French at Ostrach demonstrated {{the advantage of the}} superiority of Austrian numbers. <b>From</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle,</b> the Austrians threatened to overwhelm the French. Jourdan wrote that his men disappeared under a cloud of red coats. Battalion after battalion of Austrians threw themselves against the French defenses. By late morning, Charles' troops pushed the French out of Hoßkirch, and into Ostrach, which the French nearly lost until Jourdan sent reinforcements. The fighting remained fierce until about 1600, when the French pulled back toward Pfullendorf, encouraged by Austrian cavalry. Once out of Ostrach, and established on the road at and around Pfullendorf, the French formed a new perimeter, reinforced by reserves of Soulham, and enjoyed the benefit of altitude from which they could fire down upon the attacking Austrians. Despite the punishing musket fire, Charles' strategy worked. The far right wing (Ferino's force), which had not been attacked yet, fell back to Salem Abbey, to maintain communication with the French center.|$|E

5|$|They first {{prepared}} a cheval de frise to prevent British ships from sailing up the Hudson and outflanking the American position. For {{more than a}} month, the troops transported boulders from the heights of Manhattan {{to the edge of}} the river, where they loaded them into a collection of hulks and cribs made of timber and stretched it across the river. When the cheval de frise was finished, they began work on the fort. Little soil covered the rocky surface, so men had to haul soil up from the low ground. They were unable to dig the customary ditches or trenches around the fort. The fort was built in the shape of a pentagon with five bastions. The main walls were made of earth, constructed with ravelins with openings for guns <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle.</b> The fort enclosed a total of three to four acres. The troops built an abbattis around the fort. After the barracks were finished in September, all the troops in the area were placed under the command of Major General William Heath. Washington established his headquarters near the fort.|$|E

25|$|To {{create the}} alien water tentacle, Cameron {{initially}} considered cel animation or a tentacle sculpted in clay and then animated via stop-motion techniques with water reflections projected onto it. Phil Tippett suggested Cameron contact Industrial Light & Magic. The special visual effects work was divided up among seven FX divisions with motion control work by Dream Quest Images and computer graphics and opticals by ILM. ILM designed {{a program to}} produce surface waves of differing sizes and kinetic properties for the pseudopod. For the moment where it mimics Bud and Lindsey's faces, Ed Harris had eight of his facial expressions scanned while twelve of Mastrantonio's were scanned via software used to create computer-generated sculptures. The set was photographed <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle</b> and digitally recreated so that the pseudopod could be accurately composited into the live-action footage. The company spent six months to create 75 seconds of computer graphics needed for the creature. The film was to have opened on July 4, 1989, but its release was delayed {{for more than a}} month by production and special effects problems. The animated sequences were supervised by ILM animation director Wes Takahashi.|$|E

25|$|In 1938, {{champion}} Joe Louis {{announced that}} he would face Schmeling for the title. The rematch became an instant international sensation. Many clamored impatiently for its happening, but others, afraid of international tensions and the possibility of Hitler taking over the championship, protested. The controversy and ballyhoo led to the event becoming the most anticipated boxing match since the rematch between Dempsey and Gene Tunney, or possibly earlier. Louis, with his poor, black roots was adopted by American fans as the symbol of America as a land of opportunity. In contrast, Americans perceived Schmeling and his ties to Hitler as an obvious threat to those opportunities and ideals. When the German walked to the ring at Yankee Stadium on 22 June 1938, he did so under a hail of garbage thrown from the stands. Louis came out blazing in the first round and Schmeling tried to counter-punch as he had in the first bout, but to no avail. Driven into the ropes and battered with a fusillade of short, crisp blows <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle,</b> Schmeling turned his back to his opponent and clutched onto the ropes, letting out a scream that even years later, many spectators could recall vividly. Schmeling later said that he screamed because he had been hit with a blow to the kidneys. Schmeling's knees buckled under the punishment, and referee Arthur Donovan pushed Louis away, beginning a count on Schmeling. Schmeling reluctantly stepped away from the ropes, and Donovan allowed him to continue. A few punches later, Schmeling was knocked down again. From then on, he was helpless. He rose but fell moments later, and Donovan stopped the fight.|$|E
500|$|Biden's most {{important}} role {{within the administration}} was to question assumptions, playing a contrarian role. Obama said that [...] "The best thing about Joe {{is that when we}} get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle,</b> and that is very valuable for me." [...] Another senior Obama advisor said Biden [...] "is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible." [...] On June 11, 2010, Biden represented the United States at the opening ceremony of the World Cup, attended the England v. U.S. game which was tied 1–1, and visited Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa.|$|E
500|$|Fowler sealed this {{reputation}} as he scored more than 30 goals for three consecutive seasons, up to 1997.

Fowler's partnership with Steve McManaman was largely described as the reason why Liverpool had become the club known for being the most potent attacking force in England at the time, and Fowler was renowned for scoring goals of all varieties, <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle</b> and distance, with McManaman describing him as the [...] "greatest goalscorer of all time." ...|$|E

500|$|L.A. Noire {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first game to use the newly {{developed}} technology MotionScan, developed by Australian company Depth Analysis. MotionScan is a motion capture technology that records {{the face of an}} actor at over 1000 frames per second. This technology is crucial to the game's interrogation mechanic, which requires players to use suspects' facial reactions to questioning to judge {{whether or not they are}} lying. MotionScan functions by recording actors with 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle,</b> resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a moving human face. Despite using 32 cameras, not all are required; Oliver Bao, head of Depth Analysis R, said that the extra samples allow the team to [...] "reconstruct a better 3D surface in general" [...] and to [...] "remove reconstruction noise a little more easily".|$|E
500|$|There {{was also}} a real Dayton out there, a charming Ohio city, famous as {{the birthplace of the}} Wright brothers. Its {{citizens}} energized us from the outset. Unlike the population of, say, New York City, Geneva or Washington, which would scarcely notice another conference, Daytonians were proud to be part of history. Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the [...] "temporary center of international peace". The local newspapers and television stations covered the story <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle,</b> drawing the people deeper into the proceedings. When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown, people crowded around, saying that they were praying for us. Warren Christopher was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant. Families on the air base placed [...] "candles of peace" [...] in their front windows, and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base. One day they formed a [...] "peace chain", although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight-thousand-acre base. Ohio's famous ethnic diversity was on display.|$|E
500|$|Carson, {{a fellow}} Dubliner who had {{attended}} Trinity College, Dublin {{at the same}} time as Wilde, cross-examined Wilde on how he perceived the moral content of his works. Wilde replied with characteristic wit and flippancy, claiming that works of art are not capable of being moral or immoral but only well or poorly made, and that only [...] "brutes and illiterates," [...] whose views on art [...] "are incalculably stupid", would make such judgements about art. Carson, a leading barrister, diverged from the normal practice of asking closed questions. Carson pressed Wilde on each topic <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle,</b> squeezing out nuances of meaning from Wilde's answers, removing them from their aesthetic context and portraying Wilde as evasive and decadent. While Wilde won the most laughs from the court, Carson scored the most legal points. To undermine Wilde's credibility, and to justify Queensberry's description of Wilde as a [...] "posing...somdomite", Carson drew from the witness an admission of his capacity for [...] "posing", by demonstrating that he had lied about his age on oath. Playing on this, he returned to the topic throughout his cross-examination.|$|E

40|$|To bring {{something}} new to discussions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not easy. It has been discussed <b>from</b> almost <b>every</b> <b>angle</b> imaginable and yet defies agreement.

Yet in this connection, Rosemary Hollis argues that it is worthwhile exploring further just {{what is meant by}} national or cultural identity, using British representations of the Palestinians as a case study...|$|R
50|$|Pratt {{was also}} {{quarterback for the}} {{football}} team. The 1892 team, which he captained, is considered “the greatest football team of which Amherst can boast”. They played thirteen games, all with other college teams, won 8 and lost 5, scored 314 to opponents 141. On November 18, 1892, Amherst beat Williams on Weston Field at Williamstown, 60-0. Pratt kicked ten goals <b>from</b> almost <b>every</b> <b>angle</b> of the field, most of them against the wind. This record still stands today as the best goal-kicking exhibition of any Amherst player in a major game.|$|R
500|$|Martin Campbell {{spent three}} days of {{preparation}} on the [...] "Box" [...] set, analyzing it <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle</b> to learn {{the feel of the}} room. Fontana comes from a playwriting background, and [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] involves long lengths of dialogue in a single setting, much like a play. The actors shot about 14 pages of dialogue each day, and had a very small amount of rehearsal time before shooting. According to Fontana, Campbell never shot a scene from the same angle twice, [...] "So the entire hour keeps changing {{the point of view of}} the camera, so that you never get tired of being in that room." [...] While filming the episode, Campbell would shoot single scenes with multiple pages of long dialogue, then film the scene again from another angle. Braugher said the experience felt more like staging a play than shooting a television episode, and allowed for a feeling of spontaneous human emotion in the performances. Although the dialogue in the final episode did not stray from the original script, Fontana said Campbell and the actors came up with the rhythm and pacing of the performances largely on their own, particularly during the fast-paced questions when Pembleton and Bayliss team up on Tucker.|$|E
500|$|The retrochoir extends {{across the}} east end of the choir and into the east transepts. At its centre the vault is {{supported}} by a remarkable structure of angled piers. Two of these are so placed as to complete the octagonal shape of the Lady Chapel, a solution described by Francis Bond as [...] "an intuition of Genius". The piers have attached shafts of marble, and, with the vaults that they support, create a vista of great complexity <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle.</b> The windows of the retrochoir are in the Reticulated style like those of the Lady Chapel, but are fully Flowing Decorated in that the tracery mouldings form ogival curves. The plan of this area between the presbytery and the Lady Chapel is unique, and {{it has been suggested that}} the failure to procure the canonization of Bishop William of March led to a shortening of the presbytery as space was no longer needed for his shrine. There was then a consequent need to fill in the resulting extra space behind the High Altar. It was done ingeniously and beautifully. A similar situation had arisen at St Albans Abbey, where the old apse had been removed leaving space between the Lady Chapel and the shrine of St Alban. The space there, however, was not treated as imaginatively as it was at Wells.|$|E
500|$|Video content {{director}} [...] George Elizando {{and video}} engineer Steven Davis controlled the video surfaces using a Pinnacle i9000 switcher and an expanded Vista Systems Spyder system. Graphics on the LED walls were fed from a custom video playback system that incorporated three Green Hippo media servers; {{some of the}} video content was filmed during rehearsals and were meant for Cyrus to interact with onstage. Visual magnification was executed through the usage of Ikegami Tsushinki HL-45 cameras and multiple strategically located point-of-view cameras, in order to cover the show <b>from</b> <b>every</b> <b>angle.</b> Extensive amounts of teamwork was necessitated {{to set up the}} complex video system at each venue, particularly for weekend daytime performances, as they had less time. Mark Woody, Steve [...] "Bone" [...] Gray, Justin McLean, and Dane Mustola set up the video structures, while Evan Huff and crew chief Eric Geiger built the video thrust into the audience and installed the live cameras. [...] "Thanks to these talented designers a show commensurate with Hannah's popularity has been created", said Paul Becher, co-CEO of Nocturne Productions. For audio, Cyrus used Sennheiser's MD 5235 dynamic capsule atop the SKM 5200 wireless handheld transmitter nightly. Sixteen channels of Sennheiser G2 wireless monitors were programmed to ensure that performers could hear what was being played amidst massive, and fervid screams from the audience. Sennheiser 500 series wireless guitar and bass systems were also used.|$|E

60|$|Burton {{listened to}} his junior's attack unresentingly but with {{increasing}} bewilderment.
