However, in the Murnaghan equation, K' is constant and set to its initial value. In particular, the value K'0 = 5/3 becomes inconsistent with the theory under some situations. In fact, when extrapolated, the behavior predicted by the Murnaghan equation becomes quite quickly unlikely [...]|$|E

Addition of a trace of any alkali to tap or distilled water also provides an effective blueing solution; {{a few drops of}} strong ammonium hydroxide or of saturated aqueous lithium carbonate, added immediately before use, are sufficient for a 400 ml staining dish full of water. Use of very cold water slows down the blueing process, whereas warming accelerates it. In fact, the use of water below 10 °C for blueing sections may even produce pink artifact discolourations in the tissue.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} fixatives and enzymatic digestion procedures on the immunohistochemical demonstration of fibronectin and laminin in paraffin embedded tissues have been compared. None of the fixatives tested enabled staining of these proteins without enzymatic digestion. No intracytoplasmic laminin was found either in fixed or in fresh frozen tissue. Fixation in formol acetic acid <b>was</b> <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>for</b> demonstration of fibronectin; prolonged fixation in formol sublimate <b>was</b> <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>for</b> demonstration of laminin. Optimal results were achieved after fixation in routine 10 % formol saline. Trypsin was completely ineffective for unmasking laminin antigens except after fixation in ethanol acetic acid; {{it was only}} partially effective for showing fibronectin antigens. The best results were obtained with protease digestion, but pepsin was an adequate, although slightly less reliable, alternative. These enzymes may be used at lower concentrations than usually recommended...|$|R
