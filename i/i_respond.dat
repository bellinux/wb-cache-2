She then makes a proposition, which is, in effect, that she has seen us much together; that it appears to her that I am for the passing time the cat of the house, the friend of the family; that her curiosity and her chagrins awaken the fancy to be acquainted with their movements, to know the manner of their life, how the fair Gowana is beloved, how the fair Gowana is cherished, and so on.

It will be an immense thing to see you when your own conditions permit of it, and in that fond vision I hang on. I have been having a regular hell of a summer and autumn (that is more particularly from the end of July:) through the effect of a bad--an aggravated--heart-crisis, during the first weeks of which I lost valuable time by attributing (under wrong advice) my condition to mistaken causes; but I am in the best hands now and apparently responding very well to very helpful treatment. But the past year has made me feel twenty years older, and, frankly, as if my knell had rung. Still, I cultivate, I at least attempt, a brazen front. I shall not let that mask drop till I have heard your thrilling story. Do intensely believe that <b>I</b> <b>respond</b> clutchingly to your every grasp of me, every touch, and would so gratefully be a re-connecting link with you here--where I don't wonder that you're bewildered. (It will be indeed, as far as I am concerned, the bewildered leading the bewildered.) I have [...] "seen" [...] very few people--I see as few as possible, I can't stand them, and all their promiscuous prattle, mostly; so that those who have reported of me to you must have been peculiarly vociferous. I deplore with all my heart your plague of boils and of insomnia; I haven't known the former, but the latter, alas, is my own actual portion. I think I shall know your rattle of the telephone as soon as ever I shall hear it. Heaven speed it, dearest Hugh, and keep me all fondestly yours, ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>respond</b> {{with joy}} to your {{suggestion}} in your beautiful letter of two days ago--that I shall {{enable you to}} find a word from me on your table on the darkest a. m. of the year; {{in the first place}} because I am much touched by your attaching to any word of mine any power to comfort or charm; and in the second because I can well measure--by my own--your sense of a melancholy from which you must appeal. It is indeed a lugubrious feast and a miserable merriment. But it is something to spend the evil season by one's own poor hearthstone (save that yours is opulent), crouching over the embers and chuckling low over all the dreadful places where one is not! I've been literally pressed to go to two or three--one of them in Northumberland! (the cheek of some people!) and the reflection that I might be there and yet by heaven's mercy am not, does give a faint blush as of the rose to my otherwise deep depression. It is a mild, gray, rainless, sunless inoffensive sort of Xmas here--and the shop fronts look rather prettily pink and green and golden in the dear dirty old London streets--and I have ventured into three or four--but I do it, bless you, for nine and sevenpence half-penny, all told! No wonder you want epistolary balm if you're already in the fifties! Do you give them diamond necklaces and Arab horses all round?--But Torquay, I too intensely felt, has gorgeous ways of its own. Really it isn't bad here, for almost every one has left town. I have yet had nothing worse to suffer than a first night at the Lyceum--the too great Irvingism of which--mainly in Ellen Terry's box--had been, the same day, pleasantly mitigated, in advance, by Tessa Gosse in Sheridan's Critic. Tessa had a play and acted Mr Puff better than any of her blushing fellow-nymphs acted anything else. And on New Year's eve I go to her parents for a carouse of some sort, and until then, thank God! I don't dine out save on Xmas day. Nor in 1897--by all that's holy! ever again! I have been quite smothered with it these two months--and it's getting far beyond a joke.... I see no literary fry, and languish in incorrigible obscurity. I had a fevered dream that The Other House might reach a second edition--but it declines to do anything of the sort, and the pauper's grave continues to yawn. Nevertheless--as it is assured any way--I may go to Italy on April 1st. Meanwhile, my dear Norris, I think of you with a degree of envy which even the manners of Topper scarce avail to diminish--I mean because you have a beautiful home and are so many miles nearer than I am to nature. You are also nearer to Miss Norris, and that is another advantage, even though it does make a hole in Â£50! I have nothing better to offer her on Xmas a.m. than the very friendly handshake of yours and hers, my dear Norris, affectionately and always, ...|$|E
6000|$|I have a {{beautiful}} Xmas letter from you and <b>I</b> <b>respond</b> to it on the spot. It tells me charming things of you--such as your moving majestically from one beautiful home to another, apparently still more beautiful; such as the flow of your inspiration never having been more various and more torrential--and all so deliciously remunerated an inspiration; such as your having been on to dear C. E. N.'S obsequies--what a Cambridge date that, even for you and me--and having also found time to see and [...] "appreciate" [...] my dear collaterals, of the two generations (aren't they extraordinarily good and precious collaterals?); such, finally, as your recognising, with so fine a charity, a [...] "message" [...] in the poor little old [...] "Siege of London," [...] which, in all candour, affects me as pretty dim and rococo, though I did lately find, in going over it, that it holds quite well together, and I touched it up where I could. I have but just {{come to the end}} of my really very insidious and ingenious labour on behalf of all that series--though it has just been rather a blow to me to find that I've come (as yet) to no reward whatever. I've just had the pleasure of hearing from the Scribners that though the Edition began to appear some 13 or 14 months ago, there is, on the volumes already out, no penny of profit owing me--of that profit to which I had partly been looking to pay my New Year's bills! It will have landed me in Bankruptcy--unless it picks up; for it has prevented my doing any other work whatever; which indeed must now begin. I have fortunately broken ground on an American novel, but when you draw my ear to the liquid current of your own promiscuous abundance and facility--a flood of many affluents--I seem to myself to wander by contrast in desert sands. And I find our art, all the while, more difficult of practice, and want, with that, to do it in a more and more difficult way; it being really, at bottom, only difficulty that interests me. Which is a most accursed way to be constituted. I should be passing a very--or a rather--inhuman little Xmas if the youngest of my nephews (William's minore--aged 18--hadn't come to me from the tutor's at Oxford with whom he is a little woefully coaching. But he is a dear young presence and worthy of the rest of the brood, and I've just packed him off to the little Rye annual subscription ball of New Year's Eve--at the old Monastery--with a part of the [...] "county" [...] doubtless coming in to keep up the tradition--under the sternest injunction as to his not coming back to me [...] "engaged" [...] to a quadragenarian hack or a military widow--the mature women being here the greatest dancers.--You tell me of your [...] "Roman book," [...] but you don't tell me you've sent it me, and I very earnestly wish you would--though not without suiting the action to the word. And anything you put forth anywhere or anyhow that looks my way in the least, I should be tenderly grateful for.... I should like immensely to come over to you again--really like it and for uses still (!!) to be possible. But it's practically, materially, physically impossible. Too late--too late! The long years have betrayed me--but I am none the less constantly yours all, ...|$|E
60|$|To this fact, {{as it were}} of nature, <b>I</b> <b>responded</b> instinctively; {{which may}} {{be taken as a}} proof that for a moment I must have been robbed of my reason.|$|R

6000|$|I {{see them}} in any case as old-world images, figures of an antique stamp; products, mustn't they have been, of an order in which some social {{relativity}} or matter-of-course adjustment, some transmitted form and pressure, were still at work? Mr. Dolmidge, inordinately lean, clean-shaved, as was comparatively uncommon then, and in a swallow-tailed coat and I think a black satin stock, was surely perfect in his absolutely functional way, a pure pen-holder of a man, melancholy and mild, who taught the most complicated flourishes--great scrolls of them met our view {{in the form of}} surging seas and beaked and beady-eyed eagles, the eagle being so calligraphic a bird--while he might just have taught resignation. He was not at all funny--no one out of our immediate family circle, in fact almost no one but W. J. himself, who flowered in every waste, seems to have struck me as funny in those years; but he was to remain with me a picture of somebody in Dickens, one of the Phiz if not the Cruikshank pictures. Mr. Coe was another affair, bristling with the question of the [...] "hard," [...] but somehow too with the revelation of the soft, the deeply attaching; a worthy of immense stature and presence, crowned as with the thick white hair of genius, wearing a great gathered or puckered cloak, with a vast velvet collar, and resembling, as he comes back to me, the General Winfield Scott who lived so much in our eyes then. The oddity may well even at that hour have been present to me of its taking so towering a person to produce such small [...] "drawing-cards"; it was as if some mighty bird had laid diminutive eggs. Mr. Coe, of a truth, laid his all over the place, and though they were not of more than handy size--very small boys could set them up in state on very small desks--they had doubtless a great range of number and effect. They were scattered far abroad and I surmise celebrated; they represented crooked cottages, feathery trees, browsing and bristling beasts and other rural objects; all rendered, as I recall them, in little detached dashes that were like stories told in words of one syllable, or even more perhaps in short gasps of delight. It must have been a stammering art, but I admired its fluency, which swims for me moreover in richer though slightly vague associations. Mr. Coe practised on a larger scale, in colour, in oils, producing wondrous neat little boards that make me to this day think of them and more particularly smell them, when I hear of a [...] "panel" [...] picture: a glamour of greatness attends them as brought home by W. J. from the master's own place of instruction in that old University building which partly formed the east side of Washington Square and figures to memory, or to fond imagination, as throbbing with more offices and functions, a denser chiaroscuro, than any reared hugeness of to-day, where character is so lost in quantity. Is there any present structure that plays such a part in proportion to its size?--though even as I ask the question I feel how nothing on earth is proportioned to present sizes. These alone are proportioned--and to mere sky-space and mere amount, amount of steel and stone; which is comparatively uninteresting. Perhaps our needs and our elements were then absurdly, were then provincially few, and that the patches of character in that small grey granite compendium were all we had in general to exhibit. Let me add at any rate that some of them were exhibitional--even to my tender years, I mean; since <b>I</b> <b>respond</b> even yet to my privilege of presence at some Commencement or Commemoration, such as might be natural, doubtless, to any [...] "university," [...] where, as under a high rich roof, before a Chancellor in a gown and amid serried admirers and impressive applause, there was [...] "speaking," [...] of the finest sort, and where above all I gathered in as a dazzling example the rare assurance of young Winthrop Somebody or Somebody Winthrop, who, though still in jackets, held us spellbound by his rendering of Serjeant Buzfuz's exposure of Mr. Pickwick. Long was I to marvel at the high sufficiency of young Winthrop Somebody or Somebody Winthrop--in which romantic impression it is perhaps after all (though with the consecration of {{one or two of the}} novels of the once-admired Theodore of that name, which so remarkably insists, thrown in) the sense of the place is embalmed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>respond</b> {{without delay}} to {{the blessing of}} your letter of the 6th--which gives me so general a good {{impression}} of you all that I must somehow celebrate it. I {{like to think of}} your tranquil--if the word be the least applicable!--Chocorua summer; and as the time of year comes round again of my sole poor visit there (my mere fortnight from September 1st 1904), the yearning but baffled thought of being with you on that woodland scene and at the same season once more tugs at my sensibilities and is almost too much for me. I have the sense of my then leaving it all unsated, after a beggarly snatch only, and of how I might have done with so much more of it. But I shall pretty evidently have to do with what I got. The very smell and sentiment of the American summer's end there and of Alice's beautiful [...] "rustic" [...] hospitality of overflowing milk and honey, to say nothing of squash pie and ice-cream in heroic proportions, all mingle for me with the assault of forest and lake and of those delicious orchardy, yet rocky vaguenesses and Arcadian [...] "nowheres," [...] which are the note of what is sweetest and most attaching in the dear old American, or particularly New England, scenery. It comes back to me as with such a magnificent beckoning looseness--in relieving contrast to the consummate tightness (a part, too, oddly, of the very wealth of effect) du pays d'ici. It isn't however, luckily, that I have really turned [...] "agin" [...] my landscape portion here, for never so much as this summer, e.g., have I felt the immensely noble, the truly aristocratic, beauty of this splendid county of Sussex, especially as the winged car of offence has monstrously unfolded it to me. This afternoon an amiable neighbour, Mrs. Richard Hennessy, motored me over to Hurstmonceux Castle, which, in spite of its being but about ten miles [...] "back of" [...] Hastings, and not more than twenty from here, I had never yet seen. It's a prodigious romantic ruin, in an adorable old ruined park; but the splendour of the views and horizons, and of the rich composition and perpetual picture and inexhaustible detail of the country, had never more come home to me. I don't do such things, however, every day, thank goodness, and am having the very quietest summer, I think, that has melted away for me (how they do melt!) since I came to live here. I miss the tie of consanguinity--that I have so often felt!--and now (especially since your letter, for you mention his other plans) I find myself calling on the hoped-for Bill in vain. We lately have had (it broke but yesterday) a splendid heated term--very highly heated--following on a wholly detestable June and July and having lasted without a lapse the whole month up to now--which has been admirable and enjoyable and of a renewed consecration to this dear little old garden. I hope it hasn't broken for good, as complications, of sorts, loom for me next month--but the high possibility is that we shall still have earned, and have suffered for in advance, a fine August-end and September. My window is open wide even now--but to the blustering, softly-storming, south-windy midnight. And through thick and thin I have been very quietly and successfully working. It all pans out, I think, in a very promising way, but it is too [...] "important" [...] for me to chatter about save on the proved, or proveable, basis that now seems rather largely to await it. And I grow, I think, small step by small step, physically easier and easier, and seem to know, pretty steadily, more and more where I am.... I have been following you and Alice in imagination to the kind and beautiful Intervale hospitality--my charming taste of which has remained with me ever so gratefully and uneffacedly, please tell the Merrimans when you have another chance. You tell me that Alice and Harry lift all practical burdens from your genius--than which they surely couldn't have a nobler or a more inspiring task;--but what a fate and a fortune yours too--to have an Alice reinforced by a Harry, and a Harry multiplied by an Alice! L'un vaut l'autre--as they appear to me in the wondrous harmony. You don't mention Harry's getting to you at all--but my mind recoils with horror from the thought that he is not in these days getting somewhere. It's a blow to me to learn that Bill is again to hibernate in Boston--but softened by what you so delightfully tell me of your portrait and of the nature and degree of his progress. If he can do much and get on so there, why right he is of course to stay--and most interesting is it to learn that he can do so much; I wish I could see something--and can't your portrait be photographed? But I lately wrote to him appealingly; and he will explain to me all things. Admirable your evocation of the brave and brown and beautiful Peg--of whom I wish I weren't so howlingly deprived. But please tell her I drench her with her old uncle's proudest and fondest affection. I hang tenderly over Aleck--while he, poor boy, hangs so toughly over God knows what--and fervently do I pray for him. And you and Alice I embrace.|$|E
