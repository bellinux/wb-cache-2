40|$|In a {{quasi-experimental}} pre/posttest-treatment {{design the}} effect of the cognitive behavioral program <b>EQUIP</b> on cognitive distortions was investigated among high school youth with a mental retardation.

The sample consisted of an experimental group (n = 81) that participated in <b>EQUIP</b> and a control group (n = 35) that did not receive <b>EQUIP.</b> In the first grade, <b>EQUIP</b> was found to {{have an effect on the}} reduction of cognitive distortions (minimizing/mislabeling and assuming the worst).

None of the main categories of program integrity explained the effect of <b>EQUIP</b> on cognitive distortions. Finally, IQ did not moderate the effect of <b>EQUIP</b> on cognitive distortions.
