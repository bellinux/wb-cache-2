Moore's law states {{that the number of}} transistors per integrated circuit will double every four years. In order to successfully continue this trend of miniaturizing feature sizes, new, smaller sized patterning materials must be studied. Small molecule photoresists are being developed for high resolution patterning. Low molecular weight amorphous materials, or molecular glasses (MGs), have emerged as alternatives to polymeric <b>resist</b> <b>materials.</b> They combine the benefits of small molecular size with the favorable aspects of polymers, such as a high glass transition temperature (Tg) and the ability to form thin films. Inorganic-based nanoparticles are currently being explored as next generation photoresists. These materials are similar in architecture to MGs, but are comprised of an inorganic core that provides excellent thermal stability and resistance to plasma etching. This research focuses on the synthesis and characterization both MG and nanoparticle <b>resist</b> <b>materials</b> for high resolution patterning. The materials studied are designed for use with Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV-L), using a wavelength of 13. 5 nm.
