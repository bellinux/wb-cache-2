A similar reaction of the thiocarbenoid complex CpCr(CO) 2 (SCNMe 2) (4 a) yielded yellow crystalline solids of CpCr(CO) 2 (CNMe 2) (3 a, 16 %), a dark brown solid of Cp 4 Cr 4 S 2 -(CO) (CNMe 2) (7 a, 36 %), Cp 4 Cr 4 C 4 (10 % yield), and Cp 2 Cr 2 (CO) 4 (17 %).

The scene was written by Robert Kirkman, who based it closely on a similar sequence in the comics. Kirkman stated that he was very excited to develop the sequence and added that it was a familiar task for him:It was very exciting. I got to write the attack {{at the end of the}} episode—which was very much something that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself.

40|$|Abstract. We discuss ten “themes ” of <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> {{physics and}} show how {{they point to}} a general {{description}} of equilibrium <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> dynamics at a given temperature. This description is based on standard time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations for the density fields, stress tensor fields, potential energy density field, and fields quantifying molecular orientations. One characteristic aspect of {{the theory is that}} density has the appearance of a non-conserved field. Another characteristic feature is long-wavelength dominance of the dynamics, an assumption that not only simplifies the theory by allowing for an ultralocal Hamiltonian (free energy), but also explains the observed independence of chemistry. This is because, whereas there are no long-ranged static (i. e., equal-time) correlations in the model, there are important long-ranged dynamic correlations on the alpha time scale.

The advantages of the VLSD over other more conventional patterning methods (e. g., stenciling) include: versatility, flexibility, repeatability, accuracy, speed, little or no material waste, cost savings, and manufacturing control over the deposited liquid pattern.
