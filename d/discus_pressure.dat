40|$|This paper <b>discusses</b> the <b>pressures</b> {{and drivers}} {{of land use}} change, {{community}} values ascribed to land use and the policy tools {{that can be used}} to maximise the total value to the community. Land use pressures are particularly acute in Victoria - a small and densely populated state. Demand for land with specific attributes is increasing to support agricultural, horticultural and forestry production, environmental services and a range of social amenities including residential housing, recreation and key infrastructure needs. These alternative land uses are often in conflict - over space and time - which means public policy decisions made today will have implications for future generations. This paper <b>discusses</b> the <b>pressures</b> and drivers of land use change, community values ascribed to land use and the policy tools {{that can be used to}} facilitate the distribution of land uses to maximise the total value to the community. The paper draws on examples to highlight two broad trends in land use policy and governance arrangements: the use of market based instruments to meet policy objectives, and an increasingly devolved approach to public policy to manage land use.

However, this requires that companies acquire resources and skills in a significantly shorter time than earlier. This paper <b>discusses</b> the <b>pressures</b> that such development puts on company boundaries from the viewpoint of Finnish ICT companies. Our findings indicate that the rapidity of internationalisation is positively correlated with the number of foreign partners but reverse to our expectations, i. e., the more partners the firm has, the slower its start of international operations. Additionally, the study confirmed that a rapidly internationalising firm has a narrowly defined core competence. Surprisingly, rapidly internationalising firms searched for partners with similar type of competence instead of complementary one. This indicates that the associations between core competence and rapid internationalisation deserves more attention.

The HX consists of perforated double inner and double outer walls, as well as an innovative spiral design of the pipe bundle. Two investigation ways are considered, namely a detailed local approach by employing unit slice models and a simplified global approach. The unit slice models discretize accurately small parts of the HX, while the global models consider geometrical simplifications of the main HX components. ANSYS CFX was qualified for pressure loss simulations through perforated plates. At nominal conditions, the pressure loss estimated meets the requirements issued in the reactor design. 1...|$|R
40|$|Human {{activities}} and the resultant pressures they place on the marine environment have been widely demonstrated to contribute to habitat degradation, therefore, their identification and quantification is an essential step towards any meaningful restoration effort. The overall scope of MERCES Deliverable 1. 2 is to review current knowledge regarding the major marine pressures placed upon marine ecosystems in EU waters and the mechanisms by which they impact habitats {{in order to determine}} potential restoration pathways. An understanding of their geographical distribution is critical for any local assessment of degradation, as well as for planning conservation and restoration actions. This information would ideally be in the form of maps, which: (a) compile single or multiple {{activities and}} pressures over broad scales, integrating and visualizing available data and allowing direct identification of aggregations as well as gaps and (b) may be overlaid with habitat maps (or any other map layer containing additional information), thus combining different data levels and producing new information to be used for example when implementing EU policies. The deliverable also documents typical example habitat case studies, the prominent impacts and consequences of activities and pressures towards the identification of possible restoration or mitigation actions. Finally the deliverable <b>discusses</b> <b>pressures,</b> assessments, marine spatial planning and blue growth potential. Activities and pressures are used in a strict sense, where marine activities are undertaken to satisfy the needs of societal drivers (e. g. aquaculture or tourism) and pressures are considered to be the mechanism through which an activity has an actual or potential effect on any part of the ecosystem (e. g. for demersal trawling activity, one pressure would be abrasion of the seabed). Habitats are addressed using a nested approach from large-scale geological features (e. g. shallow soft bottoms) to species-characterised habitats (e. g. Posidonia meadows) {{because of the way they}} are referred to in current policy documents which lack standard and precise definitions...|$|R

40|$|This article <b>discusses</b> whether <b>pressure</b> ulcers formed while {{a patient}} is a {{resident}} {{in a nursing home}} can be considered an act of nursing negligence. It considers whether pressure ulcers are preventable and whether nurses can be held accountable for their formation. In the context of increasing legal action for negligence it recommends detailed record-keeping, using clinical guidelines and keeping up to date with current clinical thinking. An ethical framework is applied which includes a discussion of prima facie obligations. Many older people in nursing homes will be vulnerable to the formation of pressure ulcers. Through careful identification of risk factors and prompt interventions, care planning and evaluation, pressure ulcers can often be prevented. If they are preventable, it is debatable whether healthcare professionals should be held accountable for their formation. This article will discuss the ethical, legal and professional issues that surround pressure ulcer prevention and management.

40|$|Revised {{presentation}} to the Region XIII Diaconate Community 25 th Annual Conference, July 27 - 29, 2007 : "All One under the Son". Migratory streams to and from Latin America have created human ebbs and flows over a century-and-a-half, since the borderlands were divided by the bi-national boundary between Mexico and the U. S. In truth, what we know as the borderlands, an extended region of changing ecological, cultural and political dimensions, running from the Californias to the Caribbean basin, has articulated the movements of diverse peoples through deserts, mountains and wetlands since long before the nation-state defined North American geography. The present paper outlines the historical context for migratory flows {{to and from the}} U. S. and Latin America, through the portal of Mexico, in the light of major political events and economic circumstances. Noting the diverse composition of migrant and immigrant populations, it <b>discusses</b> the <b>pressures</b> arising from the global economy over the last three decades that have increased the northward migratory paths from Latin America and the Caribbean to the U. S. Finally, it points to the complex processes of cultural identity that evolve from the demographic and spatial movement of peoples, including issues of citizenship and national affiliation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Because of the {{practical}} importance of bluff bodies subjected fluid flow, fluid dynamics around two-dimensional bluff bodies, especially circular cylinders, has been studied in light of three major parameters, namely flow-induced force, surface pressure and wake. Though all the three are interrelated, the first two are the integrated behavior of flow velocity around the cylinder. Thus measurements of flow-induced forces, surface pressures and velocity fields are very important in the engineering discipline. This paper <b>discusses</b> force and <b>pressure</b> measurement results for two circular cylinders at gap-spacing ratio T/D varied from 0. 1 to 5 and the attack angle α from 0 ° to 180 ° where T is the gap width between the cylinders and D is the diameter of a cylinder.

40|$|One of {{the rare}} {{consensus}} among the different resources-base economic analytical approaches concerns to the strategic role of the mineral rent, as a decisive tool {{to assure that the}} temporary wealth generated in the present can turn into permanent income in the future. For this reason, the evaluation, distribution and use of the mining rent plays a central part in the mining city’s development process. The Brazilian legislation assures to the mining cities participation of the financial results of mineral extraction through the financial compensation for the mineral exploration (CFEM). CFEM is a kind of royalty ad valorem, which taxes varies to 0, 2 % until 3 % of the liquid revenue from mineral production. The legislation does not determine how those resources should be used therefore there are a wide variation in this among Brazilian mining cities. Undertaking a study from a sample of the 15 largest mining cities in eight Brazilian states allowed an identification of two main patterns in regards to the use of CFEM that were denominated "sustained use " and " the pitfall of the single treasury. " In that sense, the article <b>discusses</b> the <b>pressuring</b> factors that contribute to the patterns, as well the institutional arrangements that may be more favorable to inducing a sustained use of CFEM.
