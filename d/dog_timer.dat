5000|$|LPC111xL {{consists}} of LPC111x features, plus low power profile in active and sleep modes, internal pull-up resistors to pull-up pins to full VDD level, programmable pseudo open-drain mode for GPIO pins, upgraded to windowed watch <b>dog</b> <b>timer</b> with clock source lock capability.|$|E
5000|$|Toshiba {{developed}} the 84 pin Z84013 / Z84C13 and the 100 pin Z84015 / Z84C15 series of [...] "intelligent peripheral controllers", basically ordinary NMOS and CMOS Z80 cores with Z80 peripherals, watch <b>dog</b> <b>timer,</b> power on reset, and wait state generator {{on the same}} chip. Manufactured by Sharp as well as Toshiba. These products are today second sourced by Zilog.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, U.S. forces {{considered}} using armed dogs against fortifications. The aim {{was for a}} dog to {{run into}} a bunker carrying a bomb, which would then be detonated by a <b>timer.</b> <b>Dogs</b> in this secret program were trained at Fort Belvoir. The dogs, called [...] "demolition wolves", were taught to run to a bunker, enter it, and sit whilst waiting for a simulated explosion. Each dog carried a bomb strapped to its body in canvas pouches, as with the Russian method. The program was terminated on 17 December 1943 out of safety concerns. During the training, dogs often returned to the senders without entering the bunker or waiting there for supposed period of time which would have caused friendly casualties in a live fire situation. It was feared that in the actual battle, dogs would return much more often, scared by enemy fire. Attempts to continue the program in 1944 and 1945 failed.|$|R

This RL78/G13 microcontroller family included a +/- 1% on-chip oscillator, watch <b>dog</b> <b>timer,</b> RTC, power-on reset, low voltage detection, 26 channels of 10bit ADC, 16x16 Multiplier, 32/32 Divider, I2C, CSI/SPI, UART, LIN, multi-function timer array and also built-in IEC 60730 safety support in hardware.This combination of elements enables the system designer to achieve high performance (41DMIPS) systems operating at very low power levels and at low cost due to the high level of integration in the microcontroller.|$|E
40|$|Time {{synchronization}} {{is one of}} the {{key points}} in distributed of a real-time simulation system. At first, a distributed simulation system is introduced. Secondly, time synchronization method under 1 PPS signal is put forth. Thirdly, the relevant technology of time synchronization are studied, including system structure, SNTP, 1 PPS signal and control logic. Vxworks watch <b>dog</b> <b>timer</b> mode and timecard counter mode under this method are also analyzed in detail and the precision is presented. Fourthly, Arena software is chosen to model and simulate the time synchronization procedure. At last, the whole simulation model is constructed and the experiment results are given out to prove the efficiency of the synchronization method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{numerical}} relays {{have many}} advanced features compared to electromechanical relays. The family of relays is basically built with various technologies. The relays are accordingly segregated as electromechanical, solid-state, and numerical devices. A protective relay {{is expected to}} exhibit two important characteristics namely speed and accuracy. Other priorities like monitoring and recording becomes secondary before the latter ones. Though the numerical relays are reliable and exhibits relative merits the speed of operation is still a concern when compared with their solid-state counterparts. As a solution the idea of mixing the analog signals with numerical technology is becoming a latest development in the relay technology. As a high pitch of expectation from the society the relays are to be reliable and electricity supply should be highly secured. A quality of the supplied power in relation to continuity is another factor. Hence the numerical relay with the watchdog technology is looked as a solution. The objective of the research work is to design a mixed signal processing relay. The main feature of the architecture is inclusion of watch <b>dog</b> <b>timer.</b> The resoluteness of the watch <b>dog</b> <b>timer</b> is to shield the system from any failure of the software, such as program being trapped in an unintended loop. On the other hand if watchdog timer is eliminated from the circuitry the module can be configured as an interval timer and with this it can generate interrupts at selected time intervals. This relay finds extensive application in power protection. This mixed signal relay can be used various power protection systems like differential protection, over current protection, under voltage protection etc...|$|E
