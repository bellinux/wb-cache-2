5|$|The {{single-celled}} choanoflagellates {{resemble the}} choanocyte cells of sponges {{which are used}} to drive their water flow systems and capture most of their food. This along with phylogenetic studies of ribosomal molecules {{have been used as}} morphological evidence to suggest sponges are the sister <b>group</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of animals. Some studies have shown that sponges do not form a monophyletic group, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a common ancestor. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that comb jellies rather than sponges are the sister <b>group</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of animals.|$|E

With this booking, they persuaded bassist Jerome Arnold and drummer Sam Lay (both from Howlin' Wolf's touring band) to form a group with them in 1963. Their engagement at the club was highly successful and brought the <b>group</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of record producer Paul A. Rothchild.|$|E

5|$|In 1948, Sanford Myron Zeller {{circumscribed}} the {{new family}} Mycenastraceae, containing both Mycenastrum as the type genus, and Bovista. A 2001 molecular study supported {{the inclusion of}} Mycenastrum corium in the Lycoperdales, where it was traditionally placed. In a more recent (2008) cladistic analysis, Mycenastrum was {{shown to be a}} sister <b>group</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lycoperdaceae; authors Larsson and Jeppson agreed with Zeller (1949) and Pilat's (1958) decision to regard Mycenastrium as a monotypic genus in the separate family Mycenastraceae. Despite this, several taxonomic authorities prefer to fold Mycenastraceae into the Agaricaceae.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, {{the group}} was {{classified}} into the subclasses Oligochaeta and the Hirudinea. The oligochaetes contained the tubificids (Naididae, Lumbricidae, and Lumbriculidae - commonly the tube worms and the earthworms. The Hirudinea contained the leeches and the branchiobdellids. Modern analysis has revealed Branchiobdella and Hirudinea are two sister <b>groups</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lumbriculids and they are daughter <b>groups</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tree of oligochaetes. Hence, the terms Oligochaeta and Clitellata are considered synonymous.|$|R
5|$|In 2008, Ivakhnenko {{included}} the Akidnognathidae (as the Euchambersiidae) as the sister {{group of the}} family Whaitsiidae in the superfamily Whaitsioidea. However, other researchers {{do not include the}} Akidnognathidae in the Whaitsioidea. Phylogenies by Huttenlocker et al. found that the Akidnognathidae was instead closest to the Chthonosauridae, with the two forming the sister <b>group</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> group containing the Whaitsioidea and the Baurioidea. The topology recovered by the 2016 analysis of Huttenlocker et al. is shown below.|$|E
5|$|In San Francisco, a {{group of}} young men drive to an {{abandoned}} factory, and drug one of their members with LSD, leaving him to be torn apart by what he perceives to be a monster. Later, a large quantity of suspicious ash found in a nearby park is proven to be from human remains. A private investigative organisation, the Millennium Group, dispatches offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) to investigate the multiple homicide that led to this. Black believes that the victims were burnt alive; while chemical analysis of the ash leads the <b>Group</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same factory.|$|E
5|$|Insects can {{be divided}} into two groups {{historically}} treated as subclasses: wingless insects, known as Apterygota, and winged insects, known as Pterygota. The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish (Zygentoma). Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles, while Zygentoma and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia. The Zygentoma themselves possibly are not monophyletic, with the family Lepidotrichidae being a sister <b>group</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining Zygentoma).|$|E

50|$|If A is abelian, {{then the}} torsion {{subgroup}} T is a fully characteristic subgroup of A and the factor group A/T is torsion-free. There is a covariant functor from {{the category of}} abelian <b>groups</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> category of torsion groups that sends every <b>group</b> <b>to</b> its torsion subgroup and every homomorphism to its restriction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> torsion subgroup. There is another covariant functor from the category of abelian <b>groups</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> category of torsion-free groups that sends every <b>group</b> <b>to</b> its quotient by its torsion subgroup, and sends every homomorphism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> obvious induced homomorphism (which is easily seen to be well-defined).|$|R

They were even fewer in number than the Catholics; in 1797 the number of Jews in Corfu {{appears to have been}} only two thousand. Jewish presence in Corfu can be traced since the times of the Principality of Taranto. In Cephalonia, there is evidence of Jewish habitation in the old capital, the Castle of St. George, since the early 17th century. When the capital of the island was transferred to Argostoli the Jews resettled there.|$|E

In Epirus, Nico leads the <b>group</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Doors of Death. He works with Frank to summon and control the dead Roman legion against the cluster of monsters from Clytius. He and Hazel also use their ability to travel in the shadows to bring the group safely to the surface. Later he offered to take Athena Parthenos back to Camp Half-Blood with Reyna and Coach Hedge.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{give their}} {{name to the}} Pelecaniformes, an order which has a varied taxonomic history. Tropicbirds, darters, cormorants, gannets, boobies and frigatebirds, all {{traditional}} members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, Phaethontiformes, and the remainder into Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill have now been transferred into Pelecaniformes. Molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} shoebill and the hamerkop form a sister <b>group</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pelicans, though there is some doubt as to the exact relationships among the three lineages.|$|E

50|$|For each {{prime number}} p, this {{provides}} a functor from {{the category of}} abelian <b>groups</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> category of p-power torsion groups that sends every <b>group</b> <b>to</b> its p-power torsion subgroup, and restricts every homomorphism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> p-torsion subgroups. The product over the set of all prime numbers of the restriction of these functors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> category of torsion groups, is a faithful functor from the category of torsion <b>groups</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> product over all prime numbers of the categories of p-torsion groups. In a sense, this means that studying p-torsion groups in isolation tells us everything about torsion groups in general.|$|R
5|$|Phoronids, brachiopods and bryozoans (ectoprocts) are collectively called lophophorates, {{because all}} feed using lophophores.

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{has demonstrated that}} the Microsporidia, unicellular parasites of animals and protists, are fairly recent and highly derived endobiotic fungi (living within the tissue of another species). One 2006 study concludes that the Microsporidia are a sister <b>group</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> true fungi; that is, they are each other's closest evolutionary relative. Hibbett and colleagues suggest that this analysis does not clash with their classification of the Fungi, and although the Microsporidia are elevated to phylum status, it is acknowledged that further analysis is required to clarify evolutionary relationships within this group.|$|E
