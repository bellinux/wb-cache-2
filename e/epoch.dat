5|$|The lepton <b>epoch</b> was {{the period}} in the {{evolution}} of the early Universe in which the leptons dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second after the Big Bang, after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the hadron <b>epoch.</b> During the lepton <b>epoch</b> the temperature of the Universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created. Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons. The mass of the Universe was then dominated by photons as it entered the following photon <b>epoch.</b>|$|E

30|$|Similar {{to other}} {{research}} using two-tone alternating patterns [34, 40], standard and repetition deviant stimuli were averaged across tonal frequency stimulus types (e.g., all standard tones, {{regardless of whether}} they were low (A) or high (B) tones, were averaged together). The mean number of <b>epochs</b> accepted for averaging for each of these stimulus types was 214 for standard tone <b>epochs</b> and 66 for repetition deviant <b>epochs.</b> Data from the intensity deviant <b>epochs,</b> which evoke much larger ERPs and therefore do not test the sensitivity of the SVM approach, are not presented here.|$|R
3000|$|The {{performance}} of the SVM classifier was affected {{by a number of}} factors. First, the number of <b>epochs</b> used in the standard and deviant tone averaged waveforms was explored using a linear SVM. The accuracy of the classifier increased directly {{as a function of the}} number of <b>epochs</b> entered into the average. This result is entirely consistent with the general belief that the averaging process increases the SNRs of ERPs [1]. There was a consistent trend in which accuracy increased as the number of <b>epochs</b> entered into the average was increased from 2 to 40. The effect of number of <b>epochs</b> on the accuracy of the SVM was much more dramatic for serially [...] than randomly selected <b>epochs,</b> and achieved a higher accuracy when using 40 <b>epochs</b> in the serial condition. These results suggest that sequential effects that emerge over the stimulation protocol may have contributed to the accuracy of the classifier.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} arousals {{on the performance of}} actigraphy-based sleep/wake classification. Using a dataset of 15 healthy adults and a threshold optimized for this task we found that the percentage of sleep <b>epochs</b> with activity counts above that threshold was significantly larger in <b>epochs</b> with and following arousals. We also found that 41. 1 % of all false positive classifications occurred in these <b>epochs.</b> Finally, we determined that excluding these <b>epochs</b> from the evaluation led to a maximum precision increase of 17. 2 %. Considering wake detections in those <b>epochs</b> as correct led to a maximum precision increase of 31. 3 %. We concluded that unless arousals can be automatically identified or at least distinguished from wake, the performance of actigraphy-based sleep/wake classifiers is limited by their presence.

30|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that, {{as the number}} of <b>epochs</b> entered into the ERP waveform increases, the SNR of the ERP improves versus background EEG [1]. For the MMN, the number of <b>epochs</b> that {{is generally}} recommended for averaging is at least 150 [36], although robust MMNs have been observed with approximately 60 [34]. For this reason, the first SVM analysis explores the influence of number of <b>epochs</b> entered into the average on the accuracy of the classifier.|$|R
