50|$|Coleen, {{who works}} as a chambermaid at an inner city hotel, is joined by Damien, who has reluctantly taken a job at the hotel to earn some money during his summer vacation. Whilst working together, they {{discover}} <b>an</b> <b>unexpected</b> <b>attraction</b> to one another. It is during their last working day that they confront the significance of this relationship.|$|R
50|$|The newlyweds devise {{more and}} more cunning schemes to {{undermine}} each other, such as Jack telling Joy that their counseling session is canceled to prove she's not committed, and Joy inviting girls to their apartment {{to try to get}} Jack to cheat on her, throwing a party where Jack's friend Dave shows up. Jack gives Joy's ex-fiancé, Mason (Jason Sudeikis), her engagement ring back without Joy knowing. At Joy's job retreat, Jack and Joy find themselves developing <b>an</b> <b>unexpected</b> <b>attraction</b> to one another, and they soon realize that being with each other has brought out the best in both of them.|$|R
40|$|Public {{transport}} networks of fourteen cities of so far unexplored network size are analyzed in standardized graph representations: the simple graph {{of the network}} map, the bipartite graph of routes and stations, and both one mode projections of the latter. Special {{attention is paid to}} the inter-relations and spatial embedding of transport routes. This systematic approach reveals rich behavior beyond that of the ubiquitous scale-free complex network. We find strong evidence for structures in PTNs that are counter-intuitive and need to be explained, among these a pronounced diversity in the expression of typical network characteristics within the present sample of cities, a surprising geometrical behavior with respect to the two-dimensional geographical embedding and <b>an</b> <b>unexpected</b> <b>attraction</b> between transport routes. A simple model based on these observations reproduces many of the identified PTN properties by growing networks of attractive self-avoiding walks...|$|R
50|$|On Monk's {{first day}} {{back in the}} {{homicide}} division, he and Natalie meet Frank Porter and his granddaughter Sparrow. Monk is now being referred to not as Mr. Monk but as Captain Monk, since he is acting captain. Natalie <b>feels</b> <b>an</b> <b>unexpected</b> kinship with Sparrow. Then Monk disappears and {{is found in the}} evidence room lamenting how the Golden Gate Strangler, whoever he is, is upsetting Monk's beliefs about the balance of the universe. Monk instructs Porter to immediately double check the dead women's' credit card purchases and to map out the crime scenes.|$|R
50|$|Koenig {{pauses to}} collect a sample. Chipping at the wall, he <b>feels</b> <b>an</b> <b>unexpected</b> hand on his shoulder, turns—and beholds the doppelgänger. Before the Commander can react, the reflection-imposter renders him {{unconscious}} with an energy shock. After ripping the crystal sample {{from the wall and}} stowing it in Koenig's sample case, the replica appropriates his commlock and orders Carter to prepare for lift-off. Before leaving, it removes its mirror-image jacket and dons Koenig's. As it boards the Eagle, Carter notes the mysterious malfunction has resolved itself. Maya calls, requesting they postpone lift-off for her to get further readings from their sensors. The replica brusquely refuses and they depart.|$|R
50|$|Remembrance is {{an unusual}} wartime romance, {{inspired}} by two true but little-known stories: {{a man with an}} extremely rare memory condition, synesthesia, which literally prevented him from forgetting; and Camp X - a top secret training facility near Whitby, Ontario, that was used to train Canadian and Allied spies during World War Two. Against this backdrop, two strangers meet and, each for their own reasons, must struggle against <b>an</b> <b>unexpected</b> and dangerous <b>attraction.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{rational}} {{design of}} nanomedicines is a challenging task given the complex architectures {{required for the}} construction of nanosized carriers with embedded therapeutic properties and the complex interface of these materials with the biological environment. Herein, <b>an</b> <b>unexpected</b> charge-like <b>attraction</b> mechanism of self-assembly for star-shaped polyglutamates in nonsalty aqueous solutions is identified, which matches the ubiquitous "ordinary-extraordinary" phenomenon previously described by physicists. For the first time, a bottom-up methodology for the stabilization of these nanosized soft-assembled star-shaped polyglutamates is also described, enabling the translation of theoretical research into nanomaterials with applicability within the drug-delivery field. Covalent capture of these labile assemblies provides access to unprecedented architectures to be used as nanocarriers. The enhanced in vitro and in vivo properties of these novel nanoconstructs as drug-delivery systems highlight the potential of this approach for tumor-localized as well as lymphotropic delivery...|$|R

50|$|The novel {{starts with}} a {{portrait}} of Henry as a public figure who <b>feels</b> humiliated in <b>an</b> <b>unexpected</b> way, {{not just in the}} public side of his writing career but also in a more personal way, in which all the precautions he had taken to carry on with his life as he wished it to be, come to a crisis. Henry resolves to reduce his public life by buying a house in Rye and there he nurses his loneliness and is haunted by all the consequences his need to maintain a protected space in which to live and write has generated all through his life. He's in his fifties and he's very much aware of how he had to refuse the company of his ill sister, whom he adored, at some point, how he chose to stay away from his country and his family, how he felt to turn cold with a writer friend he had been very close to previously and becomes a bachelor with an unresolved sexuality, certainly close to homosexuality, living in a house with servants in the South of England and a daily visit of the stenographer to whom he dictates. The portrait of Henry, a man appalled by the Oscar Wilde case while repressing his self and his sexuality, shows a complex and ambiguous man. He copes with life by exerting control over how much he'd reveal, even to himself, and choosing to be a writer in order to achieve precisely that.|$|R
