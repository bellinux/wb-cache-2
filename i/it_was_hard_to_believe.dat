500|$|Michelle Erica Green {{watched the}} episode for TrekNation in August 2007, and {{described}} {{it as one of}} her favourite episodes from the first season. She thought it laid the groundwork for later episodes in The Next Generation, , and [...] regarding the Klingon culture. However, she felt that the drama seemed artificial and that the writers forced a situation where Worf had to kill one of the Klingons as if [...] "justifying the brutality as necessary for the good of Starfleet". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] also thought that the drama with Worf deciding whether or not to join the Klingons was problematic. He thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the crew seemed to know Worf as little as they did {{at this point in the}} series, but praised it for being the starting point for all future Klingon-based stories in the franchise. He gave it a score of three out of four.|$|E
500|$|The game's only {{points were}} {{scored on a}} field goal in the second quarter. [...] After Michigan drove to the Vanderbilt seven-yard line, the Wolverines lost yardage on first and second down. [...] On third down, Jack Blott was called into the backfield from his normal {{position}} at center. [...] Blott kicked a field goal from the 15-yard line. [...] A wire service account of the game noted, [...] "Both played crafty football, the fumbling that tended to mar the game being more than offset by swift, dashing interception of passes while {{the work of the}} linesmen on both sides was at top form." [...] The Michigan Alumnus summarized the game thus: [...] "Never surely was a game more lacking in spectacular features and thrills. For {{a good part of the}} time it gave one the same sort of feeling which was so common during the Great War, when a gain of a few yards was a matter for rejoicing, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that even the most dashing attack could accomplish any lasting results." ...|$|E
500|$|Washington Post {{journalist}} Erik Wemple {{criticized the}} story's graphic {{details of the}} alleged crime and said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> due to the [...] "diabolical" [...] description. A number of commentators accused the magazine of setting rape victims [...] "back decades", while The Washington Post described the Rolling Stone story as a [...] "catastrophe for journalism". Natasha Vargas-Cooper, a columnist at The Intercept, said that Erdely's decision not to interview the accused fraternity members showed [...] "a horrendous, hidden bias ... the premise {{that none of these}} guys would tell the truth if asked", while a staff editorial in The Wall Street Journal charged that [...] "Ms. Erdely did not construct a story based on facts, but went looking for facts to fit her theory." [...] Lauren Kling of the Poynter Institute criticized Rolling Stone for [...] "blaming [...] source" [...] instead of taking ownership of their own errors. Anna Merlan, a writer for Jezebel, who had earlier called Reason columnist Robby Soave an [...] "idiot" [...] for expressing skepticism of the Rolling Stone story, declared: [...] "I was dead fucking wrong, and for that I sincerely apologize." [...] Merlan had also labeled journalist Richard Bradley's doubts about the article a [...] "giant ball of shit".|$|E

[...] His mobile countenance mirrored every emotion so perfectly, each varying mood was portrayed so truly, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{that this man was}} naught but a pantomimist.

[...] The game featured few penalties, no injuries, and few substitutions. [...] Michigan made only three substitutions, and Vanderbilt not a one. Michigan completed 5 out of 16 passes for 90 yards. Vanderbilt completed just 1 of 5 for a 9-yard gain. A diagram of the game says this one pass was from Kuhn to Bomar.|$|E
2500|$|... 48 {{artefacts}} {{of silver}} tableware were found, {{with a total}} weight of around [...] The items were found in what {{appears to have been}} a storage pit, at a depth of about [...] below the modern ground level. They had been carefully placed within a large pottery bowl, which had been placed in the ground and covered over with dirt, accounting for their mostly very good state of preservation. The find came as a complete surprise to the archaeologists, who were used to finding small non-precious objects but had not expected to make a major discovery. According to Vrkić, [...] "It was hard to believe that it is silver, because they always find some small things, and when we find something half a meter long ... <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that it was silver and it was ancient." ...|$|E

[...] Another review in the same paper also commended the [...] "simple beauty of the story itself" [...] and also praised Beban's performance:"George Beban, who has the difficult role of Pietro Donnetti, gives a piece of character work that is truly marvelous.
