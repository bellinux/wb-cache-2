60|$|Contemporaneously {{with these}} {{investigations}} a remarkable discovery {{was made by}} Cagniard de la Tour. He found that common yeast is composed of a vast accumulation of minute plants. The <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>must,</b> or of wort, in the fabrication of wine and of beer, is always accompanied by the rapid growth and multiplication of these Toruloe. Thus, fermentation, {{in so far as}} it was accompanied by the development of microscopical organisms in enormous numbers, became assimilated to the decomposition of an infusion of ordinary animal or vegetable matter; and it was an obvious suggestion that the organisms were, in some way or other, the causes both of fermentation and of putrefaction. The chemists, with Berzelius and Liebig at their head, at first laughed this idea to scorn; but in 1843, a man then very young, who has since performed the unexampled feat of attaining to high eminence alike in Mathematics, Physics, and Physiology-- I speak of the illustrious Helmholtz--reduced the matter to the test of experiment by a method alike elegant and conclusive. Helmholtz separated a putrefying or a fermenting liquid from one which was simply putrescible or fermentable by a membrane which allowed the fluids to pass through and become intermixed, but stopped the passage of solids. The result was, that while the putrescible or the fermentable liquids became impregnated with the results of the putrescence or fermentation which was going on {{on the other side of}} the membrane, they neither putrefied (in the ordinary way) nor fermented; nor were any of the organisms which abounded in the fermenting or putrefying liquid generated in them. Therefore the cause of the development of these organisms must lie in something which cannot pass through membranes; and as Helmholtz's investigations were long antecedent to Graham's researches upon colloids, his natural conclusion was that the agent thus intercepted must be a solid material. In point of fact, Helmholtz's experiments narrowed the issue to this: that which excites fermentation and putrefaction, and at the same time gives rise to living forms in a fermentable or putrescible fluid, is not a gas and is not a diffusible fluid; therefore it is either a colloid, or it is matter divided into very minute solid particles.|$|E

In order to avoid uncertainties coming from the possible precipitation, we studied this opportunity on a grape must without any tartaric acid, known as forming complexes with potassium and calcium during the fermentation. The model is based on thermodynamic equilibrium of electrolytic compounds in solution. The dissociation constants depend on the temperature and the alcoholic degree of the solution. The average activity coefficients are estimated by the Debbye–H¨uckel relation. A fictive diacid is introduced in the model to represent the unmeasured residual species.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the increase in global average temperature, grapes with the adequate phenolic and aromatic maturity tend to be overripe by the time of harvest, resulting in increased sugar concentrations and imbalanced C/N ratios in fermenting musts. This fact sets obvious additional hurdles in the challenge of obtaining wines with reduced alcohols levels, a new trend in consumer demands. It would therefore be interesting to understand Saccharomyces cerevisiae physiology during the <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>must</b> with these altered characteristics. The present study aims to determine the distribution of metabolic fluxes during the yeast exponential growth phase, when both carbon and nitrogen sources are in excess, using continuous cultures. Two different sugar concentrations were studied under two different winemaking temperature conditions. Although consumption and production rates for key metabolites were severely affected by the different experimental conditions studied, the general distribution of fluxes in central carbon metabolism was basically conserved in all cases. It was also observed that temperature and sugar concentration exerted a higher effect on the pentose phosphate pathway and glycerol formation than on glycolysis and ethanol production. Additionally, nitrogen uptake, both quantitatively and qualitatively, was strongly influenced by environmental conditions.

A significant (p< 0. 01 or p< 0. 05) relationship between the addition of 100 mg/L of catechin, inositol or SO 2 to the grape must and the change in the metabolic behaviour of the yeasts was observed.

40|$|The {{winemaking}} process {{involves the}} alcoholic <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>must,</b> often followed by malolactic fermentation (MLF). The latter, mainly {{carried out by}} the lactic acid bacterium Oenococcus oeni, is used to improve wine quality when acidity reduction is required. Moreover, it prevents microbial spoilage and improves the wine's organoleptic profile. Prior observations showed that O. oeni is able to resist several months in harsh wine conditions when adhered on oak barrels. Since biofilm is a prevailing microbial lifestyle in natural environments, the capacity of O. oeni to form biofilms was investigated on winemaking material such as stainless steel and oak chips. Scanning Electron Microscopy and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy showed that O. oeni was able to adhere to these surfaces and form spatially organized microcolonies embedded in extracellular substances. To assess the competitive advantage of this mode of life in wine, the properties of biofilm and planktonic cells were compared after inoculation in a fermented must (pH 3. 5 or 3. 2 and 12 % ethanol) The results indicated that the biofilm culture of O. oeni conferred (i) increased tolerance to wine stress, and (ii) functional performance with effective malolactic activities. Relative gene expression focusing on stress genes and genes involved in EPS synthesis was investigated in a mature biofilm and emphasized the role of the matrix in increased biofilm resistance. As oak is commonly used in wine aging, we focused on the O. oeni biofilm on this material and its contribution to the development of wine color and the release of aromatic compounds. Analytical chromatography was used to target the main oak aging compounds such as vanillin, gaiacol, eugenol, whisky-lactones, and furfural. The results reveal that O. oeni biofilm developed on oak can modulate the wood-wine transfer of volatile aromatic compounds during MLF and aging by decreasing furfural, gaiacol, and eugenol in particular.

One hundred and eighty-two isolates were ascribed to 15 different species by PCR-ITS and RFLP, and partial sequencing of D 1 /D 2 domain 26 S rDNA gene. Metschnikowia pulcherrima (F’ = 0. 56, I’ = 0. 32), Hanseniaspora gulliermondii (F’ = 0. 49, I’ = 0. 27) and Cryptococcus flavescens (F’ = 0. 31, I’ = 0. 11) were the dominant yeasts found on grapes, whereas Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed the highest prevalence into wine samples. Seventy four isolates with fermentative potential were screened for oenological traits such as ethanol production, resistance to SO 2, and acetic acid, glycerol and H 2 S production. Three yeast strains (Kluyveromyces marxianus UMY 207, S. cerevisiae UMY 255, Torulaspora delbrueckii UMY 196) were selected and separately inoculated in vinifications experiments at a Georgian cellar. Musts were prepared from healthy grapes of local varieties, Goruli Mtsvane (white berry cultivar) and Saperavi (black berry cultivar). Physical (°Brix) and microbial analyses (plate counts) were performed to monitor the fermentative process. The isolation of indigenous S. cerevisiae yeasts beyond the inoculated strains indicated that a co-presence occurred during the vinification tests. Results from quantitative GC-FID analysis of volatile compounds revealed that the highest amount of fermentation flavours, such as 4 -ethoxy- 4 -oxobutanoic acid (monoethyl succinate), 2 -methylpropan- 1 -ol, ethyl 2 -hydroxypropanoate and 2 -phenylethanol, were significantly more produced in fermentation conducted in Saperavi variety inoculated with K. marxianus, whereas other aromatic compounds like 3 -methylbutyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate and dihydrofuran- 2 (3 H) -one (γ- butyrolactone) showed a higher content in Goruli Mtsvane variety samples fermented by S. cerevisiae.

Natural wine has been produced by spontaneous <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>must</b> by yeasts originated from grapes and winery equipment. The wide variety of natural yeasts reflects the biodiversity, which is still under-exploited despite the large use of commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae in most grape musts. During fermentation, several strains compete in the same fermenting must, and the dominance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae takes place when it overcomes all the others. The aim was to investigate Saccharomyces cerevisiae diversity and its technological behavior in two biodynamic wine farms in Tuscany. Autochthonous S. cerevisiae from Syrah fermentations were isolated and molecularly characterized in 2009 and 2013 harvests. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were isolated starting from Syrah musts with zero or low levels of sulphite added, according with the tendency of natural wines producers to abait every invasive operation during wine making. Samples were collected in different steps of winemaking. ITS-PCR method confirmed isolates belong to Saccharomyces sensu stricto complex. The multiplex PCR amplification of microsatellite loci (SC 8132 X, YOR 267 C and SCPTSY 7) discriminated S. cerevisiae strains. Genetically diverse S. cerevisiae strains were subsequently subjected to technological characterization. Micro-fermentations were set up to study fitness and quality traits of biotypes characterized. Weight loss kinetics were measured and chemical analyses were performed. Collected Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were tested also in order to verify the effect of low sulphite additions on biodiversity pursuing information about stress-adaptation mechanisms that allow the survival in the challenging environment of fermenting must. Sulphite addition may act as a selective factor to induce the presence and the activity of strains with diverse features about sulphite metabolism. The addition of different dose of sulphite induced a considerable variability among strains. However, some biotypes exhibited tolerance to certain concentration and only one biotype was classified as resistant to a determinate concentration. In addition, biotypes were subjected to an other environmental stress factor such as ethanol. The increasing of levels of ethanol limited considerably the activity of selected strains, but some of them highlighted a positive tolerance to various ethanol concentrations. During the harvest of 2013, the alcoholic fermentation was conducted inoculating a biotype characterized previously, which expressed good fermentative performance and a multi-strains culture of other S. cerevisiae strains characterized in the same harvest (2009) in a biodynamic farm from a workgroup of Edmund Mach Foundation of San Michele all'Adige (TN). The results of 2009 highlighted peculiar behaviors of 13 biotypes (characterized from four hundred isolates) that dominate the spontaneous fermentations. Not surprisingly, some biotypes were also found in fermentations of 2013, demonstrating yeasts are ubiquitous in that environment. Sensorial analyses of wine, originated by biotypes fermentation, revealed certain diversity in aroma and flavor traits, but also in the structure. Overall, this work suggests the consolidate relationship existing between autochthonous yeasts and the terroir, where yeasts are ubiquitous. Furthermore, autochthonous yeasts surely contribute to the unique identity of wine. In addition, this work suggests that the use of isolated and characterized autochthonous yeast strains could help the winemaking process, where the vintage could be inadequate to develop a particular product such as the wine of a specific wine farm...|$|E

Sequential inoculation led to the reduction of about half of the acetic acid content compared to the pure S. cerevisiae fermentation, but the ethanol and glycerol amounts were also low. A coinoculation with selected combinations of S. cerevisiae and C. zemplinina resulted in a decrease of ~ 0. 3 g of acetic acid/liter, while maintaining high ethanol and glycerol levels.

40|$|Interest {{is growing}} in the {{production}} of biohydrogen from algae through dark fermentation, as alternative to fossil fuels. However, one of the limiting steps of biohydrogen production is the conversion of polymeric carbohydrates into monomeric sugars. Thus, physical, chemical and biological pretreatments are usually employed in order to facilitate carbohydrates de-polymerization and enhancing biohydrogen production from algae. Considering the overall process, biohydrogen production through dark fermentation leads generally to negative net energy balances of the difference between the energy produced as biohydrogen and the direct ones (heat and electricity) consumed to produce it. Thus, to make the overall process economically feasible, dark <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> algae <b>must</b> be integrated in a biorefinery approach, where the outlets are valorized into bioenergy or value added biomolecules. The present study reviews recent findings on pretreatments and biohydrogen production through dark <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> algae looking at the perspectives of integrating side streams <b>of</b> dark <b>fermentation</b> from algal biomass, according to a biorefinery approac...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous {{alcoholic}} <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> grape <b>must</b> is {{a complex}} process, carried out by indigenous yeast populations arising from the vineyard or the winery environment and therefore representing an autochthonous microbial terroir of the production area. Microbial diversity at species and biotype level is extremely important {{in order to develop}} the composite and typical flavour profile of DOCG (Appellation of Controlled and Guaranteed Origin) wines. In this study, we monitored fungal populations involved in spontaneous <b>fermentations</b> <b>of</b> Aglianico and Greco di Tufo grape must by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of 18 S rRNA gene amplicons. We firstly proposed an alternative/addition to ITS as target gene in HTS studies and highlighted consistency between the culture-dependent and -independent approaches. A complex mycobiota was found at the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>fermentation,</b> mainly characterized by non-Saccharomyces yeasts and several moulds, with differences between the two types of grapes. Moreover, Interdelta patterns revealed a succession of several Saccharomyces cerevisiae biotypes and a high genetic diversity within this species...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt to}} produce yellow/golden wine {{was done in}} the {{laboratory}} using a mixture of fruits (33. 3 % each) as golden must extracted from Passiflora edulis (passion fruit), Mangifera indica (mango) and Ananas comosus (pineapple). After extraction of three juices, physical and chemical parameters were determined before and during <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>must.</b> These parameters were: wild yeast colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) <b>of</b> fermenting <b>must,</b> total soluble solids (degrees Brix), pH, alcohol content, titratable acidity in percent, fermentation temperature, sugar content (g/l), and specific gravity. The <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> a mixture of juices was done at room temperature, i. e., at 22 oC, and the wild yeast used was Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a strain called “musanzeensis ” isolated from local traditional banana wine. During substantial must fermentation, the pH decreased from 5. 5 for fresh juice to 3. 2 for wine, total soluble solids from 20 oBrix to 2 o Brix, titratable acidity increased from 0. 68 % to 1. 4 %, sugar content decreased from 85 g/l to 32 g/l, specific gravity decreased from 1. 040 to 1. 002, yeast growth increased from 3 to 18 log CFU/ml, an...|$|R
40|$|The {{alcoholic}} <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> Savatiano <b>must</b> variety {{was initiated}} under laboratory conditions and monitored daily with a gas sensor array without any pre-treatment steps. The sensor array consisted of eight interdigitated chemocapacitors (IDCs) coated with specific polymers. Two batches <b>of</b> fermented <b>must</b> were tested and also subjected daily to standard chemical analysis. The chemical {{composition of the}} two fermenting musts differed from day one of laboratory monitoring (due to different storage conditions <b>of</b> the <b>musts)</b> and due to a deliberate increase of the acetic acid content of one <b>of</b> the <b>musts,</b> {{during the course of}} the process, in an effort to spoil the fermenting medium. Sensor array responses to the headspace of the fermenting medium were compared with those obtained either for pure or contaminated samples with controlled concentrations of standard ethanol solutions of impurities. Results of data processing with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), demonstrate that this sensing system could discriminate between a normal and a potential spoiled grape must fermentation process, so this gas sensing system could be potentially applied during wine production as an auxiliary qualitative control instrument...|$|R
40|$|Vino cotto” is {{a typical}} product mainly {{produced}} in central Italy which is obtained by the <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> cooked <b>musts.</b> The antioxidant activity of nine “vino cotto” samples from the Abruzzo region was determined. The radical scavenging activity (RSA) and antioxidant power (AOP) of the samples resulted highly correlated both {{to the content of}} polyphenols and Maillard reaction products (MRPs). The polyphenols concentration and MRPs formation due to the cooking process showed to affect the RSA and AOP of vino cotto. The sum of the antioxidant activities of the isolated phenolic and non phenolic fractions resulted equal to the RSA of “vino cotto” samples. In highly browned vino cotto samples the antioxidant activity of the non phenolic fraction was higher than that of the phenolic fraction and could account up to the 56 % of the overall antioxidant activity...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to (i) isolate newly autochthonous yeast strains from the Tikveš region of Macedonia and (ii) test their impact on the quality of red wines from Vranec and Cabernet Sauvignon grape varieties. The newly isolated yeast strains were obtained by spontaneous <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> grape <b>must</b> from Vranec and Cabernet Sauvignon varieties collected from ten different micro-regions in Macedonia. The grapevines from both varieties grown in "Barovo" micro-region were the richest sources of yeast strains. In addition, the molecular identification and typing of strains were also carried out. The monomeric anthocyanins, polyphenolic content and other oenochemical characteristics of the wines were also compared with the wines from commercial yeast strain "SiHa". The Vranec wine from yeast strain F- 8 and Cabernet Sauvignon wine from yeast strain F- 20 had significantly (p< 0. 05) higher concentrations of monomeric anthocyanins and total phenolic compounds than other wines...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{recombinant}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EKD 13 overproducing mannoproteins {{has been}} used to obtain Albariño white wines. The inoculated strain prevailed and produced complete <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>must,</b> as also occurred in the case <b>of</b> spontaneous (non-inoculated) <b>fermentation</b> and in the must inoculated with the S. cerevisiae EC 1118 strain. The analytical study of the wines obtained showed that the most important chemical differences among the wines produced with EKD- 13, corresponded to the high concentration of mannoproteins, 2 -phenyl ethanol and tyrosol. These differences were attributed to the expression, during <b>must</b> <b>fermentation,</b> <b>of</b> genes modified in the recombinant EKD- 13 strain. The results obtained imply that this strain could be potentially useful to produce wines rich in mannoproteins that have distinctive characteristics compared to other similar wines, modifying the sensorial and technological parameters of the wines obtained. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the autochthonous non-Saccharomyces yeast populations involved in spontaneous <b>fermentations</b> <b>of</b> organic <b>musts</b> in the Abruzzo wine producing area. By using molecular methods, such as PCR-RFLP of the 5. 8 S-ITS region, sequence determination of D 1 /D 2 regions of the 26 S rDNA and RAPD-PCR, sixty-six isolated were characterized. Hanseniaspora uvarum, Metschnikowia fructicola and Candida zemplinina predominated, while Issatchenkia terricola, Issatchenkia orientalis and Hanseniaspora spp. were identified with a lower frequency. Moreover, strain typing and differentiation were carried out by RAPD-PCR. High strain polymorphisms were observed in the different species. For some strains appreciable properties were demonstrated both in vitro and in must. Some strains showed good fermentation performances, low production of acetic acid and a partial capability to degrade malic acid. Our data suggest that non-Saccharomyces strains isolated in this study could be suitable for the formulation of mixed or sequential starters together with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. [ [...] . ...|$|R
