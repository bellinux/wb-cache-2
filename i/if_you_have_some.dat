There's been some lunar transient events reported {{in the vicinity of}} Aristarchus." [...] Astronomers in Bochum, West Germany, had observed a bright glow on the lunar surface—the same sort of eerie luminescence that has intrigued Moon watchers for centuries. The report was passed on to Houston and thence to the astronauts. Almost immediately, Michael Collins reported back: [...] "Hey, Houston, I'm looking north up toward Aristarchus now, and there's an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area. It seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{four years}} of working on the project, Davis {{published}} Learning to Fly: An Uncommon Memoir of Human Flight, Unexpected Love, and One Amazing Dog in March 2013. Written after her difficult break up with Potter, it is about how she recovered {{from the loss of}} her partner and financial stability and used her developing love of skydiving to overcome her fear of falling. Described as [...] "gripping", it is a [...] "story of personal growth". She had faced a lot of fear free soloing, BASE jumping and sky diving and felt that she could offer people advice about facing fear in general. As she said in an interview, [...] "A big part of the reason I wanted to write the book is that most people have had experiences like this , or will, whether it's a relationship or a career or whatever," [...] she said in a recent interview. [...] "Even a happy person can become depressed. When you're in that place, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> kind of guidance, some ray of hope … What I knew to hold on to was climbing and this whole new world of skydiving and having new experiences. Life's about change. Don't be afraid." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You cannot escape {{liking the}} climate," [...] Cudworth said, in reply to my panegyric on the Kona coast. [...] "I {{was a young}} fellow, just out of college, when I came here {{eighteen}} years ago. I never went back, except, of course, to visit. And I warn you, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> spot dear to you on earth, not to linger here too long, else you will find this dearer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be true to yourself," [...] say the copy-book moralists, [...] "and {{you may be}} {{sure the}} result will at last be justified." [...] No doubt; but in how many centuries? And what sort of life will you lead yourself, meanwhile, for your allotted space of threescore years and ten, unless haply hanged, or burned, or imprisoned before it? What the copy-book moralists mean is merely this--that sooner or later your {{principles}} will triumph, {{which may or may}} not be the case according to the nature of the principles. But even suppose they do, are you to ignore yourself in the interim--you, a human being with emotions, sensations, domestic affections, and, in the majority of instances, wife and children on whom to expend them? Why should it be calmly taken for granted by the world that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> new and true thing to tell humanity (which humanity, of course, will toss back in your face with contumely and violence) you are bound to blurt it out, with childish unreserve, regardless of consequences to yourself and to those who depend upon you? Why demand of genius or exceptional ability a gratuitous sacrifice which you would deprecate as wrong and unjust to others in the ordinary citizen? For the genius, too, is a man, and has his feelings.|$|E

It would be like building a house on a rotten foundation.|$|R
6000|$|The {{consequence}} of this remark was another [...] "Pshaw!" [...] But Mrs. Peck went on: [...] "When you've lived opposite to people {{like that for a}} long time <b>you</b> feel as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> rights in them--tit for tat! But she didn't take it up today; she didn't speak to me. She knows who I am as well as she knows her own mother." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the writer}} (in spite of notorious {{examples}} to the contrary) must {{look to be}} ill-paid. Tennyson and Montepin make handsome livelihoods; but we cannot all hope to be Tennyson, {{and we do not}} all perhaps desire to be Montepin. If you adopt an art to be your trade, weed your mind at the outset of all desire of money. What you may decently expect, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> talent and much industry, is such an income as a clerk will earn with a tenth or perhaps a twentieth of your nervous output. Nor have you the right to look for more; in the wages of the life, not in the wages of the trade, lies your reward; the work is here the wages. It will be seen I have little sympathy with the common lamentations of the artist class. Perhaps they do not remember the hire of the field labourer; or do they think no parallel will lie? Perhaps they have never observed what is the retiring allowance of a field officer; or do they suppose their contributions to the arts of pleasing more important than the services of a colonel? Perhaps they forget on how little Millet was content to live; or do they think, because they have less genius, they stand excused from the display of equal virtues? But upon one point there should be no dubiety: if a man be not frugal, he has no business in the arts. If he be not frugal, he steers directly for that last tragic scene of LE VIEUX SALTIMBANQUE; if he be not frugal, he will find it hard to continue to be honest. Some day, when the butcher is knocking at the door, he may be tempted, he may be obliged, to turn out and sell a slovenly piece of work. If the obligation shall have arisen through no wantonness of his own, he is even to be commanded; for words cannot describe how far more necessary it is that a man should support his family, than that he should attain to - or preserve - distinction in the arts. But if the pressure comes, through his own fault, he has stolen, and stolen under trust, and stolen (which is the worst of all) {{in such a way that}} no law can reach him.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Third Way Magazine in 1995 he explained his intentions in his work: [...] "Satire is the bringing to ridicule of vice, folly and humbug.

5000|$|However, Bishop DuBourg {{was not a}} man to take no for an answer. He asked for, and {{received}} the assistance of the Vatican Curia and the Pope.

We earnestly recommend this matter to you, and We desire that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> subjects who are willing to go there and whom you judge proper for this pious work, that you should send them if it can be done.

Most people only have the time to read a few books a year, but just a single important insight could put them on the path to something great. What drives me is the idea that {{at some point in the}} future, the average person will possess much more knowledge than what is acceptable now. The possession of knowledge on its own doesn’t automatically translate into success, but what it does do is provide more references against which to check new information. For instance, it is easy to get swayed by some new idea or movement on social media or television, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> grounding in history or economics, you will be able to say, “This idea has come around before, and it didn’t work”. What has been shown to work is x, y or z." ...|$|E
