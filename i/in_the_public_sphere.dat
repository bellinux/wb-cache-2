5|$|Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst {{has argued}} that {{religious}} language is often political, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sphere,</b> and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists. Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.|$|E

In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation is dependent on the virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the 1790s, Johnson aligned {{himself with}} the {{supporters}} of the French Revolution, and published {{an increasing number of}} political pamphlets in addition to a prominent journal, the Analytical Review, which offered British reformers a voice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> In 1799, he was indicted on charges of seditious libel for publishing a pamphlet by the Unitarian minister Gilbert Wakefield. After spending six months in prison, albeit under relatively comfortable conditions, Johnson published fewer political works. In the last decade of his career, Johnson did not seek out many new writers; however, he remained successful by publishing the collected works of authors such as William Shakespeare.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{government}} policy to reduce identity to “just a Rwandan one” has only “been successful <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> of government rhetoric and bureaucracy.” In fact, ethnicity still remains socially relevant.

In rural India, however, caste origins are more readily apparent and Dalits often remain excluded from local religious life, though some qualitative evidence suggests that exclusion is diminishing.|$|E
40|$|In this essay, I {{critically}} examine {{media representation}} of Welsh rugby legend Gareth Thomas, {{with a specific}} focus {{on the construction of}} his masculinity as an outing gay celebrity. The existing critical scholarship has studied various forms of media representation of queer images. But they did not examine how unconventional queer representation interacts with the normative gender performance. This paper investigates mainstream media’s discursive construction of masculine gay male. The findings call our attention to the emergence of macho gay characterization, which supports the hegemonic domination of heterosexual normativity. The stigmatization of gay-ness as the deviated other is rationalized through illegitimating its positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>spheres,</b> marginalizing non-masculine gay characters, and erasing the larger socio-political condition that oppresses closeted gay athletes...|$|R

40|$|The article elaborates on {{the links}} between low {{participation}} of women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Polish <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> and processes of communication, education and socialisation. Drawing on my earlier research on women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Polish media, I analyse diverse gender roles constructed discursively in handbooks for first, second and third grade pupils of Polish elementary schools. The schoolbooks are treated here as key tools in educating future participants of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> whose ‘preferences, values and standpoints – of consumers and citizens – are created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earlier processes of education’ (Jürgen Habermas). Analysing the schoolbooks, I point to {{the links between}} the processes of socialisation (and communication of gender roles – in private and public life – via schoolbooks and other teaching materials), {{the social construction of}} gender identities and the reasons of the still very low participation of women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Polish <b>public</b> <b>sphere...</b>|$|R

25|$|Negt and Kluge {{furthermore}} {{point out}} the necessity of considering a third dimension of the public spheres: The public spheres of production. The public spheres of production collect the impulses of resentment and instrumentalizes them in the productive spheres. The public spheres of production are wholly instrumental and have no critical impulse (unlike the bourgeois and proletarian spheres). The interests that are incorporated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> of production are given capitalist shape, and questions of their legitimately are thus neutralized.|$|E
25|$|John Dewey (1859–1952), {{while still}} {{engaging}} in the lofty academic philosophical work of James and Peirce before him, also wrote extensively on political and social matters, and his presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> was much greater than his pragmatist predecessors.

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> past decade, Turkish {{television}} drama {{has enjoyed}} popular success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arab world, fueling wide-ranging controversies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pan-Arab <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> Such popularity is {{at first sight}} puzzling. After all, Arabs lived under Ottoman rule for 400 years, {{and for most of}} the 20 th century Turkey's foreign policy neglected Arab interests. Why, then, would Turkish drama be popular with Arab audiences, especially at a time of unprecedented vibrancy in Arab cultural production? This article grapples with that question via a systematic analysis of pan-Arab discourse about Turkish popular culture, concluding that some Turkish dramas conjure up an accessible modernity while others enact a counter-hegemonic narrative that puts Middle Easterners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role of heroes. The rise of Turkish television drama <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arab <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> offers insights into the geopolitical underpinnings and geocultural consequences of transnational media flows...|$|R
