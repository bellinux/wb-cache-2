Statistical associations are calculated both for observed substorm onsets and onsets generated by a Minimal Substorm Model in which substorms are purely internally triggered. Thence we argue that a minimum interval of prior loading is a necessary condition for substorm onset, a subsequent northward IMF turning is not necessary, and consequently that an <b>internal</b> <b>trigger</b> from a magnetospheric instability is a necessary and sufficient condition for substorm onset.

40|$|Polymeric {{carriers}} {{for drug}} and gene delivery {{have been successfully}} used in clinical applications, and developing to achieve greater efficacy. A successful polymeric carrier must not only protect the therapeutics from degradation but also increase the pharmacokinetic and biopharmaceutical properties of the therapeutic agents. Furthermore, releasing the therapeutic agents from nanocarriers at the desired target sites and with the correct dosage is important to enhance patient outcomes. Numerous polymeric systems for drug and gene delivery that can release bioactive agents through response to external (e. g., light, electric or magnetic source, and ultrasound) or <b>internal</b> <b>triggers</b> (e. g., pH, enzyme, and redox) have been designed. However, release mechanism using these triggers is restrictive in terms of in vivo applications as there is limited accessibility of external stimuli to tissues or organs; and the efficiency of <b>internal</b> <b>triggers</b> are variable between cell lines and even within the same tissue or organ.

40|$|The {{sudden release}} {{of carbon dioxide}} gas, which may {{accumulate}} gradually within the stratified water bodies of a crater lake, caused two fatal disasters in Cameroon during the past decade. We model the various processes that {{may have led to}} the release by considering (1) gas injection, (2) an <b>internal</b> <b>triggering</b> mechanism, (3) propagation of a disturbance after triggering, and (4) the forces that end the outburst. We suggest that the 1986 Lake Nyos outburst was triggered at the lake bottom. The final explosive stage of the release ended quickly when a sufficiently large volume of gas bubbles prevented circulation of water eddies within the lake. A cellular automaton model is used to estimate the amount of carbon dioxide gas released and the characteristic time interval between successive outbursts. If both the gas accumulation rate and the diffusion rate of carbon dioxide through water are constant, then rapid gas release, will occur at fairly regular intervals. In which case, the amount of gas released from Lake Nyos is 0. 17 ± 0. 05 km 3 at standard temperature and pressure each 37 ± 10 years. It is possible, however, that an external event could trigger a sudden release or that the diffusion rate of carbon dioxide may change as more gas accumulates, which could shorten the release time. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{management}} of {{a supply chain}} (SC) has a great influence on the stability of dynamic cooperation among SC partners and hence {{very important for the}} performance of the SC operations as a whole. A suitable decision-making model is the cornerstone for the efficiency of SC risk management. We propose in this paper a decision-making model based on the <b>internal</b> <b>triggering</b> and interactive mechanisms in an SC risk system, which takes into account dual cycles, the operational process cycle (OPC) and the product life cycle (PLC). We explore the inter-relationship among the two cycles, SC organizational performance factors (OPF) and available risk operational practice (ROP), as well as the risk managerial elements in OPC and PLC. In particular, three types of relationship, bilateral, unilateral and inter-circulative ones, are analyzed and verified. We build this dynamic relation into SC risk managerial logic and design a corresponding decision-making path. Based on the analytic network process (ANP), a methodology is designed for an optimal selection of risk management methods and tools. A numerical example is provided as an operational guideline for how to apply it to tailor operational tactics in SC risk management. The results verify that this strategic decision model is a feasible access to the suitable risk operational tactics for practitioners. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Fine-scale {{braiding}} of coronal magnetic loops by continuous footpoint motions may power coronal heating via nanoflares, {{which are}} spontaneous fine-scale bursts of internal reconnection. An initial nanoflare may trigger {{an avalanche of}} reconnection of the braids, making a microflare or larger subflare. In contrast to this <b>internal</b> <b>triggering</b> of subflares, we observe external triggering of subflares in a braided coronal magnetic field observed by the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C). We track {{the development of these}} subflares using 12 s cadence images acquired by SDO/AIA in 1600, 193, 94 Å, and registered magnetograms of SDO/HMI, over four hours centered on the Hi-C observing time. These data show numerous recurring small-scale brightenings in transition-region emission happening on polarity inversion lines where flux cancellation is occurring. We present in detail an example of an apparent burst of reconnection of two loops in the transition region under the braided coronal field which is appropriate for releasing a short reconnected loop downward and a longer reconnected loop upward. The short loop presumably submerges into the photosphere, participating in observed flux cancellation. A subflare in the overlying braided magnetic field is apparently triggered by the disturbance of the braided field by the reconnection-released upward loop. At least 10 subflares observed in this braided structure appear to be triggered this way. How common this external trigger mechanism for coronal subflares is in other active regions, and how important it is for coronal heating in general, remain to be seen...|$|E

40|$|Bradykinesia is {{the most}} {{disabling}} motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The sequence effect, a feature of bradykinesia, refers to the rapid decrement in amplitude and speed of repetitive movements (e. g., gait, handwriting) and is {{a major cause of}} morbidity in PD. Previous research has revealed mixed results regarding the role of dopaminergic treatment in the sequence effect. However, external cueing has been shown to improve it. In this study, we aimed to characterize the sequence effect systematically and relate this phenomenon to the energetic cost of movement within the context of cost-benefit framework of motor control. We used a dynamic isometric motor task with auditory pacing to assess the sequence effect in motor output during a 15 s task segment in PD patients and matched controls. All participants performed the task with both hands, and without and with visual feedback. Patients were also tested in on- and off-dopaminergic states. Patients in the off state did not show higher sequence effect compared to controls, partly due to large variance in their performance. However, patients in the on state {{and in the absence of}} visual feedback, showed significantly higher sequence effect compared to controls. Patients expended higher total motor energy compared to controls in all conditions and regardless of their medication status. In this experimental situation, the sequence effect in PD is associated with the cumulative energetic cost of movement. Dopaminergic treatment, critical for <b>internal</b> <b>triggering</b> of movement, fails to maintain the motor vigor across responses. The high motor cost may be related to failure to incorporate limbic/motivational cues into the motor plan. Visual feedback may facilitate performance by shifting the driving of movement from internal to external, or, alternatively, by functioning as a motivational cue...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} 18 April 2002 {{sawtooth}} event. We {{find that the}} strong magnetic field dipolarizations observed in association with each tooth are not global in occurrence but are rather confined to the nightside. In addition, {{we find that the}} flux increases are not globally dispersionless. Instead, each tooth is associated with a nonglobal, but wider-than-usual, dispersionless injection region that is consistent with the high Kp versions of the standard injection boundary model (which places the entire nightside segment of geosynchronous orbit tailward of the injection boundary for values of Kp above about 5). We also find evidence {{that at least one of}} the teeth was likely triggered by a pressure pulse. The auroral distribution shows a repeatable evolution in which a wide double-oval configuration gradually thins. Following this, a localized substorm-like brightening in the dusk to midnight sector occurs on the lower branch of the double oval which subsequently expands rapidly poleward and azimuthally. A new expanded double oval configuration emerges from this expansion phase activity and the cycle repeats itself for the duration of the sawtooth event. The observations presented give considerable support to the contention that sawtooth events are actually sequences of quasi-periodic substorms. We suggest that sawtooth events can be viewed as a magnetospheric mode similar to Steady Magnetospheric Convection intervals (SMCs) except that for sawtooth events, the flow of energy from the solar wind into the magnetosphere becomes too large to dissipate without the periodic occurrence of substorms. We further suggest that the quasi-periodicity arises because the magnetosphere may only become susceptible to external or <b>internal</b> <b>triggering</b> after it has been driven beyond a stability threshold. This hypothesis can account for the existence of more potential external triggers (in the interplanetary magnetic field or solar wind) than teeth in that the magnetosphere may be selectively responsive to them...|$|E
40|$|Land-use {{planning}} {{takes into}} consideration geologic hazards {{in order to}} protect both life and property. One type of geologic hazard is mass movement. Mass movement is a collective term for the downslope movement of mass units of debris e. g., bedrock, soil, and subsurface material, resulting from the influence of gravity and involving transporting media such as ice, snow, water, and air. As population increases, further pressures are placed on existing land use. Many areas once considered unsuitable for development due to steep slope or other physical characteristics are now experiencing problems. These areas, due to their physical characteristics, can be susceptible to mass movement. The problem is, information related to the areal distribution of susceptibility is most often not available for input to the land-use planning process. This thesis is proposing a methodology to provide general-level mass movement susceptibility maps. The methodology is a computer application utilizing the Harvard I. M. G. R. l. D. (IMGRID) System. IMGRID is a system using grid cells as the basic units of data storage, analysis, retrieval, and display. Basically, the methodology consists of three major components or phases: (1) providing the computer with data acceptable to the machine and computer programs (input); (2) manipulation of the data and storage of map results within the machine 2 ̆ 7 s memory (processing); and (3) the retrieval and display of results (output). The processing of the data is organized around susceptibility models which generate computer maps identifying areas susceptible to mass movements. Areas susceptible to moss movements are defined as portions of the landscape characterized by a set of natural characteristics existing in a stable state which will yield a failure of the material if acted upon by an external or <b>internal</b> <b>triggering</b> event either natural or man-induced. The methodology was applied to a small area in Southwest Washington as a demonstration of how one mechanically follows it from beginning to end.

In this paper we studied {{the relationship between the}} spontaneous neuronal activity in the leech (Hirudo medicinalis) and its behavior. We analyzed the electrical activity of isolated ganglia, chains of two connected ganglia and semi-intact preparations. The spontaneous electrical activity in ganglia was characterized by the occurrence of irregular bursts of spikes with variable duration and size. Properties of these bursts were modified by synaptic inputs arriving from the neighboring ganglia and from the two primitive brains located in the head and tail. In fact, in semi-intact preparations, unusually large bursts of spikes occurring spontaneously were recorded and caused the leech to move even in {{the absence of}} any external sensory stimulation.

50|$|A {{crossbow}} is a bow {{mounted on}} a stick (called a tiller or stock) with a mechanism in it that holds the drawn bow string. The earliest designs featured a slot in the stock, down into which the string was placed. To shoot this design, a vertical rod is thrust up {{through a hole in}} the bottom of the notch, forcing the string out. This rod is usually attached perpendicular to a rear-facing lever called a trigger or tickler. A later design implemented a rolling cylindrical pawl called a nut to retain the string. This nut has a perpendicular centre slot for the bolt, and an intersecting axial slot for the string, along with a lower face or slot against which the <b>internal</b> <b>trigger</b> sits. They often also have some form of strengthening <b>internal</b> sear or <b>trigger</b> face, usually of metal. These roller nuts were either free-floating in their close-fitting hole across the stock, tied in with a binding of sinew or other strong cording; or {{mounted on a}} metal axle or pins. Removable or integral plates of wood, ivory, or metal on the sides of the stock kept the nut in place laterally. Nuts were made of antler, bone, or metal.

40|$|A plastic {{root system}} is a {{prerequisite}} for successful plant acclimation to variable environments. The normally functioning root system {{is the result of a}} complex interaction of root-borne signals and shoot-derived regulators. We recently demonstrated that AUX 1, a well-studied component of auxin transport, mediates shoot-supplied ammonium (SSA) inhibition of lateral root (LR) formation in Arabidopsis. By contrast, the response did not involve ABA pathways, via which several other abiotic stresses affect LR formation. We proposed that SSA regulates LR emergence by interrupting AUX 1 -mediated auxin transport from shoot to root. Here, by analyzing both ABA- and auxin-related mutants, we show that AUX 1 is also required for SSA-mediated suppression of primary root growth. Ammonium content in shoots was furthermore shown to increase linearly with shoot-, but not root-supplied, ammonium, suggesting it may represent the <b>internal</b> <b>trigger</b> for SSA inhibition of root development. Taken together, our data identify AUX 1 -mediated auxin transport as a key transmission step in the sensing of excessive ammonium exposure and its inhibitory effect on root development...|$|R
