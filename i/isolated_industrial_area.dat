The urban goal is to connect the isolated and neglected site {{to the city of}} Pantin. On the site a former warehouse for the checking of goods by the Parisian customs is situated. This building needs to be transformed for a new use. This is done by transforming the building into a hybrid building which accomodates housing, working and learning. A small city in which different users and functions have a chance to meet and to connect. The emphasis is therefor on collectivity between the different functions, separate functions and users. The story of Esmeralda by Italo Calvino forms the inspiration for the architecture, in which the former and proposed new use come together.

Intended to be temporary and to be used only until full service to Malden was implemented, it was constructed of wood like a house rather than a permanent transit station. The light-duty construction style of this station was unique on the Elevated. Due to opposition from Malden residents who preferred a tunnel due to the noise and vibration of the planned elevated line, the Malden extension was not built and Everett remained the terminus.|$|E
50|$|In November 2009, {{police arrested}} and charged three {{suspects}} for subjecting 110 Romanians to forced labor R U S conditions, mostly in the construction sector; the ringleader reportedly used debt bondage and hired enforcers to control the workers who were forced to live in converted shipping containers in an <b>isolated</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>area</b> near Nicosia. Cypriot police actively investigated the case with law enforcement counterparts in Romania; however, a district court released the main suspect after rejecting a fourth request by police for his detention. In 2009, police conducted 95 anti-trafficking raids and 20 undercover operations on establishments suspected of trafficking. Stakeholders reported that police inspected significantly fewer cabarets in 2009. The Department of Labor (DOL) is responsible for inspecting work premises associated with the new “performing artist” work permits; however, no DOL inspectors work after-hours, when “performing artists” are most subject to exploitation in cabarets.|$|E
40|$|Med hållbar stadsplanering menas en planering som värnar om framtiden och kommande generationer. Inom detta område berörs såväl tekniska som fysiska aspekter inom samhället. Rapporten fokuserar på hållbar stadsplanering i form av kommunikation, rörelse och {{integration}} vid utformning och planering av stadsdelar, samt det faktum att det finns digitala verktyg som inte utnyttjas regelbundet i det dagliga arbetet. I samspel med Borås Stad har en analys gällande arbetsmetoder vid stadsplanering genomförts. Begreppen kommunikation, rörelse och integration diskuteras och analyseras i relation till kommunens arbete. Syftet är att formulera och pröva en arbetsmodell som kan vara vägledande inom arbetet med hållbar stadsplanering. Målet är undersöka om det finns grund för introducering av digitala verktyg som strategi i kommunens stadsplanering. Frågeställningarna berör kvalitetsbegreppen kommunikation, rörelse och integration samt hur dessa tillämpas vid daglig kommunal stadsplanering. Genom litteraturstudier och en intervju har dessa besvarats. Till sist har en Space Syntax analys i kombination med en fallstudie, av området Simonsland i Borås, genomförts. Området för fallstudien skall omvandlas från isolerat industriområde till florerande högskolecampus och kulturcenter. Med hjälp av det digitala verktyget Space Syntax har platsen analyserats i sin tidigare samt nya utformning. Space Syntax är ett rumsanalytiskt verktyg, som beräknar hur vägar och stråk i form av axiala linjer samspelar och integrerar med varandra. Denna analys mynnar ut i färgkodade illustrationer, som påvisar starka och kritiska punkter inom stadens rörelsemönster. Arbetet med utveckling av hållbar samhällsplanering inom kommunen är en ständig process. Det finns inga exakta ramar eller arbetsmetoder som tillämpas vid främjande av kvalitetsbegreppen rörelse, kommunikation och integration. Arbetsprocesserna ses som ett handlingsspel där målet är att tillfredsställa så många parter som möjligt. I examensarbetet presenteras konkreta och tydliga argument som påvisar varför och hur Space Syntax kan spela en påtaglig roll inom kommunal stadsplanering. Vikt har lagts vid hur olika intressenter kan dra nytta av verktyget samt hur åtgärderna kan genomföras med enkla medel. Resultatet visar att det finns grund för att introducera det rumsanalytiska verktyget Space Syntax i den kommunala stadsplaneringen. Verktyget bidrar med goda kunskaper om det framtida utfallet av byggnationers påverkan på rörelsemönster i staden. Sustainable {{urban planning}} is {{an approach that}} cares about the future {{as well as the}} forthcoming generations. This subject involves technical as well as physical aspects of society. This report focuses on sustainable urban design in terms of availability, movement and integration in relation to urban planning. It also considers {{the fact that there are}} digital tools that are not fully utilized during the process of urban planning. An analysis regarding the practice of urban planning has been implemented. The concepts of availability, movement, and integration are discussed and analysed in relation to the municipality work process. The purpose is to formulate and test a theory that could be indicative to the work towards sustainable urban planning. The purpose is to determine whether there are reasons for the introduction of digital tools as a strategy within the municipal urban planning. The issues concern terms of availability, movement and integration and how these are applied in daily municipal urban planning. Answers have been found through literature reviews and an interview. Finally, a case study of an area facing redevelopment in Borås, called Simonsland, has been made. Simonsland is a centrally located area in Borås, where a case study has been carried out. The area is being rebuilt and transformed from an <b>isolated</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>area</b> into a flourishing college campus and cultural centre. With help from the digital tool Space Syntax, the site has been assessed in it´s previous and new design. Space Syntax is a spatial analytical tool that calculates how roads and streets, in form of axial lines, interact and integrate with each other. This analysis culminates in color-coded illustrations that demonstrate strong and critical points within the city's pattern of movement. Development of sustainable urban planning is a constant process within the municipally work. There are no precise practice that applies to the promotion of quality concepts such as movement, communication and integration. The work process is seen as a negotiation where the objective is to satisfy as many parties as possible. The purpose of this study is to present concrete and clear arguments that demonstrate why and how Space Syntax could play a greater role in municipal urban planning. Emphasis has been placed on how various stakeholders can come to benefit from the tool and how these measures can be implemented with simple means. The result shows that there is a basis for introduction of the spatial analytical tool Space Syntax within municipal planning. The tool contributes with good knowledge about the outcome of construction and its influence on the city's pattern of movement...|$|E

40|$|Among oil-degrading {{microorganisms}} <b>isolated</b> from oil-polluted <b>industrial</b> <b>areas,</b> one yeast strain showed high degradation {{activity of}} aliphatic hydrocarbons. From the analyses of 18 S rRNA sequences, fatty acid, coenzyme Q system, G+C content of DNA, and biochemical characteristics, the strain {{was identified as}} Yarrowia lipolytica 180. Y. lipolytica 180 degraded 94 % of aliphatic hydrocarbons in minimal salts medium containing 0. 2 % (v/v) of Arabian light crude oil within 3 days at 25 °C. Optimal growth conditions for temperature, pH, NaCl concentration, and crude oil concentration were 30 °C, pH 5 - 7, 1 %, and 2 % (v/v), respectively. Y. lipolytica 180 reduced surface tension when cultured on hydrocarbon substrates (1 %, v/v), and the measured values of the surface tension were {{in the range of}} 51 to 57 dynes/cm. Both the cell free culture broth and cell debris of Y. lipolytica 180 were capable of emulsifying 2 % (v/v) crude oil by itself. They were also capable of degrading crude oil (2 %). The strain showed a cell surface hydrophobicity higher than 90 %, which did not require hydrocarbon substrates for its induction. These results suggest that Y. lipolytica has high oil-degrading activity through its high emulsifying activity and cell hydrophobicity, and further indicate that the cell surface is responsible for the metabolism of aliphatic hydrocarbons. ope...|$|R
