25|$|A <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> is an enclosed, movable {{connector}} {{which extends}} from an airport terminal gate to an airplane, allowing passengers to board and disembark {{without having to}} go outside.|$|E
25|$|The former Terminal 2 {{was built}} in 1951–53, along with the FAA control tower and a baggage claim area. For HemisFair '68, a new {{satellite}} concourse was built, containing eight <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> gates and passenger waiting areas.|$|E
25|$|Upon the airplane's {{arrival at}} the gate, {{soldiers}} boarded the airplane to arrest Aquino. The soldiers escorted him off the airplane and onto the jet bridge; however, instead of following the <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> to the terminal, they exited the <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> down the service staircase onto the apron, where a military vehicle was waiting {{to bring him to}} prison. Sometime between his egress from the aircraft and his boarding of the ground vehicle, several gunshots were heard. When the firing stopped, Aquino and a man later identified as Rolando Galman lay dead on the apron, both from gunshot wounds. Aquino's body was carried into an Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM) van by two AVSECOM SWAT soldiers, while another soldier at the bumper of the van continued to fire shots at Galman. The AVSECOM van sped away, leaving behind the bullet-riddled body of Galman. The subsequent Sandiganbayan ruling later established that Aquino had died before arriving at Fort Bonifacio General Hospital. However, this remains controversial due to contrary evidence presented in court interviews of General Custodio.|$|E
5000|$|The airport has a main International {{terminal}} building with 11 <b>jet</b> <b>bridges</b> {{and a smaller}} domestic terminal structure nearby with 2 <b>jet</b> <b>bridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|In January 2012, {{the airport}} {{announced}} the adding of four new <b>jet</b> <b>bridges.</b> At {{the beginning of}} 2013, the <b>jet</b> <b>bridges</b> were installed. This allowed passengers {{to avoid having to}} exit the terminal and board the plane from the outside. It was the first time Evansville Regional Airport had new <b>jet</b> <b>bridges,</b> since US Air exited the Evansville market in the 1990s. A subsequent ribbon cutting took place at the airport on 17 January 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Suvarnabhumi Airport has 72 <b>jet</b> <b>bridges</b> and 69 non-jet bridges. Additionally, {{flights are}} able to park at remote {{locations}} on the ramp, from which airport buses transport passengers {{to and from the}} terminal. Suvarnabhumi Airport has 18 <b>jet</b> <b>bridges</b> and 6 non-jet bridges for Airbus 380-800 ...|$|R
25|$|Perimeter Aviation is a {{regional}} airline that operates its own small, exclusive terminal building at Winnipeg International Airport to facilitate its passenger, cargo and charter services. Perimeter Aviation {{does not use}} the main terminal building due to its varied operations to small remote communities throughout Northern Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario using small propeller aircraft, with which regular airport terminal services (<b>jet</b> <b>bridge,</b> catering, etc.) are unnecessary and can actually be a hindrance to day-to-day operations.|$|E
25|$|Terminal E has a {{total of}} 15 gates {{numbered}} E1-E12. Gates E10-E12 were recently reconstructed {{as part of the}} terminal E modernization project to accommodate Airbus A380 aircraft. In this, a second <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> was added to each of those three gates to make upper level boarding on the A380 possible. All gates within the terminal are designated as common-use, meaning gates are assigned mostly based on an operational need. All ticket counters and gates in Terminal E are shared among the international carriers. The terminal houses several airline lounges: Aer Lingus' Gold Circle Lounge, Air France's Air France Lounge, British Airways' First Lounge and Terraces Lounge, Lufthansa's Senator Lounge and Business Lounge and Virgin Atlantic's Clubhouse Lounge.|$|E
25|$|San Antonio International Airport has two {{terminals}} with {{an overall}} 24 <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> gates. The original one-level terminal (formerly Terminal 2) opened in 1953 with ground-loading holding areas and was expanded twice, once in 1959 with new east and west wings, and again in 1968 with an eight-gate satellite concourse, which was built to handle visitors to HemisFair '68. Terminal 2 closed on November 9, 2010 as the new Terminal B opened, and Terminal 2 began to be demolished in March 2011, with completion in January 2012. A second terminal (formerly Terminal 1, now Terminal A) opened in 1984 with a 16-gate concourse. The U.S. Customs Federal Inspection Station (FIS) is located in Terminal A and is accessible from Gates A6-A9. Terminal A will soon begin going through an updating and modernization project.|$|E

50|$|The 1081 m pier {{features}} 21 <b>jet</b> <b>bridges,</b> two {{of which}} have been rebuilt into waiting halls for bus transfers. One gate position has been equipped with three <b>jet</b> <b>bridges</b> to handle the Airbus A380 which is regularly used by Emirates. There are further 60 aircraft stands on the apron, some of which are equipped with specially designed apron <b>jet</b> <b>bridges</b> (link=no), to which passengers are brought by bus. This unique concept allows passengers to board with full protection from the weather but without the high investments required for full satellite terminals connected through a passenger transport system.|$|R
25|$|The {{terminal}} houses ten international gates {{that are}} capable of dual <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> loading and unloading. The gates contain two exit configurations depending on the arriving flight. Domestic arrivals follow an upper path directly into the terminal while international arrivals proceed downstairs to customs and immigration screening. The Customs and Border Protection processing center located in the terminal's lower level is designed to accommodate as many as 3,200 passengers per hour. International arriving passengers connecting to another flight are screened by TSA at a dedicated screening checkpoint within the international arrivals facility. Those passengers then exit directly back {{into the center of the}} A concourse. Passengers arriving from international destinations who end their trip in Detroit (or connecting to a flight via North Terminal) exit directly into a dedicated International Arrivals Hall on the lower level of the terminal.|$|E
25|$|On April 3, 2014, DFW Airport {{director}} Sean Donohue {{announced that}} Emirates Airlines would upgrade their service from the Boeing 777-200LR to the Airbus A380 from October 1, 2014. However, due to low passenger demand, Emirates temporarily reverted to the 777 in February 2016, {{with plans to}} re-upgrade to the A380 in September. However, Emirates never switched back to the A380 after that. On May 7, 2014, Qantas announced an upgrade to A380 service beginning September 29, 2014, and the airport press agency announced that gates 15 and 16 were being renovated to accommodate the A380 {{in anticipation of the}} new service. Terminal D had been designed with the A380 in mind; however, loading the double-deck aircraft requires three gates with a separate <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> to serve first class and business class passengers on the upper level, so the renovations included the addition of gate 16X. On September 29, 2014, a Qantas A380–sporting a commemorative cowboy hat and bandana on the Kangaroo tail logo–inaugurated service at the remodeled gates.|$|E
500|$|After the attacks, {{the flight}} number for flights {{on the same}} route with the same takeoff time was changed to American Airlines Flight25. These flights now use a Boeing 737-800 instead of a Boeing 767. An American flag is flown on the <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> of gate B32 from which Flight11 {{departed}} Logan Airport. As of September 2016, the closest identical American Airlines flight is Flight 166, {{which is scheduled to}} [...] leave at 9:15 a.m. The flight often pushes back very close or next to Gate B32.|$|E
50|$|The airport had 10 gates, 5 with <b>Jet</b> <b>bridges</b> and 5 with stairs.|$|R

50|$|In 1987, Geneva {{airport was}} linked to the Swiss rail system, with a new station built close to the main terminal. Since then, a number of changes have been made. Two of the three in-field {{terminals}} have been upgraded with <b>jet</b> <b>bridges,</b> and a new terminal has been built in front of the main terminal with 12 <b>jet</b> <b>bridges,</b> plus two ground floor gates.|$|R
500|$|John Glenn Columbus International Airport has 3 airport concourses. [...] Concourse A (gates A1 – A7) {{is home to}} Southwest Airlines, {{which uses}} all the gates with the {{exception}} of A1 (no <b>jet</b> <b>bridge)</b> and A7 (ground-level boarding gate). Concourse B (gates B19 – B36) is home to Air Canada, American Airlines, United Airlines, and Frontier Airlines. The Vacation Express charters also depart from Concourse B. Gates B15 through B18 and B33 are no longer accessible due to concession and restroom construction. Gate B33 and B36 have had their jet bridges removed. Concourse C (gates C46 – C56) is home to Delta Air Lines, which uses gates C49-C56. Gates C47-C48 are not currently in use, while gate C46 is used for international arrivals and connects directly to customs and immigration. [...] Currently, the only international arrivals are the seasonal flights from Freeport, Cancun and Punta Cana, as well as the daily flights to Toronto. Columbus is also served by Allegiant Air, which operates from Rickenbacker.|$|E

Of the 66 jet bridges, five (Gates 15,23,60,62,64) are capable of handling the Airbus A380, the current users of which are Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qantas, British Airways, Asiana Airlines, Thai Airways, Air France and Lufthansa. Previous users were Korean Air, Malaysia Airlines, and China Southern Airlines.|$|E
2500|$|Terminal A is a hexagon-shaped ring {{concourse}} with {{a parking}} area, taxi stands and bus stops in its middle. It features 14 jet bridges which correspond to 16 respective check-in counters (A00–A15), with jetways 1 and 14 each serving two check-in counters. There is no transit zone, {{which means that}} each gate has its own security clearance checkpoint and exit for arriving passengers. Therefore, direct flight connections without leaving the airside area are not possible. Most major airlines arrive and depart here, especially [...] "prestigious" [...] flights like intercontinental services or flights to the busy European hub airports; for example United Airlines flights to Newark and Lufthansa services to Munich are handled here. The whole rooftop works as a visitor platform. Terminal A is capable of handling wide-bodied aircraft like the Boeing 767 or Airbus A330 on two positions but with only one <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> attached to each.|$|E
5000|$|The {{domestic}} terminal {{was built}} in 1965 when the facility was first opened as a civilian airport. [...] Through the years, it has undergone small expansions and improvements, but <b>jet</b> <b>bridges</b> have never been added.

50|$|A new {{terminal}} had been needed for many years, {{as the old}} terminal building was plagued {{by a number of}} problems, primarily space constraints. Construction on the {{new terminal}} began in late Spring, 2011. Denver-based Coover-Clark & Associates, Inc. designed the building and Kadrmas Lee & Jackson's Rapid City office handled the construction administration. A <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> was to be installed at the terminal, but airport officials decided to wait until a scheduled commercial airline could use the <b>jet</b> <b>bridge,</b> as Great Lakes Airlines aircraft are not <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> capable. As noted above, Pierre has not had scheduled passenger jet service operated with mainline aircraft in 30 years; however, a <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> could be used with the current generation of regional jet aircraft. In the past three years, the airport has pursued several airlines that are boarding bridge capable, and the new airport terminal has the space set aside for a loading bridge, so it would require very little effort to install one. The airport hopes to have a <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> by 2018. The new terminal was completed in September, 2012.|$|E
5000|$|On April 3, 2011, AmericanConnection flight 5019 {{bound to}} O'Hare International Airport {{sustained}} substantial damage after the <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> was blown {{into the side}} of the plane. Winds were gusting to 27 kts, and the emergency brakes in the <b>jet</b> <b>bridge</b> failed to activate. There were no injuries reported, and the aircraft was repaired and returned to service.|$|E

50|$|Terminal 2 {{will have}} new gates (8 {{additional}} gates to Terminal 2) and aircraft {{stands on the}} apron. All gates for long-haul flights will have double <b>jet</b> <b>bridges</b> (such as the ones at Incheon International Airport) to enable handling larger aircraft more efficiently. Finavia has {{signed a contract with}} Thyssen Krupp Airport Systems for 16 widebody aircraft stands with up to 33 new <b>jet</b> <b>bridges.</b> New <b>jet</b> <b>bridges</b> were installed to gates 38 and 39 (now 53 and 54). Gate 49 will be able to accommodate the Airbus A380 superjumbo and there will be new aircraft stands on the apron accommodating the A380. Five of the gates will be able to accommodate two regional jets, such as Boeing 737s or Airbus A320s, simultaneously at a single gate.|$|R
50|$|Phase II {{takes into}} {{consideration}} {{the construction of a}} 4 star hotel, the high-speed railway station, and the expansion of the terminal. The expansion consists of an additional 2 <b>jet</b> <b>bridges</b> and 8,000 m². Phase III includes added 2 more <b>jet</b> <b>bridges</b> and 10,000 m² of total terminal area, as well as the construction of several business centers and a cargo terminal. Phase II is said to be completed by 2018, whilst Phase II should be done in 2021.|$|R
