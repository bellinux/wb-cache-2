5000|$|The <b>fishplates</b> (<b>joint</b> bars) in jointed track may fail, {{allowing}} the rails to pull apart in extremely cold weather; {{this is usually}} associated with uncorrected rail creep.|$|R
5000|$|In jointed track, rails {{are usually}} {{connected}} with bolted <b>fishplates</b> (<b>joint</b> bars). The web {{of the rail}} experiences large shear forces and these are enhanced around the bolt hole. Where track maintenance is poor, metallurgical fatigue can result in the propagation of star cracking from the bolthole. In extreme situations {{this can lead to}} a triangular piece of rail at the joint becoming detached.|$|R
50|$|Even though {{fishplates}} {{strengthen the}} weak points represented by rail joints, improvements {{can still be}} made. For example, the joints can be welded together using the thermite welding process. In 1967, at Hither Green on the Southern Region of British Railways, a major disaster occurred when a rail fractured at its <b>fishplate</b> <b>joint.</b> Welded Rail installation was sped up due to this error, with strict procedures on concrete and wooden Sleepers.|$|R
25|$|Jointed rails {{were used}} {{at first because}} {{contemporary}} technology did not offer any alternative. However, the intrinsic weakness in resisting vertical loading results in the ballast becoming depressed and a heavy maintenance workload is imposed to prevent unacceptable geometrical defects at the joints. The joints also needed to be lubricated, and wear at the <b>fishplate</b> (<b>joint</b> bar) mating surfaces needed to be rectified by shimming. For this reason jointed track is not financially appropriate for heavily operated railroads.|$|R
25|$|Through {{the use of}} low wing- and span-loading to {{generate}} greater effectiveness than conventional counterparts, the Islander could lift considerably heavier payloads than the typical aircraft in its power, weight or cost classes. To reduce manufacturing costs, both the wings and tail surfaces maintain a constant chord and thickness, while the ribs within the aircraft's wing are all identical; both rivets and external <b>fishplate</b> <b>joints</b> are used for the same purpose. The type was originally intended to use a fabric-and-steel design. A light alloy monocoque approach was adopted instead. The structure is designed to give rise to and experience low levels of stress, and has an infinite fatigue life without testing.|$|R
50|$|At a {{press conference}} {{the day after the}} accident, an SNCF {{director}} stated that the failure of a <b>fishplate</b> (rail <b>joint)</b> was the cause of the accident, confirmed in the third SNCF press conference by supporting photographs. According to Guillaume Pepy, the SNCF president, the fishplate broke away from the rails and became lodged {{in the middle of the}} switch, causing the derailment.|$|R
2500|$|Jointed {{track is}} made using lengths of rail, usually around [...] long (in the UK) and [...] long (in North America), bolted {{together}} using perforated steel plates known as <b>fishplates</b> (UK) or <b>joint</b> bars (North America).|$|R
