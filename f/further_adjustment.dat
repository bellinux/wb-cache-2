A <b>further</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the county boundary took place in 1928 and on this occasion however, Staffordshire gained territory from Worcestershire at Warley Woods (See Fig 4).

25|$|Aneroid {{barometers}} have {{a mechanical}} adjustment {{that allows the}} equivalent sea level pressure to be read directly and without <b>further</b> <b>adjustment</b> if the instrument is not moved to a different altitude. Setting an aneroid barometer is similar to resetting an analog clock that is not at the correct time. Its dial is rotated so that the current atmospheric pressure from a known accurate and nearby barometer (such as the local weather station) is displayed. No calculation is needed, as the source barometer reading has already been converted to equivalent sea-level pressure, and this is transferred to the barometer being set—regardless of its altitude. Though somewhat rare, a few aneroid barometers intended for monitoring the weather are calibrated to manually adjust for altitude. In this case, knowing either the altitude or the current atmospheric pressure would be sufficient for future accurate readings.|$|E
2500|$|When Allied {{troops were}} halted near Anzio, Italy {{during the spring}} of 1944, powered {{personal}} radio receivers were strictly prohibited as the Germans had equipment that could detect the local oscillator signal of superheterodyne receivers. [...] Crystal sets lack power driven local oscillators, hence they could not be detected. Some resourceful soldiers constructed [...] "crystal" [...] sets from discarded materials to listen to news and music. One type used a blue steel razor blade and a pencil lead for a detector. [...] The lead point touching the semiconducting oxide coating (rust) on the blade formed a crude point-contact diode. [...] By carefully adjusting the pencil lead {{on the surface of the}} blade, they could find sensitive spots, of iron oxide, capable of rectification. [...] The lead of the pencil is made of graphite and clay and so it would inhibit further corrosion that would result if copper or iron wire was used in its place. Any further corrosion at the point of contact would ruin the diode effect found at that spot and <b>further</b> <b>adjustment</b> would be necessary. The sets were dubbed [...] "foxhole radios" [...] by the popular press, and they became part of the folklore of World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{research}} {{does not}} support significant links between meat consumption and various cancers. Key et al. found that [...] "There {{were no significant differences}} between vegetarians and nonvegetarians in mortality from cerebrovascular disease, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer or all other causes combined." [...] Truswell reviewed numerous studies, concluding that the relationship of colorectal cancer with meat consumption appeared weaker than the [...] "probable" [...] status it had been given by the World Cancer Research Foundation in 1997. A study by Chao et al. (2005) found an apparent association of colorectal cancer with red meat consumption after adjustment for age and energy intake. However, after <b>further</b> <b>adjustment</b> for body mass index, cigarette smoking and other covariates, no association with red meat consumption was found. Alex' ander conducted a meta-analysis which found no association of colorectal cancer with consumption of animal fat or protein. Based on European data (EPIC-Oxford study), Key et al. found that incidence of colorectal cancer was somewhat lower among meat eaters than among vegetarians. However, they concluded that 'the study is not large enough to exclude small or moderate differences for specific causes of death, and more research on this topic is required'. A study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) found that association between esophageal cancer risk and total and processed meat intake was not statistically significant. Another recent study of [...] EPIC [...] found a significant correlation between eating ' processed meat and cardiovascular diseases...also to cancer. In this population, reduction of processed meat consumption to less than 20g/day would prevent more than 3% of all deaths.' ...|$|E
