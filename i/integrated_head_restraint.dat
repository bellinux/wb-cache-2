This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of head restraints appears to have been low, approximately 5-10%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase crash-worthiness of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed rear impact collisions.

For the last 40 years, vehicle safety researchers have been designing and gathering information on the ability of head restraints to mitigate injuries resulting from rear-end collisions. As a result, different types of head restraints have been developed by various manufacturers to protect their occupants from whiplash. Below are definitions of different types of head restraints. [...] Head restraint — refers to a device designed to limit the rearward displacement of an adult occupant’s head in relation to the torso {{in order to reduce the}} risk of injury to the cervical vertebrae in the event of a rear impact. The most effective head restraint must allow a backset motion of less than 60 mm to prevent the hyperextension of the neck during impact. <b>Integrated</b> <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> or fixed head restraint — refers to a head restraint formed by the upper part of the seat back, or a head restraint that is not height adjustable and cannot be detached from the seat or the vehicle structure except by the use of tools or following the partial or total removal of the seat furnishing”. [...] Adjustable head restraint — refers to a head restraint that is capable of being positioned to fit the morphology of the seated occupant. The device may permit horizontal displacement, known as tilt adjustment, and/or vertical displacement, known as height adjustment. [...] Active head restraint — refers to a device designed to automatically improve head restraint position and/or geometry during an impact”. [...] Automatically adjusting head restraint — refers to a head restraint that automatically adjusts the position of the head restraint when the seat position is adjusted.

More studies by manufacturers and automobile safety organizations are currently undergoing to examine the best ways to reduce head and torso injuries during a rear-end impact with different geometries of the head restraint and seat-back systems.

A restraint should be at least as high as the head's center of gravity, or about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) below the top of the head.

40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in International Journal of Crashworthiness on 03 Dec 2015, available online: [URL]. This paper presents design of a concept for an <b>integrated</b> <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> and car seat system to mitigate whiplash in rear-end vehicle collisions. The main emphasis is on a concept, which combines a reactive head restraint with a reactive seat. The chosen concept is developed {{in the form of}} mechanical linkages using linkage analysis software, SAM 6. 1. A human model positioned in a ‘good’ driving posture is used to show how the head restraint and seat would operate using a typical crash pulse used for dynamic sled testing of automotive seats. The head restraint system is capable of translating into an optimal position of 40 mm forwards and 60 mm upwards in 12 ms, before whiplash-induced injuries start to take place. The reactive seat is also capable of reclining 15 degrees. The combination of reducing the backset and reclining the seat to reduce the relative motion between the head and torso has the potential to reduce the whiplash-effect-related injuries in rear-end collisions...|$|E

40|$|Although {{typically}} {{classified as}} AIS 1, whiplash injuries continue {{to represent a}} substantial societal problem with associated costs estimated at over $ 5 billion annually in the US. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of seatback and <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> design parameters on occupant response in rear impact. Rear impact sled tests were conducted using the Hybrid III mid-sized male (50 M) dummy seated in a modified production seat, which allowed for the adjustment of recliner stiffness, seatback cushion stiffness, and <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> height. Instrumentation provided measurements of neck forces and moments, head motion relative to the torso, seatback rotation, and head contact. An on-board digital video camera recorded dummy kinematics. Results from this study indicate that the risk of whiplash injury is not simply related to <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> position, but is dependent on a combination of factors related to both <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> and seatback design...|$|R
