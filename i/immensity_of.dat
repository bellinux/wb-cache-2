5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|An early {{concept for}} The Rite of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The family symbol in {{advertising}} may be observable before the industrial revolution, {{but it was}} not until after the industrial revolution that advertising boomed and the use of family images {{in advertising}} became prevalent. The industrial revolution changed advertising from informative flyers marking the availability of goods in 17th and 18th century Europe, whose audience were those within physical propinquity, to multimillion-dollar campaigns that attempted to instantly connect and persuade peoples from across the world. After the industrial revolution, large companies emerged as mass-producers, products became branded, and customers began establishing brand loyalties. Thus, persuading customers to purchase one brand rather than another became vital to advertising. An advertisement was responsible for making products and services salient in order to earn consumer attention in competitive industrial markets. During this period, not only did the <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> the advertising industry drastically change, but so did its marketing strategies as it began to incorporate images and specify an audience. This change from largely informative to largely persuasive strategies and from general to specific audiences explains the increase in presence and usage of symbols, representations, and stereotypes in advertising—including those of the family.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to grasp the <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> Canada's oil sands and heavy oil resource. Fields in northern Alberta include four major deposits which underlie almost 70,000 square kilometres of land. The volume of bitumen in those sands dwarfs the light oil reserves of the entire Middle East. One of those deposits, the Athabasca oil sands, is the world's largest known crude oil resource.|$|E

Witness Cromwell and his Puritans,--making England habitable even under the Charles-Second terms for a couple of centuries more. Nations are benefited, I believe, for ages, by being thrown once into divine white-heat in this manner. And no Nation that has not had such divine paroxysms at any time is apt to come to much.|$|R
25|$|The <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> the pilgrim {{presence}} in Rome {{and the vast}} diplomatic contingent from nations around the world raised concerns by the College of Cardinals that the funeral, conclave and installation of a new pope would make Vatican City a target for terrorism. The anti-terrorism task forces responsible for securing the funeral considered international terrorists the primary potential threat because of the attending dignitaries; domestic terrorism from Italian political extremists was considered less likely.|$|E
25|$|Bradley's {{service to}} the country as {{assistant}} postmaster general is regarded as influential. Bradley's postal routes and schedules, enforced rigidly over a thirty-year period, gave the Post Office Department a rapid and reliable engine for delivering information across vast distances, instilling in citizens {{the importance of the}} connectedness they shared with their distant neighbors. The numerous maps Bradley published, while later discarded and redrawn by the new Jackson administration, created in their time a sense of the <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> American territory.|$|E
25|$|Huntington {{had envisioned}} the work {{depicting}} {{a history of}} Spain, but the painter preferred the less specific 'Vision of Spain', eventually opting for {{a representation of the}} regions of the Iberian Peninsula, and calling it The Provinces of Spain. Despite the <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> the canvases, Sorolla painted all but one en plein air, and travelled to the specific locales to paint them: Navarre, Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Elche, Seville, Andalusia, Extremadura, Galicia, Guipuzcoa, Castile, Leon, and Ayamonte, at each site painting models posed in local costume. Each mural celebrated the landscape and culture of its region, panoramas composed of throngs of laborers and locals. By 1917 he was, by his own admission, exhausted. He completed the final panel by July 1919.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{is one to}} do?" [...] {{the captain}} {{repeated}} after a vast interval, and suddenly becoming active and savage and blasphemous, decided to burn the Santa Rosa without further delay. Everyone aboard was pleased by that idea, everyone helped with zest; they pulled in the cable, cut it, and dropped the boat and fired her with tow and kerosene, and soon the cuberta was crackling and flaring merrily amidst the <b>immensities</b> <b>of</b> the tropical night. Holroyd watched the mounting yellow flare against the blackness, and the livid flashes of sheet lightning that came and went above the forest summits, throwing them into momentary silhouette, and his stoker stood behind him watching also.|$|R
60|$|And from above, {{many of the}} {{occupants}} of the airships stared with an equal curiosity. No {{city in the world}} was ever so finely placed as New York, so magnificently cut up by sea and bluff and river, so admirably disposed to display the tall effects of buildings, the complex <b>immensities</b> <b>of</b> bridges and mono-railways and feats of engineering. London, Paris, Berlin, were shapeless, low agglomerations beside it. Its port reached to its heart like Venice, and, like Venice, it was obvious, dramatic, and proud. Seen from above it was alive with crawling trains and cars, and at a thousand points it was already breaking into quivering light. New York was altogether at its best that evening, its splendid best.|$|R
60|$|Your {{mother and}} I wore black only {{at his funeral}} and came back colored again into your colored world, and in a very little while your {{interest}} in this event that had taken us away for a time turned to other, more assimilable things. But there happened a little incident that laid hold upon me; you forgot it, perhaps, {{in a week or}} less, but I shall never forget it; and this incident it was that gathered up the fruits of those moments beside my father's body and set me to write this book. It had the effect of a little bright light held up against the vague dark <b>immensities</b> <b>of</b> thought and feeling that filled my mind because of my father's death.|$|R
25|$|Mrs. Norval compromises her beliefs {{when she}} realizes the <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> Lola's wealth. When {{she hears the}} news of her husband's death in Egypt, she enters a clandestine {{marriage}} with Mr. Hackwell, yielding to his advances even though she {{claims to be a}} chaste woman. The couple spends Lola's wealth extravagantly as Mr. Sinclair, who was entrusted with the bulk of Lola's wealth, sends them a monthly allowance intended for Lola. Mrs. Norval uses it to advance her family's social standing in the hopes of finding wealthier, more suitable matches for her daughters. She therefore embodies the idea of Manifest Destiny. She spends Lola's money as if it were hers, since she believes she belongs to the superior race. Lola's wealth corrupts her until she succumbs to brain fever.|$|E
500|$|In 1843 Balzac placed Le Père Goriot in {{the section}} of La Comédie humaine {{entitled}} [...] "Scènes de la vie parisienne" [...] ("Scenes of life in Paris"). Quickly thereafter, he reclassified it– due to its intense focus on the private lives of its characters– {{as one of the}} [...] "Scènes de la vie privée" [...] ("Scenes of private life"). These categories and the novels in them were his attempt to create a body of work [...] "depicting all society, sketching it in the <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> its turmoil". Although he had prepared only a small predecessor for La Comédie humaine, entitled Études de Mœurs, at this time, Balzac carefully considered each work's place in the project and frequently rearranged its structure.|$|E

Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt that the film did an [...] "excellent job conveying the boggling <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> [...] extraterrestrial vehicles [...] and panic in the streets" [...] and the scenes of the alien attack were [...] "disturbing, unsettling and completely convincing".|$|E

6000|$|We {{know the}} sublime Perpetual President in his red wig, and sublime {{supremacy}} of Pure Science. A gloomy set figure; affecting the sententious, the emphatic and a composed impregnability,--like the Jove <b>of</b> Science. With <b>immensities</b> <b>of</b> gloomy vanity, not compressible at all times. Friedrich always strove {{to honor his}} Perpetual President, and duly adore the Pure Sciences in him; but inwardly could not quite manage it, though outwardly he failed in nothing. Impartial witnesses confess, the King {{had a great deal}} of trouble with his gloomings and him. [...] "Who is this Voltaire?" [...] gloomily thinks the Perpetual President to himself. [...] "A fellow with a nimble tongue, that is all. Knows nothing whatever of Pure Sciences, except what fraction or tincture he has begged or stolen from myself.

500|$|His {{attention}} slowly shifted {{away from}} The Midwife when he wrote for, and won, the [...] "Seatonian Prize" [...] for his On the <b>Immensity</b> <b>of</b> the Supreme Being and when he began working with Newbery's children's magazine, The Lilliputian Magazine. However, Smart returned to this character full force when he established The Old Woman's Oratory; or Henley in Petticoats in December 1751. The Oratory included Smart playing as Mrs. Midnight, various songs and dances, animal acts, and [...] "miscellany" [...] acts. The Oratory was successful, and was completely redone on 21 January 1752. However, not everyone enjoyed the show, and Horace Walpole described the performance as [...] "the lowest buffoonery in the world even to me who am used to my uncle Horace." [...] Late in 1752, Smart finished and published a collection of his works as Poems on Several Occasions, {{which resulted in the}} end of the Oratory and The Midwife.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the play}} is {{concerned}} with demonstrating the <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> the difficulties that face Jason in trying to rescue Number 18. For example, he finds it difficult {{to be away from}} his wife, and struggles with the decision of whether to continue his work or return to Canada. To depict this tension, Jason and Ali communicate via Skype, represented on stage by two laptop computers placed back-to-back with Jason and Ali standing on either side facing one another. The two argue, but their interactions demonstrate the kind of love that Number 18 can only dream of. In the 2012 cross-Canada tour, a torn picture of Number 18's family remained on stage as scenery to emphasize what the character has lost. This picture took the form of a painted curtain held over a geometric floor pattern and depicted the family as tired, poor, and living in a shack. Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate said the most emotionally gripping scene was the one in which the voices cause Number 18 to recall the face of her dead father. [...] Anna Borowiecki of the St. Albert Gazette called the play a story of [...] "fallible people who find strength in each other under the worst conditions." ...|$|E
500|$|The London Quarterly Review {{began with}} the {{observation}} that [...] "When an intelligent man tells us that he has spent eleven of {{the best years of}} his life in any district, we may be pretty sure he has something to say about it which will interest even those who generally find travels dull reading". The reviewer finds Bates among the most readable, and free of the usual [...] "personal twaddle" [...] of travel and adventure books. The reviewer also remarks on Bates's subtitle [...] "...of the origin of species", that Wallace had taken up that theme more fully. In the reviewer's opinion, Bates says little about [...] "the Darwinian hypothesis", focusing instead steadily on natural history, while making [...] "very shrewd remarks" [...] about human society and giving [...] "most glowing" [...] descriptions of tropical scenery. The reviewer notes {{that most of the people}} Bates meets [...] "had a tinge of colour" [...] but made the [...] "lonely Englishman" [...] comfortable with their [...] "winning cordiality", and is amused that in a feast in Ega an Indian dressed up as an entomologist, complete with insect-net, hunting-bag, pincushion, and an old pair of spectacles. As for nature, the reviewer considers that [...] "in Brazil man is oppressed, crushed, by the <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> nature".|$|E
60|$|Young General Egalite, {{it would}} seem, shone brave among the bravest on this occasion. Doubtless a brave Egalite;--whom however does not Dumouriez rather talk of oftener than need were? The Mother Society {{has her own}} thoughts. As for the Elder Egalite he flies low at this time; appears in the Convention for some half-hour daily, with rubicund, pre-occupied, or {{impressive}} quasi-contemptuous countenance; and then takes himself away. (Moore, ii. 148.) The Netherlands are conquered, at least overrun.

It is signed, Breslau, 5th June, 1741, and {{both parties have}} their hands loose, and make use of their liberty for months to come; nay, in some sort, all along; feeling how contingent it was! Friedrich did not definitely tie himself till 4th November next, five months after: when he signed the French-Bavarian Treaty, renounced Berg-Julich controversies, and fairly went into the French-Bavarian, smaller French Adventure; into the greater, or wide-winged Belleisle one, he never went nor intended to go,--perhaps even the contrary, if needful. Readers may try to remember these elucidative items, riddled from the <b>immensities</b> <b>of</b> Dryasdust: I have no more to give, nor can afford to return upon it.

6000|$|But {{there is}} another {{literary}} project on hand, which did take effect;--much worthy of mention, this year; the whole world having risen into such a Chorus of TE DEUM at sight of it next year. In this year falls, what at any rate was a great event to Friedrich, as literary man: the printing of his first Book,--assiduous writing of it {{with an eye to}} print. The Book is that [...] "celebrated ANTI-MACHIAVEL," [...] ever-praiseworthy Refutation of Machiavel's PRINCE; concerning which there are such <b>immensities</b> <b>of</b> Voltaire Correspondence, now become, like the Book itself, inane to all readers. This was the chosen soul's employment of Friedrich, the flower of life to him, at Reinsberg, through the yea? 1739. It did not actually get to press till Spring 1740; nor actually come out till Autumn,--by which time a great change had occurred in Friedrich's title and circumstances: but we may as well say here what little is to be said of it for modern readers.|$|R

Which might indeed have saved <b>immensities</b> <b>of</b> trouble to the whole world, {{as well as to the}} Pair in question, and have made a very different History for Germany and the rest of us. Fancy it! But for many reasons, change of religion, had there been no other, it was an impossible notion.

The Pragmatic Sanction. [...] "Accept my Pragmatic Sanction," [...] said the Kaiser, [...] "let that be the preliminary of all things."--"Not the preliminary," [...] answered Fleury; [...] "we will see to that as we go on; not the preliminary, by any means!" [...] There was the rub.

[...] The Kaiser was equally inflexible. Whereupon <b>immensities</b> <b>of</b> protocolling, arguing, and the Congress [...] "fell into complete languor," [...] say the Histories.

60|$|Most {{travelled}} Englishmen {{who have}} seen {{much of the world}} and resided for long or short periods in many widely separated countries would probably agree that there is a vast difference in the feeling of strangeness, or want of harmony with our surroundings, experienced in old and in new countries. It is a compound feeling and some of its elements are the same in both cases; but in one there is a disquieting element which the other is without. Thus, in Southern Europe, Egypt, Syria, and in many countries of Asia, and some portions of Africa, the wanderer from home might experience dissatisfaction and be ill at ease and wish for old familiar sights and sounds; but in a colony like Tasmania, and in any new country where there were no remains of antiquity, no links with the past, the feeling would be very much more poignant, and in some scenes and moods would be like that sense of desolation which assails us at the thought of the heartless voids and <b>immensities</b> <b>of</b> the universe.|$|R
