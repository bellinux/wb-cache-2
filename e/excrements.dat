5|$|In 2005, after {{a hundred}} years of neglect, {{a part of the}} Mare aux Songes swamp was {{excavated}} by an international team of researchers (International Dodo Research Project). To prevent malaria, the British had covered the swamp with hard core during their rule over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles), and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found in the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct Cylindraspis genus, and 7.1% belonged to dodos, which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. Furthermore, cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the <b>excrements</b> of animals gathered around the swamp, which died of intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring. Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp, few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.|$|E
25|$|The {{partially}} digested and pulverized gizzard contents {{are passed}} into the intestine, where pancreatic and intestinal enzymes complete the digestion of the digestible food. The digestion products are then absorbed through the intestinal mucosa into the blood. The intestine ends via the large intestine in the vent or cloaca which serves as the common exit for renal and intestinal <b>excrements</b> {{as well as for}} the laying of eggs. However, unlike mammals, many birds do not excrete the bulky portions (roughage) of their undigested food (e.g. feathers, fur, bone fragments, and seed husks) via the cloaca, but regurgitate them as food pellets.|$|E
25|$|At {{this period}} the {{compounds}} employed in medicine were often heterogeneous mixtures, {{some of which}} contained from 20 to 70, or more, ingredients, while {{a large number of}} simples were used in consequence of the same substance being supposed to possess different qualities according to the source from which it was derived. Thus crabs’ eyes (i.e., gastroliths), pearls, oyster shells, and coral were supposed to have different properties. Among other ingredients entering into some of these formulae were the <b>excrements</b> of human beings, dogs, mice, geese, and other animals, calculi, human skull, and moss growing on it, blind puppies, earthworms, etc.|$|E

25|$|The helminthic {{disease is}} {{so named because}} the {{infection}} is transmitted through ingestion of the nematode eggs in the soil, which is contaminated through <b>excrements.</b> Therefore, the disease is most prevalent in warm and moist climates where sanitation and hygiene are poor and waters are unsafe, including the temperate zones during warmer months. STH is categorised among neglected tropical diseases because it inflicts tremendous disability and suffering, which can be clinically treated and relatively easily be prevented (primarily through improved sanitation), yet negligible {{attention has been given}} for many years. It is now among the target diseases of London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (launched on 30 January 2012) to be controlled/eradicated by 2020.|$|E

25|$|The {{status of}} the genus as a truly {{carnivorous}} plant has been repeatedly put into question. In their natural habitat, all species have been observed playing host to live bugs of the genus Setocoris, which nourished themselves by eating prey caught by the plants. Following this discovery it was assumed that, as with the genus Roridula, the plants don't actually digest their prey themselves, rather relying on the bugs to do that. The plants, it was reasoned, benefited by absorbing nutrients from the <b>excrements</b> of the bugs, either through their leaves or through the ground. An indirect digestion of these nutrients by a chitinase producing fungus was even proposed. It wasn't until 2005 that direct digestion of insect prey by enzymes secreted by the sessile glands of B. filifolia was proven. Soon thereafter similar results were found with B. liniflora. These results clearly place this genus among the true carnivorous plants.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{density and}} spatial {{location}} of bacteria were investigated within different horizons of an upland grassland soil {{before and after}} a liming treatment to increase the numbers of large soil fauna. Bacterial cells were located by image analysis of stained thin sections and densities calculated from these data. <b>Excrement</b> from macro- and meso-fauna was identified using micromorphology and the densities of bacteria on specific areas of <b>excrement</b> measured by image analysis. There were significant differences among horizons in the density of bacterial cells, with the minimum density found in the horizon with least evidence of earthworm activity, but no difference in density between the organic H and organo-mineral Ah horizons. Soil improvement by liming significantly increased bacterial densities in all three horizons, with the greatest increase found in the horizon with the smallest density before liming. There were no differences in bacterial density between areas dominated by <b>excrement</b> from earthworms and <b>excrement</b> from enchytraeids, although densities in both areas were significantly increased by liming. Variability in bacterial density at spatial scales of less than 1 mm {{was linked to the}} occurrence of <b>excrement.</b> Bacterial densities within areas of both types of <b>excrement</b> were significantly greater than those in the surrounding soil. However, the frequency distribution of the ratios of density in <b>excrement</b> to that in the soil was bimodal, with a majority of occurrences having a ratio near 1 and only some 20 – 30 % having a much larger ratio. These variations can probably be explained by variations {{in the age of the}} <b>excrement</b> and its suitability as a substrate...|$|R

60|$|From {{a similar}} feeling, “every substance,” says Dr. Paris,(231) “whose origin is {{involved}} in mystery, has at different times been eagerly applied to the purposes of medicine.

60|$|But, {{to proceed}} to other enormities: Every person who walks the streets, must needs observe the immense number of human <b>excrements</b> at the doors and steps of waste houses, and {{at the sides of}} every dead wall; for which the disaffected party have {{assigned}} a very false and malicious cause. They would have it, that these heaps were laid there privately by British fundaments, to make the world believe, that our Irish vulgar do daily eat and drink; and, consequently, that the clamour of poverty among us, must be false, proceeding only from Jacobites and Papists. They would confirm this, by pretending to observe, that a British anus being more narrowly perforated than one of our own country; and many of these <b>excrements</b> upon a strict view appearing copple crowned, with a point like a cone or pyramid, are easily distinguished from the Hibernian, which lie much flatter, and with lest continuity. I communicated this conjecture to an eminent physician, who is well versed in such profound speculations; and at my request was pleased to make trial with each of his fingers, by thrusting them into the anus of several persons of both nations, and professed he could find no such difference between them as those ill-disposed people allege. On the contrary, he assured me, that much the greater number of narrow cavities were of Hibernian origin. This I only mention to shew how ready the Jacobites are to lay hold of any handle to express their malice against the government. I had almost forgot to add, that my friend the physician could, by smelling each finger, distinguish the Hibernian excrement from the British, and was not above twice mistaken in an hundred experiments; upon which he intends very soon to publish a learned dissertation.|$|E

This favourite is hated by the whole herd, and therefore, to protect himself, keeps always near the person of his leader.
