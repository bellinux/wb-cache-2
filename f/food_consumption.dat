Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the Taíno, hunted it for <b>food</b> <b>consumption</b> but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for the pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline.

5|$|Technetium plays {{no natural}} {{biological}} role {{and is not}} normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity.

5|$|Being herbivores, {{blackbuck}} graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. They prefer sedges, fall witchgrass, mesquite, {{and live}} oak. They have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia {{trees in the}} Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem {{were found to be}} palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently crude protein intake in summer was very low, even below the recommended value. Blackbuck had a lower <b>food</b> <b>consumption</b> in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and blackbuck {{may play a role in}} their dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce.

40|$|Dietary {{habits of}} children, {{including}} snack <b>foods</b> <b>consumption,</b> {{in developing countries}} have seldom been investi-gated {{in relation to their}} nutrition and health. To assess the effects of snack <b>foods</b> <b>consumption</b> of 154 children aged 1 - 12 years in a rural village of West Java, Indonesia, a 3 -hour-interval food recall survey for all meals and snack foods consumed in seven consecutive days for each subject, anthropometry, and interviews for socio-demographic indicators were conducted. Their overall prevalence of stunting and underweight was 69. 5 % and 35. 7 %. There were 221 foods consumed by the subjects, among which 68 foods were categorized as snack foods. Though the children of both < 7 year and ≥ 7 year age groups consumed snack foods similarly throughout the day, the latter group only consumed larger amounts of energy from snack foods at school recess-times. The mean per-cent contribution of snack foods was 59. 6 % for fat, 40. 0 % for energy, 20. 6 % for calcium, and < 10 % for vitamins A and C. Half number of the subjects who snacked more than the median amount consumed less carbohydrate and vitamin C than the remaining half. Furthermore, the more snack-consuming group the lower z score for height-for-age (HAZ) among schoolchildren. To improve this nutritionally vulnerable situation, <b>consumption</b> of snack <b>foods</b> should be replaced by the non-snack foods which contain much higher nutrient density, i. e., 15 times for calcium and 32 times for vitamin A. Moreover, considering high snack <b>foods</b> <b>consumption</b> of ≥ 7 y age grou...|$|R
