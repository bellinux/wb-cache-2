5000|$|<b>Grain</b> <b>moisture</b> content at {{harvesting}} is {{an important}} piece of the yield monitoring process. It is used in many cases, dependent upon manufacturer, in the grain mass flow sensor calibration and provides producers with additional information about spatial variability within a field. <b>Grain</b> <b>moisture</b> is sensed by measuring the capacitance of the grain by passing a known grain volume between two electrically conductive plates. Typically this sensor is mounted on the clean grain elevator and a sample metered into the sensor {{and back into the}} clean grain elevator after it has been processed. [...] This sensor orientation allows for sampling <b>grain</b> <b>moisture</b> throughout a field during harvest operations.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the use of high <b>moisture</b> <b>grain</b> has become more popular due to the {{increased}} costs of handling and dry feed grains. For cattle feeders in particular, storing <b>grains</b> as high <b>moisture</b> is one practice that can improve their competitive position and reduce costs. Using high <b>moisture</b> <b>grains</b> allows greater opportunity to design a system that will minimize harvest, storage and feed processing costs. Grains such as sorghum and wheat have been stored as high moisture, but corn is the principal high <b>moisture</b> <b>grain</b> stored. High <b>moisture</b> corn can be processed and stored as whole shelled corn, ground shelled corn or ground ear corn.

50|$|Farmers {{experienced}} {{difficulty in}} drying their crops and protecting it from pests while in storage. Treatment for pest eradication in the stored grain was costly, requiring {{an investment in}} drying and storage facilities for each farm. Failure to dry the grain to the required 14% of moisture also resulted in mouldy grain which was difficult to sell and added to the poor reputation of the Tablelands crop. Initially farmers stored their maize in barns but rodents and weevils soon encouraged the more affluent farmers to erect 1,200 gallon galvanised tanks for storage. They tried to overcome <b>grain</b> <b>moisture</b> problems by sun drying their maize on canvas tarpaulins before storing it in the tanks. Carbon bisulphate was then added {{to the top of}} the sealed tanks to kill the weevils. These efforts had variable results.|$|E
5000|$|Measurement {{of grain}} yield {{comes from the}} {{measured}} grain mass flow, the harvester speed, and header width. <b>Grain</b> <b>moisture</b> {{as determined by the}} moisture sensor or by operator input into the yield monitor can also be included to estimate dry grain mass. In the United States the grain yield is typically reported as bushels per acre. SI units for grain yield measurement are typically reported as tonnes per hectare or in few cases [...] The harvester speed can be obtained by ground speed measurement from measuring the wheel speed of the harvester, radar mounted on the harvester, or by GPS. The head, as it is referred to is the device mounted {{on the front of the}} harvester by which the crop is gathered into the harvester. The width of the head is determined by the effective width of crop that can be harvested as the combine moves in the forward direction.|$|E
50|$|Multiple layer drying method {{refers to}} the use of LP heat or natural gas in drying corn. Compared to {{low-temperature}} methods, multiple-layer drying requires higher temperatures, which results in a shorter allowable storage time.Multiple-layer drying without stirring is the basic multiple-layer drying method, in which airstream is entered through an LP heater by a fan. Usually, the temperature rise after the LP burner is remained low in order to avoid over drying in the bottom layers in the bin. As soon as corn is dried in the bin, the burner is turned off and the fan is used to bring the corn to ambient temperature. The advantages of multiple-layer drying without stirring are little handling of corn, and bin can be used as either dryer or storage; the disadvantages are slow filling and over drying in the bottom layers (Bern and Brumm, 2010).Multiple-layer drying with stirring can not only dry grain equilibrium from top to bottom, but also decrease the air resistance of the grain. Moreover, using stirring system can avoid over drying in bottom layer problem and give a uniform <b>grain</b> <b>moisture</b> content in the whole bin. When drying is complete, the burner is turned off while the fan and stirrer are used to mix the corn to achieve equal moisture content and temperature. The advantages of adding stirring are preventing over drying and accelerating drying and allowable fill rate; the disadvantages of stirring system are additional expenses and decreasing bin capacity.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Grain in the U. S. Northwest is {{typically}} both over-dry and too warm for safe storage after harvest. Laboratory and computer studies {{were used to}} examine aeration with cool and high humidity air to alleviate both deficiencies, while maintaining grain quality with safe storage conditions. A wide range of high humidity aeration conditions was produced in the laboratory to study the effect of moisture condensation on the <b>grain</b> and <b>moisture</b> adsorption during and after cooling the grain. Computer simulations were used to evaluate long-term temperature and moisture changes from aeration. Results demonstrated the possibility of maintaining optimum <b>grain</b> temperature and <b>moisture</b> content when these processes are correctly managed. The tests showed that moisture accumulation (by adsorption), but not moisture condensation, needs to be monitored for safe aeration management. Unsafe storage conditions can occur when aerating for long, or even short, periods with high relative humidity air...|$|R

50|$|Glyphosate {{is used as}} a pre-harvest {{herbicide}} {{and harvest}} aid on cereal crops including wheat and oats and on oil seed rape. As a systemic herbicide it is not a true desiccant as it can take weeks rather than days for the crop to die back after application. In the UK, it began to be applied to wheat crops in the 1980s to control perennial weeds such as common couch which was very effective and meant that sowing of the next crop could occur sooner. Use as a harvest aid in the UK increased after the introduction of strobilurin fungicides which prolong the longevity of the leaves, and in 2002, 12% of UK wheat crops were treated. The timing of application is crucial as the moisture content of the grain must be below 30% for the yield of the crop to be unaffected and to minimise uptake of glyphosate by the grain. Yield may be affected and residues increased if applications are made to uneven fields in which some areas have a moisture content over 30%. Although used in weed-free and evenly maturing crops with the aim of reducing the <b>grain</b> <b>moisture</b> content more rapidly to hasten the harvest, {{there is little or no}} advantage in doing so. Glyphosate was found in 5-15 % of cereal crop samples tested in the UK between 2000 and 2004, although never exceeding the Maximum Residue Level of 20 mg/kg. A survey of British wheat in 2006-8 found average levels of 0.05-0.22 mg/kg with maximum levels of 1.2 mg/kg. In July 2013 Austria banned the use of pre-harvest glyphosate citing the precautionary principle. In April 2015 an oat buyer in Western Canada announced that it was refusing oats in which pre-harvest glyphosate had been used.|$|E
50|$|Seeds stored {{hermetically}} {{have shown}} to exhibit prolonged quality. Researches in Ghana investigated {{the effectiveness of}} storing seeds using three different types of grain storage. The three methods used in the research included the jute, polypropylene and triple layer hermetic storage. Two destructive insects pests, Adult Prostephanus truncatus and Sitophilus were infested in each bag. These two insects pests are common in Africa and are very destructive to maize. Unprotected maize in storage can be totally annihilated by these organisms. Of these three methods, the triple layer hermetic storage offered outstanding results of seed quality with prolonged germination rate and viability despite insect infestation. Additionally, to ensure that grain maintains its natural quality in storage, {{it has to be}} stored at optimal moisture contents of approximately 12 -14% and preferably low moisture content. The bags have to be sealed for the entire period of storage and regular check ups need to be down to ascertain that the seal remains intact i.e. very air tight bags. Another study investigated the efficacy of controlling bean pests i.e. Acanthoscelides obtectus on the quality of beans by employing the hermetic storage system (silo bags and plastic bottles) and non-hermetic glass containers. Beans were stored at high moisture contents of 15%, temperature 25 C and relative humidity 70± 5%. In the study the hermetic method showed no alteration in quality.Deterioration in grain quality arises from several factors (1) high moisture content at the time of storage. High <b>grain</b> <b>moisture</b> content promotes development of molds which renders the grains unusable or unsafe for consumption. (2) failure to keep storage bags air tight from oxygen which would otherwise accelerate insect infestation leading to total destruction of grain. In this phenomenon, hermetic conditions are not met to secure the grain from insects. (3) Failure to keep the bags water tight to prevent moisture infiltration, (4) high temperatures leading to grain discoloration and largely insect infestation.|$|E
