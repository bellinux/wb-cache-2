5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{view is that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> {{formal structure}} of the Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but {{the presence of a}} practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity.

5|$|As regards proportionality, the law {{states that}} a self-defense {{may not be}} manifestly disproportionate. It is evident, that for a self-defense to be successful, {{it has to be}} {{performed}} on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.|$|E

5|$|Federal Forest Highway16 (FFH16) is {{a forest}} highway {{in the western}} Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. This road runs through the Ottawa National Forest in Iron, Houghton and Ontonagon counties. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has erroneously marked it as H-16 on their {{official}} state map. FFH16 is designated by the US Forest Service (USFS) with maintenance shared by the county road commissions (ICRC, HCRC, OCRC, respectively). Although the MDOT maps would {{suggest that it is}} a part of the County-Designated Highway System (CDH system), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> three counties in question do not participate in the system, and the roadway falls in the middle of the G zone for numbering purposes.|$|E
5|$|Following mass vaccinations, disease {{detection}} and containment were {{central to the}} eradication campaign. As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts, who were vaccinated. Successes came quickly; by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa, nor, by 1971, in Brazil. By 1973, smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, Botswana and Ethiopia. Finally, after 13 years of coordinated disease surveillance and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organisation declared smallpox eradicated in 1979. Although the main weapon used was vaccinia virus, which {{was used as the}} vaccine, no one seems to know exactly where vaccinia virus came from; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> strain of cowpox that Edward Jenner used, and it is not a weakened form of smallpox.|$|E
5|$|In her interview, Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg {{describes}} purchasing sex from {{a prostitute}} as paying to masturbate into someone. The leader {{of an organization}} working to rescue girls from prostitution in Cambodia says that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> poorest parents who sell their children into sexual slavery but rather the parents who are looking to buy luxury goods. He therefore argues that sex trafficking is a spiritual and moral issue that cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes. Another interview features an American {{man who had been}} a sex tourist in Asia.|$|E

5|$|MOHH {{may have}} been the first hip-hop dance {{convention}}, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only one that exists. Urban Dance Camp (UDC) is a six-week-long German-based dance convention held every year in Lörrach, a small town on the border of France and Switzerland. In a report on the event by a local paper, Bettina Kraft, the manager of UDC, estimated that 85% of the participants were from outside of Germany. In 2009 Kraft created Urban Dance Showcase, a parallel event to UDC reserved only for performances by professional choreographers, dance crews, and UDC teachers. Dancers such as Shaun Evaristo, Les Twins, I.aM.mE, b-boy Lilou, and b-boy Hong 10 have performed at the showcase in the past.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for tracheal intubation is for the placement of a conduit through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered.
