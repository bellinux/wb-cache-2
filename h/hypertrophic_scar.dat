40|$|Wound {{healing in}} <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring</b> and keloid animal models {{presents}} significant differences {{when compared with}} humans. A brief review is presented about <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring</b> in animal models during the last 5 years. Models were described by animals and scientific artifices to cause <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring.</b> They were divided into 1) heterologous <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring</b> or keloid implants in immunodeficient animals (athymic mice and rats); 2) heterologous <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring</b> or keloid implant in immune privileged site (hamster cheek pouch); 3) <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring</b> or keloid induction via chemically mediated injury (guinea pigs); 4) <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring</b> or keloid induction in anatomic specific site (rabbit ear); and the 5) porcine model. the ideal model would allow to research pathophysiology, histology, and molecular events during time and to test prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for humans. Some of these animals were useful to study specific steps of the scarring process and better understand abnormal wound healing, {{but none of them}} have a widespread use. Most recently, the female red Duroc pigs were validated as a new model, demonstrating its similarity to human conditions in different ways. Full-thickness human skin grafts in nude mice also represent improvement in the search of an ideal <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring</b> animal model.

40|$|Immunoperoxidase {{staining}} of skin sections {{obtained from}} 11 <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scars,</b> six normotrophic scars and three samples of normal skin were performed using anti-HLA monoclonal antibodies (HLA-DR, -DQ, class I), anti-interleukin- 2 receptor (IL- 2 R) and anti-CD 1.

40|$|Background: <b>Hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring</b> {{carries a}} large burden of disease, {{including}} disfigurement, pain and disability. There is currently no effective medical treatment {{to reduce or}} prevent <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring.</b> Flightless I (Flii), {{a member of the}} gelsolin family of actin remodelling proteins, is an important negative regulator of wound repair. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of Flii as a potential regulator of <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring.</b> Methods: Using human skin samples and an animal model of bleomycin-induced <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring</b> in mice that overexpress or have reduced expression of Flii, we investigated its effect on dermal fibrosis and <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring.</b> Results: Flii expression was increased in human burns and <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scars.</b> A similar increase in Flii was observed in <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scars</b> formed in mice post-treatment with bleomycin. However, Flii-deficient (Flii+/−) mice had reduced scarring in response to bleomycin evidenced by decreased dermal thickness, smaller cross-sectional scar areas, fewer myofibroblasts and a decreased collagen I/III ratio. In contrast, bleomycin-treated Flii-overexpressing mice (FliiTg/Tg) showed increased scar dermal thickness, larger cross-sectional scar areas, more myofibroblasts and an increased collagen I/III ratio. Injecting developing scars with a Flii neutralizing antibody led to a significant reduction in the size of the scars and a reduction in the collagen I/III ratio. Conclusion: This study identifies Flii as a profibrotic agent that contributes to excessive scar formation. Reducing its activity using neutralizing antibodies is a promising approach for reducing <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring.</b> A. M. Cameron, C. T. Turner, D. H. Adams, J. E. Jackson, E. Melville, R.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is {{possibly}} associated with altered wound healing including {{the development of}} <b>hypertrophic</b> or keloidal <b>scarring.</b> The management of these lesions {{may prove to be}} difficult, and there are no universally accepted treatment protocols. Objective To assess erythema fading of <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scars</b> following cold applications. METHODS: Skin color was assessed using the Visi-Chroma VC 100 technology following validation of the method. We compared the effects of freezing or cooling <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scars</b> developed in 45 Caucasian pregnant women. The effects of liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy, hydrogel cooling pads, and thermal contact cushions were compared.

CONCLUSION: Freezing or cooling <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scars</b> helps reducing erythema of <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scars.</b> This effect probably results from an inhibitory action exerted on the microvasculature.

50|$|A <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> is a {{cutaneous}} condition {{characterized by}} deposits of excessive amounts of collagen which {{gives rise to}} a raised scar, but not to the degree observed with keloids.

They generally develop after thermal or traumatic injury that involves the deep layers of the dermis and express high levels of TGF-β.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{complications}} and often causes the disfigurement or deformity in burn or trauma patients. Therapeutic methods on <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> treatment have limitations due to the poor understanding of mechanisms of <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> formation. To throw light on the molecular mechanism of <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> formation will definitely improve the outcome of the treatment. This study aimed to illustrate the negative role of eukaryotic initiation factor 6 (eIF 6) in the process of human <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> formation, and provide a possible indicator of <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> treatment and a potential target molecule for <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar.</b> Methods: In the present study, we investigated the protein expression of eIF 6 in the human <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> of different periods by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis.

40|$|<b>Hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> is {{the result}} of {{abnormal}} healing that often follows thermal injury. <b>Hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> is characterized by excessive dermal fibrosis and scarring. Five cases of human <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> were compared with normal skin using in situ hybridization to localize mRNAs for procollagen types I and III and transforming growth factor-β 1.

40|$|Scar {{formation}} {{is a normal}} outcome of wound healing. However, after trauma, surgical injury and especially in burn wounds, <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> formation can occur. This {{is a process of}} abnormal wound healing resulting in raised, red scars. Patients with <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> formation are presented with itching, pressure, pain and cosmetical concerns. It is believed that <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> {{formation is}} caused by an exaggerated inflammatory response, stimulating fibroblasts to produce excessive ECM. Abnormal ECM composition and increased ECM production result in hypertrophic scars. Current treatments of HSF are inefficient and variable. However still incomplete, our understanding of the etiology of <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> formation has lead to new targets for preventive treatments.

40|$|<b>Hypertrophic</b> <b>scarring</b> is {{a common}} proliferative {{disorder}} of dermal fibroblasts characterized by collagen overproduction and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). There is no consensus about the best therapeutics to produce complete and permanent improvement of scars with few side effects. To investigate the therapeutic effects of oleanolic acid (OA) on <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scars</b> and explore the possible mechanism of action involved, a rabbit ear model with <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scars</b> was established. OA (2. 5 %, 5 %, and 10 %) was given once daily to the scars for 28 consecutive days. As a result, OA significantly alleviated formed <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scars</b> on rabbit ears. The levels of TGF-β 1, MMP- 1, TIMP- 1, and collagens I and III were notably decreased, {{and the number of}} apoptosis cells and mRNA expression of MMP- 2, caspase- 3, and caspase- 9 were markedly increased in the scar tissue. The scar elevation index (SEI) was also evidently reduced. Histological findings exhibited significant amelioration of the collagen tissue. These results suggest that OA has the favorable curative effects on formed <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scars</b> in the rabbit ear model, and the possible mechanism of action is that OA decreases HSFs proliferation and increases HSFs apoptosis by reduction of P 311 gene expression and TGF-β 1 production, inhibition of TIMP- 1 secretion, enhancement of MMP- 2 activity, and subsequently facilitation of degradation of collagen types I and III...|$|R

However, {{little is known about the}} response of cultured human <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> fibroblasts to adrenaline. In this study, we investigated cell proliferation and involved mechanisms in <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> fibroblasts in response to adrenaline. Population doubling time (PDT) assay and MTT assay were performed to determine the cell proliferation and cell viability, respectively. The expression of bFGF and TGF- ß 1 was measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that adrenaline inhibited proliferation of normal and <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, adrenaline up-regulated the expression of bFGF and down-regulated the expression of TGF- ß 1 in normal and <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> fibroblasts. Interestingly incubation with the a receptor antagonist regitine indicated that adrenaline mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and regulation of TGF-ß 1 and bFGF in cultured normal and <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> fibroblasts were mediated by the a receptor.

40|$|Background/Aims: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) {{are thought}} to play crucial roles in human diseases.

Methods: In this study, we investigated the expression of lncRNA 8975 - 1 in <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> tissues and fibroblasts by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). To investigate its function, overexpression and knockdown of lncRNA 8975 - 1 were performed using lentivirus infection and Stealth RNAi transfection, respectively. Cell proliferation was detected by CCK- 8 assay. The protein levels of collagens and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were analysed by western blot. Results: We found that lncRNA 8975 - 1 was overexpressed in <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> tissues and dermal fibroblasts. Overexpression of lncRNA 8975 - 1 inhibited cell proliferation and reduced the protein expression levels of COL 1 A 2, COL 1 A 1, COL 3 A 1 and α-SMA in <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>scar</b> fibroblasts, whereas knockdown of lncRNA 8975 - 1 had the opposite effect.
