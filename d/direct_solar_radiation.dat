25|$|Parabolic trough {{power plants}} use a curved, {{mirrored}} trough which reflects the <b>direct</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> onto a glass tube containing a fluid (also called a receiver, absorber or collector) running {{the length of}} the trough, positioned at {{the focal point of the}} reflectors. The trough is parabolic along one axis and linear in the orthogonal axis. For change of the daily position of the sun perpendicular to the receiver, the trough tilts east to west so that the direct radiation remains focused on the receiver. However, seasonal changes in the angle of sunlight parallel to the trough does not require adjustment of the mirrors, since the light is simply concentrated elsewhere on the receiver. Thus the trough design does not require tracking on a second axis. The receiver may be enclosed in a glass vacuum chamber. The vacuum significantly reduces convective heat loss.|$|E

Instead of <b>direct</b> measurements, <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> may be estimated from empirical <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> models that employ more commonly measured variables or direct outputs of general and regional circulation models (such as air temperature). Coefficients for these models are site-dependent. This usually implies that they are estimated for stations with direct radiation measurements, but need to be interpolated for other locations. In this paper, we introduce a procedure to auto-calibrate empirical <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> models {{that are based on}} daily air temperature range, i. e. Bristow and Campbell (1984), and Hargreaves et al. (1985). Meteosat Second Generation data were used to create two static look-up tables of mean cloud cover and clear-sky transmissivity as input for the auto-calibration procedure. We demonstrate that daily <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> can be accurately estimated from daily air temperature range measurements without site-specific empirical coefficients that require stations that measure <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> The average relative root mean square error for our auto-calibrated models was comparable to ground-measurement-based calibration; only 1 % higher for the Bristow and Campbell model (p < 0. 05, n = 126), and 2 % higher for the Hargreaves model (p < 0. 05, n = 126). The mean bias error, relative mean bias error and the slope of linear regression were not statistically different in comparison to ground-measurement-based calibration for the Bristow and Campbell model. When our new <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> retrieval algorithm is used to estimate evapotranspiration, we found similar accuracies when using <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> input from ground- and auto-calibration.
