It cites a poor match to eyewitness physical descriptions, a level of skydiving expertise above that predicted by their suspect profile, and an absence of direct incriminating evidence.|$|E
5|$|A soccer kick is {{performed}} when a fighter <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> {{to the side}} or {{in front of an}} opponent on the ground and kicks the grounded opponent's head. This is done in a style similar to an association football player kicking a football. Most practitioners aim to use their shins for the point of impact rather than the foot. While soccer kicks are usually delivered to the head, kicks {{to other parts of the}} body in a similar style are also referred to as soccer kicks.|$|E

After Alec hits his master's hand on the podium he <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> on, Presto then spends {{the rest of the}} show trying to catch Alec through the opening between his top hat and the wizard's hat.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all {{butterflies}} are diurnal, {{have relatively}} bright colours, and hold their wings vertically above their bodies when at rest, unlike {{the majority of}} moths which fly by night, are often cryptically coloured (well camouflaged), and either hold their wings flat (touching the surface on which the moth <b>is</b> <b>standing)</b> or fold them closely over their bodies. Some day-flying moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth, are exceptions to these rules.|$|E

5|$|The {{context-sensitive}} button mechanic {{allows one}} button {{to serve a}} variety of functions, such as talking, opening doors, and pushing, pulling, and throwing objects. The on-screen display shows what action, if any, the button will trigger, determined by the situation.

Although the film was shot in Hollywood, the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene on Lexington Avenue in New York. In the shoot, Monroe <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of her white dress, which {{became one of the most}} famous scenes of her career. The shoot lasted for several hours and attracted a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators, including professional photographers.|$|E
5|$|Jason first {{appeared}} outside of {{film in the}} 1982 novelization of Friday the 13th Part 3 by Michael Avallone. Avallone chose to use an alternate ending, which was filmed for Part 3 but never used, as the ending for his 1982 adaptation. In the alternate film ending, Chris, {{who is in the}} canoe, hears Rick's voice and immediately rushes back to the house. When she opens the door, Jason <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> there with a machete, and he decapitates her. Jason next appears in print in the 1986 novelization of Jason Lives by Simon Hawke, who also adapted the first three films in 1987 and 1988. Jason Lives specifically introduced Elias Voorhees, Jason's father, a character that was slated to appear in the film but was cut by the studio. In the novel, instead of being cremated, Elias has Jason buried after his death.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June 2013, Shakira {{released}} a teaser {{of the commercial}} for the fragrance along with a photo of her posing with two cheetahs. A full version of the commercial was released later. It begins with Shakira, dressed in a dark burgundy gown, coming across a pair of cheetahs in an arid desert region. The two animals, alarmed, commence running towards her {{in an effort to}} attack her. Shakira responds by raising her hand, which prompts the cheetahs to abruptly stop in their tracks. They are later seen prowling around her while she <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> atop a rock and a bottle of Wild Elixir is then shown placed on a log of wood. The official website of the perfume also features a game made to promote the fragrance and Shakira's Barefoot Foundation.|$|E

5|$|Stela 5 was {{situated}} {{at the base of}} Structure 1 in the East Plaza. It was carved with a rounded frame containing a figure in profile facing to the left. The figure <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> with the legs together and is wearing a feathered headdress and bears a zoomorphic head on its back, from which hang more feathers. The hands of the figure are extended forward and appear to bear a staff of rulership. The stela bears a hieroglyphic panel with an incomplete dedicatory date that must fall within the range from December 740 to November 805. The text also contains the name of the king who dedicated the stela, Shield Jaguar, and the Emblem Glyph of El Chal.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Gaga, {{dressed in black}} clothing, sunglasses, bloody feet, and {{seemingly}} bionic features, walking through a field in Nebraska; having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly drops it as a toothless man with a doll in his hand grins at her. She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a water tank appear in quick succession. The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a piano {{in the middle of}} a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top of the piano, smoking and drinking a beer. As Calderone pulls up his sleeves, present day Gaga is still walking through the desert.|$|E

5|$|Six of the 12 {{films have}} been adapted into novels—Friday the 13th 1 – 3, Jason Lives, Jason X, and Freddy vs. Jason—with Friday the 13th Part 3 being adapted twice. The first novel was Michael Avallone's 1982 {{adaptation}} of Friday the 13th Part 3; Avallone had previously adapted Beneath the Planet of the Apes and Shock Treatment. The author {{chose to use}} an alternate ending, one that was filmed for Part 3 but never used, as the conclusion for his adaptation. In the alternate ending, Chris, {{who is in a}} canoe, hears her boyfriend Rick's voice and immediately runs back to the house. When she opens the door, Jason <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> there with a machete and decapitates her. The next book was not published until 1986, when Simon Hawke adapted Jason Lives. Hawke would also adapt the first three films into novels, and his adaptation of the original Friday the 13th was published in 1987, with novelizations of Part 2 and 3 both being published in 1988. Hawke's first adaptation, Jason Lives, introduced the character of Elias Voorhees, Jason's father, who was supposed to appear in the film before being cut by the studio. The book explains how Elias has Jason's body buried, instead of the planned cremation, after his death in The Final Chapter.|$|E
5|$|Stela 39 is {{the broken}} {{bottom half of}} a stela that was found inside Temple 5D-86, on the east-west axis running through the East Platform from the Lost World Pyramid. The {{monument}} is sculpted {{on the front and}} back faces and was deliberately broken in ancient times and was moved inside the temple in order to save it. The front of the stela shows the bottom half of a person, who is identified as a ruler by his costume; the back features two columns of hieroglyphs. The king depicted on the stela is ChakTokIch'aakI, who governed in the 4th century AD. This king <b>is</b> <b>standing</b> over a bound captive; the bearded captive appears to be a noble since he retains his clothing. The stela celebrates an event in AD 376 and appears to have been moved to the Mundo Perdido in relation to a funerary ceremony. The stela was possibly moved to the temple by king YaxNuunAyiinII to celebrate the changing of the 20-year k'atun Maya calendrical cycle in AD 771 and thereby link himself to ChakTokIch'aakI. It was placed directly over the most important of the late 4th century elite tombs. The stela continued to be worshipped in the Terminal Classic, as evidenced by the presence of polychrome ceramic offerings and incense burners.|$|E
