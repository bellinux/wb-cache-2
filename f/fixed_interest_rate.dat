25|$|In both {{classical}} and Keynesian economics, the money market is analyzed as a supply-and-demand system with interest rates being the price. The money supply {{may be a}} vertical supply curve, if the central bank of a country chooses to use monetary policy to fix its value regardless of the interest rate; {{in this case the}} money supply is totally inelastic. On the other hand, the money supply curve is a horizontal line if the central bank is targeting a <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and ignoring the value of the money supply; in this case the money supply curve is perfectly elastic. The demand for money intersects with the money supply to determine the interest rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{securities}} can {{be issued}} {{with either a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> or a floating rate under currency pegging system. Fixed rate ABS set the “coupon” (rate) {{at the time of}} issuance, in a fashion similar to corporate bonds and T-Bills. Floating rate securities may be backed by both amortizing and non-amortizing assets in the floating market. In contrast to fixed rate securities, the rates on “floaters” will periodically adjust up or down according to a designated index such as a U.S. Treasury rate, or, more typically, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The floating rate usually reflects the movement in the index plus an additional fixed margin to cover the added risk.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Many {{associations}} in the Farm Credit System, which are financial cooperatives, pay their member-borrowers a cash patronage payment {{based on the}} amount of loan volume with the association. In today's competitive lending environment, some Farm Credit associations have offered lower <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> on new loans but these new member-borrowers have to forgo their cash patronage payment to receive this new, lower-interest rate loan. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify Farm Credit member-borrowers' preferences for patronage refunds received as a cash payment versus lower <b>fixed</b> real estate <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Preferences for patronage refunds or lower <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are elicited from Farm Credit Services of East Central Oklahoma member-borrowers via conjoint analysis. Findings – Results show that member-borrowers strongly prefer patronage refunds compared to lower <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Originality/value – This paper fulfills a need to better understand patronage refund programs within the Farm Credit System.

25|$|Among {{the most}} common indices are the rates on 1-year constant-maturity Treasury (CMT) securities, the cost of funds index (COFI), and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). A few lenders use their own cost of funds as an index, rather than using other indices. This is done to ensure a steady margin for the lender, whose own cost of funding will usually {{be related to the}} index. Consequently, {{payments}} made by the borrower may change over time with the changing interest rate (alternatively, the term of the loan may change). This is distinct from the graduated payment mortgage, which offers changing payment amounts but a <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> Other forms of mortgage loan include the interest-only mortgage, the fixed-rate mortgage, the negative amortization mortgage, and the balloon payment mortgage.|$|E
25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; {{it has to be done}} in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have to start making payments several years before actually getting the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to plan ahead for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E

These bonds would not be tradable but could be held by investors with the EMF and liquidated at any time.

To ensure fiscal discipline despite lack of market pressure, the EMF would operate according to strict rules, providing funds only to countries that meet fiscal and macroeconomic criteria.|$|E
