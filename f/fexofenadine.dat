25|$|Itching tends {{not to be}} {{a severe}} problem when opioids are used for pain relief, but antihistamines are useful for counteracting itching when it occurs. Non-sedating antihistamines such as <b>fexofenadine</b> are often {{preferred}} as they avoid increasing opioid induced drowsiness. However, some sedating antihistamines such as orphenadrine can produce a synergistic pain relieving effect permitting smaller doses of opioids be used. Consequently, several opioid/antihistamine combination products have been marketed, such as Meprozine (meperidine/promethazine) and Diconal (dipipanone/cyclizine), and these may also reduce opioid induced nausea.|$|E
2500|$|Diphenhydramine is not {{recommended}} for people older than 60 or {{children under the age}} of six, unless a physician is consulted. These populations should be treated with second-generation antihistamines such as loratadine, desloratadine, <b>fexofenadine,</b> cetirizine, levocetirizine, and azelastine. Due to its strong anticholinergic effects, diphenhydramine is on the [...] "Beers list" [...] of drugs to avoid in the elderly.|$|E
2500|$|Ulcerative colitis can {{be treated}} {{with a number of}} medications, {{including}} 5-ASA drugs such as sulfasalazine and mesalazine. Corticosteroids such as prednisone can also be used due to their immunosuppressive and short-term healing properties, but because their risks outweigh their benefits, they are not used long-term in treatment. Immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and biological agents such as infliximab and adalimumab are given only if people cannot achieve remission with 5-ASA and corticosteroids. Such treatments are used less commonly [...] due to their possible risk factors, including but not limited to increased risk of cancers in teenagers and adults, tuberculosis, and new or worsening heart failure (these side effects are rare). A formulation of budesonide was approved by the FDA for treatment of active ulcerative colitis in January 2013. The evidence on methotrexate does not show a benefit in producing remission in people with ulcerative colitis. Off-label use of drugs such as ciclosporin and tacrolimus has shown some benefits. <b>Fexofenadine,</b> an antihistamine drug used in treatment of allergies, has shown promise in a combination therapy in some studies. Opportunely, low gastrointestinal absorption (or high absorbed drug gastrointestinal secretion) of <b>fexofenadine</b> results in higher concentration at the site of inflammation. Thus, the drug may locally decrease histamine secretion by involved gastrointestinal mast cells and alleviate the inflammation.|$|E
50|$|Taking {{erythromycin}} or ketoconazole {{while taking}} <b>fexofenadine</b> does increase the plasma levels of <b>fexofenadine,</b> but this increase does not influence the QT interval. The {{reason for this}} effect is likely due to transport-related effects, specifically involving p-glycoprotein (p-gp). Both erythromcin and ketoconazole are inhibitors of p-gp, a transporter protein involved in preventing the intestinal absorption of <b>fexofenadine.</b> When p-gp is inhibited, <b>fexofenadine</b> may be better absorbed by the body, increasing its plasma concentration by more than what was intended.|$|E
50|$|No {{studies have}} been done to {{evaluate}} the presence of <b>fexofenadine</b> in breast milk. Therefore, nursing women are urged to take caution while using <b>fexofenadine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Fexofenadine,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Allegra among others is an {{antihistamine}} pharmaceutical drug {{used in the}} treatment of allergy symptoms, such as hay fever, nasal congestion, and urticaria. Therapeutically, <b>fexofenadine</b> is a selective peripheral H1-blocker.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fexofenadine</b> {{is not to}} {{be taken}} with apple, orange, or {{grapefruit}} juice because it could decrease absorption of the drug and should therefore be taken with water. Grapefruit juice can significantly reduce the plasma concentration of <b>fexofenadine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the {{half-life}} of <b>fexofenadine</b> is {{shorter than}} cetirizine, which could indicate {{the need for}} twice daily dosing, although labeling often denotes dosing once a day. However, {{there is also evidence}} that cetirizine causes more sleepiness than <b>fexofenadine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Fexofenadine</b> is a {{selectively}} peripheral H1-blocker. Blockage {{prevents the}} {{activation of the}} H1 receptors by histamine, preventing the symptoms associated with allergies from occurring. <b>Fexofenadine</b> does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and is therefore less likely to cause drowsiness in comparison to other antihistamines that readily cross the blood-brain barrier (i.e. first-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine). In general, <b>fexofenadine</b> takes about one hour to take effect, though this may {{be affected by the}} choice of dosage form and the presence/absence of certain foods.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fexofenadine</b> no {{significant}} cognition-enhancing effects in healthy individuals.|$|E
50|$|Absorption: After oral application, maximum plasma {{concentrations}} are reached {{after two}} to three hours. <b>Fexofenadine</b> {{should not be taken}} with a high fat meal, as mean concentrations of <b>fexofenadine</b> in the bloodstream are seen to be reduced from 20-60% depending on form of medication (tablet, ODT, or suspension).|$|E
50|$|Antacids {{containing}} aluminium or magnesium {{should not}} be taken within 15 minutes of <b>fexofenadine</b> as they reduce the absorption of <b>fexofenadine</b> by almost 50%. This is not thought to be due to a change in pH (in fact, absorption can actually increase under increasingly alkaline pH), but rather due to the formation of metal complexes with charged/polar moieties on <b>fexofenadine.</b> As suggested by Shehnaza et al (2014), various sites of the molecule are thought to be responsible for this interaction, including the piperidine nitrogen, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, and both hydroxyl (-OH) groups.|$|E

50|$|The older {{antihistaminic}} agent terfenadine {{was found}} to metabolize into the related carboxylic acid, <b>fexofenadine.</b> <b>Fexofenadine</b> {{was found to}} retain all of the biological activity of its parent while giving fewer adverse reactions in patients, so terfenadine was replaced in the market by its metabolite. <b>Fexofenadine</b> was originally synthesized in 1993 by Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Sepracor, which then sold the development rights to Hoechst Marion Roussel (now part of Sanofi-Aventis), and was later approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996. Albany Molecular Research Inc. (AMRI) holds the patents to the intermediates and production of <b>fexofenadine</b> HCl along with Roussel. Since that time, it has achieved blockbuster drug status with global sales of $1.87B USD in 2004 (with $1.49B USD coming from the United States). AMRI received royalty payments from Aventis that enabled the growth of AMRI.|$|E

50|$|Third-generation H1-antihistamines are second-generation antihistamines informally labeled third-generation {{because the}} active {{enantiomer}} (levocetirizine) or metabolite (desloratadine and <b>fexofenadine)</b> derivatives of second-generation drugs {{are intended to}} have increased efficacy with fewer adverse drug reactions. <b>Fexofenadine</b> {{is associated with a}} lower risk of cardiac arrhythmia compared to terfenadine.
