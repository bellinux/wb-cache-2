25|$|Spotted low-density arrays {{typically}} feature picolitre {{drops of}} a range of purified cDNAs arrayed on the surface of a <b>glass</b> <b>slide.</b> The probes are longer than those of high-density arrays and typically lack the transcript resolution of high-density arrays. Spotted arrays use different fluorophores for test and control samples, and the ratio of fluorescence is used to calculate a relative measure of abundance. High-density arrays use single channel detection, and each sample is hybridised and detected individually. High-density arrays were popularised by the Affymetrix GeneChip array, where each transcript is quantified by several short 25-mer probes that together assay one gene.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiment}} was first performed with an electromagnet {{that allowed the}} non-uniform magnetic field to be turned on gradually from a null value. When the field was null, the silver atoms were deposited as a single band on the detecting <b>glass</b> <b>slide.</b> When the field was made stronger, {{the middle of the}} band began to widen and eventually to split into two, so that the glass-slide image looked like a lip-print, with an opening in the middle, and closure at either end. In the middle, where the magnetic field was strong enough to split the beam into two, statistically half of the silver atoms had been deflected by the non-uniformity of the field.|$|E
25|$|A {{counting}} chamber,(also {{known as}} hemocytometer), is a microscope slide that is especially designed to enable cell counting. The hemocytometer has two gridded chambers in its middle, which {{are covered with}} a special <b>glass</b> <b>slide</b> when counting. A drop of cell culture {{is placed in the}} space between the chamber and the glass cover, filling it by capillarity. Looking at the sample under the microscope, the researcher uses the grid to manually count the number of cells in a certain area of known size. The separating distance between the chamber and the cover is predefined, thus the volume of the counted culture can be calculated and with it the concentration of cells. Cell viability can also be determined if viability dyes are added to the fluid.|$|E

25|$|Like {{traditional}} western maps, the Fairylogue and Radio-Play map {{showed the}} west on the left, {{and the east}} on the right. However, the first map of Oz to appear in an Oz book had those directions reversed, and the compass rose adjusted accordingly. It is believed {{that this is a}} result of Baum copying the map from {{the wrong side of the}} <b>glass</b> <b>slide,</b> effectively getting a mirror image of his intended map. When he realized he was copying the slide backward, he reversed the compass rose to make the directions correct. However, an editor at Reilly and Lee reversed the compass rose, thinking he was fixing an error, and resulting in further confusion. Most notably, this confused Ruth Plumly Thompson, who frequently reversed directions in her own Oz books as a result.|$|E

The fibers were embedded by tightly wrapping {{them on a}} small <b>glass</b> <b>slide</b> and sandwiching a collagen-TERP solution {{between it}} and another glass slide; spacers between the glass slides set the gel thickness to 800µm. The conductive fibers were carbon fiber and Kevlar, and the nonconductive fibers were nylon-6 and tungsten wire. Neurites extend in all directions in thick bundles on the carbon fiber; however with the other three fibers, neurites extended in fine web-like conformations. The neurites showed no directional growth on the carbon and Kevlar fibers, but they grew along the nylon-6 fibers {{and to some extent}} along the tungsten wire. The tungsten wire and nylon-6 fiber scaffolds had neurites grow into the gel near the fiber-gel interface in addition to growing along the surface. All fiber gels except Kevlar showed a significant increase in neurite extension compared to non-fiber gels. There was no difference in the neurite extension between the non-conductive and the conductive fibers.|$|E
2500|$|On September 7, 1927, Farnsworth's image {{dissector}} camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, to a receiver in another room of his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. Pem Farnsworth recalled in 1985 that her husband broke the stunned silence of his lab assistants by saying, [...] "There you are — electronic television!" [...] The source of the image was a <b>glass</b> <b>slide,</b> backlit by an arc lamp. An extremely bright source was required because of the low light sensitivity of the design. By 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. His backers had demanded to know when they would see dollars from the invention; so the first image shown was, appropriately, a dollar sign. In 1929, the design was further improved by elimination of a motor-generator; so the television system now had no mechanical parts. [...] That year Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images using his television system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Pem.|$|E

40|$|The {{pursuit of}} an {{efficient}} and economical technique for {{early detection of}} cancer {{has led to the}} development of sophisticated biosensors for antigen analysis. As biosensors become more complex, coatings are necessary and important. The preferred coatings need to have the following properties: high surface area for binding, resistance to biofouling, and flexible synthesis. The focus of this project is to determine whether using peptoid microsphere-coated <b>glass</b> <b>slides</b> in the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) microarray technique is better than using commercially available <b>glass</b> <b>slides.</b> Current microarray slides are coated with reactive groups, such as amines, epoxides, or aldehydes.

6000|$|We held a post-mortem, of course, the {{condition}} of the blood being what we most wished to observe; and the autopsy revealed some unexpected details. One remarkable feature consisted in a certain undescribed and impoverished state of the contained bodies which Sebastian, with his eager zeal for science, desired his students to see and identify. He said it was likely to throw much light on other ill-understood conditions of the brain and nervous system, {{as well as on the}} peculiar faint odour of the insane, now so well recognised in all large asylums. In order to compare this abnormal state with the aspect of the healthy circulating medium, he proposed to examine a little good living blood side by side with the morbid specimen under the microscope. Nurse Wade was in attendance in the laboratory, as usual. The Professor, standing by the instrument, with one hand on the brass screw, had got the diseased drop ready arranged for our inspection beforehand, and was gloating over it himself with scientific enthusiasm. [...] "Grey corpuscles, you will observe," [...] he said, [...] "almost entirely deficient. Red, poor in number, and irregular in outline. Plasma, thin. Nuclei, feeble.

60|$|Everybody {{knows the}} aphides well by sight, {{in one of}} their forms at least, the {{familiar}} rose aphis; but probably few people ever look at them closely and critically enough to observe how very beautiful and wonderful is the organisation of their tiny limbs in all its exquisite detail. If you pick off one good-sized wingless insect, however, from a blighted rose-leaf, and put him on a <b>glass</b> <b>slide</b> under a low power of the microscope, you will most likely be quite surprised to find what a lovely little creature it is that you have been poisoning wholesale all your life long with diluted tobacco-juice. His body is so transparent that you can see through it by transmitted light: a dainty glass globe, you would say, of emerald green, set upon six tapering, jointed, hairy legs, and provided in front with two large black eyes of many facets, and a pair of long and very flexible antennæ, easily moved in any direction, but usually bent backward when the creature is at rest so as to reach nearly to his tail as he stands at ease upon his native rose-leaf. There are, however, two other features about him which specially attract attention, as being very characteristic of the aphides and their allies among all other insects. In the first place, his mouth is provided with a very long snout or proboscis, classically described as a rostrum, with which he pierces the outer skin of the rose-shoot where he lives, and sucks up incessantly its sweet juices. This organ is common to the aphis with all the other bugs and plant-lice. In the second place, he has half-way down his back (or a little more) a pair of very peculiar hollow organs, the honey tubes, from which exudes that singular secretion, the honey-dew. These tubes are not found in quite all species of aphides, but they are very common among the class, and they form by far the most conspicuous and interesting organs in all those aphides which do possess them.|$|E
