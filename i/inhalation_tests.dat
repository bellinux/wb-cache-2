An {{investigation}} of allergy in byssinosis: sensitization to cotton, hemp, flax, and jute antigens. The authors investigated allergy to cotton, hemp, flax, and jute in 41 subjects with byssinosis. In contrast with immediate skin reactions, which were seldom observed, delayed reactions were nearly always present. The incidence of positive skin tests in byssinosis {{was similar to}} that observed in all textile workers. <b>Inhalation</b> <b>tests</b> with textile allergens were negative in all but four subjects who also had a concomitant bronchial asthma. Fifteen out of 31 subjects with byssinosis had positive <b>inhalation</b> <b>tests</b> to acetylcholine but only one of the 13 tested had a positive response to the inhalation of textile macerate. Haemagglutinating antibodies to low titres could be observed in byssinosis as well as in chronic bronchitis, in bronchial asthma, and in the general population. The significance of various types of antibodies existing in byssinosis is further discussed. The authors stress the need to standardize textile allergens...|$|E
40|$|Beta {{adrenergic}} agents {{given by}} aerosol decrease the responsiveness of the airways to histamine and methacholine {{in subjects with}} asthma, causing a shift of the dose response curve to the right. To {{find out whether the}} shift is related to the dose of beta adrenergic agent given and to determine the duration of the reduced responsiveness, eight subjects with asthma were given histamine <b>inhalation</b> <b>tests</b> after inhaled saline and after increasing doses of inhaled fenoterol on different days. The histamine <b>inhalation</b> <b>tests</b> were repeated at hourly intervals for five hours after a selected dose of fenoterol. Fenoterol caused a dose related shift {{to the right of the}} histamine dose response curve in each subject and in some the dose response relationship reached the "non-symptomatic range. " The shift in the dose response curve was short lived and had returned towards the control position within three hours in all subjects. There was no change in shape of the curves at the time of maximal shift. The results show that inhaled fenoterol greatly reduces the airway responsiveness to histamine, but up to 400 micrograms of fenoterol every four to five hours may be needed to keep the responsiveness of the airways in the non-symptomatic range...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: Patients with {{upper and}} lower airway {{symptoms}} and with pronounced sensitivity to chemical odours, such as perfumes, flower scents and tobacco smoke, have been suggested to have sensory hyperreactivity (SHR). The symptoms {{have been difficult to}} identify with physiological measurements and the effects of various medications are doubtful. However, these patients {{have been found to be}} more sensitive to inhalation of capsaicin than healthy people. The aim of this study was to establish limit values with the capsaicin <b>inhalation</b> <b>test</b> in patients with SHR. Methods: Ninety-five consecutive patients with {{upper and lower}} airway problems, who were admitted for allergy testing, underwent a capsaicin <b>inhalation</b> <b>test</b> with three different concentrations. The number of coughs was registered during each challenge. Score systems were used for symptoms and influence on social life of sensitivity to odours. In relation to scored symptoms, the patients were grouped as SHR or not, and compared with 73 healthy controls. Results: All patients and controls coughed on capsaicin in a dose-dependent manner. Symptom score of odour sensitivity in patients was positively correlated to the response of the test. Out of 95 patients, 15 (16 %) were scored to SHR. Patients with SHR reacted more to the capsaicin <b>inhalation</b> <b>test</b> than the other patients and the healthy controls. The limit values for a positive capsaicin <b>inhalation</b> <b>test</b> for the SHR were determined to be 10, 35 and 55 coughs at 0. 4, 2. 0 and 10 μM capsaicin, respectively. Conclusion: The capsaicin <b>inhalation</b> <b>test</b> well reflects the degree of airway sensitivity to chemicals and to what extent the social life is influenced.

The unbuffered histamine solutions were prepared with 0. 9 % sterile saline and had a pH range from 4. 3 to 7. 3, while the buffered histamine solutions were prepared with a phosphate buffer and had a pH range of 6. 5 to 7. 4. The two histamine <b>inhalation</b> <b>tests</b> were similar in all other regards. The geometric mean histamine provocation concentration required to produce a 20 % reduction in FEV 1 (PC 20) was significantly lower for the unbuffered histamine (1. 33 mg/ml) than for the buffered histamine (1. 67 mg/ml), p less than 0. 05. The two PC 20 s differed by less than one doubling dilution, the range of reproducibility of the test, in 12 of the 15 subjects. The pH effect was only noted when the pH of the histamine solutions was below five (histamine concentrations from one to eight mg/ml). We conclude that the acid pH of higher concentrations of histamine acid phosphate solutions has a slight but significant enhancing effect on the bronchial responsiveness to inhaled histamine...|$|E

40|$|New {{surface-active}} {{agents in}} waterproofing sprays are often tested for {{acute inhalation toxicity}} in vivo {{on the basis of}} OECD Test Guideline 403. A screening test using the isolated perfused rat lung (IPRL) is proposed {{in order to reduce the}} number of acute <b>inhalation</b> <b>tests</b> and to refine these. The test comprises exposure of IPRLs to aerosolised formulations of the water proofing agents and on-line monitoring of respiratory parameters. Substances revealing harmful effects on the IPRL, such as impaired lung compliance and atelectasis formation, did also show changes in respiratory parameters up to mortality in in vivo tests with rats. Thus, pre-testing in the IPRL allows the identification of surface-active substances causing acute inhalation toxicity. To assess the potential lung toxicity of seven formulations, each tested in two male and two female IPRLs, we evaluated changes in the respiratory parameters tidal volume, compliance, and resistance, edema and atelectasis formation, taking into account the inhaled doses. These IPRL results were compared with available in vivo results and a good or excellent correlation in six out of seven cases was revealed. In conclusion, the use of the IPRL is well suited for screening substances showing acute "physical" inhalation toxicity. Therefore, for future assessment of surface active substances, it is suggested to use this test prior to in vivo <b>inhalation</b> <b>tests.</b> Formulations with no acute harmful effects on the IPRL need to be further investigated in vivo for complete risk assessment. However, substances showing strong reactions in the IPRL will most likely cause lung damage in vivo. This is why testing in live animals is not recommended in order to avoid possible pain, suffering or distress...|$|E

40|$|Background: The Chloramine T {{is used in}} {{hospital}} as a disinfectant and in sterilizing of endoscopic instruments. Objectives: A case of a nurse suffering from asthma due to Chloramine T is presented in order {{to focus attention on}} this occupational disease. Methods and results: The patient (male, 43 years) was nurse since 1993 carrying out activities in various departments and operating rooms where he was exposed to glutaraldehyde and chloramine T in disinfecting surgical and endoscopic instruments. In 2007 he noticed the beginning of asthmatic reactions after the exposure to disinfectant. Skin tests with common allergens gave positive reactions and the skin test with Chloramine T showed a positive result. The <b>inhalation</b> <b>test</b> with Glutaraldehyde gave negative results for both asthma and rhinitis. During the <b>inhalation</b> <b>test</b> with Chloramine T 0, 5 % a significant biphasic decrease of FEV 1 was observed. The score of subjective symptoms for rhinitis was negative. Conclusions: The case confirms the existent difficulty in diagnosing occupational asthma due to Chloramine T in professional health workers, which results from the frequent presence of late reactions and from the exposure to many respiratory allergens and irritants in the workplace. The specific inhalation challenge represents the golden standard in the diagnosis of asthma induced by Chloramine T and in occupational asthma in general.

METHODS [...] Twenty lifelong non-smoking RA patients (mean age 59 years (range 44 - 72; 18 females) were studied. Detailed medical and drug histories were taken. Protease inhibitor phenotype (Pi) and HLA-DR 4 status were assessed. Schirmer's tear tests were performed to detect keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). Spirometry, flow volume loops, and gas transfer factor measurement were recorded. The degree of bronchial reactivity (PC 20 FEV 1) was measured by a methacholine <b>inhalation</b> <b>test.</b> Chest and hand radiographs and HRCT of the lung were performed in all patients. RESULTS [...] Thirteen patients were HLA-DR 4 positive. Eighteen had the Pi MM and two the Pi MS phenotype. Eight patients had evidence of KCS on Schirmer's tear testing. Ten patients achieved PC 20 FEV 1 in the methacholine <b>inhalation</b> <b>test.</b> All the patients had normal chest radiographs and all showed evidence of erosive arthropathy on hand radiographs.

40|$|Background/Aims: Many {{patients}} with aspirin-induced asthma have severe methacholine airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), suggesting {{a relationship between}} aspirin and methacholine in airway response. This study was performed to determine whether methacholine AHR affects the response of asthmatics to inhaled aspirin. Methods: The clinical records of 207 asthmatic patients who underwent inhalation challenges with both aspirin and methacholine were reviewed retrospectively. An oral aspirin challenge was performed in {{patients with}} a negative inhalation response. The bronchial reactivity index (BRindex) was calculated from the percent decrease in lung function divided by the last dose of the stimulus. Results: Forty-one (20. 9 %) and 14 (7. 1 %) patients showed a positive response to aspirin following an inhalation and oral challenge, respectively. Only 24. 3 and 14. 3 % of the responders {{had a history of}} aspirin intolerance, respectively. The methacholine BRindex was significantly higher in the inhalation responders (1. 46 ± 0. 02) than in the oral responders (1. 36 ± 0. 03, p < 0. 01) and in non-responders (n = 141, 1. 37 ± 0. 01, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Extrinsic {{allergic}} alveolitis {{is caused by}} the inhalation of small organic allergen particles by non-atopic subjects which provoke an allergic reaction, thought to be chiefly due to a type III mechanism, in the peripheral respiratory tissues.

When the exposure is intermittent and intensive, febrile episodes with respiratory symptoms beginning after four to six hours are prominent, but when it is more continuous and less intensive they are not and the features are those of a chronic fibrosing lung disease. The diagnosis is important to make because management by the avoidance of exposure is followed by improvement.

40|$|Seven {{patients}} with occupational asthma {{caused by a}} chemical, tetrachlorophthalic anhydride (TCPA), left their work in 1980. They have subsequently avoided TCPA exposure and have been followed until 1985. One patient died in 1981. The six living patients reported continuing symptoms suggestive of asthma, and five who were studied in 1985 demonstrated mild bronchial hyperresponsiveness (histamine concentration provoking a 20 % fall in FEV 1 range 2. 7 to 12. 5 mg/ml). Specific IgE antibody to TCPA conjugated with human serum albumin was measured by a radioallergosorbent test and detected in all patients. After avoidance of exposure, specific IgE fell exponentially with a half-life of 1 year. Specific IgE was still detectable in 1985, and throughout the follow-up period, prick tests with the conjugate elicited immediate skin responses. In 1981 four patients had <b>inhalation</b> <b>tests</b> with TCPA, and specific IgE rose afterward and then fell again...|$|E
40|$|Six {{workers with}} {{occupational}} asthma due to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) were studied. For each worker a detailed clinical and occupational history was taken, and lung function measurement and skin intradermal tests for common allergens were carried out. Methacholine inhalation challenge was performed before TDI inhalation, and 8 h after TDI inhalation. Methacholine challenge was within normal limits when performed before TDI inhalation, but {{went into the}} asthmatic range after TDI inhalation. These cases provide evidence that asthma can be induced by toluene diisocyanate {{in the absence of}} airway hyperresponsiveness. They further demonstrate that an isolated negative methacholine <b>inhalation</b> <b>test</b> cannot be used to exclude sensitization to TDI. Screening and follow-up studies on workers exposed on TDI require serial measurements of airway responsiveness and of variable air-flow obstruction...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Hypersensitivity to {{formalin}} used to sterilise {{artificial kidney}} machines was shown by <b>inhalation</b> provocation <b>tests</b> {{to be responsible}} for attacks of wheezing accompanied by productive cough in two members of the nursing staff of a haemodialysis unit. Three further members of the staff of 28 who were continually exposed to this substance occupationally had developed similar recurrent but less frequent episodes since joining the unit. Two underwent <b>inhalation</b> provocation <b>tests</b> with formalin which did not reproduce these symptoms. Single episodes of these symptoms had been noted by three additional staff members so that altogether eight (29 %) had experienced attacks described as bronchitic since becoming exposed to formalin. We suggest that, while exposure to formalin {{did not seem to be}} directly responsible in all cases, it might have increased susceptibility to other provoking agents or induced a hyper-reactive responsiveness of the airways. The responses observed in the two nurses after <b>inhalation</b> provocation <b>tests</b> with formalin were predominantly of airways obstruction. Wheezing began between two and three hours after exposure, and peakex-piratory flow rates fell maximally by approximately 50 o%. Reactions persisted for 10 hours to 10 days depending on the exposure dose. A productive cough was a prominent feature. The sputum appeared to be mucopurulent, but culture produced a scanty growth of Haemophilus influenza...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hepatopulmonary {{syndrome}} (HPS) is a pulmonary vascular disorder, complicating hepatic disease, and {{is responsible}} for an increased morbidity and mortality among patients awaiting liver transplantation. Nowadays, it is recognized as an independent risk factor for death in this patient population. The severity of hypoxemia and the advanced stage of the liver dysfunction are determinants for the prognosis. Therefore, the possibility to be successful, thus improving survival, consists of addressing HPS at an earlier stage, giving more attention to moderate evidences of this pathology instead of the severe ones. Patients and methods: Between the year 2000 and {{first half of the}} year 2005 we observed 115 patients with liver cirrhosis B and C expressed as class of Child-Pough classification of different etiology and portal hypertension (63 men and 52 women). All patients were included on the basis of inclusion and eyclusion criterion. Results: Clinically we suspected on hepatopulmonary syndrome in 18 patients. With 100 % oxygen <b>inhalation</b> <b>test</b> we confirmed the hepatopulmonary syndrome in 9 patients (57. 7 %), 6 men and 3 women, on the other hand contrast echosonography was positive in 8 patients (51. 3 %), 5 men and 3 women. All these patients had liver cirrhosis grade C, expressed as class of Child-Pough. Conclusions: On the basis of scientific evidence, we suggest a sample for detecting HPS among patients with liver cirrhosis, founded on the integration of two main factors: the severity of hepatic disease, expressed as class of Child-Pough, and the severity of the hypoxemia. The key role in diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome are anamnesis of platipnea and arterial blood oxygen analysis as a less invasive diagnostic methods. However final diagnosis is achieved with 100 % oxygen <b>inhalation</b> <b>test</b> and contrast echosonography. </p...|$|R
