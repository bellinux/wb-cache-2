They might be improvised (4, 8) or highly choreographed (1, 2, 5, 10); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, (4); a paying audience (2); a world audience (10); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre (3, 5). They might {{be a part of}} a celebration, such as a wedding or New Year (6, 8); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by warriors like a haka (7). Some dances, such as traditional dance in 1 and ballet in 2, need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the can-can, require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces <b>joy</b> <b>for</b> the dancers themselves (9).|$|E

25|$|For 1991 Perkins {{entered a}} deal that saw Peter Brock close his Mobil 1 Racing team and bring {{sponsorship}} to Perkins Engineering to race two VN Commodores. Early results were slim, and despite some mechanical issues, Perkins and Brock generally became the fastest of the Holden's on track during the 1991 Australian Touring Car Championship and into the late season endurance races. While Brock would finish the championship in 6th place, Perkins could only manage 11th, the team's biggest problem {{was the lack of}} quality Bridgestone rubber early in the season. The 1991 Bathurst 1000 saw little <b>joy</b> <b>for</b> the team, though both cars easily qualified in the top 10. After a race plagued by electrical issues, the Brock/Andrew Miedecke car finished 7th while the Perkins/Mezera car retired after 65 laps with no oil pressure. Perkins would later attribute his personal lack of success in 1991 to the contract with Brock's team and sponsor Mobil, claiming that the contract actually prevented him from finishing in front of Brock on the race track.|$|E

Narada serviced [...] "They Are the Roses" [...] to Adult Contemporary and country stations, and [...] "I'm Alright" [...] to Adult album alternative and Americana music formats. Maria Konicki Dinoia wrote in Allmusic that [...] "she pushes the envelope, bringing to the forefront the blending of the Scottish/Irish music found in small doses on her last few albums." [...] One year later, she released her second Christmas disc, <b>Joy</b> <b>for</b> Christmas Day, which continued in her Celtic music influences. This album was inspired by her annual Christmas tours that she had done ever since the release of Good News.|$|E

500|$|The tour {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Jason Stratley from The Philadelphia Inquirer said that [...] "On stage, wiggling and writhing, a rock-video vision of messy, bleached- blond hair, bare skin, sequined paisley and dime store diamonds was the flash-and-trash rock queen Madonna. Behold the Madonna clones—she {{is turning into}} one fine legend." [...] Jeff Sewald from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] "the modus operandi [...] was clear. Madonna was not only selling her music to throngs of teen-agers and adults alike, but she was selling herself and the entire package {{proved to be a}} <b>joy</b> <b>for</b> the 14,500 screaming fans. [...] Madonna's 'Virgin Tour' had torn the cover off Pittsburgh's sexuality." [...] Rachel Lee from The Sacramento Bee felt that [...] "more than any pop star in recent memory, even Boy George and Prince, Madonna is an image. Her hour-long concert here Tuesday night, as professionally performed and well-choreographed as it was, did nothing to give her more dimension than the two already bestowed on her." [...] Arthur Daniels from Lexington Herald-Leader felt that [...] "Madonna looked grim, but the fans were delighted when the blond rock star made her first major concert appearance to kick off her 'Virgin Tour'. [...] She looked blank and did not look up as she passed fans who gathered by the stage door before the show." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ironic" [...] {{was covered}} in 2007 by Mexican duet Jesse & <b>Joy</b> <b>for</b> their album Esta Es Mi Vida Sesiones, and the pop punk band Four Year Strong for their 90's cover album Explains It All (2009). In the 1996 novel Naïve. Super by Norwegian author Erlend Loe, the protagonist watches the video for the song on {{television}} and dreams about [...] "meeting an Alanis-girl {{and living in a}} house together with her". In the Jay and Silent Bob comic Chasing Dogma (1998), the character Tricia Jones is singing [...] "Ironic" [...] before Jay steps into the shower. In 2003, Ji-In Cho covered the song for the German version of the Fame Academy talent show, which became a success in the German charts. In September 2001, [...] "Ironic" [...] was listed as [...] "one of the songs deemed inappropriate due to its lyrics" [...] by American mass media company Clear Channel Communications, after the September 11 attacks occurred. The music of the song was featured in the romantic comedy film I Could Never Be Your Woman (2007), where Saoirse Ronan, as Izzie Mensforth, sings an altered version of the lyrics in a talent show. It also made a predominant appearance as the opener to 2013 comedy film The Internship, starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, as they sing along to it. [...] More recently, the song was briefly on an episode of Castle when the titular character laments about the song's title being subjected to misuse since it was first released. In 2015, Morissette appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden and sang a version of the song with new lyrics [...] "updated" [...] for the technology era, and an homage to the linguistics of the original mentioned above.|$|E
