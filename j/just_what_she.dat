500|$|Regarding the feud between Mercedes and Mitzeee, All About Soap {{columnist}} Laura Morgan {{commented that}} it was shocking that she felt sorry for Mercedes. She explained that even though Mercedes was [...] "a nasty cow" [...] because of the feud she was a [...] "woman teetering {{on the verge of}} a massive meltdown". Upon Mercedes telling Riley she has no need to be angry with Silas not sitting trial Morgan said she could tell Mercedes had been [...] "knocked her for six", adding that Mercedes could not [...] "hide anything from us". The journalist added that [...] "Mercedes did what Mercedes does best and decided a randy hook-up [...] was <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> needed to get her mind off Silas. After slapping on the war paint and selecting her sluttiest outfit, minxy Merc headed to a grotty hotel". She went on to explain that [...] "Mercedes knows she’s sinking. She pretty much admitted it when the doc asked her if she hated him and she replied, “I guess I hate myself a little more...” So why doesn’t she get some help before she totally and utterly loses the plot? [...] we’re missing our tart-with-a-heart Mercedes. We want to see her flirting her way around the village again, but without her finger firmly on the self-destruct button..." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{the film}} Mughal-e-Azam that marked what many {{consider}} to be Madhubala's greatest and definitive characterization, as the doomed courtesan Anarkali. Although the film took nine years to complete, {{it was not until}} 1953 that Madhubala was finally chosen for the role. Bunny Reuben in his book Dilip Kumar: Star Legend of Indian Cinema claimed that Dilip Kumar's role was instrumental behind this selection. Mughal-e-Azam gave Madhubala the opportunity of fulfilling herself totally as an actress, for it was a role that all actresses dreamt of playing, as Nimmi acknowledges that [...] "as an actress, one gets a lot of roles, {{there is no shortage of}} them, but there isn’t always good scope for acting. With Mughal-e-Azam, Madhubala showed the world <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> could do." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{movement}} itself, apparently, {{made him}} once more stand off. He had felt on his nearer approach the high {{temperature of the}} question. [...] "Perhaps that's <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> doing: showing him how much she's letting him alone--pointing it out to him from day to day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't her fault, and it isn't yours--it isn't mine, as {{a matter}} of justice. Rose is <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> always been, a good, sweet girl--I wouldn't have her see {{anything}} but friendly interest in my eyes for half my heart--I'm afraid she will, so--I guess----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I feel {{exactly in}} the same way about her. I am not in the least afraid that she'll bite me; and as for caressing the animal,--that kind of caressing which you mean,--it {{seems to me to be}} <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> made for. But, I do feel sometimes, that she is like a cat." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{character}} {{has been described}} by Hilary Kingsley, author the EastEnders Handbook, as a [...] "tease [...] a pretty girl who thinks she can get anything she wants, thanks to her own brand of sexy wheedling." [...] She adds that Sam is [...] "a lot sharper than her brothers [...] and contrives to do <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants in the face of their attempts to stand in for their dead father [...] Sam loves excitement and doesn't frighten easily. She's a user, able to get almost anyone to do what she wants." [...] Kate Lock, author of EastEnders Who's Who, has described Sam as [...] "Headstrong, streetwise and pretty [...] a chip off the old Mitchell block, though her methods of manipulation are marginally more subtle than [...] One bat of a sooty eyelash is enough to charm most men into submission and she can wind doting mum Peggy round her little finger [...] she returned to the Square , Sam had lost her kittenish cuteness and hardened up, becoming more EastEnd moll than Barbie doll." ...|$|E

60|$|Her words rang true; {{there was}} no flattery or {{artifice}} in them. Geoffrey felt that the girl was saying <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thought.|$|E
50|$|Eddie and Gwen's {{friendship}} grows closer. Afraid {{to share}} what she'd done as a practicing alcoholic for fear of looking bad to Eddie, they share a moment when Eddie tells her that's <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> done. She is just fine as she is. They are come upon by Jasper, who showed up unannounced. Jasper then proceeds to insult and pick a fight with Eddie, shoving him. Eddie punches him before Gwen stops any further violence. Eddie walks off, and Gwen and Eddie's friendship becomes estranged.|$|R
6000|$|That was all {{he could}} say till he had digested a pair of thoughts: <b>Just</b> <b>what</b> did <b>she</b> mean by [...] "types"? Had it {{something}} to do with printing stories? And what could he say about the people, anyway? He observed: ...|$|R
6000|$|TANNER. Ann will do <b>just</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> likes. And <b>what's</b> more, she'll {{force us}} to advise her to do it; and she'll put the blame on us {{if it turns out}} badly. So, as Tavy is longing to see her-- ...|$|R

5000|$|Under {{the advice}} of the 8-by-10 Man, Becka {{eventually}} decides to kill her worthless husband, and in a bit of [...] "damaged savantry", rigs the television (using instructions from the 8-by-10 Man) to deliver a fatal electrical pulse to whoever touches the knob. Becka, in the end, tricks her husband into touching it, but as he begins to be fatally electrocuted, <b>she</b> finally realizes <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> done and tries to save him. All she does is alter the circuit by touching him, and the two fall dead, the victims of a tragic quirk of fate.|$|R
50|$|In Niger, {{the oral}} {{tradition}} and its moral lessons are passed on through tales and stories. Agaïssa {{is the story of}} a young princess who does not listen to her parents, neither to the wisemen, and who <b>just</b> does <b>what</b> <b>she</b> fancies to do.|$|R
60|$|Both {{would come}} presently, {{and with them}} the memory of this last irretrievable hour and a <b>just</b> {{estimate}} of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had done.|$|R
60|$|And this note, {{which was}} <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{would have sent}} to a lover, took that form, perhaps unconsciously, because she {{had never had a}} lover thus to write to.|$|E

6000|$|... "Who's there, I say?" [...] But {{without waiting}} for an answer, he stalked into the front room. [...] "It's no use in life your coming here," [...] he said, {{addressing}} himself at once to Ontario; [...] "not the least. She ain't for you. She's for somebody else. Why can't one word be as good as a thousand?" [...] Moggs stood silent, looking sheepish and confounded. It was not that he was afraid of the father; but that he feared to offend the daughter should he address the father roughly. [...] "If she goes against me she'll have to walk out of the house with <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> got on her back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, father, she don't need no {{paint and}} flour {{to make a}} fairy on her just now. <b>She's</b> <b>just</b> like <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{was the last time}} I seed her go up in a gauze cloud to heaven, with red and blue fire blazin' all round her." ...|$|R
5000|$|Pappenheim's {{work with}} Simon Fisher-Turner has {{included}} {{contributions to the}} soundtracks of two Derek Jarman films.

60|$|His {{greeting}} to Annette {{was warm}} and cordial, he complimented her on her sister's recovered looks, and tried to extort a declaration that <b>she</b> looked <b>just</b> like <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had been when he took her from Wrangerton.

5000|$|Another {{reviewer}} {{wrote about}} the camera work in that film in this way: (In) Patrick Stettner’s The Business of Strangers, you {{learn a lot about}} Julie. She’s on the move, traveling first class, but everywhere she goes looks the same; all the restaurants, boardrooms, and hotel suites feature the same bland décor. As Julie click-clicks through a starkly white airport, Teodoro Maniaci’s camera tracks behind her, then moves around to reveal her game face: prepared and in control. The problem is, she can never be sure <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>she’s</b> prepared for and in control of, but that is the precise nature of her business, which is characterized by treachery and tension. Indeed, minutes after Julie’s in-charge intro, things start to go wrong.... Cynthia Fuchs, editor, review at ...|$|R
50|$|On May 29, 2007, Justin.tv {{introduced}} a second 24/7 feed, hosted by designer iJustine in Pittsburgh.
