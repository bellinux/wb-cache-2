Among the most lauded and most notable players the school has produced are Calvin Johnson, Demaryius Thomas, Keith Brooking, Joe Hamilton, Joe Guyon, and Billy Shaw. In addition to its players, Tech's football program has been noted for its coaches and <b>its,</b> <b>in</b> many cases bizarre traditions and game finishes. Among the team's former coaches are John Heisman, for whom the Heisman Trophy is named, and Bobby Dodd, for whom the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award and the school's stadium are named. Heisman led the team to the highest-scoring game in American football history, and both Heisman and Dodd led Tech's football team to national championships. Dodd also led the Jackets on their longest winning streak (8 games) against the University of Georgia, Tech's most time-endured rival.|$|E

25|$|As the {{complaints}} from the BMX upper crust-the Pros and BMX Press-increased, the more Mennenga resented {{and took a}} defensive position. This defensiveness that perhaps slowly calcified to an unwillingness to listen help to create an unorganized Pro rider boycott in 1983 and into part of 1984. It was led unofficially by Greg Hill, {{one of the most}} respected and winningest professionals at the time, and included legendary racers like Stu Thomsen over the alleged unfairness of its pro points system that was in place during that time. It was a long-standing complaint going back to Mr. Hill's 1980 objections to the 1979 season points scoring. An editorial boycott by Robert Osborn, the Managing Editor, Publisher and owner of BMX Action, a major BMX magazine, was over long simmering slights perceived by Mr. Osborn at ABA events but the direct cause of his boycott was his being denied a photographer's pass at an ABA national in 1980. Mr. Osborn had printed unfavorable editorials in his magazine about the ABA. As a result, ABA racing events abruptly disappeared from the pages of BMX Action after the June 1983 issue when it covered the Elsinore National. Conversely NBL Nationals and Renny Roker's NBL sanctioned ESPN Pro Spectacular races received lavish coverage, particularly the 1983 NBL Grand Nationals. It had a full 19 pages dedicated to it in the January 1984 issue. BMXA didn't even cover the ABA Grand National for 1983. In contrast in its February 1985 issue it reported with photos of the United States Bicycle Association (USBA) race at the USBMX track in Azusa, California. The USBA was as time would show not merely an archrival of the ABA but an arch enemy. The ABA was mentioned only obliquely and incidentally, which had been the case for the previous year and a half. It was not until the March 1985 issue did it cover an ABA event, the 1984 Grand National. It was 20 months since the last ABA national BMX Action had reported on. Reportedly, BMX Action ended its editorial boycott in part due to an agreement with the ABA to cease publishing <b>its</b> <b>in</b> house magazine Bicycles and Dirt.|$|E
25|$|Studies in {{controlled}} environments on {{the giant}} trevally's feeding strategies have found hunting in schools increases their capture efficiency, {{but is not}} necessary for an individual's survival. When a school is formed during feeding, one individual will take a leading position, with others trailing behind it. Several individuals will attack the prey school, striking and stunning the prey, with the leading individual generally being more successful. Some individuals act individually and opportunistically within the school {{if one of the}} prey fish becomes isolated, with the main advantage of schooling appearing to be the ability to further break up and isolate prey schools. The only time hunting in schools is a disadvantage is when only isolated prey are present, such as close to a reef; here, an individual hunter has a greater probability of capturing it than if a group is present. Another hunting strategy of the giant trevally is to 'escort' monk seals, a behavior which has been observed near the Hawaiian Islands. The trevally swim close by the seal, and when the seal stops to forage, the trevally positions its mouth inches away from the seal. If a prey item is disturbed, the trevally will attempt to steal the prey from the seal, which routinely does occur. The seal does not appear to gain any benefit from this relationship, and it is thought juvenile seals being followed in this way may be outcompeted by the larger fish. A similar strategy has been employed by fish in the presence of large reef sharks, as they use the larger animal as a tool to ambush prey. The opportunistic nature of giant trevally has also been made evident by studies on the mortality rate of undersized or egg-bearing lobsters released from traps at the water's surface of the Hawaiian Islands. The fish are efficient predators of these crustaceans, with individuals often seizing a lobster before it could sink to the seafloor after being released, or attacking before the lobster moves into a defensive position. Some bolder, large individuals are even known to eat the lobster head first when <b>its</b> <b>in</b> a defensive stance.|$|E
