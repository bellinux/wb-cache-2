40|$|Long run {{success in}} {{watershed}} management requires {{understanding of how}} <b>economic</b> <b>stratification</b> and social values affect water quality protection. Feedback effects on water quality are produced by three aspects of economic well-being: income levels, {{quality of life and}} inequality, including the effects of gender based inequality. In the US emphasis on individualistic values leads to reliance on local and private policy solutions to social problems. Analysis of the context of New York City's internationally famous watershed agreement with communities 120 miles distant provides a case study of these relationships. The nature of <b>economic</b> <b>stratification</b> in these upstate communities and the insufficient response of social policies were an impediment to achieving New York City's water quality goals. As a consequence the City's watershed agreement contains direct economic aid to Watershed communities. The Agreement does not address all stratification issues. Some call for solutions beyond the local level and an approach that benefits from the European emphasis on community. It {{is in the interest of}} watershed managers to broaden the scope of their concerns to understand and support state and national programs which address problems created by <b>economic</b> <b>stratification.</b> The expansion of the European Union increases the relevance of these lessons for Europe.

25|$|Elman Service (1915-1996) {{proposed}} that, {{unlike in}} <b>economic</b> <b>stratification</b> theories, the state largely creates stratification in society {{rather than being}} created to defend that stratification. Bureaucracy evolves to support the leadership structure in tribes and uses religious hierarchy and <b>economic</b> <b>stratification</b> {{as a means to}} further increase its power. Warfare may {{play a key role in}} the situation, because it allows leaders to distribute benefits in ways that serve their interests, however it is a constant that feeds the system rather than an autonomous factor. Similarly, anthropologist Henry T. Wright argues (2006) that competitive and conflictual environments produce political experimentation leading to the development of the state. As opposed to theories that the state develops through chance or tinkering, experimentation involves a more directed process where tribal leaders learn from organization forms of the past and from the outcomes they produced.|$|R

40|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>Stratification</b> Differentiates Home Gardens in the Maya Village of Pomuch, Mexico. In this paper, we analyze if <b>economic</b> <b>stratification</b> {{of peasant}} {{families}} in a Maya {{village in the}} Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico influences species composition and structure of home gardens. Our general hypothesis was that composition and structure reflect a higher dependence on home garden produce of relatively poorer families as compared to more prosperous families. We registered the cultivated trees and herbs in samples of twelve home gardens of poorer and wealthier families that had similar assets in the 1980 s, and classified them by principal use and geographic origin. Total species richness of cultivated herbs was highest in home gardens of the more prosperous families, whereas total species richness of trees was highest in home gardens of the poorer families. Average species richness of trees and herbs and species composition was similar in both economic strata. Poorer families cultivated relatively more trees for uses other than fruit than richer families. The average and total number of native tree species and density of trees with diameter at breast height of less than 10 cmwas significantly higher in poorer families’ home gardens than in those of wealthier families. We conclude that <b>economic</b> <b>stratification</b> leads to different production strategies in home gardens. Richer families are comparatively more interested in obtaining fruit occasionally and emphasize diversity of herbaceous ornamentals. Poorer families emphasize different uses, favor the native flora, and increase tree density. Thereby they contribute more to biodiversity conservation than wealthier familie...|$|R

30|$|Centered on the size-earnings relationship, {{this study}} explores three questions. First, does {{organization}} size matter for <b>economic</b> <b>stratification</b> in urban China’s context? Although {{some studies have}} also {{examined the relationship between}} organization size and non-economic job rewards, such as fringe benefits, promotions, and autonomy, (e.g., Kalleberg and Van Buren 1996), this research mainly focuses on <b>economic</b> <b>stratification</b> indicated by earnings. Second, how can such a size effect be explained by individual as well as organizational characteristics? Due to data limitations in China, {{it is not possible to}} take into account as many organizational variables as various explanations suggest should be, 4 but at least the size effect can be examined by controlling three organizational characteristics that are routinely emphasized by the existing danwei literature, i.e., ownership, rank, and type. Third, is there any temporal change for the answers to the first two questions, during China’s dramatic change since the mid- 1990 s? Because of the rarity of highly comparable datasets, this research mainly compares two time points: 1996 and 2006, aiming to provide a preliminary depiction on ten years of change.|$|R

50|$|It is {{apparent}} that under these conditions, neither increasing the supply of M1 nor decreasing it (relative to M2) can effectively prevent an economic collapse. Therefore, it can be postulated that <b>economic</b> <b>stratification</b> itself ultimately results in economic collapse of one degree or another.
