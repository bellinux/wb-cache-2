5|$|About 40percent of the tributaries that {{originally}} flowed {{over the surface}} of the watershed were piped or relocated during urban development, especially {{on the north side of}} the main stem. Generally, the remaining free-flowing tributaries begin south of the main stem and run north; the major exception is Crystal Springs Creek, which begins as a groundwater discharge and flows south. The other major tributaries are Hogan, Kelley, Butler, Sunshine, and Badger creeks. Crystal Springs and Kelley creeks contribute more <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main stem than the other tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|The fjord ends by {{splitting}} {{into three}} branches: <b>the</b> Eidsfjorden <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, <b>the</b> Nordgulfjorden <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, and <b>the</b> Austgulfjorden <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. When you measure {{distance of the}} main fjord and the Austgulfjorden (the longest of its branches), it is 22 km long.|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} streams densely covering the commune. Those in <b>the</b> north <b>flow</b> north <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nielle river which eventually <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Orbieu which joins the Aude near Saint-Nazaire-d'Aude. Those in <b>the</b> south <b>flow</b> south <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Berre river which <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea.|$|R
50|$|The Kosmaj is {{source of}} several rivers. Turija river (and {{several of its}} tributraries, {{including}} Sibnička reka), which springs right below <b>the</b> mountain and <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west into the Kolubara River. Other originate below the Parcanski vis: Lug (or Veliki Lug) which <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east into the Kubršnica, Ralja also <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east into the Jezava, outflow of the Velika Morava, and Topčiderka which <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, into the urban center of Belgrade.|$|R
5|$|In 1948 Shive {{invented the}} {{phototransistor}} that used {{a beam of}} light, instead of a wire, as the emitter of a point contact transistor, generating holes that <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> collector. It was not announced until 1950. This invention embodies the modern day nationwide direct distance dialing system.|$|E
5|$|In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses {{light energy}} to remove {{electrons}} from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cytochrome b6f complex, which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast. These protons move {{back through the}} membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP+, {{for use in the}} Calvin cycle, which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, and carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk and severity of narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from {{increasing the amount of}} carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or because of poor gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E
50|$|The River Wissey {{rises in}} Bradenham and <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west whilst the River Yare rises <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of Bradenham and <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|R
50|$|The {{mountains}} around Blaenau Ffestiniog {{form the}} watershed between <b>the</b> River Lledr <b>flowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north (a {{tributary of the}} River Conwy) and <b>the</b> River Dwyryd <b>flowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west.|$|R
40|$|FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MENA {{region have}} been disappointing {{relative}} to other developing countries. Using fixed effects panel regressions, this paper investigates whether the determinants of FDI affect MENA countries differently. The results indicate {{that some of the}} variables that influence FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> developing countries are not important for <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> MENA countries. These include the rate of return on investment, infrastructures, economic growth, and inflation. While trade openness increases FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> MENA countries, corruption/bureaucratic red tape were found <b>to</b> reduce <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region. Thus, trade liberalization and privatization are important preconditions for FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region...|$|R
5|$|Older {{and more}} deeply eroded, the Western Cascades are {{a range of}} volcanoes lying west of and merging with the High Cascades. They consist of partly altered {{volcanic}} rock from vents in both volcanic provinces, including varied lavas and ash tuffs {{ranging in age from}} 0 to 40million years. As the Cascades rose, the Rogue maintained its <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ocean by down-cutting, which created steep narrow gorges and rapids in many places. Bear Creek, a Rogue tributary that flows south to north, marks the boundary between the Western Cascades to the east and the Klamath Mountains to the west.|$|E
5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver cirrhosis, biliary narrowing due to cancer, acute renal failure and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (inability of the respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|Several {{relatively}} young obvious lava flows {{exist in the}} area around Adams. Most of these flows are {{on the north side of}} the mountain and include the flow in the Mutton Creek area, Devils Garden, the Takh Takh Meadows Flow, and the much larger Muddy Fork Lava <b>Flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of Devils Garden. Only one obvious flow appears on the south slopes of Adams, the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Other smaller flows exist in various locations around the mountain as well.|$|E
50|$|The Ruisseau de Fayau {{runs through}} the village and the commune from north-west and is joined by the Ru du Moulin river before <b>flowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Miette river {{south-east}} of the commune which in turn <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Aisne river <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south.|$|R
60|$|These rivers are the Forth and the Clyde. <b>The</b> Forth <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, {{and has a}} {{very wide}} estuary,[B] {{as you will see}} by the map. The Clyde, on <b>the</b> other hand, <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. Its estuary is long and crooked.|$|R

5|$|The Continental Divide of North America runs diagonally {{through the}} southwestern {{part of the}} park. The divide is a {{topographic}} feature that separates Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About {{one third of the}} park lies {{on the west side of}} the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Marcellus {{natural gas}} trend, which {{encompasses}} 104,000 square miles and stretches across Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and into southeast Ohio and upstate New York, {{is the largest}} source of natural gas in the United States, and production was still growing rapidly in 2013. The Marcellus {{is an example of}} shale gas, natural gas trapped in low-permeability shale, and requires the well completion method of hydraulic fracturing to allow the gas to <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> well bore. The surge in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale since 2008 has generated both economic benefits and environmental concerns—and thus, considerable controversy.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of Nemausus (Nîmes) was somewhat inconvenient {{when it came}} to providing a water supply. Plains lie to the city's south and east, where any sources of water would be at too low an altitude to be able to <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city, while the hills to the west made a water supply route too difficult from an engineering point of view. The only real alternative was to look to the north and in particular to the area around Ucetia (Uzès), where there are natural springs.|$|E
50|$|The {{watershed}} (Daerah aliran sungai or DAS) Cikaengan {{together with}} Cilaki river form the Southern Watershed Area of Garut Regency, as it <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. The rivers {{in the area}} are generally short, narrow and with more valleys compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northern area (Cimanuk river <b>flowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Java <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north).|$|R
50|$|Vadakkekkad, {{where the}} temple is located, was {{supposed}} to be a thickly forested area with a river <b>flowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. The flora and fauna has disappeared since but there exists a canal which <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. It came under the kingdom of Malabar.|$|R

5|$|The outlet of {{the river}} onto the Humber {{is thought to have}} changed in the early medieval period. The {{original}} outlet has been identified at a place called Limekiln creek. A second channel Sayers Creek was cut or widened, with both outlets existing simultaneously at one point. Limekiln creek was subsequently reduced in <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level of a drain.|$|E
5|$|The second theory {{posits that}} either {{increased}} blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain or {{increase in the}} brain tissue itself may result in the raised pressure. Little evidence has accumulated to support the suggestion that increased blood flow plays a role, but recently Bateman et al. in phase contrast MRA studies have quantified cerebral blood flow (CBF) in vivo and suggests that CBF is abnormally elevated in many patients with IIH. Both biopsy samples and various types of brain scans have shown an increased water content of the brain tissue. It remains unclear why {{this might be the}} case.|$|E
5|$|When {{stars are}} moving at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades {{it was assumed}} that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interstellar medium. A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).|$|E
50|$|The Kunturillu River (Condorillo) {{originates}} at <b>the</b> mountain. It <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast {{as a right}} {{tributary of}} the Uqururu (Aymara and Quechua for Mimulus glabratus, hispanicized Ojoruro). This river {{is also known as}} Sumana or Cotahuasi. It <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cotahuasi Canyon in the southwest.|$|R
50|$|Helchteren {{is located}} near the {{watershed}} between the Meuse and the Scheldt. In the immediate vicinity <b>the</b> Dommel (which <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Meuse near Den Bosch), the Grote Nete (which <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Scheldt) and the Neer (that joins the Meuse just south of Roermond) all originate.|$|R
50|$|Koznik {{is a small}} {{mountain}} in Kosovo. It is in the Metohija valley and is 1005 m high, which is quite small compared to some of Kosovo's higher mountains. The White Drin river <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of Koznik while <b>the</b> Miruša <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of Koznik.|$|R
5|$|When submerged, a crocodilian's {{heart rate}} slows {{down to one}} or two beats a minute, and blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> muscles is reduced. When it rises and takes a breath, its heart rate speeds up in seconds, and the muscles receive newly oxygenated blood. Unlike many marine mammals, {{crocodilians}} have little myoglobin to store oxygen in their muscles. During diving, muscles are supplied with oxygen when an increasing concentration of bicarbonate ions causes haemoglobin in the blood to release oxygen.|$|E
5|$|When the {{atrioventricular}} valves (tricuspid and mitral) are open, during blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ventricles, the aortic and pulmonary valves {{are closed}} to prevent backflow into the ventricles. When the ventricular pressure {{is greater than}} the atrial pressure the tricuspid and mitral valves will shut. When the ventricles contract the pressure forces the aortic and pulmonary valves open. As the ventricles relax, the aortic and pulmonary valves will close in response to decreased pressure.|$|E
5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Admiralty.|$|E
50|$|The WAIS Divide is the ice flow divide on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) {{which is}} a linear {{boundary}} that separates the region where <b>the</b> ice <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ross sea, from the region where <b>the</b> ice <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Weddell sea. It {{is similar to a}} continental hydrographic divide.|$|R
50|$|Mt. Kurai (Kurai-yama) {{is located}} on the border of the cities of Takayama and Gero in Gifu Prefecture, Japan. The {{mountain}} also separates the watersheds of the northern and southern portions of the Hida region. <b>The</b> Jinzū River <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and <b>the</b> Hida River <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south.|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{border of}} the commune is formed by the Orne river. A stream, flows through the village and down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Orne and another stream <b>flowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Orne forms the {{southern}} boundary of the commune. The Guigne stream forms the northern {{border of the}} commune and also <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Orne.|$|R
