500|$|Harding's {{success as}} an editor took a toll on his health. Five times between 1889 (when he was 23) and 1901, he spent time at the Battle Creek Sanitorium for reasons Sinclair {{described}} as [...] "fatigue, overstrain, and nervous illnesses". Dean ties these visits to early occurrences of the heart ailment that would kill Harding in 1923. During one such absence from Marion, in 1894, the Stars business manager quit. Florence Harding took his place. She became her husband's top assistant at the Star on the business side, maintaining her role until the Hardings moved to Washington in 1915. Her assistance and competence allowed Warren Harding to travel to make speeches (his use of the free railroad pass increased greatly after his marriage). Florence Harding made sure no cents escaped her—sometimes sending Warren to the bank with a gallon (...) bucket full in each hand—and wrote of her husband, [...] "he does well when <b>he</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> me and poorly when he does not." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout the journey, the duo {{encounter}} numerous mishaps: first, SpongeBob tries {{a pioneer}} trick {{he claims to}} have seen in a movie where <b>he</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> the ground and hears a truck coming. But when he tries to get the driver's attention by doing a bizarre dance {{in the middle of the}} road, the driver speeds up and nearly runs over SpongeBob. Then, the duo are caught up in a storm that eventually turns into a tornado, and Squidward tells SpongeBob to let the pizza go as it causes them to get sucked into the tornado. However, the pizza saves their lives after SpongeBob turns it into a parachute. Upon landing, Squidward panics when he realizes the road they were following is nowhere in sight. SpongeBob then notices some moss on a rock and claims that they should go in the direction the moss is pointing (another one of SpongeBob's [...] "pioneer tricks"), but Squidward refuses and goes in the other direction, despite there actually being civilization where the moss was pointing.|$|E
500|$|The game's soundtrack {{was entirely}} {{composed}} by Fox. A self-taught musician, he composed {{most of the}} tracks with little iteration; the game's main theme, [...] "Undertale", was the only song to undergo multiple iterations in development. The soundtrack was inspired by music from Super NES role-playing games, such as EarthBound, {{as well as the}} webcomic Homestuck, for which Fox provided some of the music. Fox also stated that he tries to be inspired by all music <b>he</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to,</b> particularly those in video games. According to Fox, over 90% of the songs were composed specifically for the game. [...] "Megalovania", the song used during the boss battle with Sans, had previously been used within Homestuck and in one of Fox's EarthBound ROM hacks. For each section of the game, Fox composed the music prior to programming, as it helped [...] "decide how the scene should go". He initially tried using a music tracker to compose the soundtrack, but found it difficult to use. He ultimately decided to play segments of the music separately, and connect them on a track. To celebrate the one year anniversary of the game, Fox released five unused musical works on his blog in 2016.|$|E

500|$|Evan {{decides to}} build the ark alone, gaining media {{attention}} and public ridicule as hundreds of animals assemble in pairs. Meanwhile, God appears to Joan as a waiter at a diner, where <b>he</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> her as she expresses concern that Evan is losing his sanity and allowing himself to become a laughing stock, though claiming that [...] "God told him to do it." [...] Sympathetic toward Evan, God tells Joan that perhaps it is only opportunity for them, and explains {{that he does not}} give things but only the opportunity by which to obtain things, citing togetherness of families as one of these things. Seeing God's meaning, Joan finally returns to Evan with new-found faith and continues helping him finish the ark together in order to prepare for the flood. On September 22, the day of the flood, Evan's staffers arrive in support as well and Eugene shows him research he performed on Long. It is revealed that, many years ago, Long conquered Prestige Crest and later commissioned a dam, then destroyed the remaining land to have many of the lots and houses built. Long cut corners in building the dam, and will most likely {{do the same thing with}} his Public Land Act bill.|$|E
500|$|Bates goes {{hunting with}} a native, who brings down a crested oropendola with a {{blowpipe}} {{at a range}} of 30 yards (27 metres); {{he notes that the}} usefully silent weapon can kill at twice that range, but that he and Wallace [...] "found it very difficult to hold steady the long tubes". Around a campfire, <b>he</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> tales; the Bouto or river dolphin used to take [...] "the shape of a beautiful woman, with hair hanging loose to her heels, and walking ashore at night in the streets of Ega, to entice the young men down to the water" [...] where the Bouto would grab them and [...] "plunge beneath the waves with a triumphant cry". They go turtle-hunting; and Bates kills an alligator with a heavy stick. He finds many footprints of the jaguar, and [...] "the great pleasure" [...] of seeing the [...] "rare and curious umbrella bird". Arrived in Catua, he admires a woman of 17: [...] "her figure was almost faultless", and her blue mouth [...] "gave quite a captivating finish to her appearance", but she was [...] "extremely bashful". He is amazed at how much alcohol the [...] "shy Indian and Mameluco maidens" [...] can drink, never giving way to their suitors without it.|$|E
500|$|Co-written by Raphael Saadiq, [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] is {{a tribute}} to one of D'Angelo's primary influences, Prince, and evokes his early [...] The {{similarity}} of D'Angelo's music on Voodoo to Prince was addressed in Saul Williams's liner notes, as he stated [...] "I'd pay to see Prince's face as <b>he</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> this album." [...] Questlove described the song as [...] "finding the line between parody and honesty [...] In an era of 'the cover song', redoing a Prince song was taboo. This is the second best thing". It follows a six eight signature and features electric guitar interplay throughout, which is reminiscent of the Jimi Hendrix guitar style and [...] "Maggot Brain" [...] sound. The song contains a drum pattern with a uniform dynamic. D'Angelo's vocals were overdubbed several times to produce the sound of a choir singing harmonies during choruses, all of which were sung by D'Angelo. The song's sexually explicit lyrics describe the narrator's plea to his lover for sex, as exemplified in the second verse: [...] "Love to make you wet/In between your thighs, cause/I love when it comes inside of you/I get so excited when I'm around you, baby" [...] It has been cited by critics as the album's best song.|$|E

500|$|In the Kurma Purana, Sita prays to Agni {{just when}} Ravana arrives to kidnap her. Agni creates Maya Sita – an exact double of Sita – {{who takes the}} place of Sita and is {{abducted}} by the demon. While Sita is taken by Agni to heaven, Maya Sita is confined in Lanka. After Ravana's death, when Maya Sita enters the fire at Agni Pariksha, Agni restores the real undefiled Sita to Rama; meanwhile Maya Sita is destroyed in the blaze. The Chaitanya Charitamrita, a biography of the Vaishnava saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1533), by Krishnadasa Kaviraja (b. 1496) alludes to the Kurma Purana tale. Chaitanya meets a brahmin Rama devotee in Madurai. The brahmin is devastated after learning that [...] "mother Sita, mother of the universe and the supreme goddess of fortune" [...] was stained by Ravana's touch and gives up food. The saint consoles the brahmin saying that Sita's spiritual form can not be touched by the demon; it was Maya Sita that was taken away by Ravana. The brahmin feels better and accepts food. Chaitanya then travels to Rameswaram, where <b>he</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> the Kurma Purana and obtains the authoritative proof to comfort the brahmin. He returns to Madurai with the Kurma Purana manuscript, leaving that brahmin overjoyed.|$|E
500|$|Mitsuda {{claims to}} compose by [...] "just fool around on my keyboard" [...] {{and letting the}} melodies come to him. He also {{sometimes}} comes up with songs while asleep, including the ending theme to Chrono Trigger and [...] "Bonds of Sea and Fire" [...] from Xenogears, though his main inspiration is visual items, [...] "paintings or other things". His music is frequently minimalistic, and he has cited Minimalism as an influence. His final battle themes for Chrono Trigger and Xenogears are based on only a few chords each, with the latter containing only two. Mitsuda has listened to {{a great number of}} musical genres throughout his life, which he learned from his father, and is especially inspired by jazz music. He is also inspired by Celtic music, and has created two albums of music in that style. His soundtrack for Chrono Trigger also shows the influence of Asian music, including the sounds of Japanese shakuhachi flutes, Indian tabla drums and the sitar. He has cited Maurice Ravel, J.S. Bach, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Claude Debussy, Robert Schumann, Antonín Dvořák, and Gustav Holst as his favorite Classical composers, claiming that his modern influences are too numerous to name as <b>he</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> so much music.|$|E
500|$|The episode name is {{a parody}} of One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish by Dr. Seuss. [...] The sushi bar that the Simpson family visits is located on a street called Elm Street, a {{reference}} to the A Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise. While waiting for Homer to finish his meal at the sushi bar, Bart and Lisa sneak into the bar's karaoke room and sing the theme song to the 1971 film Shaft, [...] "Theme from Shaft" [...] by Isaac Hayes. In the karaoke room, a gentleman introduces himself as Richie Sakai, a reference to a producer on The Simpsons with the same name. He proceeds to sing the 1971 song [...] "Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves" [...] by Cher. Homer sings his own version of the gospel hymn [...] "When the Saints Go Marching In" [...] while listening to Lisa playing her saxophone one last time. When Homer arrives at his home after leaving Moe's Tavern, he hammers on one of the windows of the house and shouts Marge's name. This is {{a reference to the}} 1967 film The Graduate, in which Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) does the same and runs to the church, pounds on the window, and yells [...] "Elaine! Elaine!"
