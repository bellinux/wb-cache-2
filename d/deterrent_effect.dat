25|$|The Attorney-General {{submitted}} {{that the}} 15-gram differentia was intelligible and bore a rational {{relation to the}} social purpose of the MDA: to have a <b>deterrent</b> <b>effect</b> on drug trafficking in or through Singapore by large-scale drug traffickers.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the court {{acknowledged}} that using a 15-gram differentia {{might not be}} the best method of furthering the social object of the MDA. However, the matter of what would constitute a better differentia was one which reasonable people may not necessarily agree on, and so this was a question of social policy best left to the legislature, not the judiciary. Addressing Yong's contention that in reality the mandatory death penalty only had a limited <b>deterrent</b> <b>effect</b> on drug traffickers, the Court said that it was not within the its purview to determine the mandatory death penalty's efficacy as a deterrent to drug trafficking. Such an issue was a question of policy and should be left to the legislature to decide. If any changes to the mandatory death penalty or the death penalty in general were to be effected, these had to be done by the legislature and not by the Judiciary under the pretence of constitutional interpretation. In addition, while the court acknowledged {{it could be argued that}} there was insufficient evidence of the mandatory death penalty's <b>deterrent</b> <b>effect</b> on serious offences like murder, it could also be said there was insufficient evidence that the mandatory death penalty did not have a <b>deterrent</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

25|$|After the massacre, {{the already}} evident disarray in the insurgents' ranks increased, and the rebel factions {{experienced}} acrimonious internal splits. Particularly damaging to their cause was the <b>deterrent</b> <b>effect</b> of the massacre, {{as well as}} the realization that no Sunni uprisings had occurred {{in the rest of the}} country in support of the Hama rebels. Most members of the rebel groups fled the country or remained in exile, mainly in Jordan and Iraq, while others would make their way to the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. The Muslim Brotherhood—the largest opposition group—split into two factions, after giving up on armed struggle. One, more moderate and recognized by the international Muslim Brotherhood, eventually headquartered itself in the UK where it remains, while another for several years retained a military structure in Iraq, with backing from the government, before rejoining the London-based mainstream.|$|E

40|$|Some {{judges and}} {{scholars}} {{have questioned the}} social value of the standard form in which the Securities and Exchange Commission settles its corporate enforcement actions, including the agency’s use of essentially unreviewed consent decrees that include no admission of liability or wrongdoing. This essay for a symposium on SEC enforcement provides {{an analysis of the}} <b>deterrent</b> <b>effects</b> of the three main components of settlements in public enforcement of law: liability, admission, and remedy. The conclusions are the following. All three components have beneficial <b>deterrent</b> <b>effects.</b> Cost considerations nonetheless justify some settlements that dispense with liability or admission, or even both. But a practice like the SEC’s of uniformly institutionalizing settlements without admissions, such that the <b>deterrent</b> <b>effects</b> of admissions are never realized, even for bargaining leverage, is not justified. Further, {{there is reason to believe}} that some form of judicial review of enforcement settlements would contribute to deterrence. To put the argument another way, the SEC and other agencies engaged in public civil enforcement could learn something from contemplating why the federal criminal justice system strongly disfavors nolo contendere pleas and why a plea bargaining system dominated by nolo pleas would be so undesirable as to be unthinkable...|$|R

Second, since the analysis shows LMC's inferences about deterrence to be based on a flawed methodology, we offer an alternative, theory-based sensitivity analysis of estimated <b>deterrent</b> <b>effects</b> using similar data. Our analysis supports the deterrence hypothesis. More generally, it emphasizes the indispensable role of theory in guiding sensitivity analyses of model specification. ...|$|R

Yiftah S.

He also noted that the earliest deliveries in 2016 would be past the date Iran is expected to have operational nuclear weapons, one of the prime reasons for having the F-35.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of shaming penalties. It establishes {{that there may be}} an inverse relation between the rate of shaming penalties and their <b>deterrent</b> <b>effects</b> - the more people are shamed the less deterring shaming penalties become. This conclusion is based on a search model in which the costs of searching for law-abiding partners increase with the rate of shaming, and may lead to lower expected sanction for offenders. The inverse relation between the rate of shaming penalties and their effectiveness is later used to show that increasing the probability of detection, increasing the magnitude of shaming penalties or reducing the number of wrongful acquittals does not necessarily increase the <b>deterrent</b> <b>effects</b> of shaming penalties (and may, in fact, decrease these effects). ...|$|R

500|$|These problems, {{together}} {{with a desire to}} enhance the <b>deterrent</b> <b>effect</b> of the death penalty, resulted in the passage of the Murder Act 1752. [...] It required that [...] "every murderer shall, after execution, either be dissected or hung in chains". [...] Dissection was generally viewed as [...] "a fate worse than death"; giving judges the ability to substitute gibbeting with dissection was an attempt to invoke that horror. [...] While the Act gave anatomists statutory access to many more cadavers than were previously available, it proved insufficient. [...] Attempting to bolster the supply, some surgeons offered money to pay the prison expenses and funeral clothing costs of condemned prisoners, while bribes were paid to officials present at the gallows, sometimes leading to an unfortunate situation in which corpses not legally given over for dissection were taken anyway.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of what deters crime is of both theoretical and practical interest. The present paper focuses on what factors deter minor, non-violent crimes, i. e. dishonest actions that violate the law. Much research {{has been devoted to}} testing the effectiveness of legal sanctions on crime, while newer models also include social sanctions (judgment of friends or family) and internal sanctions (feelings of guilt). Existing research suggests that both internal sanctions and, to a lesser extent, legal sanctions deter crime, but it is unclear whether this pattern is unique to Western countries or robust across cultures. We administered a survey study to participants in China, Colombia, Germany, Portugal, and USA, five countries from distinct cultural regions of the world. Participants were asked to report the likelihood of engaging in seven dishonest and illegal actions, and were asked to indicate the probability and severity of consequences for legal, friend, family, and internal sanctions. Results indicated that across countries, internal sanctions had the strongest <b>deterrent</b> <b>effects</b> on crime. The <b>deterrent</b> <b>effects</b> of legal sanctions were weaker and varied across countries. Furthermore, the <b>deterrent</b> <b>effects</b> of legal sanctions were strongest when internal sanctions were lax. Unexpectedly, social sanctions were positively related to likelihood of engaging in crime. Taken together, these results suggest that the relative strengths of legal and internal sanctions are robust across cultures and dishonest actions...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} is a replication of the Saltzman et al. study concerning <b>deterrent</b> and experiential <b>effects</b> in perceptual deterrence research. Despite certain design {{differences in the}} two studies (e. g., we used a shorter lag between Time One and Time Two), our findings replicate theirs in that (1) perceptions of risk are not particularly stable, even over a period as short as three months, and (2) experiential effects are consistently larger and more often significant than <b>deterrent</b> <b>effects.</b> Both in our data and in the Saltzman et al. data, we find interactions which specify the experiential effect as most likely to occur among those with initially high perceptions of risk (a naivet&eacute; effect) rather than among those for whom a given form of behavior is new (a novelty effect), as Saltzman et al. had contended.
