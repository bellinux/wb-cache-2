We develop a formal model to predict, and leverage a surprisingly underutilized cross-national survey – the PEW Global Attitudes Project – to show that an individual’s wealth is a key predictor of favorable preferences for FDI. However, while wealthy individuals may favor FDI more than the poor, this effect attenuates in higher income countries: wealthy individuals in developing countries favor FDI more those in developed countries. Thus, preferences for FDI depend on both an individual’s wealth and her country’s placement in the global <b>economy.</b> <b>Word</b> coun...|$|R
