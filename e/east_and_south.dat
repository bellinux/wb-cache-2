5|$|On {{the third}} day of battle, {{fighting}} resumed on Culp's Hill, and cavalry battles raged to the <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>south,</b> but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge, known as Pickett's Charge. The charge was repulsed by Union rifle and artillery fire, at great loss to the Confederate army.|$|E
5|$|Once the monsoons subside, average {{temperatures}} gradually fall across India.

5|$|The two-storey L-shaped {{main house}} forms the <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>south</b> {{sides of a}} {{courtyard}} with single-storey stables forming {{the north and west}} sides. To the south-west of the house, is a second, larger courtyard flanked on its west side by a large barn and on its north and south by single storey return wings.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its {{ownership}} changes the building has been considerably altered, with only the <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>south</b> wings retaining their original appearance. Destruction of the west wing began during the seventeenth century, and the north wing was destroyed in 1812. The Hôtel d'Alluye was classified as a monument historique on 6 November 1929, and its courtyard has been open to the public on European Heritage Days since 2011.|$|E
5|$|As it {{approached}} the hospital, the line split; the southern fork {{led to a}} siding to the north-west of the hospital, while the other turned sharply <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>south</b> through almost 180° before splitting again. One fork ran into a large workshop and the other led to a short platform, which was initially used for passengers. Following the suspension of passenger services it was converted into a coal dock.|$|E

5|$|Edward built further luxurious, {{self-contained}} lodgings for {{his court}} around the <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>south</b> {{edges of the}} Upper Ward, creating the modern shape of the quadrangle. The Norman gate was built to secure the west entrance to the Ward. In the Lower Ward, the chapel was enlarged and remodelled with grand buildings for the canons built alongside. The earliest weight-driven mechanical clock in England was installed by Edward III in the Round Tower in 1354. William of Wykeham went on to build New College, Oxford and Winchester College, where the influence of Windsor Castle can easily be seen.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the 9thcentury the Pechenegs {{controlled}} the territories to the <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>south</b> of the Carpathians. According to the Eymund's saga, they fought together with the Blökkumen ("Romanians") in the Kievan Rus' in the 1010s. The Pechenegs were swept aside from their territories by the Cumans between 1064 and 1078. A late variant of the oldest Turkish chronicle, the Oghuz-name relates that the Cumans defeated many nations, including the Ulâq ("Romanians"). Some of the Pechenegs fled into the Kingdom of Hungary where they were employed to guard the border districts, for instance in Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{launched}} his attack on November 16. He led an assault from three sides: the north, <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>south.</b> Tides in the Harlem River prevented some troops from landing and delayed the attack. When the British moved against the defenses, the southern and western American defenses fell quickly. Patriot {{forces on the}} north side offered stiff resistance to the Hessian attack, but they too were eventually overwhelmed. With the fort surrounded by land and sea, Colonel Magaw chose to surrender. A total of 59 Americans were killed and 2,837 were taken as prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|In 1861 a {{proposal}} {{was made to}} construct a road from Blackfriars to the Mansion House; this {{would have resulted in}} the complete demolition of the College. However, protests from the heralds resulted in only parts of the south <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>south</b> west wings being sliced off, requiring extensive remodelling. The College was now a three-sided building with an open courtyard facing the New Queen Victoria Street laid out in 1866. The terrace, steps and entrance porch were also added around this time.|$|E
5|$|Incapillo {{is part of}} a {{volcanic}} system active between 3.5 and 2mya that includes Ojos del Salado and Nevado Tres Cruces. It was the last volcanic centre formed in the region; subsequently, the shallowing of the subducting slab prevented volcanism <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>south</b> of it. Another volcanic trend considers Incapillo as part of a northeastsouthwest trend with Cerro Galan and Cerro Blanco. This trend may be related to delamination of the lower crust. Also, these centres are located between two domains of different rigidity, an Ordovician sedimentary domain of low rigidity and a higher rigidity basement.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} in sources in Egypt and Sudan. In 1866 the Pharmaceutical Journal stated that it was found as a contaminant in Alexandrian senna, being found in cultivated fields in the valleys to the <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>south</b> of Assouan, in the Elephantine Islands, opposite Assouan, along the Nile, and Edfou and Hermonthis. In Israel it grows in the Judean desert, the Dead Sea Valley, the Negev hills and Eilat.|$|E

5|$|Newark is New Jersey's {{largest and}} second-most racially diverse city (after {{neighboring}} Jersey City). It {{is divided into}} five political wards, which are often used by residents to identify their place of habitation. In recent years, residents have begun to identify with specific neighborhood names instead of the larger ward appellations. Nevertheless, the wards remain relatively distinct. Industrial uses, coupled with the airport and seaport lands, are concentrated in the <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>South</b> Wards, while residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central, and West Wards.|$|E
5|$|Old Pine Church is {{surrounded}} {{on three sides}} by a cemetery containing approximately 200 interments, the oldest section of which is located to the immediate <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>south</b> of the church building. The earliest remaining gravestone dates from 1834, but several unmarked interment sites in the surrounding cemetery may date from as early as 1759.

Some of the stones are still vertical, but the majority are now recumbent and some are no longer present.|$|E
