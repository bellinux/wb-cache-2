40|$|Abstract: An <b>intelligent</b> <b>textile</b> is {{a textile}} {{structure}} that measures and reacts {{in front of}} external agents or stimulus with or without integrated electronic equipment [...] The finality of the present textile is {{to take one more}} step towards <b>intelligent</b> <b>textile,</b> considering the integration of electronics and textile needs, to be industrially viable and to keep up the necessary competitiveness, raising the final price as little as possible. The finality of these experiments is to develop a textile that varies in conductivity and resistance in relation to the elongation of the textile, detecting changes caused by the alteration of a piece of clothing, from the pressure of a finger on the material, for example. One of the most important characteristics of textile is the capacity of reproducing measures, of varying the response in different tests. Two lines of research were opened: the study of the most adequate structure to achieve a response that can be reproduced and the study of the best way of taking measures without altering the behavior of the textile...|$|R

E-textiles function like their rigid electronic companions but keep their textile properties.

For flexible solar cells or fibrous transistors, electro-conductive coatings are applied. Transistors, acting as electrical switches, are essential for realizing fully integrated <b>intelligent</b> <b>textile</b> systems.

Ideal pH and optimal reaction time as well as the effect of variation in fibre diameter are investigated. A reproducible polypyrrole layer has been obtained. Ideal reaction time was 180 minutes at a temperature of 278 K.

Flexible materials are widely employed for these applications due to the diversity of body shapes to which the sensors are attached and the variability of strain in action. Recent progress on the material systems includes graphene ripples on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates [8], Si/Ge nanowire matrix on polyimide substrates [3], Pt-coated polymer nanofibers sandwiched between PDMS sheets [9], Si nanoribbons on polyimide substrates [10], carbon nanotube ribbons embedded in PDMS [11], ZnO nanowire/polystyrene hybrid structure on PDMS [12], and graphene on PDMS [13]. Although high gauge factors reaching 116 and the adaptability to various forms of stresses such as tension, compression, shear stress, and torsion have been demonstrated through those approaches, a few weak points still need to be addressed. For instance, sensor fabrication processes were somewhat complicated, tolerable strains were low (less than several percent) for many systems, and most sensors were not completely transparent, whereas conventional strain sensors made of metal foils also suffer from limited sensitivity and high power consumption [14].|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>intelligent</b> <b>textile</b> systems {{to increase the}} wearer's level of protection has exposed the necessity of wearable communication tools and has led to research in textile antennas.

Flexible pad foam is commonly available in protective clothing and overcomes these constraints by providing a uniform, stable, and sufficient thickness.
