5|$|Most of the {{surviving}} frescoes on the church's interior walls date from the 18th century. These include images of the Mother of God, <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> John the Baptist, all painted {{as part of the}} church's first reconstruction. However, restoration works carried out in the 2000s have uncovered 14th-century murals depicting the meeting of Elizabeth and Mary as well as John the Baptist.|$|E
5|$|Onion domes {{often appear}} {{in groups of}} three, {{representing}} the Holy Trinity, or five, representing <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> the Four Evangelists. Domes standing alone represent Jesus. Vasily Tatischev, the first to record such interpretation, disapproved of it emphatically. He believed that the five-domed design of churches was propagated by Patriarch Nikon, who liked to compare the central and highest dome with himself and four lateral domes with four other patriarchs of the Orthodox world. There is no other evidence that Nikon ever held such a view.|$|E

5|$|As World War II neared its conclusion, Kimball {{and other}} LDS Church leaders {{constantly}} {{responded to the}} needs of the friends and families of LDS war casualties. Kimball's eldest son, Spence, was nearly killed in 1945 while serving aboard the aircraft carrier USS Franklin, when bombs dropped from Japanese airplanes damaged the ship and ignited its tanks of aviation fuel. In an attempt to give comfort to families of those killed in combat, Kimball drafted a well-known letter in which he wrote that sin, not premature death, was the only true tragedy in life. Kimball compared the death of young servicemen to the early death of <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> stated that although such death is heartbreaking, from an eternal perspective, God's all-knowing purposes would be seen in their circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{identified}} several instances {{in the story}} that he argued linked to wider themes within the Adventures of Tintin. He identified a recurring host-and-guest theme in Alembick's visit to Syldavia, and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick's identity is stolen. Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy {{was that of the}} blurring between the sacred and the political; he saw echoes of this in King Ottokar's Sceptre as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir's Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> the Resurrection. McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled Captain Haddock, a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E
