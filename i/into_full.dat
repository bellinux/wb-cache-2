5|$|Construction of the B Station began {{shortly after}} the A station was completed. The {{stations}} were built during {{a period in which}} there were great advances in power station technology, and in the scale of production, which led to them having a variety of intermediate generator set sizes along with a mix of design styles. Blyth A had a generating capacity of 480megawatts (MW) and the B Station 1,250MW. Their combined capacity of 1,730MW briefly made Blyth Power Station the largest electricity generation site in England, until Ferrybridge C Power Station came <b>into</b> <b>full</b> operation in 1966. The stations were capable of generating enough electricity to power 300,000homes.|$|E

5|$|Development {{started in}} early 2014 and took {{fourteen}} {{months to go}} <b>into</b> <b>full</b> production. The concept was contributed by Keiji Inafune, who wished to convey the idea of surviving in a world verging on human extinction.

Writer Joseph Staten resolved to create a simple story to enhance an emotional backdrop more grounded in complexity.|$|E
5|$|During the Interregnum, a governor, Sir John Fowell, was {{appointed}} by Parliament to run the defences of Dartmouth and to prevent smuggling.

Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 and initially granted the Dartmouth defences to the control of town once again. By 1662, however, the fortifications in Dartmouth were garrisoned by a royal force of 23 men and overseen by Sir John, who continued in his post as captain and governor until 1677.|$|E

Two of these songs would appear on his next album, Either/Or, which was another Kill Rock Stars release. Either/Or came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further <b>into</b> <b>full</b> instrumentation, with several songs containing bass guitar, drums, keyboards, and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title {{was derived from the}} two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, whose works generally deal with themes such as existential despair, angst, death, and God.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of December 31, 1950, the PVA 13th Army {{launched}} a massive attack against South Korean forces along the 38th parallel. Along the Imjin River and the Hantan River, the PVA 38th, 39th, 40th and 50th Corps managed to decimate the ROK 1st Division while routing the ROK 6th Division. At the Chuncheon sector, the PVA 42nd and the 66th Corps forced the ROK III Corps <b>into</b> <b>full</b> retreat. With the defenses at the 38th parallel completely collapsed by January 1, 1951, Ridgway ordered the evacuation of Seoul on January 3.|$|E
5|$|Some of the ferry's six {{proposed}} routes {{were originally}} {{supposed to be}} operational in June 2017, but the implementation date was later moved to May 1. Under the 2015 plan, the whole system is expected to come <b>into</b> <b>full</b> service by 2018. The system includes routes that were formerly under NY Waterway, most notably the East River route. There {{would be at least}} 18 boats needed for rush-hour operation. Twelve boats would be deployed in 2017, while the other six would be put in service the next year. The number of boats was later revised slightly to 20, including three boats that would be upgraded later.|$|E

Around 700 men were lost in engineering units, 70th Tank Battalion, and seaborne vessels sunk by the enemy. German losses are unknown.

A large force of South Korean troops, designated Task Force P'ohang, was massed and sent into P'ohang-dong to engage the 766th Regiment and the 5th Division. ROK troops attacked toward An'gang-ni to the east, forcing the KPA's 12th Division into a full retreat. Threatened with encirclement, the KPA's 5th Division and 766th Regiment were ordered <b>into</b> <b>full</b> retreat on August 17.

Play was primarily for inculcating virtuous traits like courage and loyalty, but it also made life more tolerable.

Children often helped the adults, and performed chores (like fetching wood or water) that quickly escalated <b>into</b> <b>full</b> work responsibilities.|$|E

In December 1914, Caesar was detached from the 7th Battle Squadron and transferred to Gibraltar to serve as guard ship and gunnery training ship there. In July 1915, she transferred to the North America and West Indies Station, serving as guard ship and gunnery training ship at Bermuda and patrolling the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Because of this {{experiment}} Hendrik Lorentz {{proposed that the}} motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to contract along its length in the direction of motion, and he further assumed, that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed accordingly ("local time"), which led to the formulation of the Lorentz transformation. Based on Lorentz's aether theory, Henri Poincaré (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in v/c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz's theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz's aether theory <b>into</b> <b>full</b> observational agreement with the principle of relativity.|$|E

5|$|Being Naughty Dog's first PlayStation 3 game, {{the project}} {{required}} {{the company to}} familiarize themselves with the new hardware, and resulted in several development mistakes. The switch from developing for the PlayStation 2 to the PlayStation 3 prompted the staff to implement changes to their development technology. Naughty Dog switched to the industry standard language C++ in order to participate in technology sharing among Sony's first-party developers—the company had previously used their own proprietary programming language GOAL, a Lisp-based language. In rewriting their game code, they decided to create new programming tools as well. This switch, however, delayed the team's progress in developing a prototype, as the new tools proved to be unreliable and too difficult to use. Ten months <b>into</b> <b>full</b> production, the team decided to recreate the game's pipeline, the chain of processing elements designed to progress data through a system. In retrospect, Naughty Dog's Co-President Evan Wells considered this the greatest improvement to the project. Additionally, the animation blending system was rewritten several times to obtain the desired character animations.|$|E
