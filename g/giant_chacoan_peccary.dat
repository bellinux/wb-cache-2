50|$|Some of the {{endangered}} species that live in this park include the maned wolf, jaguar, the <b>giant</b> anteater, the <b>chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> and the <b>giant</b> armadillo.|$|R
50|$|Being an {{accredited}} {{member of}} the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), the zoo partakes in multiple captive breeding programs and Species Survival Plans. The zoo works to care for and breed multiple endangered species such as Amur tigers, Amur leopards, Canada lynx, Brazilian ocelots, red wolves, Mexican wolves, maned wolves, <b>giant</b> anteaters, <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccaries,</b> golden lion tamarins, North American river otters, Andean condors, spotted turtles, and Eastern hellbenders.|$|R
5000|$|Pampas Plains- This new exhibit {{opened in}} 2015 and is phase {{one of the}} zoo's [...] "South American Adventure". It {{features}} a raised walkway to allow for better viewing and is home to maned wolves, <b>giant</b> anteaters, <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccaries,</b> and greater rheas. The zoo also plans to add vicuña to the exhibit, making them {{one of the few}} zoos in the country to exhibit the species. An anteater was born at the zoo on February 13, 2016, the first in the zoo's history.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> (Catagonus wagneri), {{known only}} from fossils before its {{discovery}} in 1975.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> is {{confined}} to hot, dry areas. Dominated by low-lying succulents and thorny bushes, the Gran Chaco is about 140,000 km2. A few scattered giant trees are found, {{but the majority of}} the vegetation is thorny scrub vegetation. The <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> has developed adaptations such as well-developed sinuses to combat dry, dusty conditions. Their feet are also small, which allows maneuverability among spiny plants.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{defensive}} strategy, {{members of a}} herd may line up in {{a defensive}} wall; this makes the herds easy targets for hunters. The <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> produces a milky, odorous substance used for marking trees, shrubs, and similar. The substance is secreted from glands located on their backs, and is dispersed by rubbing. Frequently bathing in mud or dust, <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccaries</b> also defecate at particular [...] "stations".|$|R

50|$|The third species, the <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> (Catagonus wagneri), is {{the closest}} living {{relative}} to the extinct Platygonus pearcei. It {{is found in the}} dry shrub habitat or Chaco of Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina. The <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> has the unusual distinction of having been first described based on fossils and was originally thought to be only an extinct species. In 1975, the animal was discovered in the Chaco region of Paraguay. The species was well known to the native people.|$|R
50|$|More exotic animals include crested screamers, Patagonian maras (cavies), Orinoco geese, flamingos, bush dogs, red pandas, Indian muntjac, yaks, <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccaries,</b> and rheas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{largest of}} the three {{generally}} accepted species of <b>peccaries,</b> the <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> has many pig-like features. It is an ungulate with a well-formed rostrum with a tough leathery snout. The bristle-like hair is generally brown to almost gray. A dark stripe runs across the back, and white fur is on the shoulders. <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccaries</b> differ from other peccary species by having longer ears, snouts, and tails. It has white hairs around the mouth, unlike other peccaries. Catagonus wagneri also has a third hind toe, but other peccaries only have two. The hypsodont teeth follow this dental formula: 2/3, 1/1, 3/3, 3/3 [...] The upper canines display the distinguishing trait of peccaries, pointing downwards instead of out and up like other Suiformes. When the <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> is nervous or frightened, it flees, and raises the hairs on its back. While escaping, it sprays secretions from its dorsal glands, which may be a signal for other peccaries to keep the group together through the dense bush.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the zoo {{became the}} first in the Northeast to exhibit <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccaries.</b> In October 2011, it also {{became the first}} zoo in the Northeast to breed the species.|$|R

50|$|The arid {{habitat of}} the Gran Chaco region {{provides}} very tough vegetation for the <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary.</b> These peccaries feed on various species of cacti, such as Cleistocactus baumannii and Opuntia discolor. It uses its tough snout {{to roll the}} cacti on the ground, rubbing the spines off. It may pull off the spines with its teeth and spit them out. The kidneys are specialized to break down acids from the cacti. The two-chambered stomachs are also well suited to digest tough foods. Occasionally grazing on bromeliad roots, it also eats acacia pods and fallen cactus flowers. This species of peccary seeks out salt licks formed from ant mounds and construction projects (road building and land clearings). The <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> gains essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, and chlorine from the salt licks.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> or tagua (Catagonus wagneri) is {{the last}} extant species of the genus Catagonus; it is a peccary found in the Gran Chaco of Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina. Approximately 3,000 remain in the world. It is {{believed}} to be the closest living relative to the extinct genus Platygonus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccaries</b> often {{travel in}} herds {{of up to}} 20 individuals. They are active during the day, {{especially}} {{in the morning when}} they are most apt to travel. Herds display a general travel cycle within their home range of 42 days. This allows the individuals to monitor and show ownership over their areas.|$|R
50|$|Between the cougar exhibit and Bear Grotto, {{a summer}} {{enclosure}} {{was built for}} the zoo's tortoise collection. Kronk and Isma, the zoo's large Aldabra tortoises, took residence in the exhibit. In 2004, the exhibit was renovated {{for the arrival of}} four endangered <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccaries.</b> The renovated exhibit featured tunnels and dens for the South American pigs.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> has {{the unusual}} {{distinction}} {{of having been}} first described in 1930 based on fossils and was originally thought to be an extinct species. In 1971, the animal was discovered to still be alive in the Chaco region, in the Argentine province of Salta. The species was well known to the native people, {{but it took a}} while for scientists to acknowledge its existence. It is known locally as the tagua.|$|R
50|$|Peccaries {{are social}} animals, and often form herds. Over 100 {{individuals}} {{have been recorded}} for a single herd of white-lipped peccaries, but collared and <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccaries</b> usually form smaller groups. Such social behavior {{seems to have been}} the situation in extinct peccaries, as well. The recently discovered giant peccary (Pecari maximus) of Brazil appears to be less social, primarily living in pairs. Peccaries rely on their social structure to defend territory, protect against predators, regulate temperature, and interact socially.|$|R
50|$|The zoo {{is home to}} {{more than}} 75 species that are native to the Americas. It {{is the only one of}} five zoos in New York City that {{exhibits}} Andean bears. The zoo is also home to pumas, California sea lions, Coywolves, snowy owls, Canada lynx, pudú, thick-billed parrots, American alligators, Roosevelt elk, American bison, Trumpeter swans, pronghorn, sandhill crane, bald eagle, <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccaries,</b> a walk-through aviary, and a farm with a variety of domestic animals.|$|R
50|$|The fauna {{present in}} the area is {{representative}} of the Chaqueña plains region, with 350 registered species, 89 species of snakes, 301 species of birds, 65 species of small mammals and 59 species of large mammals. Foremost among these are the <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary,</b> known locally as tagua or quilimero pig, a common species in Chaco, armadillos (Tolypeutes matacus and Chlamyphorus retusus), common in the region, the Chacoan mara and Conover's tuco-tuco. The jaguar, puma, ocelot and maned wolf can also be found.|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> is {{endemic to}} a {{formerly}} isolated region of South America, {{it is most}} vulnerable to human activity. Just as quickly as this species is discovered in an area, it disappears. Herd numbers are decreasing {{as a result of}} habitat loss and fragmentation. Their range is being quickly transformed into large Texas-style ranches. Hunting also continues, as well as an unidentified disease that has plagued the herds in recent years. A population has been established in North American and European zoos. Preserves have also been established in Paraguay, but are not highly enforced.|$|R
5000|$|Woodland edge was {{the first}} phase of Discoveryland. Woodland Edge {{consisted}} of two naturalistic exhibits. One exhibit housed the zoo's bald eagles. Their names were Sam and Betsy [...] The other exhibit housed a bobcat.When construction on Rocky Shores started, some of the animals from the construction zone had to be moved to Discoveryland. The exhibits in Woodland Edge were renovated to house them. Two orphaned mountain lion siblings moved into where the bobcat used to be, and a family of endangered <b>chacoan</b> <b>peccaries</b> moved into where the bald eagles were. New exhibits were built for the eagles and bobcat on the zoo's south pathway.|$|R
5000|$|In The Eternal Frontier, Flannery made a {{proposal}} for what later became nicknamed [...] "Pleistocene rewilding": restoring the ecosystems that existed in North America {{before the arrival of}} the Clovis people and the concomitant disappearance of the North American Pleistocene megafauna ca. 13,000. He wonders if, in addition to the wolves that have been already re-introduced to Yellowstone National Park, ambush predators, such as jaguars and lions should be reintroduced there as well, in order to bring the number of elks under control. Furthermore, the closest extant relatives of the species that became extinct around the Clovis period could be introduced to North America's nature reserves as well. In particular, the Indian and African elephants could substitute, respectively, for the mammoth and the mastodon; the <b>Chacoan</b> <b>Peccary,</b> for its extinct cousin the flat-headed Peccary (Platygonus compressus). Llamas and panthers, which still survive outside of the USA, should too be brought back to that country.|$|R
5000|$|Faunal {{diversity}} in the Gran Chaco is high as well.The Gran Chaco has high levels of biodiversity, containing around 3,400 plant species, 500 birds, 150 mammals and 220 reptiles and amphibians. Animals typically associated with tropical and subtropical forests are often found throughout the eastern humid Chaco, including jaguars, howler monkeys, peccaries, deer, and tapirs. Edentate species, including anteaters and armadillos, are readily seen here as well. [...] Being home to at least ten species, the Argentinian Chaco is {{the location of the}} peak diversity for the armadillo, including species such as the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) whose range extends north to the southern US, and the southern three-banded armadillo (Tolypeutes matacus). The pink fairy armadillo (Chlamyphrous truncates), is found nowhere else in the world. The giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), while not found in the eastern humid Chaco, {{can be seen in the}} drier arid Chaco of the west. Some other notable endemics of the region include the San Luis tuco-tuco (Ctenomys pontifex). This small rodent is only found in the Argentinian Chaco. All of 60 species of Ctenomys are endemic to the continent of South America. The <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccary</b> (Catagonus wagneri), locally known as tauga, is the largest of the three peccary species found in the area. This species was thought to be extinct by scientists until 1975, when it was recorded by Dr. Ralph Wetzel.|$|R
40|$|Radio-telemetry is an {{excellent}} tool for gathering data on the biology of animals and their interactions with the environment they inhabit. Many methods {{have been developed for}} analyses of spatial information, on home range size and utilization density. Activity patterns are often described using radio-tracking data, but no generally accepted method is currently available specifically for determining the temporal independence of this type of data for statistical inference. Activity rhythms have generally been analysed by ecologists with the assumption that data are temporally independent, or by subjectively fixing an independence interval, based on attributes of their ranging behaviour. Although some good approximations of activity patterns can be obtained in these ways, we underline the need for a functionally correct method of estimating independence interval. Here we use semi-variograms to estimate the minimum interval required for the readings to be sequentially independent. This geostatistical tool is applied to the analysis of data on activity of Chilean foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus) and <b>Chacoan</b> <b>peccaries</b> (Catagonus wagneri). Data were collected in the field by radio-tracking over 24 -hr periods, with readings on activity state taken every 15 min. The spatial dimension in which the theory of geostatistics lies has been transferred into the time dimension, so that the correlation interval is expressed in time units (min). Time of independence as estimated by the variogram was 110 min for foxes, while data on peccaries indicated that they have long periods of activity, more suitable for time-series analysi...|$|R
40|$|I {{assessed}} {{major factors}} influencing {{the interactions between}} the mestizo community and wildlife of the Impenetrable, in the Argentine Chaco, {{and the ways in}} which these interactions are influenced by the larger economic and political context. I used a mixed qualitative and quantitative methods approach, between 2001 and 2005. I found that wildlife represented an important food source, especially for the poorer rural households. The importance of wild meat varied across the community and region, in relation to the socioeconomic characteristics of households, village size, forest condition, season, species biology, and cultural preferences. Some species used by local people, primarily white-lipped and <b>chacoan</b> <b>peccaries,</b> and jaguar, were in decline and their range had been reduced by habitat destruction and overhunting, especially in the humid sub-region. These species persisted in areas of low human density, low hunting pressure and scarce development. Harvest of peccaries for food was unsustainable. Characteristics of the resource and of the community explained the lack of incentives for community-based management of peccaries. The resource was too large in relation to the local technology and the community's institutional capacities were scarcely developed. Changes in property right regimes also influenced people-wildlife interactions and were related with species mobility. Acquisition of land title by peasants did not reduce overexploitation of highly mobile resources such as peccaries, which continued to be hunted as open access resources. The national economic collapse of 2001 had a strong influence in the region. Hunting by villagers increased as a result of growing unemployment, whereas peasants reduced their hunting and turned to forest exploitation. Acquisition of land title by non-locals and intensification of ranching and forest exploitation subsequently increased, thereby affecting the livelihoods of local peasants by reducing grazing areas and affecting wildlife by reducing habitat. This study shows how people-wildlife interactions are complex and dynamic, and indicates that conservation measures are unlikely to succeed without considering the biological, cultural, socio-economic, and political factors involved. External factors require especial consideration. In this case, a national change in economic policy produced a local change in land use that is jeopardizing the peasants culture and the region's biodiversity...|$|R
