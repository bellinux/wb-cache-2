[...] Datamoshing with software such as Avidemux is a common method for creating glitch art by manipulating different frame types in compressed digital video: [...] "Datamoshing involves the removal of an encoded video’s I-frames (<b>intra-coded</b> <b>picture,</b> also known as key frames—a frame that does not require any information regarding another frame to be decoded), leaving only the P- (predicted picture) or B- (bi-predictive picture) frames. P-frames contain information predicting {{the changes in the}} image between the current frame and the previous one, and B-frames contain information predicting the image differences between the previous, current and subsequent frames. Because P- and B-frames use data from previous and forward frames, they are more compressed than I-Frames."This process of direct manipulation of the digital data is not restricted to files that only appear on digital screens.

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes {{the use of}} unequally {{protected}} key {{pictures to}} prevent temporal error propagation in error-prone video communications. The key picture may either be an <b>intra-coded</b> <b>picture</b> or a picture using a long-term motion compensation reference picture through reference picture selection. The inter-coded key picture uses previous key pictures as motion compensation reference. Key pictures are better protected than other pictures using forward error correction in either source or transport coding. Simulation results show significantly improved error resiliency performance of the proposed technique compared to conventional methods. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a denoising method of <b>intra-coded</b> <b>pictures</b> using motion estimation and pixel shift. Firstly, {{we show that}} pixel-aligned mixture of distorted images which are spatially shifted and differently encoded brings reduction of quantization errors. We show that this effect can be formulated as a special case of Wiener-Hopf equation and independence of quantization errors affects the performance. We then consider its application to denoising of <b>intra-coded</b> <b>pictures</b> by using motion estimation and pixel shift. Experiments using actual image sequences verify that motion estimation is effective in moving regions, pixel shift is effective in static regions and favorable PSNR gains are achieved...|$|R
50|$|In most designs, {{there are}} two types of inter frames: P-frames and B-frames. These two kinds of frames and the I-frames (<b>Intra-coded</b> <b>pictures)</b> usually join in a GOP (Group Of Pictures). The I-frame doesn't need {{additional}} information to be decoded and it can be used as a reliable reference. This structure also allows to achieve an I-frame periodicity, which is needed for decoder synchronization.|$|R

In this paper, we extend our previous work, that focused on requantization of <b>intra-coded</b> <b>pictures,</b> to P and B pictures. We show that by {{using a combination of}} techniques, depending on the slice and macroblock type, improved results are obtained when compared to previously existent architectures. We also show that in the important case of transcoding to low bitrates, results of this hybrid architecture approximate the rate-distortion performance of the computationally complex decoder-encoder cascade...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{transmission}} {{errors in}} H. 264 may propagate in the temporal direction. Errors in <b>intra-coded</b> <b>picture</b> (I-frame) will propagate into the associated P-B frame {{if they are}} in the same Group Of Picture (GOP). Therefore it is important to detect errors in the I-frame rather than in the P-B frame. This paper proposes and demonstrates an effective technique of Error-Resilient Coding based on bit-error detection and Directional Intra-Frame Concealment (DIFC) for H. 264 video. The bit error detection is derived from multiblock checksum, chain coverage and remainder coding. DIFC takes advantage of flexible block sizes to deal with detailed movement areas and employs object edge detection to improve the accuracy of spatial interpolation. The results showed that the proposed directional intra-frame concealment has a better performance than the weighted pixel interpolation in H. 264 software.

30|$|It can be assumed, {{without loss}} of generality, that the GOP {{structure}} is IPPP..., where I is an <b>intra-coded</b> <b>picture</b> and P is a forward-predicted picture. The adaptive rate control scheme in the H. 264 /AVC {{is composed of}} two layers: the GOP layer rate control and the frame layer rate control. An additional basic unit layer rate control is added if {{the size of the}} basic unit is smaller than a frame. It was noted in [4] that using a bigger basic unit, a higher PSNR can be achieved with higher bit fluctuations, and using a smaller basic unit there will be smaller bit fluctuations with a slight loss in PSNR. Since we want to maximize PSNR for this study, the basic unit is selected as a frame so {{there is no need for}} an additional basic unit layer rate control. In addition, only the frame layer rate control is modified; the operation of the GOP layer rate control remains the same.|$|E
40|$|A congestion-level measure {{based on}} packet {{dispersion}} rather than packet loss, using a fuzzy rule set {{rather than an}} equation-based approach is proposed. Tests show that nonpacket-loss-based control of transcoded video is well behaved across a tight link {{in the face of}} characteristic Internet cross-traffic and results in smooth variation of the received video quality. Introduction: Knowledge of the network state allows transcoder adaptation of a pre-encoded video bit rate by varying the re-quantization parameter. In TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) [1], which is now an RFC, an equation captures the network state, determining congestion primarily from packet loss events. However, packet loss of <b>intra-coded</b> <b>pictures</b> leads to progressive deterioration of a video sequence group of pictures (GOP). Ideally, a more sensitive measure of congestion is required, whic...|$|R
40|$|Requantization {{techniques}} for H. 264 /AVC rate reduction transcoding Abstract—In order {{to cope with}} the increasing number of different display devices and the heterogeneity of transmission networks, fast and elegant adaptation of video content is required. Transcoding can be used for reduction of the bitrate, without fully decoding and recoding the bitstream. A significant reduction in computational complexity can be achieved by reusing information from the incoming bitstream, such as motion vectors, and by working as much as possible in the transform domain. We investigated architectures for bitrate reduction transcoding of <b>intra-coded</b> <b>pictures,</b> comparing the decoder-encoder cascade with different reduced complexity transcoders. Results show that the transform-domain architecture can achieve the quality of the pixel-domain transcoder, and approximates the quality of a decoder-encoder cascade.
