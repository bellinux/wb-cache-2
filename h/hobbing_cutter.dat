40|$|Abstract: Owing to {{the complex}} {{geometry}} of helical cutting tools, several manufacturing pro-cesses are required to produce {{the profile of the}} cutter and the cutting angles. If the traditional method of manufacture were used, the cost would be frustratingly expensive. In this paper, a novel straight-sided <b>hob</b> <b>cutter</b> design consisting of two curved cutting edges and three straight cutting edges with different pressure angles is proposed. By applying designed rake profile equations of a <b>hob</b> <b>cutter,</b> the principle of coordinate transformation, the theory of differential geometry, and the theory of gearing, a mathematical model of the helical cutting tool is derived. In addition, the cutting angles, the condition of full undercutting, and the width of the top land of the cutter are also studied. The novelty of the design is such that the multiangles of the helical cutting tool can be manufactured in one hobbing process, thereby simplifying the man-ufacturing process. The results and concepts proposed in the paper will be beneficial as design guidance for tool designers, will enhance the manufacturing processes of helical cutting tools, and will assist tool-related industries in upgrading their technology and competitiveness...|$|R
