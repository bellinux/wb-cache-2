He then ordered Rock into an Intercontinental match with Ken Shamrock, with Rock's tournament {{spot on the}} line. Shamrock hit him with a chair and thus he won, but only by disqualification and thus lost his tournament spot. Afterwards McMahon had The Rock arrested, much like <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done months before with Austin. The following week McMahon threatened him with expulsion from the company {{if he could not}} win a match against former Nation of Domination stable mate Mark Henry. Despite the odds being stacked in his favor with McMahon's entourage at ring side distracting the referee, Shane McMahon ran down after Rock had performed the Rock Bottom, a lifting side slam, on Henry and counted the pinfall to secure Rock's employment and, presumably, earning back his spot in the tournament although this was never specifically mentioned other than McMahon mentioning it on Heat.|$|R
