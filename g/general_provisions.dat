25|$|Work {{began in}} May 1811 on the sole trading post {{founded by the}} Tonquin, Fort Astoria, on the present-day Oregon coast. After {{construction}} was completed, the ship departed with {{a majority of the}} trade goods and <b>general</b> <b>provisions</b> from the fort, intending to trade them with indigenous tribes on the coast of Vancouver Island. When the crew began bartering with Tla-o-qui-aht natives at Clayoquot Sound in June, a dispute arose due to Captain Thorn's poor treatment of an elder. All but four members of the crew were killed by armed Tla-o-qui-aht led by chief Wickaninnish. The survivors intentionally detonated the ship's powder magazine, and the Tonquin was destroyed and sunk. Joseachal, a Quinault interpreter previously hired by Thorn, was the sole crew member to survive the entire incident and return to Fort Astoria. While there, he held several conversations with Duncan McDougall and gave the only detailed account of how the Tonquin was destroyed.|$|E
