40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the {{ultimate}} load carrying capacity of conventional reinforced concrete beams with that of investigation specimen incorporated with coated reinforcement and partially with recycled aggregate and quarry dust. A novel technique of coated reinforcement delays the onset of corrosion with enhanced durability of structures. Results show that not even a <b>film</b> <b>of</b> corrosion (white <b>rust)</b> can be seen in the investigation specimen. There is a progressive increase in stiffness from the state of the first crack to ultimate stage and a negligible difference in ultimate load carrying capacity of the investigation specimen, when compared with the controlled specimen. Incorporation of galvanization, recycled aggregate, and quarry dust seemed to be compatible with the existing conservative concreting procedures. Experimental results are compared with the numerical solutions aided by finite element analysis (FEA by using ABAQUS) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Oil {{drilling}} {{requires that}} miles of steel drill pipe, called the drill string, {{be exposed to}} fatigue loading and corrosive environments. Furthermore, {{it has been reported}} that pitting corrosion is responsible for initiating catastrophic drillstring failure. Pitting corrosion is responsible for initiating fatigue cracks, with pits acting as local stress raisers. This project investigates the pitting corrosion susceptibility and influence on fatigue life of high strength low alloy drillstring steels S- 135 and UD- 165 in a simulated drilling completion fluid, 6. 7 M CaCl₂. Immersion test results show that both alloys are susceptible to pitting corrosion and a non-protective <b>film</b> <b>of</b> hydrated <b>rust</b> (FeOOH) was found. Non-metallic inclusions are well known to initiate pits in carbon steels. Preliminary testing of S- 135 shows inclusions rich in Mn and S, while UD- 165 shows inclusions rich in either Fe, Al and O, or Nb and C. Potentiodynamic scans of both alloys show active dissolution. Cyclic voltrammetry results shows a repassivation potential in the cathodic region. Through potentiostatic testing pit growth was found to be independent of anodic polarization time, meaning pit growth was unachievable through anodic polarization. Shallow, wide pits (3 - 5 μm deep, 10 - 50 μm wide) were only observed after the potentiostatic anodic polarization. Fatigue testing was performed on three surface treatments: 1) virgin 2) pitted by galvanostatic methods, and 3) pitted by galvanostatic methods, dried and left in the laboratory (20 °C, 20 - 40...|$|R

Three different species <b>of</b> <b>rust,</b> Puccinia alli sensu lato, P. allii sensu Gäumann (1959) and P. mixta, were identified based on the morphology of urediniospores and teliospores, and analyses of the internal transcribed spacer and large subunit regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA.

On the investigated area there were found 32 species <b>of</b> <b>rusts.</b> They presence was determined by the influence of several factors: the composition of surrounding vegetation, the local climate, the annual average temperature, the wind direction, the quantity of rainfall, ontogenetic development of the host plant. The occurrence <b>of</b> some <b>rust</b> species should be expected here in following year, especially the species overwintering as perennial mycelium. The occurrence of most species <b>of</b> <b>rusts</b> is difficult to predict in the future, because they spread diffusely. The special attention was paid to rust on spring plants: Uromyces muscari on Muscari tenuiflorum and Puccinia liliacearum on Ornithogalum kochii.
