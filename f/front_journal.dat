40|$|Fingertip {{splitting}} may {{be observed}} at chemical reaction fronts subject to buoyancy-induced Rayleigh-Taylor fingering, as investigated in ascending fronts of the iodate-arsenous acid reaction in vertical Hele-Shaw cells. We study {{the properties of}} the flow-field evolution during a tip-splitting event both experimentally and theoretically. Experimental particle-image velocimetry techniques show that the flow field associated to a finger displays a quadrupole of vortices. The evolution of the flow field and the reorganization of the vortices after a tip-splitting event are followed experimentally in detail. Numerical integration of a model reaction-diffusion-convection system for an exothermic reaction taking into account possible heat losses through the walls of the reactor shows that the nonlinear properties of the flow field are different whether the walls are insulating or conducting. In insulating systems, the flow field inside one finger features only one pair of vortices. A quadrupole of flow vortices arranged around a saddle-node structure similar to the one observed experimentally is obtained in the presence of heat losses suggesting that heat effects, even if of very small amplitude, are important in understanding the nonlinear properties of fingering of exothermic chemical <b>fronts.</b> <b>Journal</b> Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

30|$|Between the two World Wars, a few {{students}} from the continent and the Caribbean also met in literary circles of Paris, France. While they did not form a specific organization, they discussed themes that had identity and political implications especially “Négritude” (Black identity), given the high politicization of racial identity. This resulted in a decision by Leopold Sédar Senghor of Senegal, Aimé Césaire of Martinique, and Léon Gontran Damas of French Gyana to create a Journal named “l’Etudiant Noir” (The Black Student). But their activities did not develop further on the political <b>front</b> and the <b>Journal</b> was discontinued.|$|R

He was a fan of the Munchkin, but felt that the unavoidable long-legged versions were indistinguishable from similar mixed breeds commonly seen in animal shelters. Smith decided that {{something had to be done}} to create a cat unique in both short and long legged versions, something that looked purebred. He chose the Persian breed group as an outcross to the Munchkin for two reasons: beauty and boning. The original Napoleon standard was written with this in mind.|$|R
40|$|The complex Ginzburg Landau {{equation}} (CGLE) is a ubiquitous {{model for}} the evolution of slowly varying wave packets in nonlinear dissipative media. A front (shock) is a transient layer between a plane-wave state and a zero background. We report exact solutions for domain walls, i. e., pairs of fronts with opposite polarities, in a system of two coupled CGLEs, which describe transient layers between semi-infinite domains occupied by each component {{in the absence of the}} other one. For this purpose, a modified Hirota bilinear operator, first proposed by Bekki and Nozaki, is employed. A novel factorization procedure is applied to reduce the intermediate calculations considerably. The ensuing system of equations for the amplitudes and frequencies is solved by means of computer-assisted algebra. Exact solutions for mutually-locked front pairs of opposite polarities, with one or several free parameters, are thus generated. The signs of the cubic gain/loss, linear amplification/attenuation, and velocity of the coupled-front complex can be adjusted in a variety of configurations. Numerical simulations are performed to study the stability properties of such <b>fronts.</b> Comment: <b>Journal</b> of the Physical Society of Japan, in pres...|$|R
6000|$|There also {{exists a}} set of small Mycenaean relics called Palladia, found at Mycenae, Spata and in the {{earliest}} strata of the Acropolis at Athens. They resemble [...] "two circles joined together so as to intersect one another slightly," [...] or [...] "a long oval pinched in at the middle." [...] They vary in size from six inches to half an inch, and are of ivory, glazed ware, or glass. Several such shields are engraved on Mycenaean gems; one, in gold, {{is attached to a}} silver vase. The ornamentation shown on them occurs, too, on Mycenaean shields in works of art; in short, these little objects are representations in miniature of the big double-bellied Mycenaean shield. Mr. Ernest Gardner concludes that these objects are the [...] "schematised" [...] reductions of an armed human figure, only the shield which covered the whole body is left. They are talismans symbolising an armed divinity, Pallas or another. A Dipylon vase (Fig. 3) shows a man with a shield, possibly evolved out of this kind, much scooped out at the waist, and reaching from neck to knees.

40|$|An {{electric}} field {{applied in the}} direction of propagation of a chemical reaction-diffusion front can affect the stability of this front with regard to diffusive instabilities. The influence of an applied constant {{electric field}} is investigated by a linear stability analysis and by nonlinear simulations of a simple chemical system based on the cubic autocatalytic reaction A-+ 2 B [...] -> 3 B-. The diffusional stability of the front is seen to depend on the intensity E and sign of the applied field, and D, the ratio diffusion coefficients of the reactant species. Depending on E, the front can become more or less diffusively unstable for a given value of D. Above a critical value of E, which depends on D, electrophoretic separation of the two <b>fronts</b> is observed. <b>Journal</b> Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Visualisation of {{molecules}} {{in the field}} of chemistry has been important for understanding their structure, whether simple or complicated. Initially, this was done by hand, but latterly software has {{come to the aid of}} researchers and the vast majority of chemistry visualisation is now computer-generated. As well as aiding understanding, many molecules, especially if complex in nature, can take on an artistic quality when visualised, using artificial colour for example. Often these are used for creative reasons on the <b>front</b> of chemistry <b>journals,</b> for example, and sometimes as an inspiration for more pure art forms. This paper introduces molecular graphics in the context of creative computing. It also provides a history of the development of visualisation in chemistry, especially more recently with the use of software and the increasing use on journal covers. A brief survey of some of the software involved is included. Finally, some conclusions are drawn with respect to the creative directions being taken now and possible directions in the future...|$|R
40|$|This master's thesis aims at the {{development}} of the most successful Czech tabloid journal Blesk. It starts with the comparison of Czech and foreign tabloids. Subsequently, it captures the history of Czechoslovakian and Czech tabloids from the First Republic until the present day. This thesis also deals with the journals that unsuccessfully tried to compete with the journal Blesk. Nowadays, the only remaining tabloid journal is Aha!, nevertheless it is owned by the same publishing company as the journal Blesk. Further, the thesis pays attention to the main personalities who helped to shape the form of the journal. It inquires into {{the development}} of the graphical shape of the front pages and it tries to interpret their symbolical message, both by the means of qualitative analyses. Alongside that, it deals with the editors and their influence on {{the development of}} the journal, its visual form, and the choice of topics on the <b>front</b> pages.

40|$|The {{paper will}} concern the {{formation}} of the United Nations Organization in 1945 and its reflection in the period newspapers. Firstly it will provide facts about the preceding organizations of UNO, it will describe the proces of drafting the new organization and its establishing conference in San Francisko 25. 4. - 26. 6. 1945. It will discuss the position of the Czechoslovak Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Masaryk at the conference, because he acted as a very pro-Western politician before and during World War II, but at the conference he stood for the interestes of the Soviet Union (i. e. in the question of recognizing the Polish government). Then the paper will also outline the domestic political situation that was influencing Masaryk's performance at the conference. The first part includes also the preamble of the UN Charter. The second part of the paper will introduce the articles in the Czechoslovak press that were reporting about the UN creation. I chose the following newspapers: Lidová demokracie, Mladá fronta, Právo lidu, Rudé právo and Svobodné slovo, because those daily newspapers were written in Czech, they were published in the period of June-December 1945 and they were published by political parties that were represented in the National <b>Front</b> (only the <b>journal</b> Mladá fronta was published [...] ...|$|R

It provides a summary of the infuences (people, places, books etc.) which have informed my thinking, working practices and methods with traditional and contemporary digital typographic tools. It explores personal thoughts and refections on typefaces, papers, colours, inks and presses; and, how these interact within the process confnes of the craft-based letterpress printing environment. For the reader, it records my workshop space and equipment, along with the ideals of craft working within the limits of the available materials. As a fine press printer/typographer, some clues are given on my own beliefs on the subject of being a practicing craftsman and the methods which can be practised in the pursuit of high standards of composition and presswork.

5000|$|The HiPo {{engine was}} {{engineered}} to increase performance and high-RPM reliability over standard 289 fare. It had solid lifters with hotter cam timing; 10.5:1 compression; a dual point, centrifugal advance distributor; smaller combustion chamber heads with cast spring cups and screw-in studs; low-restriction exhaust manifolds; and a bigger, manual-choke 595 CFM carburetor (the standard 289-4V was 480 CFM). The water pump, fuel pump, and alternator/generator pulleys were altered, fewer vanes, extra spring, and larger diameter, respectively; to help handle the higher engine speeds. Even the HiPo’s fan was unique. Bottom-end improvements included a flaw-free selected standard block, thicker {{main bearing caps}} and crankshaft damper/balancer, larger-diameter rod bolts, a crankshaft made from 80% nodular iron {{as opposed to the}} regular items at 40%, all were checked for correct 'nodularity' by polishing an area of the rear counterweight and comparing that surface using a magnification arrangement against a picture datum, increased crankshaft counterweighting to compensate for the heavier connecting rod big ends, the increased external counter weighting at the front was split between the crankshaft damper and a supplementary counterweight place adjacent to the <b>front</b> main bearing <b>journal</b> (all designed to reduce the 'bending moment' in the crankshaft at high-rpm), all for high-rpm reliability. The HiPo carried SAE gross ratings of [...] at 6,000 rpm and 312 lbft Nm at 3,400 rpm. About 25,000 were manufactured at CEP1 between March 1963 and June 1967.|$|R
40|$|International audienceEven {{in small}} numbers, {{fractures}} must be carefullyconsidered for the geological disposal of radioactivewastes. They critically enhance diusivity, speed upsolute transport, extend mixing fronts and, in turn,modify the physicochemical conditions of reactivityaround possible storage sites. Fractures occur at se-veral {{places in the}} cement surrounding the containersand in the Excavation Damaged Zones (EDZ) of thegalleries. They even occur in clays like in the FrenchCallovo-Oxfordian formation mostly because of the de-saturation conditions induced in the operational timeof the galleries. Numerous studies in various elds (e. g. radioactivewaste storage, CO 2 sequestration, geothermal storage,hydrothermal alteration) have shown that fracturescannot be simply integrated within an equivalent po-rous medium with a simple enhancement of its petro-physical properties (porosity and permeability). Frac-tures cannot either be accurately identied and fullydeterministic modeling approaches are precluded. We propose a combined numerical and experimentalapproach to determine the influence on reactivity oftypical fracture patterns classically found in radioac-tive waste applications. We investigate the possibilityto apply simplied modeling frameworks on the basisof some key properties :(i) transport is mostly diusive and much faster inthe fractures than in the porous matrix [1],(ii) reactivity occurs predominantly in the matrix be-cause of the large {{surface to volume ratio}} favorableto dissolution/precipitation processes,(iii) reactivity within the surrounding matrix is atequilibrium, or equivalently much faster thanthe diusive transport. Reactivity is assumedtransport-limited rather than rate-limited. Based on the separation of the fracture and ma-trix domains, we develop a reactive transport mo-del with diering diusion conditions in the fractureand in the matrix, appropriate flow-rock interactionsat equilibrium in the matrix and fracture-matrix ex-change conditions at their interface. Using preferen-tially existing software, we propose simulation methodsthat comply with much faster diusion in the fracturethan in the matrix, and validate them against elemen-tary fracture structures and simplied reactivity. We intend to use the developed methods on dierentfracture structures to simulation reactivity over longperiods of time. We determine the possible relevanceof the most classical simplied frameworks for fracture-matrix including :(i) fully homogenized models with adapted porosity,permeability and surface to volume ratio to reco-ver localization eects,(ii) models with isolated fractures within "innite ma-trix" assuming implicitly the localization of reac-tivity in the immediate vicinity of the fracture [2],(iii) double porosity models characterized by single ormultiple exchange coecients[3]. Following the outcome of the numerical simulations,we will investigate experimentally the most critical li-mitation of reactivity. It might a priori be either thefracture to matrix exchange law especially if fractureis desaturated and matrix saturated. Within the radioactive waste framework, we aim atincluding fractures in the safety assessment workflow. We intend to determine to which extent fractures faci-litate the access to reactive surfaces, the increase of thebulk reactivity, the corrosion potential and the pertur-bation of the chemical conditions. We frame as much aspossible the reference simulations in realistic physicaland chemical conditions including the main operatio-nal phases of the radioactive waste repository. Resultswill be reported as comprehensive evolution scenarios. References[1] D. Roubinet, J. R. Dreuzy, and D. M. Tartakovsky.

40|$|This Special Issue of Econometric Reviews (ER) is {{a tribute}} to Esfandiar Maasoumi for his longstandingcontributions to the {{econometrics}} profession as an outstanding researcher, a revered teacher andsupervisor, and a journal editor of three decades, all of which manifests his extraordinary devotion tothe discipline of econometrics and to its growing community of students and scholars. Essie, as he isuniversally known to his friends, colleagues, and the international community, took on the editorshipof ER in 1987. At that point, as (very) senior members of the profession will remember, the journal hada paperback cover, no formal typesetting, only two small issues a year, and {{was no more than a}} reviewjournal. Much has changed in the intervening years. ER is now one of the top ve core journals in econometricswith a distinguished editorial board, a strong track record of path-breaking publications, and the backingof a major publishing house. As editor, Essie has guided the path of ER through these changes and builta publishing culture that has brought ER into the <b>front</b> rank of <b>journals.</b> In an age where many journaleditor communications read like automated mechanical exercises, Essie’s editorial letters show sensitivityto authors, empathy for the research eortthat has gone into a paper, and an understanding of its subject,history, and motivation. This Special Issue honors Essie for his sustained guidance of ER over the past three decades, for hisscholarship and learning that have contributed to our knowledge of econometrics and its limitations,and for his unwavering support for the econometrics community. Thanks to its many contributors, thisissue has an impressive range of new research that covers many of the ongoing areas of econometrics,including Essie’s own past and recent work. Essie’s long career began as a lecturer in econometrics at the University of Birmingham in the UnitedKingdom as he was nishing his PhD at the London School of Economics under Denis Sargan in 1977. In 1978, Essie moved to the United States, rst to the University of Southern California. After spellsteaching at Iowa, Indiana, and Southern Methodist Universities, he joined Emory University, where hecurrently serves as Arts and Sciences Distinguished Professor. Over his career, Essie has collaboratedand coauthored with an unusually large number of researchers across the discipline, many of whomhave joined us with contributions in enthusiastic support of this Special Issue of ER...|$|R
40|$|Esta tesis {{doctoral}} es una investigación cuantitativa y cualitativa, descriptiva y analítica, basada en el método de análisis de contenido, que tiene por objeto de estudio el contenido que los periodistas profesionales españoles difunden en Twitter. El propósito del estudio es describir ese contenido, analizarlo e inferir de ello determinadas tendencias. Se pretende hallar en tales tendencias indicaciones relativas a la consideración del papel de Twitter por parte de los periodistas en el proceso de cambio general que experimenta el periodismo en el marco de la Red. Ello podría ayudar a advertir indicios de actividad innovadora en la Red por parte de los autores de los tuits que forman el corpus de la investigación. En la investigación se utiliza el método de análisis de contenido desarrollado por Berelson, Holsti y Krippendorff introduciendo algunas adaptaciones metodológicas y técnicas al aplicarlo a un objeto de estudio que se da en una determinación tecnológica muy distinta a la usual {{en el momento}} que fue creado aquel método: las redes sociales de internet. Por ello, la tesis pretende aportar algunas innovaciones metodológicas al respecto que puedan ajustar las metodologías establecidas en el estudio de los medios de comunicación de masas a las nuevas y cambiantes realidades que presentan las redes sociales de internet en el contexto y evolución de la Web 2. 0. La hipótesis principal propone que los periodistas españoles publican en Twitter contenido de distinta naturaleza según trabajen en medios masivos o en cibermedios. La diferencia denota distintos posicionamientos respecto al papel de Internet en las tareas periodísticas. Tales tendencias implican prioridades distintas en el abordaje de la actualidad, así como determinadas concepciones de la profesión y la Red. El trabajo de campo alcanza el análisis de 3. 500 tuits y 350 portadas de periódicos, que corresponden, los primeros, a dos muestras formadas por 20 cuentas de Twitter de otros tantos periodistas, y las segundas, a una muestra compuesta de cinco diarios de referencia publicados en Barcelona y Madrid. El seguimiento de las muestras ha sido realizado durante siete días, no consecutivos y en semanas escalonadas, lo que supone un contexto de actualidad comprendido en el marco temporal de siete semanas. Las conclusiones de la tesis apuntan a la relación entre el periodismo español de ahora y las expectativas de innovación del mismo en los nuevos escenarios de la Red. The actual {{doctoral thesis}} is a quantitative and qualitative, descriptive and analytic research, based in the content analysis method, whose object is the content that professional spanish journalists spread through Twitter. The purpose {{of this research is}} describying that content, analyzing it and deduce from it certain tendences. The aim is to find in them data referring to the way how journalists considere Twitter’s role amid the general change process that journalism is suffering in the Web frame. Tendences and data could help to find traces of innovating activity in the Web shown by the senders of tweets analyzed from the research corpus. In this research the content analysis method developed by Berelson, Holsti and Krippendorff is used, introducing some methodological and technical adaptations {{due to the fact that}} the object of study is given in a dramatically different technological determination that the prevailing in the time when analysis content method was created: the internet’s social networks. For that reason this thesis would introduce some methodological innovations on that subject that could update the established methodologies used in the study of mass media communications and adapt them to the new and changing realities shown by the internet’s social networks in the frame and evolution of the Web 2. 0. Tha main hypothesis of the research proposes that the spanish journalists publish on Twitter diferent nature of content either they work in mass media or cybermedia. That difference indicates different stances concerning the role of Internet in newsmaking. These stances mean different priorities in the approach of current affairs, just like certain considerations on the journalism and the Net. The field work includes an analysis of 3. 500 tweets and 350 <b>journals</b> <b>front</b> pages, belonging either to two samples composed by 20 Twitter accounts corresponding to the same amount of journalists and one sample composed by five reference daily newspapers published in Barcelona and Madrid. The following of these samples has been carried out during seven days, non consecutive and in staggered weeks, what means a frame of seven weeks period of current issues. The summation of the thesis shows a relation between the current journalism as is practiced in Spain and the innovation expectations in the new scenes in the Net...|$|R
