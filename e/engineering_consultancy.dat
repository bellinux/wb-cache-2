40|$|Management {{research}} has been focusing on creating knowledge management solutions funded by and destined for large technology and <b>engineering</b> <b>consultancies.</b> Subsequently, smaller consultancies, which fall under the SME category, have little research that supports the enhancement of different practices through which the flow of knowledge that gets into their organizations is managed. This thesis comes {{as an extension of}} Ojanen, et al. (2011), which presents the importance of the impact of knowledge acquisition and utilization in technology and <b>engineering</b> <b>consultancies</b> (TECs) on innovativeness. As a result, this thesis starts by exploring and identifying the different knowledge dissemination practices used in SME TECs, from the existing literature. The impact of these practices on the ability of SME TECs to innovate is then deduced. The impact is measured through a framework that is built from the combination of two existing frameworks; the first measures innovativeness, while the second categorizes the main factors that are involved in the process of knowledge dissemination. The aim of this thesis is to identify the different knowledge dissemination practices which improve the innovativeness capability in small and medium sized technology and <b>engineering</b> <b>consultancies.</b> Interviews were conducted with employees in managerial positions working in SME TECs in Finland. A questionnaire was sent to these companies as well. The results confirmed the existence and the importance of the impact of several knowledge dissemination practices on innovativeness in SME TECs...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, both {{economic}} geographers and innovation scholars have paid considerable attention to knowledge-intensive-business-services (KIBS) and professional service firms (PSFs). Both communities have also shown {{a strong interest}} in knowledge and 'knowledge bases'. Considering architecture to be based on symbolic and synthetic knowledge, and engineering to be based on analytical and synthetic knowledge, and using a panel dataset, this article examines the different geographies of performance among architecture practices and <b>engineering</b> <b>consultancies</b> active in the UK construction industry. We find that architecture practices are significantly more concentrated in inner London, whereas the <b>engineering</b> <b>consultancies</b> are much more dispersed. Locating in inner London provides significant financial benefits to architects but not to engineers. Ultimately, the various drivers of performance are rather different, with a Christallerian logic applying to architects but not to engineers. We consider that different knowledge bases are fundamental to understanding these differences between architects and engineers and KIBS/PSFs more generally. © The Author (2012).
