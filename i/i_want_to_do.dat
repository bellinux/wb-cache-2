I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. What <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E
