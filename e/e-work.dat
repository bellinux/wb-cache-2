In addition {{to the need for}} human interaction with the emerging systems that are typically complex and not well understood (in terms of their internal mechanisms) by their human users, imagine the additional workload, confusion, and cost when those systems keep changing. KISS is a central principle for effective collaborative <b>e-Work.</b> This principle states that systems must be as complex as needed in their cyber sides, as long as the <b>e-Work</b> support system is enabled to work autonomously, in parallel to and supportive of humans, and subject to the humans’ inputs and instructions. At the same time, for the users, the system must be the simplest to comprehend and operate, in order to minimize the need for repeated and costly human retraining.|$|E
5000|$|FTT [...] {{addresses}} fault-tolerant, feed-forward collaborative {{control of}} distributed processes. The {{goal of the}} FTT principle is to enable better efficiency and reliability from a network of weak agents (e.g., micro- and nano-sensors) rather than a single strong agent. FTT implies that an optimized team of collaborative agents generally yields better results compared to more powerful but individual agents. The latter may fail, and without backup, the system risks failure. The [...] and availability of system is improved through application of multiple redundant agents. Fault tolerance relates {{to the structure of}} a collaborative <b>e-Work</b> system. The combination of the FTT and CEDP principles extend into resilience by teaming frameworks [...] that enable the formation, re-configuration, and operation of <b>e-Work</b> systems via “disruption-prone agents” that achieve higher resilience than an equivalent system of “flaw-less/more reliable” agents.|$|E
5000|$|BM [...] {{implies that}} an <b>e-Work</b> {{system with a}} system with “mismatched” {{individuals}} is always outperformed by an equivalent system with “best-matched” individuals. The growing complexity and dynamic behavior of systems along with competitive and globalized markets have gradually transformed traditional centralized systems into distributed networks of <b>e-Work</b> systems. These systems, regardless of context and application, have a property in common: They all involve certain types of interactions (collaborative, competitive, or both) among their distributed individuals—from clusters of sensors and machines to complex networks of computers, intelligent robots, humans, and enterprises. Having this common property, such systems may encounter common challenges in terms of suboptimal interactions and thus poor performance, caused by potential mismatch between individuals. BM provides the PRISM taxonomy of best matching 12, a set of concepts, models, and frameworks for systematic analysis, taxonomy, analogical and structural assessment of matching processes, specification, modeling, and real-time optimization of matching processes in distributed manufacturing, supply, and service networks.|$|E

The State had been spatially transformed during the “Celtic Tiger ” era with (sub) urban sprawl, fuelled by Ireland’s chronic car dependency, a feature of everyday life. Commuting to and from work increased noise and air pollution, traffic congestion and contributed considerably to carbon emissions augmenting globally negative anthropogenic climate change. In an apparent shift in transport policy, the government published Smarter Travel in 2007 where more environmentally sustainable modes of transport, such as walking, cycling and public transport, were encouraged to combat the country’s unusually high levels of car dependency. An essential feature of the Smarter Travel initiative was telework (<b>e-Working).</b> Working from home has the potential to reduce, or eliminate, the daily commute to and from work and was regarded by policymakers as a crucial element in reducing Ireland’s unsustainable patterns of mobility whilst continuing the pursuit of unhindered economic growth. However, telework remains marginalised in business terms and lacks the regulation and guidelines essential to legitimise it for employers and employees that wish to work from home. A neo-liberal approach to the practice adopted by policymakers is evident and in the absence of legislation employers retain sole discretionary decision making powers over telework schemes and home working conditions. Indeed, many key decision makers fail to appreciate or recognise the potential benefits that may accrue from telework, which is leading to ad hoc and disorganised arrangements to the detriment of this method of working.

50|$|Collaborative Control Theory (CCT) is a {{collection}} of principles and models for supporting the effective design of collaborative <b>e-Work</b> systems. Beyond human collaboration, advances in information and communications technologies, artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, and cyber physical systems have enabled cyber-supported collaboration in highly distributed organizations of people, robots, and autonomous systems. The fundamental premise of CCT is: Without effective augmented collaboration by cyber support, working in parallel to and in anticipation of human interactions, the potential of emerging activities such as e-Commerce, virtual manufacturing, telerobotics, remote surgery, building automation, smart grids, cyber-physical infrastructure, precision agriculture, and intelligent transportation systems cannot be fully and safely materialized. CCT addresses the challenges and emerging solutions of such cyber-collaborative systems, with emphasis on issues of computer-supported and communication-enabled integration, coordination and augmented collaboration. CCT is composed of eight design principles: (1) Collaboration Requirement Planning (CRP); (2) <b>e-Work</b> Parallelism (EWP); (3) Keep It Simple, System (KISS); (4) Conflict/Error Detection and Prevention (CEDP); (5) Fault Tolerance by Teaming (FTT); (6) Association/Dissociation (AD); (7) Dynamic Lines of Collaboration (DLOC); (8) Best Matching (BM).|$|E

5000|$|CEDP [...] enables dynamic diagnosis, prognosis, and {{resolution}} of conflicts between entities in a collaborative <b>e-Work</b> space. CEDP {{implies that the}} larger the rate of interactions, the larger the number of active collaborating parties and thus the rates of conflicts and errors. A conflict {{is defined as the}} inconsistencies between the goals, plans, tasks, and activities of two or more individuals. An error, on the other hand, refers to any input, output, or intermediate result which does not meet the predefined specifications, expectations, or comparison objectives of a system. Errors and conflicts are different but related. The key difference is that an error may involve only one individual, while for a conflict to occur, at least two individuals must be involved. An error may cause a conflict (or a series of conflicts) and vice versa. CEDP consists of a set of functions for detecting existing errors/conflict, classifying the observation as an error or a conflict, determining the exact point of error/conflict in the system, determining the type, magnitude, time, and cause of the out-of-control status, analyzing, predicting, and preventing propagation of the error/conflict, mitigating the negative effects of the error/conflict, and handling exceptions (constructive deviations from the process).|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn organisation-based work groups, experts often {{approach}} {{problem solving}} by combining explicit domain knowledge and information with their practice-based knowledge {{in ways that}} are largely driven by their specific work context. In collaborative ework, such common grounds for decision making offered by a shared work context hardly exist. Designing context-aware systems to support decision making in collaborative <b>e-work,</b> thus, poses a huge challenge because of the inherent difficulty in establishing a shared context of work and users adequate for supporting cohesive collaboration and knowledge sharing among experts across organisational and geographical boundaries. To address this problem, this paper proposes a framework, which incorporates an explicit model of context between the domain model of an application and the activity landscapes of various individuals, workgroups and organisations collaborating across borders, and between these landscapes and the knowledge resource space model in an intelligent ubiquitous environment. We argue that an explicit context model will enable a clearer understanding of the way experts integrate knowledge during problem solving, and thus provide common grounds for decision making and knowledge sharing during collaborative <b>e-work.</b> We demonstrate how a system based on our proposed model can be applied to support the reactive, collaborative and proactive modes of decision support in collaborative <b>e-work...</b>|$|E

Specifically, collaborative <b>e-Work</b> is revolutionizing the capabilities of e-Business, e-Production, and e-Service; by building upon existing and well-established work, business and service models, theories, and solutions and merging them with the new electronic world, they are augmenting their abilities to meet customer’s needs and address the ever-changing landscape of manufacturing and services. ^ The focus of this research is an investigation into the use of a Best-Matching methodology for streamlining, leveraging and matching information supply and demand to enable collaborative <b>e-Work</b> decision-making. The Best-Matching methodology developed provides the foundation for the creation of near-optimal and computational efficient heuristics and protocols to support <b>e-Work</b> activities.

40|$|<b>E-Work</b> expands in {{the rapid}} {{evolution}} of intelligent technologies for interaction, communication, and collaboration. Enabled by <b>e-Work,</b> networked agents can provide services collaboratively to interdependent clients, i. e., the Network-to-Network (N 2 N) services. The complex dependencies in networks challenge agents to maintain efficiency in their distributed yet collaborative operations. To gain systematic understanding of N 2 N services in <b>e-Work,</b> {{and to improve}} the operations of N 2 N services, the Dynamic Lines of Collaboration (DLOC) model is proposed, developed, explored and validated in this dissertation. ^ DLOC model captures {{the dynamics of the}} changing structure of a service team while performing inter-related services on and throughout a network of clients. The theoretical foundation of DLOC lies in complex network theory, scheduling theory, and collaborative control theory. Based on theoretical analysis of DLOC, three protocols are designed to effectively control the collaboration of agents: (1) Asynchronous Collaboration Requirement Planning (ACRP) is used to design the configuration of a team of agents prepared to handle collaborative tasks. (2) Centrality-Based depot Allocation (CBA) protocol efficiently aligns the service team with the client network to provide better coverage of services. (3) Neuroplasticity-inspired scheduling protocols determine the response operations to minimize the total latency of all tasks. Three classes of critical performance metrics, i. e., quality, time and cost, are designed to evaluate the N 2 N services controlled by the protocols. To validate the DLOC model and protocols, a new version of Teamwork Integration Evaluator (TIE) software - TIE/DLOC is developed. The evaluator is able to analyze the structures of a client network and a service team, then apply different control protocols to the <b>e-Work</b> system, and finally evaluate several protocols based on their performance in N 2 N services. ^ In this dissertation, the applications of the DLOC model and control protocols are discussed, experimented, and evaluated. The first set of experiments is on the configuration design of Reconfigurable End-Effectors (REEs) for automated harvesting systems. Different configurations of REE components provide various grasp qualities on diverse targets. ACRP is used to determine the configuration network of REE so that the quality and yield of harvesting operations for various vegetables are optimized. The second set of experiments is on the collaborative response operations during disruptions in the critical Cyber-Physical Infrastructure (CPI). When disruptions occur in a CPI, cascading failures may lead to catastrophic damage. The disruption response operations are crucial, because if the responders can provide the correct service to the right components of CPI at the right time, failures and damages can be limited and kept within a relatively small range. CBA and neuroplasticity-inspired scheduling protocols developed in this research facilitate the allocation of responders and online task scheduling to minimize the latency before CPI components are repaired. This experiment is based on both simulated CPI networks and real networks of water supply and power grid. Other potential applications of the DLOC model and control protocols are discussed, including: collaborative visual analytics, heterogeneous robotic material handling, and quality assurance planning in manufacturing. By applying the DLOC model and TIE/DLOC software on the aforementioned <b>e-Work</b> systems for experimental studies, the performance under different control protocols are obtained. The experimental results show that there is a significant performance improvement by the control protocols developed in this research compared with other conventional design, allocation, and scheduling protocols in practice. The improvement implies that through network awareness, i. e., by exploiting the structures of both the client and the server networks for the control of N 2 N services a higher level of collaborative intelligence can be achieved. Based on this dissertation, future research can advance the effectiveness of emerging <b>e-Work</b> systems with additional protocols and decision dimensions. ...|$|E
