40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the validity of power measurement techniques during the jump squat (JS) utilizing various combinations of a force plate and linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> (LPT) devices. Nine men with at least 6 months of prior resistance training experience participated in this acute investigation. One repetition maximums (1 RM) in the squat were determined, followed by JS testing under 2 loading conditions (30 % of 1 RM [JS 30] and 90 % of 1 RM [JS 90]). Three different techniques were used simultaneously in data collection: (a) 1 linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> (1 -LPT); (b) 1 linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> and a force plate (1 -LPT + FP); and (c) 2 linear <b>position</b> <b>transducers</b> and a force place (2 -LPT + FP). Vertical velocity-, force-, and power-time curves were calculated for each lift using these methodologies and were compared. Peak force and peak power were overestimated by 1 -LPT in both JS 30 and JS 90 compared with 2 -LPT + FP and 1 -LPT + FP (p ≤ 0. 05). Peak power determined by 2 -LPT + FP was significantly higher than that determined by 1 -LPT + FP under the JS 90 loading condition. Peak vertical velocity determined by 2 -LPT + FP was significantly lower than that determined by either 1 -LPT and 1 -LPT + FP in JS 90. This investigation indicates that peak power and the timing of power output in the jump squat varies according to the measurement technique utilized. The 1 -LPT methodology is not a valid means of determining power output in the jump squat. Furthermore, the 1 -LPT + FP method may not accurately represent power output in free weight movements that involve a significant amount of horizontal motion...|$|R

Force, velocity and power patterns were averaged over the push-off phase using accelerometry, linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> and a method based on key positions measurements during squat jump, and compared to force plate measurements. Concurrent validity analyses indicated very good agreement with the reference method (CV= 6. 4 – 14. 5 %).

The validity of measurements was equivalent for all tested methods (r= 0. 87 – 0. 98). Bland-Altman plots showed a lower agreement for velocity and power compared to force. Mean force, velocity and power were reliable for all methods (ICC= 0. 84 – 0. 99), especially for Samozino’s method (CV= 2. 7 – 8. 6 %).

40|$|High speed tilting {{trains are}} a smart {{solution}} to guarantee shorter travelling time {{with respect to}} conventional trains without the need of major investments to renew the railway network. A design issue associated to the train carbody tilting {{is the need to}} keep the pantograph centred with respect to the catenary that runs aligned to the rails. The solution used in most tilting trains is to mechanically link the pantograph to the bogie: it is a simple design concept, but the mechanical structure connecting the pantograph to the bogie takes away useful space from the carbody interior. For this reason, a solution used in recent tilting trains is to connect the pantograph to the carbody roof and implement a position control system {{in order to keep the}} pantograph centred with the catenary. This paper specifically addresses the case of a pantograph position control performed by two servovalve controlled, spring centred hydraulic actuators mounted in opposite pair, each equipped with a <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> for <b>position</b> control and system monitoring. The monitoring system presently implemented in this servocontrol detects the servocontrol failures, but in case the two <b>position</b> <b>transducers</b> provide a conflicting information, it is not always able to sort out which of the two transducers is failed. As a result, a <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> failure always leads to disabling the tilting function and reducing the train speed, and then to remove and replace the entire pantograph, because the functionality of each individual transducer can only be checked at shop level. An advanced diagnostic system was hence developed that can both identify the presence of a failure and recognize which of the two <b>position</b> <b>transducers</b> is the failed one. In case of a transducer failure is thus possible to isolate the failed transducer and keep the pantograph position control operational, thereby retaining the train tilting function. A further merit of the advanced diagnostic system is the reduction of maintenance time and costs because the failed transducer can be replaced without removing the entire pantograph from the train. The merits of the presented health management system were assessed running several simulations of a model representing the dynamic response of a train pantograph. These simulations were performed, both in normal and in failed conditions, in order to assess the ability of the implemented advanced diagnostic system to properly identify a failure of one or both <b>position</b> <b>transducers</b> and to avoid false alarms. The transducers health management process described in this paper was first tested simulating different tracks over the whole range of normal operating and environmental conditions, and appropriate limits for the failure detection were established to prevent false alarms. Then, all types of transducers failures and malfunctionings were injected and the ability of the health management system to recognize them was positively assessed. The results of the entire simulation campaign proved the robustness of the proposed transducers health management system and a confidence was hence gained in its ability to detect a transducer failure or malfunctioning with minimum risk of false alarms or missed failures. The implementation of such health management system on a tilting train will thus enable the tilting operation to continue after a failure of a pantograph lateral position sensor, hence allowing the train to maintain its high speed travel for the remainder of the ride. Furthermore, the positive recognition of a transducer failure would greatly ease the maintenance operation, since the failed transducer can be replaced without the need of removing the entire pantograph assembly from the train roo...|$|R
40|$|Tilting {{trains are}} {{provided}} with the ability of rotating their carbodies of several degrees {{with respect to the}} bogies about the longitudinal axis of the train. This permits a train to travel at a high speed while maintaining an acceptable passenger ride quality with respect to the lateral acceleration, and the consequent lateral force, received by the passengers when the train travels on a curved track at a speed in excess of the balance speed built into the curve geometry. When the carbody is tilted with respect to the bogie, the train pantograph needs to remain centered with respect to the overhead catenary, which is aligned with the track. The conventional solution is to mechanically link the pantograph to the bogie, but recent tilting trains have the pantograph connected to the carbody roof while a position servoloop continuously control the pantograph position such to keep it centered with the catenary. The merit of this design is to allow a gain of the useful volume inside the carbody. The pantograph position servoloop uses two position sensors providing a redundant position information to close the pantograph feedback loop and perform system monitoring. The monitoring functions presently implemented in pantograph position controls are able to detect the servocontrol failures, but in case of conflicting information from the two <b>position</b> <b>transducers</b> they are not always able to sort out which of the two transducer is failed because some failures of the <b>position</b> <b>transducers</b> cannot be detected by simply looking at the output signals of the transducer. As a result, if a difference between the output signals of the two <b>position</b> <b>transducers</b> is detected, the tilting function is disabled and the train speed is reduced. Also, the entire pantograph is then removed and replaced because the functionality of each individual transducer can only be checked at shop level. Developing better diagnostic techniques for the pantograph position control system have been encouraged by the train companies, but no work on this subject has so far been performed. A research activity was hence conducted by the Authors, that was aimed at developing an advanced diagnostic system that can both identify the presence of a failure and recognize which of the two <b>position</b> <b>transducers</b> is the failed one. In case of a transducer failure it is thus possible to isolate the failed transducer and keep the pantograph position control operational, thereby retaining the train tilting function.

Twelve moderately resistance-trained men participated in three deadlift sessions. During the first, 1 RM was assessed; during the second, load-velocity profiles were recorded with six loads (65 % to 90 % 1 RM) using a linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> recording at 1000 Hz; and during the third, minimal velocity thresholds (MVT) were recorded from the velocity of the last repetition during sets to volitional fatigue with 70 % and 80 % 1 RM with a linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> recording at 1000 Hz. Regression was then used to generate individualised load-velocity profiles and the MVT was used as a cut-off value from which to predict deadlift 1 RM. In general, velocity reliability was poor to moderate. More importantly, predicted deadlift 1 RMs were significantly and meaningfully less than actual deadlift 1 RMs (p < 0. 05, d = 1. 03 – 1. 75). The main practical application that should be taken from the results of this study is that individualized load-velocity profiles should not be used to predict deadlift 1 RM.

PURPOSE: To determine the validity of a 3 -dimensional video markerless motion capture system for determining barbell kinetics and kinematics. METHODS: Two 3 -D video cameras sampling at 30 Hz and mounted {{on the top of a}} power rack were interfaced with a self-contained computer and software system, and operated with a touch screen (EliteForm, Lincoln, NE). For laboratory comparison purposes, a ceiling–mounted linear <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> (Unimeasure, Corvallis, OR) was attached via a tether to the barbell. Data from the <b>position</b> <b>transducer</b> was sampled at 1000 Hz using a BioPac data acquisition system (Goleta, CA).

One weight-trained male subject (age = 25 yrs, hgt = 1. 75 m, BW = 82. 6 kg, 1 RM = 161. 0 kg) performed the barbell bench press exercise for 10 sets x 1 repetition at 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 % 1 RM loads using maximal acceleration during the concentric phase. Dependent variables included peak (PV) and X̅ velocity (MV) and peak (PP) and X̅ power (MP). Linear regressions between lab-derived and 3 -D video-derived data provided correlation coefficients, and regression slopes (b). Bland-Altman plots were used to determine X̅ differences, from which effect sizes (Cohen’s D) and % error for the 3 -D camera system was determined.
