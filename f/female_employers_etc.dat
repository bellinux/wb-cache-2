40|$|This {{study is}} a sociolinguistic study about request made by male and <b>female</b> <b>employer</b> to {{the male and female}} {{employees}} and also male and female employees to male and <b>female</b> <b>employers.</b> The writer is interested in investigating request since request can be used differently by both employers and employees. She also wants to know the types of request used by the male and <b>female</b> <b>employer</b> to the male and female employees and male and female employees to male and <b>female</b> <b>employers.</b> The writer used Ervin-Tripp?s theory of request as the main theory to classify the types of request. To find the most frequently used types of request used by both male and <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> and both male and female employees, the writer used descriptive quantitative approach. The writer found that both male and <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> mostly used the same types of request expressions to both male and female employees. However, the writer found various types of request used by both male and female employees to both male and <b>female</b> <b>employers.</b> The result of this research showed that both male and <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> mostly used bald imperatives as their types of request, both to their male and female employees. However, both male and female employees used various types of request, both to male and <b>female</b> <b>employer.</b> Thus, the result might prove that the social status and gender may have influenced the types of request made by both male and <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> and both male and female employees...|$|R

30|$|Male {{employers}} and professional own-account workers {{in many developing}} countries enjoy a particularly large earnings premium compared to formal employees, while <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> and professionals do not. In fact, our estimates suggest that <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> and professionals in low and high income countries pay a statistically significant penalty compared to employees, while in middle income countries estimated penalties are statistically insignificant. These gender differences are consistent with the hypothesis that women are more willing to accept lower wages as compensating earnings differentials for the flexibility of self-employment.|$|R

40|$|Using a {{case study}} of interwar Queensland, this paper {{examines}} white <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> and self-employed women, groups whose role in the economy rarely attracts sustained attention from historians. After offering a brief explanation for this lack of attention, the paper explores four aspects of the experiences of these women: the types of businesses they operated, how and why they acquired those businesses, the income they generated, and the relations between <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> and their staff. All four aspects demonstrate the central influence of gender, but they also suggest a degree of flexibility in the gendered patterns of economic activity and female proprietorsâ ability to benefit from that flexibility...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a sociolinguistic study about request made by Chinese Indonesian females to both their younger and older servants. The writer is {{interested}} in investigating request since request can be used differently by her surrounding. The writer wants to know the type of request used by Chinese Indonesian <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> to their younger and older servants. Then, the writer also wants to know {{the factors that influence}} the use of the type of requests, whether it could be the power distance or the age of the addressee. The writer predicted that there are some differences in making requests to the younger and older servants. Here, the writer used Ervinn-Tripp?s theory of request to classify the type of request. The writer also uses structured interview as the way in getting the data. To find the most frequently used type of request used by Chinese Indonesia <b>female</b> <b>employers,</b> the writer used quantitative approach, whereas to interpret the data, the writer used structured and unstructured interview. The writer found that there are no differences in the frequency of the type of request used by Chinese Indonesian <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> both to younger and older servants. The result of this research showed that most of Chinese Indonesian females used bald imperatives as their type of request, both to their younger and older servants. However, Chinese Indonesia <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> used bald imperatives with the use of word tolong, sorry, hedges and use of address term to show their respect and another social factors that could not be analyzed. Thus, the result might prove that the power distance has influenced more to the type of request than the age of the addressee...|$|R

5000|$|Statistical {{discrimination}} {{is an economic}} theory of racial or gender inequality based on stereotypes. According to this theory, inequality may exist and persist between demographic groups even when economic agents (consumers, workers, <b>employers,</b> <b>etc.)</b> are rational and non-prejudiced. This type of preferential treatment is labeled [...] "statistical" [...] because stereotypes may {{be based on the}} discriminated group's average behavior.|$|R

The second largest percentage of <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> as a percentage of female workers is 3% in Egypt. In Indonesia where 68% of women are self-employed and 38% of the labor force is composed of women, only 1% of these individuals are employers.|$|R

30|$|These figures {{can be put}} in {{perspective}} {{by looking at the}} relative male to female wages at the industry level, which are provided in the last column of Table  3. There are wide variations in relative wages by industry. For over half of the manufacturing industries in the sample, the unadjusted wage gap between men and women was at or above 50 % in {{one or both of the}} years under consideration. The wage ratio is also quite high in the three largest <b>female</b> <b>employers,</b> ranging between 1.46 in Food and Beverages, to 2.0 in Garments in 2006.The gender wage gap widened over time in industries such as Chemical Products (increased by more than 5 fold-this is the same industry that witnessed a nine-fold increase in its share of female employment), Electrical Equipment, Machinery and Equipment, Textiles and Wood Products, while it declined in some notable <b>female</b> <b>employers,</b> such as Garments, and Coke and Petroleum manufacturing.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} gender and corruption, controlling for country-specific heterogeneity in a panel framework. Using annual observations in a pooled setting (no country-fixed effects) confirms the positive link between the involvement of women in society {{and the absence of}} corruption. However, once country-fixed effects are acknowledged, only the share of <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> remains a positive and statistically meaningful correlate. Nevertheless, the derived magnitude is negligible in a global sample. Analyzing potential nonlinearities reveals that this effect is driven by African nations, where a one standard deviation increase in the share of <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> is related to a substantial decrease of corruption by 2. 5 index points (scale from zero to ten). Surprisingly, the link between the share of women in the labor force and the absence of corruption becomes negative once country unobservables are accounted for. Taken together, these findings cast doubt on a general, global relationship between gender and corruption...|$|R

30|$|Differences {{between male}} and <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> and own-account {{professionals}} are even more striking. In middle and upper income countries, male employers and professionals earn a premium compared to employees, while women pay a penalty. These results suggest that women may be more willing than men to accept a negative compensating earnings differential for self-employment, and that this phenomenon is more pronounced in high income countries.|$|R

25|$|The wide {{gap between}} male and female labor force {{participation}} rates and ratios, and the gap {{between male and}} <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> is indicative of gender inequality within the private sector of majority Muslim countries. However, numerous reasons may account for these outcomes such as weak education infrastructure for women, low levels of economic development, or simply capital-intensive resource development. The latter characteristic is probably given how many majority Muslim nations are net oil exporters.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{identifying}} the attitude-related barriers that older unemployed, jobseeking workers (50 +) face when they endeavor to reenter {{the labor market}} and to investigate employers’ attitudes and perceptions of older workers. Two studies were conducted. In study 1, interviews were undertaken with 26 unemployed persons and 24 representatives of other stakeholders, including social partners and officials representing the Social Insurance Agency (FK) and the Public Employment Service (AF). In study 2, the attitudes among private sector employers were studied by carrying out a questionnaire survey (N = 147). The interview results showed that many unemployed job seekers had experienced negative age-related attitudes among employers. This observation was supported by other stakeholders. Perceived attitudes to older workers and lack of updated competence were considered crucial. The questionnaire study showed a mixed picture concerning employer attitudes. There was a statistical difference between older (> 50 years) and younger employers; older employers believed that older women wanted competence development to a greater extent. There was also {{a significant difference between}} female and male employers’ opinions; <b>female</b> <b>employers,</b> in particular the older ones, assessed that older women wished competence development to a greater extent. These differences were not found with respect to views on older men. About half (52 %) of the employers had the opinion that {{there was no difference between}} older and younger employees with respect to the ability to cope with changes or learning new things. However, younger <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> (but not older <b>female</b> <b>employers)</b> considered that older employees had greater difficulties with changes or learning new things. It is concluded that negative attitudes to older workers with respect to competence development tend to be most common among younger employers...|$|R
25|$|A general {{economic}} {{idea is that}} if {{sales taxes}} are high enough, people start engaging in widespread tax evading activity (like buying over the Internet, {{pretending to be a}} business, buying at wholesale, buying products through an <b>employer</b> <b>etc.).</b> On the other hand, total VAT rates can rise above 10% without widespread evasion because of the novel collection mechanism. However, because of its particular mechanism of collection, VAT becomes quite easily the target of specific frauds like carousel fraud, which can be very expensive in terms of loss of tax incomes for states.|$|R

40|$|Using a {{longitudinal}} data set covering the period 1987 – 2000, the authors explore {{the impact of}} <b>female</b> <b>employers</b> and gender segregation on wages in Portugal. In the context of Becker’s (1957) taste for discrimination theory, they investigate whether the gender of a firm manager affects gender wage differences. They find that females benefit from higher wages in female-led firms than in male-led firms. Further, when females lead, the wage gap between female and male workers is reduced by 1. 5...|$|R
