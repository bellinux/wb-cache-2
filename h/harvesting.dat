5000|$|The plot of <b>Harvest</b> Moon DS Cute is {{different}} from that of <b>Harvest</b> Moon DS. In this version of the game, the player's mother sends a wish to the <b>Harvest</b> Goddess that you may be a successful farmer. The <b>Harvest</b> Goddess eventually determines the player has no work ethic, and tells the <b>Harvest</b> King what she thinks. The <b>Harvest</b> King angrily tells the <b>Harvest</b> Goddess she isn't trying hard enough, and she is slacking off in her old age. The <b>Harvest</b> Goddess then calls the <b>Harvest</b> King a [...] "big baldy", and is turned into stone. The <b>Harvest</b> Sprites defend the <b>Harvest</b> Goddess, which angers the <b>Harvest</b> King even more, and he sends the <b>Harvest</b> Sprites and the <b>Harvest</b> Goddess to another world as punishment. He then writes a letter to the player telling her if she works hard, he will return the <b>Harvest</b> Sprites and the <b>Harvest</b> Goddess. Basic gameplay remains unaltered between the two versions.|$|R

Public timber <b>harvests</b> decreased in all but four counties in the region. The volume decreases were particularly large on the Olympic Peninsula, in the Washington Cascades, and in coastal and southwest Oregon. Change in Public and Private Timber <b>Harvest.</b> The total change in timber <b>harvest</b> was affected by both the <b>harvest</b> from public lands and the <b>harvest</b> from privately owned lands. As Federal <b>harvests</b> declined, <b>harvests</b> from other ownerships could either moderate or exacerbate the change..

50|$|In Britain, thanks {{have been}} given for {{successful}} <b>harvests</b> since pagan times. <b>Harvest</b> festival is traditionally held on the Sunday near or of the <b>Harvest</b> Moon. This is the full Moon that occurs closest to the autumn equinox (22 or 23 September). The celebrations on this day usually include singing hymns, praying, and decorating churches with baskets of fruit and food in the festival known as <b>Harvest</b> Festival, <b>Harvest</b> Home, <b>Harvest</b> Thanksgiving or <b>Harvest</b> Festival of Thanksgiving.|$|R
40|$|Cranberries are <b>harvested</b> by {{two basic}} methods, dry <b>harvest</b> and water <b>harvest.</b> The dry <b>harvest</b> fruit is destined {{primarily}} for the fresh market while the water <b>harvested</b> fruit is processed. Growers manage cranberry plantings to facilitate these <b>harvest</b> methods and fruit uses. Ideally, the fruit are <b>harvested</b> at full maturity with good color (anthocyanin content) but prior to the fruit becoming over-ripe. Timing of <b>harvest</b> is important for fresh-market fruit so that the berries are sufficiently red but retain good storage quality, while fruit for the process market ideally has maximum color. Cranberry marketing companies produce ‘no color added’ products, so the color at <b>harvest</b> is of great importance in processed berries. Following the <b>harvest,</b> management practices focus on minimizing <b>harvest</b> stress and preparing the bogs for the dormant season. To minimize disease and weed infestations, leaf litter and fallen fruit are removed from the bogs...|$|R
40|$|In Maryland, {{commercial}} {{blue crab}} (Callinectes sapidus) <b>harvests</b> are monitored through mandatory, annual <b>harvest</b> reporting, but no monitoring exists for recreational fishers. This study used a large-scale mark-recapture program to assess relative exploitation between the recreational and commercial fishing sectors in 15 <b>harvest</b> reporting areas of Maryland, then incorporated movement information and extrapolated reported commercial <b>harvest</b> data to generate statewide estimates of recreational <b>harvest.</b> Results indicate spatial variation in recreational fishing, {{with a majority}} of recreational <b>harvests</b> coming from tributaries of the Western Shore and the Wye and Miles Rivers on the Eastern Shore. Statewide, recreational <b>harvest</b> has remained 8 % as large as commercial <b>harvest</b> despite management changes in 2008, and remains a larger proportion (12. 8 %) of male commercial <b>harvest.</b> In addition, this study provides detailed spatial information on recreational <b>harvest</b> and the first information on rates of exchange of male crabs among <b>harvest</b> reporting areas...|$|R

5|$|Traditionally, sales {{took place}} in the {{daffodil}} fields prior to <b>harvesting</b> the bulbs, but today sales are handled by Marketing Boards although still before <b>harvesting.</b> In the Netherlands there are special exhibition gardens for major buyers to view flowers and order bulbs, some larger ones may have more than a thousand narcissus varieties on display. While individuals can visit these gardens they cannot buy bulbs at retail, which are only available at wholesale, usually at a minimum of several hundredweight. The most famous display is at Keukenhof, although only about 100 narcissus varieties are on display there.|$|E
40|$|Commercial <b>harvest</b> of red {{sea urchins}} began in Washington state in 1971. <b>Harvests</b> peaked {{in the late}} 1980 s and have since {{declined}} substantially in Washington and {{other areas of the}} U. S. west coast. We studied effects of experimental <b>harvest</b> on red sea urchins in San Juan Channel (SJC), a marine reserve in northern Washing-ton. We recorded changes in density and size distribution of sea urchin populations resulting from three levels of experimental harvest: 1) annual size-selective <b>harvest</b> (simulating cur-rent commercial urchin <b>harvest</b> regulations), 2) monthly complete (non–size selective) <b>harvest,</b> and 3) no <b>harvest</b> (control) sites. We also examined re-colonization rates of <b>harvested</b> sites. The red sea urchin population in SJC is composed of an accumulation of large, old individuals. Juvenile urchins represent less than 1 % of the population. Lower and upper size limits for commercial <b>harvest</b> protect 5 % and 45 % of the population, respectively. Complete <b>harvest</b> reduced sea urchin densities by 95 %. Annual size-selective <b>harvest</b> significantly decreased sea urchin densities by 67 % in the first year and by 47 % in the second year. Two years of size-selective <b>harvest</b> significantly altered the size distribution of urchins, decreasing the density of legal-size urchins. Recolonization of <b>harvested</b> sites varied seasonally and occurred primarily through immigration of adults. Selective <b>harvest</b> sites were recolonized to 51 % and 38 % of original densities, respectively, six months after the first and second annual <b>harvests.</b> Yields declined substantially in the second year of size-selective <b>harvest</b> because of the fishing down of the population and because of low recolonization rates of <b>harvested</b> sites. We recommend that managers consider the potential efficacy of marine <b>harvest</b> refuges and reevaluate the existing upper and lower size limits for commercial <b>harvest</b> to improve long-term management of the sea urchin fishery in Washington...|$|R

5|$|At these lower prices, ice {{began to}} sell in {{considerable}} volumes, with the market moving beyond the wealthy elite to {{a wider range of}} consumers, to the point where supplies became overstretched. It was also being used by tradesmen to preserve perishable good, rather than for direct consumption. Tudor looked beyond his existing suppliers to Maine and even to <b>harvesting</b> from passing icebergs, but neither source proved practical. Instead, Tudor teamed up with Nathaniel Wyeth to exploit the ice supplies of Boston on a more industrial scale. Wyeth devised a new form of horse-pulled ice-cutter in 1825 that cut square blocks of ice more efficiently than previous methods. He agreed to supply Tudor from Fresh Pond in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reducing the cost of <b>harvesting</b> ice from 30 cents ($7.30) a ton (901kg) to only 10 cents ($2.40). Sawdust to insulate the ice was brought from Maine, at $16,000 ($390,000) a year.|$|E
5|$|Birbhum is a {{major centre}} of cottage industries. Perhaps the most notable cottage {{industry}} is a non-profit rural organisation named Amar Kutir. Other main industries in Birbhum are agriculture-based industries, textiles, forestry, arts and crafts. Sriniketan is noted for its dairy industry and as a forestry centre. Some of the notable forms of cottage industries of Birbhum include textile—especially cotton and locally harvested tussar silk, jute works, batik, kantha stitch, macramé (weaving by knotting threads), leather, pottery and terracotta, solapith, woodcarving, bamboo and cane craft, metal works and tribal crafts. There are 8,883 small and medium scale industries. Principal industries of the district include cotton and silk <b>harvesting</b> and weaving, rice and oilseed milling, lac <b>harvesting,</b> and metalware and pottery manufacture. Bakreshwar Thermal Power Station (210 MW x 3 + 210 MW x 2 under construction) is the only heavy industry in the district.|$|E

5|$|Commercial sealing was {{historically}} just {{as important}} an industry as whaling. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. The scale of seal <b>harvesting</b> decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced {{the length of the}} hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to <b>harvesting.</b> The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.|$|E
