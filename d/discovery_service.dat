2500|$|Pandora {{decided to}} be a consumer-oriented music <b>discovery</b> <b>service,</b> {{specifically}} a non-interactive radio station. [...] In the three months that ended October 31, 2011, advertising comprised 88% of Pandora's total revenues; a figure of 80% was reported for this metric in December 2013. [...] RPM (revenue per 1000s of hours) is determined based on CPMs (cost per thousand impressions). CPMs are largely dependent upon network effects and thus increase as a website scales and adds users. As such, Pandora's strategy {{in order to allow}} for widespread distribution was to offer a service unbundled from devices and transport. Pandora is currently working with system-on-chip manufacturers to embed its technologies on the chips they sell to consumer electronics manufacturers like Samsung, Sony, and Panasonic.|$|E

40|$|Resource {{discovery}} is a core function of e-learning. While initially confined to library environments, {{it has become}} pervasive, {{partly due to the}} advent of web-based searching and also service-oriented approach. The latter is the focus of this paper as resource <b>discovery</b> (web) <b>services</b> enable existing resources to be identified from a source (library) and re-purposed for educational purposes in other systems such as virtual learning environments. This paper describes the development of such resource <b>discovery</b> <b>services</b> developed as part of an initiative to pilot e-learning and a shared digital library infrastructure for Grid Computing training projects in Europe. The development is also related to a project funded by the UK Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) on publisher metadata interoperability. The resource <b>discovery</b> <b>services</b> correspond to an emerging international service-oriented framework for developing e-learning. This paper also provides an overview of the framework and the use-scenarios in which the resource <b>discovery</b> <b>services</b> have been deployed...|$|R

Although these relatively new <b>discovery</b> <b>services</b> have been widely adopted by libraries on a global basis, the ODI recommendations should assist with the further development of this industry. This article provides some background for the ODI, a summary of the published recommendations, and a call to action...|$|R

Resource <b>discovery</b> <b>services</b> now help users locate and retrieve information.

Independent of the approach used, resource <b>discovery</b> <b>services</b> can also help users organize newfound informa-tion so that they can refer to it without having to repeat the entire discovery process.
