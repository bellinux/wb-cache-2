His theory is, [...] "if an individual participates in their community they will earn an invested interest in their community. The community chewed the bubblegum, and many individuals [...] as though they were a part of its creation. This instills a sense of stewardship in one’s community". Even the robotics Team 1717, featured in the book The New Cool, is depicted in neon blue gum.|$|E

40|$|Cognition is a {{biological}} function, not a cultural invention. Our nervous systems detect, encode, and process information not because someone invented these capacities in antiquity, but because evolutionary forces shaped the organs that instantiate these biological functions. Cognition is the function that ensures a non-arbitrary relation between perception and action. Historically, psychologists {{have tended to}} overlook or downplay <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> biology and evolution when developing theories of cognitive functions, with the inevitable result that our theories have often provided inadequate predictions and explanations of cognitive phenomena, from basic inductive processes to higher cognition. Evolution and Basic Inductive Processes Consider first investigations of spatial learning in the rat. In one standard paradigm, a rat is placed on a central platform with alleys radiating out from the platform like spokes in a wheel. A cache of food is placed at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleys.</b> <b>The</b> maze is constructed such that the rat cannot see <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleys,</b> and air flow is directed such that no olfactory cues are present to guide the rat to the food. The rat is allowed to explore the maze. After it has found and consumed the food, the rat is removed and placed again on the platform, and <b>the</b> same <b>alley</b> re-baited. What will the rat do now? Reinforcement theory predicts that the rat will return to <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> where it previously found food because that choice was reinforced (see Hilgard & Bower, 1975, pp. 206 - 251).

5000|$|In 1686, Westerners {{were allowed}} to rent {{accommodations}} in the factory quarter to avoid <b>the</b> necessity <b>of</b> shuttling back to Pazhou each night. For the most part, the supercargos, their assistants, and the bookkeepers stayed at the factories, the crew—except for a few guards or those on shore leave—stayed with the ships, and the captains continued to ferry between the two. A Chinese comprador hired each factory's staff of Chinese servants and bought its provisions from local vendors; senior supercargos sometimes brought their own staff or slaves as well. Another comprador dealt with the ship's provisions at Pazhou, where sampan ladies crowded around the ships to do laundry and odd jobs for the sailors. A few weeks before departure, the crew came to the factories in shifts of a few days each for shore leave, chaperoned by some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship's officers. Hog Lane was lined with open-fronted booths and shops catering to them, selling food, drink, clothing, and [...] "chowchows" [...] (novelties), and was policed by Chinese guards stationed at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alley.</b> At first <b>the</b> supercargos came and left with the ships, but over <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century companies began to rent their factory spaces year-round to avoid being displaced on their return. The supercargos were then permitted to outstay their company's ships {{a few weeks to}} conduct business for the next season; after that, they were obliged to remove themselves to Macao through the spring and summer until <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next ship. By the 1760s, every East India company had permanent supercargos and rooms were being rented in Macao year-round as well.|$|R

At the farthest extremity of the passage I stopped at a door and knocked. Several of the other doors of the passage opened, and various heads were thrust out, while inquisitive eyes surveyed me and my companion.

It was a knocking which he usually associated with the police, and it came from his side door.

In other respects, his address was gallant, free, and unencumbered either by pride or ceremony--far remote certainly from the charge either of haughty coldness or forward impetuosity; and so far his father had justly freed him from the marked faults which he ascribed to the manners of the prince and his favourite Buckingham.|$|E

40|$|Twelve pill bugs (Armadillidium vulgare, Isopoda, Cmstacean) were {{examined}} in 200 successive T-mazes. When obstacles are present, A. vulgare tend to move by means of turn alternation, which is generally considered an innate adaptive behavior. With a decrease in air moisture, the bugs {{have a tendency to}} increase their turn alternation rate. However, in such long successive T-mazes as in this study, continued turn alternation should actually accelerate the bugs' desiccation. This fact implies that turn alternation cannot always work adaptively. In this trade-off situation, while three individuals kept turn alternation at a high rate (1) and four at a low rate, (2), the other five spontaneously increased <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> turn alternation and then decreased it (3). This instability of turn alternation in group (3) is interpreted as resulting not from stochastic factors but rather from the bugs' own decision-making, and seems to be anescape behavior used to get out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimental apparatus. In order to verify thedecision-making hypothesis, all animals were subsequently tested in another successive T-maze apparatus, where <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chosen <b>alleys</b> were shut, i. e., with 50 successive blind alleys.

"Driving back in {{the evening}} from Coombe Tracey he was in time to get his hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman waiting.

The hound had kept upon the grassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track but the man's was visible.

Her father took so the childish view of her that he had not yet explained to her the new relation in which he stood to the elegant Miss Archer.

I even saw from this moment, I think, that, whatever she might understand, she would be able herself to say but little. She gave herself, in that minute, more than she doubtless knew--gave herself, I mean, to my intenser apprehension. She went through the form of expression, but what told me everything was the way the form of expression broke down. Her lovely grimace, the light of the previous hours, was as blurred as a bit of brushwork in water-colour spoiled by the upsetting of the artist's glass. She fixed me with it as she had fixed during the day forty persons, but it fluttered like a bird with a broken wing. She looked about and above, down each of our dusky avenues and up at our gilded tree-tops and our painted sky, where, at the moment, the passage of a flight of rooks made a clamour.

50|$|<b>The</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{monument}} was {{entrusted to}} the world renowned Croatian sculptor Ivan Mestrovic (Vrpolje, modern Croatia, 1883 - South Bend, Indiana, USA, 1962), who made a model in his Zagreb studio (Mestrovic Gallery). The sculpture was cast in fourteen pieces at <b>the</b> Art Foundry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Academy <b>of</b> Fine Arts using the lost wax technique. The pieces were joined to form two halves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertically divided sculpture, transported to Belgrade and assembled together on the site. The monumental figure, over four metres tall, represents France rushing to Serbia’s aid. <b>The</b> expressive movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> allegorical female figure, an important motif in Mestrovic’s sculptural work, evokes and glorifies <b>the</b> national spirit <b>of</b> France, suggesting energy, leadership, courage and faith. Monumentality, typical of Mestrovic’s sculptural expression, is emphasized by mounting <b>the</b> massive form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central female figure on a seven-metre-high pedestal made of blocks of Brač “marble” (in fact, grey Adriatic limestone turning white with time). <b>The</b> pyramidal structure <b>of</b> its geometric mass sets <b>the</b> rhythm <b>of</b> gradual increase in emphasis towards the central scene and ensures stylistic unity between the monument and the surrounding ground laid out in <b>the</b> geometric pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French garden. By virtue of being located at <b>the</b> far <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>alley</b> that extends beyond the park borders and into the city’s main street (Knez Mihailova), the monument becomes a significant visual landmark. Engraved on its front are <b>the</b> year <b>of</b> erection and <b>the</b> dedication “A la France”, and on the back, the inscription “We love France as she loved us 1914-1918”. <b>The</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedestal feature narrative compositions in low relief at <b>the</b> eye level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viewer. The reliefs were executed after Mestrovic’s drawings by the sculptors Frano Kršinić, who oversaw the work, and Antun Augustinčić, as well as Grga Antunac, Šime Dujmić and Orlandini. Without encroaching into the surrounding space, the reliefs form an organic part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedestal, with the carved sections fitted with precision, while leaving the joints visible in <b>the</b> spirit <b>of</b> Egyptian monumentalized relief. <b>The</b> repetitive row <b>of</b> figures in <b>the</b> scene known as Warriors {{on the left side}} follows <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> isocephaly on <b>the</b> model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bas-relief depicting Assyrian archers, a motif Mestrovic elaborated in relief and lithography. It evokes the bond forged by Serbian and French soldiers on the Salonika Front. On the opposite side, the more softly modelled allegory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sorbonne alludes to the French educational aid extended to Serbian youths during and after the war. The original sketch for this relief, depicting France as a woman breastfeeding Serbian children (now kept at Mestrovic Gallery), was altered at <b>the</b> suggestion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Institute in Zagreb (Raymond Warnier).|$|R

Its present name first appears as Packhus gränd in 1733.|$|R
