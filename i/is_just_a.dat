5|$|Little {{is known}} about Leofric, as his cathedral town was not a centre of {{historical}} writing, and he took little part in events outside his diocese.

No official acts from his episcopate have survived, and there <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> brief death notice in the Leofric Missal, although no notice of his death occurs in the contemporary Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. He occurs as a witness to royal charters.|$|E

5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, which <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} chronicles that mention Breton's death {{also note that}} he was the author of a legal {{treatise}} entitled le Bretoun, but this cannot be the surviving work called Britton, {{at least not in the}} current form, as that work discusses laws composed 15 years after Breton's death. It is unclear why he was credited with the work, and whether this attribution <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> confusion of Breton with the real author or if he did in fact author the work, which was later revised. The fact that the Britton is written in French, not Latin, and that it contains little information about the theory of law, being mostly concerned with the practical application of laws, points rather strongly to an author who was a royal justice, which Breton was.|$|E
5|$|At first Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> big and {{powerful}} car, {{but as the}} book progresses the car surprises the family by beginning to exhibit independent actions. This first happens while the family is caught in a traffic jam {{on their way to}} the beach for a picnic. The car suddenly instructs Commander Pott to pull a switch which causes Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang to sprout wings and take flight over the stopped cars on the road. Commander Pott flies them to Goodwin Sands in the English Channel where the family picnics, swims, and sleeps. While the family naps, the tide comes in threatening to drown them. Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang wakes them just in time with a hiss of steam. At the car's direction, Commander Pott pulls another switch which causes it to transform into a hovercraft-like vehicle. They make for the French coast and land on a beach near Calais. They explore along the beach and find a cave boobytrapped with some devices intended to scare off intruders. At the back of the cave is a store of armaments and explosives. The family detonates the cache of explosives and flees the cave.|$|E

5|$|In a draft {{resolution}} for the IAU definition of planet, both Pluto and Charon {{would have been}} considered dwarf planets in a binary system, given that they both satisfied the mass and shape requirements for dwarf planets and revolved around a common center of mass located between the two bodies (rather than within one of the bodies). The IAU currently states that Charon is not considered to be a dwarf planet and <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> satellite of Pluto, although the idea that Charon might qualify to be a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date. The location of the barycenter depends not only on the relative masses of the bodies, but also on the distance between them; the barycenter of the Sun–Jupiter orbit, for example, lies outside the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Lana {{attempts}} to convince everyone that it <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> rumour by dating Brendan Bond (Michael Wahr). When Sky {{finds out that}} Lana is planning {{to have sex with}} Brendan during a party, Sky tries to stop her. Lana tells Sky to leave, but then decides to tell Brendan that she cannot have sex with him because she likes girls. Lana receives anonymous notes in her locker praising her for being brave. However, she is also targeted by a gang of girls who threaten to cut her hair off. Susan decides to get the school involved in a tolerance campaign, but many of the parents protest about it. Sky and Lana begin drawing a cartoon strip together called Freak Girl and The Enigma and Buffy Only (Laura Gordon), the editor of a gay magazine, becomes interested in publishing it. Buffy later asks Lana out on a date, but comes to realise that they are not right for each other.|$|E
5|$|Osborn and Mook, in 1921, {{provisionally}} synonymized {{the three}} species, sinking A. latus into Camarasaurus supremus, and suggesting also that A. fragillimus <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> very large individual of A. altus, a position which most subsequent studies, including McIntosh 1998, Foster (2007), and Woodruff and Foster (2015) have agreed with. Carpenter (2006) disagreed about the synonymy of A. altus and A. fragillimus, however, citing numerous {{differences in the}} construction of the vertebra also noted by Cope, and suggested these differences are enough to warrant a separate species or even a separate genus for A. fragillimus. However, he went on to caution that the validity of A. fragillimus as a separate species is nearly impossible to determine without the original specimen to study. Although Amphicoelias latus is clearly not Amphicoelias, it is probably synonymous with Camarasaurus grandis rather than C. supremus because it was found lower in the Morrison Formation and the deeply concave articular faces on the caudal vertebrae are more consistent with C. grandis.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} {{has also made}} several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program This Is My Best, the Queen uttered a curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood {{was nothing but a}} heap of ashes from which black spiders crawled and scuffled off into the night. In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children had a crush on Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> cartoon character.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E
