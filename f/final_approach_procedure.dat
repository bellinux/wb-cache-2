40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the assessment of navigation performance of GPS/EGNOS system in user position domain. Examination {{is based on a}} static signal in space monitoring and evaluation campaign to assess the ability to provide sufficient performance for new navigation procedures. GPS/EGNOS system is the first primary navigation system {{to be used in the}} airspace of Czech Republic. The first part describes the benefits of using new procedures, summarizes navigation development and current status. The second part defines components of GPS/EGNOS primary navigation system being analysed and its characteristics with the potential impact on the quality of approach navigation services to be provided and ensured by EGNOS. Subsequently, the methodology for critical evaluation of GPS/EGNOS signal in space navigation performance in position domain to be monitored by of air traffic services was formulated, using new methods for investigation of accuracy, integrity and continuity with the focus on <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> <b>procedures.</b> Simultaneously supporting software for data analysis against performance requirements in position domain was designed. Based on campaigns of static experimental measurements and detailed analysis of combined GPS/EGNOS performance against the demands, the level of performance is analysed, the findings are presented and conclusions are made. In the last part, the usage of permanent geodetic stations for regular evaluation of GNSS performance for civil aviation purposes is designed and verified, and the conclusions based on navigation performance evaluation of observations from all selected station in the Czech Republic...|$|R
5|$|In {{a typical}} LFR {{instrument}} <b>approach</b> <b>procedure,</b> <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> would begin {{over the range}} station, with a turn to a specific course. The pilot would descend to a specified minimum descent altitude (MDA), and if the airport was not in sight within a specified time (based on ground speed), a missed <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> would be initiated. In the depicted Joliet, IL LFR <b>approach</b> <b>procedure,</b> minimum descent altitude could be as low as 300 feet AGL, and required minimum visibility one mile, depending on aircraft type.|$|R
50|$|Vectoring {{is used to}} {{separate}} aircraft by a specified distance, to aid the navigation of flights, and to guide arriving aircraft to a position from which they can continue their <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> to land {{under the guidance of}} an <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> published by the FAA.|$|R
40|$|Through {{the use of}} new {{technology}} {{in the field of}} air navigation new potentials arise with regard to the run-way capacity of an airport. It may be that different approaches and their guidance both can be carried out simultaneously, which provide the possibility to make <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> more flexible or to relocate the <b>Final</b> <b>Approach</b> Fix (FAF) closer to the runway threshold. With regard to the separation of aircraft on the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> this may result in an advantage to runway capacity {{in the case of the}} leading aircraft operating at a higher speed compared to the following aircraft. The gap between both aircraft on a shortened <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> segment may increases less in contrast to a longer segment. The analysis of the impact due to relocating the FAF will be conducted by different scenarios. The basis of the scenarios is provides by a generic airport with various ratios of departing to arriving aircraft, aircraft mixes and two different <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> segment lengths...|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} {{is the official}} FAA definition of VDP:"A defined point on the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> course of a nonprecision straight-in <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> from which normal descent from the MDA to the runway touchdown point may be commenced, provided the approach threshold of that runway, or approach lights, or other markings identifiable with the approach end of that runway are clearly visible to the pilot." ...|$|R
40|$|In 1978 a joint NASA-FAA {{helicopter}} {{flight test}} {{was conducted to}} examine the use of weather-mapping radar for IFR guidance during landing approaches to oil rig helipads. The following navigation errors were measured: total system error, radar-range error, radar-bearing error, and flight technical error. Three problem areas were identified: (1) operational problems leading to pilot blunders, (2) poor navigation to the downwind <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> point, and (3) pure homing on <b>final</b> <b>approach.</b> Analysis of these problem areas suggests improvement in the radar equipment, <b>approach</b> <b>procedure,</b> and pilot training, and gives valuable insight into the development of future navigation aids to serve the off-shore oil industry...|$|R
500|$|<b>Final</b> <b>approach</b> {{segments}} of LFR instrument approaches were normally flown near the range station, which ensured increased accuracy. When the aircraft {{was over the}} station, the audio signal disappeared, {{since there was no}} modulation signal directly above the transmitting towers. This quiet zone, called the [...] "cone of silence", signified to the pilots that the aircraft was directly overhead the station, serving as a positive ground reference point for the <b>approach</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|R
50|$|Circle-to-land is a {{maneuver}} {{initiated by}} the pilot to align the aircraft with a runway for landing when a straight-in landing from an instrument approach is not possible or is not desirable, and only after ATC authorization has been obtained and the pilot has established and maintains required visual reference to the airport. A circle-to-land maneuver is an alternative to a straight-in landing. It is a maneuver used when a runway is not aligned within 30 degrees of the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> course of the instrument <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> or the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> requires 400 feet (or more) of descent per nautical mile, and therefore requires some visual maneuvering of the aircraft {{in the vicinity of}} the airport after the instrument portion of the approach is completed to align the aircraft with the runway for landing.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> do {{not permit}} straight-in {{approaches}} unless the pilots are being radar vectored. In these situations, pilots are required to complete a procedure turn (PT) or other course reversal, generally within 10 NM of the PT fix, to establish the aircraft inbound on the intermediate or <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> segment. When conducting any type of approach, if the aircraft is not lined up for a straight-in approach, then a course reversal might be necessary. The idea of a course reversal is to allow sufficiently large changes in the course flown (in order to line the aircraft up with the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> course), without taking too much space horizontally and while remaining {{within the confines of}} protected airspace. This is accomplished in one of three ways: a procedure turn, a holding pattern, or a teardrop course reversal.|$|R
50|$|The minimum descent {{altitude}} (MDA) is {{the lowest}} altitude, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> where no electronic glideslope is provided. Unlike with DH or DA, a missed approach need not be initiated immediately upon reaching the altitude. A pilot flying a non-precision approach may descend to the MDA and maintain it until reaching the missed approach point (MAP), then initiate a missed approach if the required visual reference was not obtained. An aircraft must not descend below the MDA until visual reference is obtained, and which the aircraft can land while performing normal maneuvers, which differs slightly from a DH/DA in that while the missed <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> must be initiated at or prior to the DH/DA, because of its vertical momentum, during a precision approach an aircraft may end up descending slightly below the DH/DA {{during the course of}} the missed approach.|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} fuel {{efficient}} flight paths which include shorter routes and routes {{adapted to the}} prevailing terrain {{as well as the}} aim to reduce the perceived noise {{on the ground in the}} terminal area of airports lead to the development of curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures.</b> To be able to conduct curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures,</b> an aircraft is on the one hand required to be able to determine its position very precisely. On the other hand, it is required to be able to follow the required flight path very accurately. The first is usually archived with satellite navigation or a combination of different navigation systems and the latter can be achieved by an autopilot which has to be rather sophisticated when intending to follow a curved approach path. This indicates that an aircraft has to be highly equipped with navigation and guidance avionics systems. To fully exploit the advantages of curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures,</b> it is desired that the majority of aircraft are able to conduct curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> even with a less sophisticated degree of equipage. A key enabler for curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> is a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS). It broadcasts pseudorange corrections for all satellites in view to enable airspace users to augment their own position. In addition, it broadcasts desired flight paths. Next to standard “straight-in” <b>Final</b> <b>Approach</b> Segments (FAS), GBAS messages are defined in the RTCA standard DO- 246 D that provide the possibility to broadcast curved precision approach paths. This Terminal Area Path (TAP) functionality in combination with the augmentation of the user’s position can be used as a sole means to conduct a curved approach. The advantage of this setup is that a high accuracy and a high integrity in the lateral as well as in the vertical position domain can be achieved and the aircraft does not have to be equipped with a current database for the published <b>approach</b> <b>procedures.</b> Different ways to present flight path data were investigated and flight tested in this work. ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{instrument}} <b>approach</b> wherein <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> is begun {{without first}} having executed a procedure turn, not necessarily completed with a straight-in landing or made to straight-in landing minimums. A direct instrument <b>approach</b> requires no <b>procedure</b> turn {{or any other}} course reversal procedures for alignment (usually indicated by [...] "NoPT" [...] on approach plates), as the arrival direction and the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> course are not too different from each other. The direct approach can be finished with a straight-in landing or circle-to-land procedure.|$|R
50|$|The {{flight was}} being {{operated}} under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) from Sentani, and a visual descent, approach, and landing at Wamena, {{because there was}} no published instrument <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> at Wamena. There was low cloud on the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> track to Runway 15 at Wamena. The aircraft was observed conducting a low altitude go-around over the runway: it then climbed to a low height along the extended centre-line to the south east, before making a right turn onto the downwind leg of the circuit. As it began its second approach it hit Pikei Hill in Tengah Mountain at 07:43 local time (10:43 UTC). All on board were killed instantly.|$|R
25|$|Flight 5719 {{was cleared}} {{for a landing}} on runway 31 at Hibbing, but the flight crew {{requested}} an approach to runway 13 instead {{because there was a}} tailwind on the approach to runway 31 and 31 was covered with precipitation. The flight crew initiated the <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> by joining the HIB 20 DME arc from the HIB VOR and intercepting the localizer at 8000 feet MSL.This delayed the start of the descent and thus required an excessive rate of descent. The aircraft descended at 2250 ft/min and was 1200 feet above the minimum altitude when overhead the KINNY <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> fix. The Jetstream BA-3100 was not equipped with a Ground Proximity Warning System that was required on larger aircraft.|$|R

50|$|Captain Zinke didn't {{encounter}} any difficulties on the <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> to Denpasar's Ngurah Rai Airport. The procedure {{stated that}} {{before they could}} land at the airport, the flight should maintain 12,000 ft and then they should execute the full ADF let-down procedure. The pilots were aware that there were mountainous terrain on {{the north of the}} airport and that flight level 120 would clear them from the mountains. The crew then told the controllers on the ETA of Flight 812, and stated their intention to make a right turn within 25 miles from the beacon for a track out on 261 degrees, descending to 1,500 ft followed by a procedure to turn over the water for <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> on Runway 09.|$|R

25|$|The {{accident}} and subsequent investigation prompted {{the release of}} NTSB Safety Recommendations A-80-59 and A-80-60.

50|$|The crew {{initially}} executed the VOR/DME non-precision instrument <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> to runway 02. Upon becoming visual, {{the crew}} {{determined that the}} aircraft was not adequately aligned with the runway and initiated a missed approach. A change in wind direction now favoured the opposite runway, so the aircraft was positioned for an ILS (Instrument Landing System) approach to runway 20. The aircraft descended below cloud and became visual with the runway at around 500 ft above ground level. At a late stage in the <b>final</b> <b>approach,</b> the airfield lighting failed for a few seconds. The aircraft touched down hard, bounced, and made a second heavier touchdown causing substantial damage to the nosewheel and its supports. This caused further damage to the aircraft systems, including loss of electrical power, interference with controls and an uncommanded increase in thrust.|$|R

40|$|In a {{simultaneous}} paired approach to closely-spaced parallel runways, {{a pair of}} aircraft flies in close proximity on parallel approach paths. The longitudinal separation between the aircraft must be maintained within a range that avoids wake encounters and, {{if one of the}} aircraft blunders, avoids collision. To increase operational availability, the <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> must accommodate a mixture of aircraft sizes and, consequently, approach speeds. In these procedures, the slower aircraft is placed in the lead position. The faster aircraft maintains separation from the slow aircraft in a dependent operation until <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> and flies independently afterward. Due to the higher approach speed of the fast aircraft, longitudinal separation will decrease during <b>final</b> <b>approach.</b> Therefore, the fast aircraft must position itself before the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> so that it will remain within the safe range of separation as separation decreases. Given the approach geometry and speed schedule for each aircraft, one can use kinematics to estimate the separation loss between a pair of aircraft. A kinematic model can complement fast-time Monte-Carlo simulations of the approach by enabling a tailored reduction in the variation of starting position for the fast aircraft. One could also implement the kinematic model in ground-based or on-board decision support tools to compute the optimal initial separation for a given pair of aircraft. To better match the auto-coupled flight of real aircraft, the paper derives a kinematic model where the speed schedule is flown using equivalent airspeed. The predicted time of flight using the equivalent airspeed kinematic model compares well against a high-fidelity aircraft simulation performing the same approach. This model also demonstrates a modest increase in the predicted loss of separation when contrasted against a kinematic model that assumes the scheduled speed is true airspeed...|$|R

50|$|A concept {{related to}} the missed {{approach}} point is the visual descent point, or VDP. Determination of its location {{is done by the}} designers of the instrument <b>approach</b> <b>procedure,</b> but typically this is a point on the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> course of a non-precision approach, from which the aircraft would be able to continue its descent from the MDA to the runway threshold while maintaining a standard 3° descent angle while being assured obstacle clearance. In other words, usually it is the point (on the profile view of the approach) where a line depicting a 3° descent angle would intercept the horizontal line at the MDA. If the pilot does not have the required visual reference to continue the descent from the MDA at this point, he/she must continue to fly at or above the MDA, and the rapidly steepening descent angle required to complete a successful landing on the runway means that a safe and successful approach becomes less likely.|$|R
