25|$|Murdoch has two {{children}} with Wendi Deng: Grace (b. New York, 19 November 2001) and Chloe (b. New York, 17 July 2003). It was revealed in September 2011 that Tony Blair is Grace's godfather. There {{is reported to be}} tension between Murdoch and his oldest children over the terms of a trust holding the family's 28.5 percent stake in News Corporation, estimated in 2005 to be worth about $6.1 billion. Under the trust, his children by Wendi Deng share in the proceeds of the stock but have no voting privileges or control of the stock. Voting rights in the stock are divided 50/50 between Murdoch on the one side and his children of his first two marriages. Murdoch's voting privileges are not transferable but will expire upon his death and the stock will then be controlled solely by his children from the prior marriages, although their half-siblings will continue to derive their share of income from it. It is Murdoch's stated desire to have his children by Deng given a measure of control over the stock proportional to their financial interest in it (which would mean, if Murdoch dies while {{at least one of the}} children is a minor, that Deng would exercise that control). It does not appear that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> strong legal grounds to contest the present arrangement, and both ex-wife Anna and their three children are said to be strongly resistant to any such change.|$|E
500|$|Myatt {{himself has}} {{repeatedly}} denied allegations that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> {{involvement with the}} ONA, {{and that he has}} used the pseudonym [...] "Anton Long", furthermore challenging the arguments used to connect him with Long by claiming that they are based on insufficient evidence. Religious studies scholar George Sieg expressed concern with this association, stating that he found it to be [...] "implausible and untenable based on the extent of variance in writing style, personality, and tone" [...] between Myatt and Long. Jeffrey Kaplan, an academic specialist in the far right, has also suggested that Myatt and Long are separate people, while the religious studies scholar Connell R. Monette posited the possibility that [...] "Anton Long" [...] was not a singular individual but rather a pseudonym used by several different people.|$|E

500|$|Jack {{wakes up}} in a cell in the , where Juliet gently interrogates him. [...] At one point Jack attacks her and {{attempts}} to escape, holding an improvised weapon at her throat. [...] He orders her to open a door, but she refuses to comply, claiming that doing so would kill them both. Ben appears and agrees that opening the door will kill them all. [...] Jack throws Juliet away, and then opens the door. As Ben dashes back through the door he came in, water starts rushing into the hallway. [...] Juliet helps Jack struggle into an adjoining room, tells him to push a button which she had previously mentioned was for emergencies. [...] He does so and she knocks him unconscious. When he awakes, she shows Jack a file which she says contains documents about his entire life. [...] Juliet asks Jack if <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> questions about Sarah. [...] After a pause, he asks, [...] "Is she happy?" [...] Juliet replies yes, and walks outside, and Ben congratulates her on a job well done.|$|E
500|$|Riders {{are then}} ushered into the {{pre-flight}} [...] "Funhouse" [...] room {{by a team}} member. Here, Krusty leads the Simpsons into a backstage area where Grampa and Maggie are told not to ride due to certain safety restrictions (Maggie doesn't meet the 40 inch height requirement, and Grampa has certain heart conditions that could be aggravated, which proves to be true as he suffers a heart attack, a stroke and a massive aneurysm while trying to deny that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> heart conditions). Grampa suddenly falls asleep while Maggie crawls into a nuclear reactor room, causing her to grow larger. Meanwhile, Krusty leads the Simpsons into a ride room where he tells them to enjoy the ride, before Sideshow Bob appears, knocks Krusty out, and tells the Simpsons Family to enter the ride vehicle. Homer enters, followed {{by the rest of}} the family. Sideshow Bob then tells the Simpsons and the riders that they must watch a safety video from Itchy and Scratchy. The screen then displays a recap of the safety reminders (but showing Scratchy's attempts to follow the safety rules getting sabotaged by Itchy constantly), while riders are ushered into the main ride room.|$|E
500|$|As {{the lines}} between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under {{pressure}} in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. Tucker Carlson and Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, [...] "When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, {{if you give them}} a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary." [...] She has argued that The Daily Show success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV. Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> journalistic role as an interviewer.|$|E

[...] And he does not even aver that these claims are valid, or that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> title to them; but, on the contrary, charges {{that none of the}} claims had been secured, and states that he did not think it probable that they would be obtained by the assignees of the Indians. [...] And as the case has been removed here from the decision of a state court, we have no right to review it unless the complainant claimed some right under the treaty with the Choctaws or the act of Congress [...] [...] [...] [...] In the case before us, no such title, right, or privilege was claimed by the bill, and of course no decision was made against it in the state court. We therefore can exercise no jurisdiction [...] [...] [...] and are not authorized to examine any questions of fraud or failure of consideration, or breach of contract [...] [...] [...] [...]|$|E
500|$|... "Borderland" [...] first premiered on UPN in the United States on October 29, 2004. The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Robert Bianco highlighted the episode as one {{to watch in}} his preview column for USA Today. Maureen Ryan for the Chicago Tribune praised the return of Brent Spiner to Star Trek, saying [...] "Surprise, fear, elation, self-control; they're all given masterful life by Spiner {{in the space of}} a few seconds." [...] The reviewer at IGN thought that the episode was a return to the quality of [...] "", and praised the abilities of Spiner. The teaser trailer was compared to that of a Quentin Tarantino film, and a score of 3/5 was given saying [...] "Executive Producer Manny Coto has a long way to go if <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> hope of making up for Enterprise's transgressions the past three years but if this three episode story arc lives up to the promise shown in Borderland, he might just pull it off." [...] Stephanie Vander Weide of Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C" [...] grade rating. She said that she liked the premise of the episode, but felt that the execution was sub-par, describing the augments as [...] "Khannabees" [...] and expressing her disappointment in the actions of Captain Archer. The mini-arc featuring the episodes [...] "Borderland", [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] and [...] "The Augments" [...] were subsequently ranked the sixth best story of Enterprise by Den of Geek writer James Hunt.|$|E

2500|$|Andrew's {{relentless}} torment of {{his mother}} and other devious exploits have been negatively received by critics, with one declaring him a [...] "Class-A jerk". The Parent's Television Council named [...] "I Know Things Now" [...] as their [...] "Worst Episode of the Week", in part due to Andrew's seduction of Bree's boyfriend. However, his improved behavior and deep love for his mother in Season 3 has also disappointed some critics, with one saying [...] "if <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> lines at all, he's a little angel...as if he's become something of a Stepford son!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Negative {{scores are}} common, and {{occasionally}} even the victor's score may be negative. Score totals are {{announced at the}} conclusion of the show.

[...] John Lloyd, QIs creator, has, on one occasion, admitted that not even <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> idea how the scoring system works, but there is someone who is paid to check on the scores. According to the Series A DVD, guests are allowed the right of appeal if they believe their score is wrong, but none has so far exercised that right.|$|E

[...] EgyptAir officials also immediately dismissed Taha's claim. American investigators confirmed key aspects of Taha's information, but decided not to anger the Egyptian government further by issuing any official statement about Al-Batouti's motive. EgyptAir terminated Taha's employment, and his application for British asylum was reportedly declined, though he gave an extensive 2002 newspaper interview in London, and a 2005 documentary credited him as [...] "Exiled Captain".|$|E
2500|$|Sarah Austin's {{style is}} clear, {{unaffected}} and forcible. She adopted {{a high standard}} for the duties of a translator and sought to conform to it rigorously. [...] "It has been my invariable practice," [...] she said, [...] "as soon as I have engaged to translate a work, to write to the author of it, announcing my intention, and adding that if <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> correction, omission, or addition to make, he might depend on my paying attention to his suggestions." [...] She did much {{to make the best}} minds of Germany familiar to Englishmen and she left a literary reputation due as much to her conversation and wide correspondence with illustrious men of letters as to her works.|$|E
2500|$|While the 1874 {{correspondent}} described Worth as [...] "not {{a man to}} {{be afraid}} of if one has a liberal exchequer", it was implied that the couturier was not afraid to dictate to clients what they should wear: [...] "Yet Mr Worth declares <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> amount of trouble with women – that they want to wear colours that don't become them and a superabundance of trimming that is far from good taste". It appears Worth had the charm or gravitas to overcome his clients' requests for the wrong colour or trimming. His son Jean Philippe later recalled: [...] "His practised eye discerned the color and style of robe that would most completely enhance a woman's charm, and with complete serenity she might leave the matter to him and give her mind to the contemplation of home affairs, her children and philanthropies".|$|E
