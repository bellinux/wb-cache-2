5|$|In many of {{the legends}} of the Cascade Mountains, there are thunderbirds that live on them and Adams is no exception. This {{particular}} thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized {{the inhabitants of the}} land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.|$|E
500|$|During {{the search}} for a {{suitable}} conductor, Disney and Walt Disney Feature Animation president Thomas Schumacher invited Metropolitan Opera conductor James Levine and manager Peter Gelb to a meeting in September 1991. Disney recalled: [...] "I asked James what his thought was on a three minute version of Beethoven's fifth symphony. <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> went 'I think the right three minutes would be beautiful'". In November 1992, Disney, Schumacher, Levine, Gelb, and Butoy met in Vienna to discuss a collection of story reels developed, one of them being Pines of Rome, which Levine took an immediate liking to. Butoy described Levine's enthusiasm toward the film as [...] "like a kid in a candy store". Because Katzenberg continued to express some hostility towards the film, Disney held development meetings without him and reported directly to Eisner instead, something that author James B. Stewart wrote [...] "would have been unthinkable on any other future animation project." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, Jeter was appreciative. [...] "He grooved them? [...] The {{first one}} was a little cutter that he threw down and away. [...] He {{probably}} assumed I was swinging. [...] So he didn't groove the first one. [...] The second was about 90, a two-seamer that stayed on a really good ... No, I don't know, man", <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> smiled, drawing laughs from reporters. [...] "I have no idea. [...] If he grooved it, thank you. [...] You still got to hit it." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused.</b> <b>He</b> turned <b>and</b> came slowly back. Standing {{above her}} he smiled upon her.|$|R
2500|$|Without hesitation, Mynarski {{made his}} way through the flames to Brophy's assistance. All his efforts were in vain, {{initially}} using a fire axe to try to pry open the doors before finally resorting to beating at the turret with his hands. With Mynarski's flight suit and parachute on fire, Brophy eventually waved him away. Mynarski crawled back through the hydraulic fire, returned to the rear door where <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> saluted. He then reputedly said [...] "Good night, sir," [...] his familiar nightly sign-off to his friend, and jumped.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> the frown deepened between Wellington's brows.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> she {{repeated}} {{his last two}} words--gently, encouragingly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> again, <b>and</b> still Arthur Gride glared {{upon him}} in silence.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> there, <b>and</b> {{his face}} grew dark with remembered despair, and she shuddered.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> thoughtfully, <b>and</b> {{shook his}} head with ominous frowns and bitings of his lips.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> then {{voice and}} {{expression}} became suddenly fierce.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> {{captain and}} mate looked despair at each other.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> began fumbling {{in a large}} locker {{under the}} companion-steps.|$|E
5000|$|Mild-mannered teen James [...] "Jimmy" [...] Wilson (Robert Lowell) appears {{before a}} judge on charges of manslaughter. When asked to speak in his own defense, <b>he</b> <b>pauses,</b> <b>and</b> {{reflects}} to say; [...] "I accuse my parents" [...] for not giving him the home life he should have had.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>paused,</b> hesitated, <b>and</b> then {{striking}} {{across the}} summit of the hill, made his way boldly to Gabriel's cottage.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{commercial}} advertising Mysteries Of the Unknown aired in September 1987; the voice-over narration started with [...] "Chicago: {{a man is}} about to board a routine flight <b>and</b> suddenly <b>he</b> <b>pauses,</b> <b>and</b> walks away. An hour later the plane goes down in flames. It's dismissed as chance." [...] One- and two-minute versions of this commercial were aired.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} his friend, who sat in mute amazement.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> swore again. His companion's silence {{appeared}} to irritate him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> his {{attitude}} suggested a roving {{glance at the}} window.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What is the matter?' asked <b>he,</b> <b>pausing</b> <b>and</b> looking round. And a man replied, in a faltering voice, {{that each}} year a {{beautiful}} girl was chosen by lot to be offered up to a dreadful fiery dragon, who had a mother even worse than himself, and this year the lot had fallen on their peerless princess.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> abruptly, <b>and</b> his {{somewhat}} full, sensitive {{lips were}} pressed tightly together {{as if to}} suppress an insistent outburst of passion.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> abruptly, <b>and</b> {{looked at}} his mother with solemn anxiety, for he was well aware that {{he had given her}} food for {{profound}} reflection.|$|R
60|$|At length <b>he</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} Harry Somerville for some time.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} his {{employer}} significantly. Wingrave turned on his heel.|$|E

60|$|SERGIUS (speaking to himself). Which {{of the six}} is {{the real}} man?--that's the {{question}} that torments me. One {{of them is a}} hero, another a buffoon, another a humbug, another perhaps a bit of a blackguard. (<b>He</b> <b>pauses</b> <b>and</b> looks furtively at Louka, as he adds with deep bitterness) And one, at least, is a coward--jealous, like all cowards. (He goes to the table.) Louka.|$|R

6000|$|And as he to the court-yard pass'd along, [...] Each third step did <b>he</b> <b>pause,</b> <b>and</b> listen'd oft [...] If {{he could}} hear his lady's matin-song, [...] Or the light whisper of her {{footstep}} soft; [...] And as he thus over his passion hung, [...] He heard a laugh full musical aloft; [...] When, looking up, he saw her features bright [...] Smile through an in-door lattice, all delight.

6000|$|Her {{tone was}} friendly--too friendly, {{considering}} {{the point at}} which <b>he</b> had <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was a little hurt by it. Was she playing with him? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> again <b>paused,</b> <b>and</b> {{took two}} or three quick puffs at his cigar, as if in angry thought of how he should begin, and then went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "I only {{fear the}} men and they need not know," [...] he said eagerly, even though at her words <b>he</b> had <b>paused</b> <b>and</b> turned back towards her.|$|R
