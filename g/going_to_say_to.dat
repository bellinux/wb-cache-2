60|$|DAISY. [After a moment's pause.] What {{were you}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me? Don't {{thank me for}} {{anything}} I may have done. It's given me a happiness I never knew before.|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] the Prince continued, [...] "is a {{personal}} matter. What I am now <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you is official. I had despatches from Berlin last night. They concern you." ...|$|E
5000|$|... [...] "Oh, really, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no <b>to</b> me?" [...] snapped Hershel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, perhaps I may. I {{have not}} had a change for twenty-five years. Never could afford it. Aren't you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye <b>to</b> Elizabeth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't wish {{to waste}} your time, sir," [...] he answered. [...] "If {{you are not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> the others before then I will go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There’s worse misfortunes than that, as I’ve told you," [...] ses Mrs. Prince, sharply. [...] "Now, {{listen to}} wot I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you. When the clock strikes twelve to-night——" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{could not}} ask him {{anything}} when they met, but {{he raised his}} dull eyes after the first silence, and said, [...] "I don't know what I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Rogers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{you poor}} fish, my uncle, of course. What {{do you think}} my uncle's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> all this? If I sprang it on him cold, he'd tie himself in knots on the hearthrug." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Lydia. [...] "I want to. But it wouldn't be any comfort. I {{thought that}} out before I left home, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-by <b>to</b> grandfather here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-by <b>to</b> him, my darling, {{and there}} is no time to lose; so dress quickly and come to me in my room. I must go to Daisy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-by <b>to</b> him. I'll {{meet you}} in the field, if you don't care to come. It's only manners, after all, {{although}} the lemonade's all gone and I haven't had a drop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O yes," [...] {{said the}} Prince, [...] "it {{must have been}} very {{different}} to you indeed; but I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you, a little while ago, that you need not think me above you, for I am half-brother to a gnome." ...|$|E
6000|$|He never had. But {{she told}} him that she had been there for two years. [...] "And now," [...] she continued, [...] "there may be time enough before I must pack up my effects to finish what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you about {{approximate}} assimilations." ...|$|E
6000|$|CANDIDA (going to him, and {{standing}} behind him with one hand caressingly on his shoulder). Eighteen! Will you, for my sake, make a little poem out of the two sentences I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you? And will you promise to repeat it to yourself whenever you think of me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> much <b>to</b> you, {{seeing as}} how {{both of you}} are hurt," [...] said the master of the Columbia, briefly. [...] "But understand, I want no {{nonsense}} from either of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [191] Island, ii. 5. I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Look <b>to</b> the context.' but am fain {{to give it}} here; for the stanza, {{learned by}} heart, ought to be our school-introduction to the {{literature}} of the world.|$|R
5000|$|Dismissal comment: [...] "I {{wish you}} well, but I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye." ...|$|R
60|$|AUGUSTUS [lazily]. Well, I {{should not}} {{go as far as}} that. [Lowering his voice.] Will you swear to me not to repeat what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you; for if the British public knew that I had said it, I should be at once hounded down as a pro-German.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Mademoiselle," [...] he said, [...] "I {{must speak}} to you now of strange things. But, first, I must implore you to promise me this, and {{remember}} it always. Every word that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you now must remain for the present a profound secret. That is agreed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tallente," [...] he said, [...] "I don't {{know exactly}} what Dartrey is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you. I only know this, {{that it is very}} {{possible}} he may make you, on behalf of all of us--the Democratic Party, that is to say--an offer which you will do well to consider seriously." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is right, lad; we {{all hope}} most {{sincerely}} {{that there will be}} no occasion for its provisions to be carried out, but it is always best that a man should get these things off his mind. Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye <b>to</b> us tonight?" ...|$|R
60|$|How you adore him, Anne! You may {{set your}} mind at rest. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a word <b>to</b> Arthur. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> speak to Violet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> up <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye <b>to</b> Bill. Have you {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> against that? And I shall <b>say</b> good-bye <b>to</b> {{him in my}} own way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} {{everything}} {{in life is}} slipping away from me," [...] he protested. [...] "I ought to be thinking over what lam <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> your country people, and instead of that I am wondering whether there is anything more beautiful {{in the world than}} the blue haze over your meadows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{my friends}} and fellow-sinners, now I told you when I began, that I didn't know a word of what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you (and no, I did not!), {{but that it was}} all one to me, because I knew the Lord would put into my mouth the words I wanted.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may be sure, Mr. Parr, that I {{should not}} be here unless I were {{prepared}} to be specific. And what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you I have reserved for your ear alone, {{in the hope that}} you will take it to heart, while it is not yet too late, said amend your life accordingly." ...|$|E
30|$|One of our {{observations}} of the patients is their inability to complete sentences. They seem to either forget what they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> or <b>to</b> completely change the context and start talking about a different topic. Incomplete sentences are manually labeled for each conversation. To compute this feature, the ratio of incomplete sentences to {{the total number of}} the sentences is calculated.|$|R
6000|$|She {{glanced at}} Paul. He made a {{movement}} {{as though to}} quit the room, but Adrea prevented him. [...] "You need not go!" [...] she said. [...] "Anything {{that is to be}} said can be said to you as well as to me. I prefer to have no secrets! You were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something <b>to</b> me," [...] she added, turning to her companion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't say it! don't! I cannot bear {{you to feel}} so much, and me to feel nothing. And I {{am afraid}} they will notice us, Mr. Boldwood. Will you let the matter rest now? I cannot think collectedly. I did not know you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this <b>to</b> me. Oh, I am wicked to have made you suffer so!" [...] She was frightened as well as {{agitated}} at his vehemence.|$|R
6000|$|He joined her, {{and walked}} beside her. [...] "Well, Cynthy, {{what are you}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me? I'm off for Cambridge again to-morrow morning, and I suppose we've got to {{understand}} each other. I came up here to put myself in your hands, to keep or to throw away, just as you please. Well? Have you thought about it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Bradley did {{not hear}} the sermon. He was {{wondering}} just what Nettie's smile meant, {{and what he was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> her. He was not subtle enough to take a half-way or an ambiguous stand. He must either treat her tenderness as a forgotten thing or hold himself to his promise as something which he was under orders from his conscience to fulfill.|$|E
60|$|She was {{preparing}} {{in her mind}} what she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him, she rehearsed the words which {{were most likely to}} appeal to his callous nature. Already she was nerving herself for the supreme effort of pleading for a brave man's life when suddenly the tramping of heavy feet outside the hut, confused shouts and clang of arms, caused Stoutenburg to jump to his feet.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Attend, I tell you,' (in {{a raised}} voice) 'to what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Keep close <b>to</b> that idiot girl. Keep her under your thumb. You have her fast, {{and you are}} not to let her go. Do you hear?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... --The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I'm {{just waiting}} for Ben Dollard. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a word <b>to</b> long John {{to get him to}} take those two men off. All I want is a little time.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 81: [...] "Island," [...] ii. 5. I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Look <b>to</b> the context," [...] but am fain {{to give it}} here; for the stanza, {{learned by}} heart, ought to be our school-introduction to the {{literature}} of the world.|$|R
