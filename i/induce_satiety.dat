40|$|Cnidarians are the {{simplest}} metazoans to exhibit satiety after feeding. When hydra are fed to repletion, they close their mouths and cease to capture prey. As feeding stops, contractions of the tentacles and body column increase. Our earlier experiments {{showed that a}} gel chromatographic fraction of prey substances inhibits prey capture. We now present evidence that the same fraction reduces the duration of mouth opening induced by reduced glutathione (GSH) and inhibits the binding of GSH to its putative receptor. The fraction also induces column contractions which {{are similar to those}} normally seen in sated animals. Prey substances, of unfractionated homogenate, also induce post-feeding tentacle contractions similar to those seen in sated animals.

40|$|SummaryHypothalamic neurons expressing Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) are {{critical}} for initiating food intake, but druggable biochemical pathways that control this response remain elusive. Thus, genetic ablation of insulin or leptin signaling in AgRP neurons is predicted to reduce satiety but fails to do so. FoxO 1 is a shared mediator of both pathways, and its inhibition is required to <b>induce</b> <b>satiety.</b> Accordingly, FoxO 1 ablation in AgRP neurons of mice results in reduced food intake, leanness, improved glucose homeostasis, and increased sensitivity to insulin and leptin. Expression profiling of flow-sorted FoxO 1 -deficient AgRP neurons identifies G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr 17 as a FoxO 1 target whose expression is regulated by nutritional status. Intracerebroventricular injection of Gpr 17 agonists induces food intake, whereas Gpr 17 antagonist cangrelor curtails it. These effects are absent in Agrp-Foxo 1 knockouts, suggesting that pharmacological modulation of this pathway has therapeutic potential to treat obesity...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: In humans, {{impaired}} gastric accommodation {{is associated}} with early satiety and weight loss. In animals, accommodation involves activation of gastric nitrergic neurones. Our aim was to study involvement of nitric oxide in gastric accommodation and in meal <b>induced</b> <b>satiety</b> in humans. METHODS: The effect of N(G) -monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) 4 mg/kg/h and 8 mg/kg/h on gastric compliance, on sensitivity to distension, and on gastric accommodation was studied with a barostat in double blind, randomised, placebo controlled studies. The effect of L-NMMA 8 mg/kg/h on meal <b>induced</b> <b>satiety</b> was studied using a drinking test. RESULTS: L-NMMA had no significant effect on fasting compliance and sensitivity. Ingestion of a meal induced a relaxation of 274 (15) ml which was significantly smaller after L-NMMA 4 mg/kg/h (132 (45) ml; p= 0. 03) or L-NMMA 8 mg/kg/h (82 (72) ml; p= 0. 03). L-NMMA 8 mg/kg/h significantly decreased {{the amount of food}} ingested at maximum satiety from 1058 (67) to 892 (73) kcal (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Ingestion {{of dietary}} fat stimulates {{production}} of the small-intestinal satiety factors oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and N-palmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NPPE), which reduce food intake {{through a combination of}} local (OEA) and systemic (NPPE) actions. Previous studies have shown that sympathetic innervation of the gut is necessary for duodenal infusions of fat to <b>induce</b> <b>satiety,</b> suggesting that sympathetic activity may engage small-intestinal satiety signals such as OEA and NPPE. In the present study, we show that surgical resection of the sympathetic celiac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex, which sends projections to the upper gut, abolishes feeding-induced OEA production in rat small-intestinal cells. These effects are accounted for by suppression of OEA biosynthesis, and are mimicked by administration of the selective β 2 -adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI- 118, 551. We further show that sympathetic ganglionectomy or pharmacological blockade of β 2 -adrenergic receptors prevents NPPE release into the circulation. In addition, sympathetic ganglionectomy increases meal frequency and lowers satiety ratio, and these effects are corrected by pharmacological administration of OEA. The results suggest that sympathetic activity controls fat-induced satiety by enabling the coordinated production of local (OEA) and systemic (NPPE) satiety signals in the small intestine...|$|E

One advantage of this combination is the complementary mechanistic actions of insulin and GLP- 1. Insulin increases glucose utilization and retards hepatic glucose production through direct actions in muscle, adipose tissue and the liver. On the other hand, GLP- 1 stimulates insulin secretion, inhibits glucagon secretion and retards gastric emptying. Combining these effects results in powerful reductions in both fasting and postprandial glucose through diminished glucose entry into the bloodstream after food consumption, reduced hepatic production of glucose and increased glucose utilization. In addition, GLP- 1 receptor agonists <b>induce</b> <b>satiety,</b> leading to decreases in food intakes and body weight, thereby preventing the weight gain often seen with insulin therapy.

Odor detection thresholds were measured in 2 groups of participants (39 per group, 18 – 40 years), under 3 conditions: when hungry (twice), after a sweet lunch, and after a savory lunch. One group had their detection thresholds tested for a sweet odor, whereas in the other group, sensitivity to a savory odor was measured. Differences in olfactory sensitivity conditions were analyzed using linear mixed models. Participants had higher scores on the odor sensitivity task in a hungry versus satiated state (P = 0. 001). Within the satiated condition, there was no effect of type of lunch on odor sensitivity.

40|$|Feeding gestating sows {{with high}} fibre diets (HFD) helps <b>induce</b> <b>satiety</b> without {{excessive}} energy intake. Neutral Detergent Fibre (NDF) (15 - 20 %) enables sows to adapt their feed intake to their needs. Therefore, {{ad libitum feeding}} becomes possible, reducing the costs of feeding equipment. Fibre effect on the feeling of satiety is due among others to the higher amount of feed intake, the increase of eating time and delay in gastric emptying. Sow welfare improvement due to the feeling of satiety has for consequence {{a reduction in the}} occurrence of stereotypes and aggressions. The disadvantage of HFD feeding is linked to a reduction of cell component accessibility to digestive and microbial enzymes. However, energy efficiency of fibre degradation is better for sows than for growing pigs. If the amount of feed offered takes into account the reduction in energy digestibility, sow performance is not affected. Besides, the increased capacity of the digestive tract may result in an increased capacity of the digestive tract may result in an increased feed intake during early lactation, supporting higher milk production and limiting the body reserve mobilisation.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} overweight and obesity requires new, effective {{prevention and treatment}} strategies. One approach to reduce energy intake is by developing novel foods with increased satiating properties, which may be accomplished by slowing down lipolysis to deliver substrates to the ileum, thereby enhancing natural gut-brain signalling pathways of satiety that are normally induced by meal intake. To develop slow release food additives, their processing in the gastrointestinal tract has to be understood; therefore, we start from a general description of the digestive system and relate that to in vitro modelling, satiety and lipolytic mechanisms. The effects of physicochemical lipid composition, encapsulation matrix and interfacial structure on lipolysis are emphasized. We give an overview of techniques and materials used, and discuss partitioning, which may be a key factor for encapsulation performance. Targeted release capsules that delay lipolysis form a real challenge {{because of the high}} efficiency of the digestive system; hardly any proof was found that intact orally ingested lipids can be released in the ileum and thereby <b>induce</b> <b>satiety.</b> We expect that this challenge could be tackled with structured o/w-emulsion-based systems that have some protection against lipase, e. g., by hindering bile salt adsorption and/or delaying lipase diffusion...|$|E

40|$|Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is a gut-derived {{endogenous}} lipid that stimulates vagal fibers to <b>induce</b> <b>satiety.</b> Our {{previous work}} {{has shown that}} peripherally administered OEA activates c-fos transcription in {{the nucleus of the}} solitary tract (NST) and in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), where it enhances oxytocin (OXY) expression. The anorexigenic action of OEA is prevented by the intracerebroventricular administration of a selective OXY receptor antagonist, suggesting a necessary role of OXYergic mediation of OEA's effect. The NST is the source of direct noradrenergic afferent input to hypothalamic OXY neurons, and therefore, we hypothesized that the activation of this pathway might mediate OEA effects on PVN neurons. To test this hypothesis, we subjected rats to intra-PVN administration of the toxin saporin (DSAP) conjugated to an antibody against dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) to destroy hindbrain noradrenergic neurons. In these rats we evaluated the effects of OEA (10 mg/kg, ip) on feeding behavior, on c-Fos and OXY immunoreactivity in the PVN, and on OXY immunoreactivity in the posterior pituitary gland. We found that the DSAP lesion completely prevented OEA's effects on food intake, on Fos and OXY expression in the PVN, and on OXY immunoreactivity of the posterior pituitary gland; all effects were maintained in sham-operated rats.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of obesity has increased rapidly worldwide {{and the importance of}} considering the role of diet in the prevention and treatment of obesity is widely acknowledged. This paper reviews data on the effects of dietary carbohydrates on body fatness. Does the composition of the diet as related to carbohydrates affect the likelihood of passive over-consumption and long-term weight change? In addition, methodological limitations of both observational and experimental studies of dietary composition and body weight are discussed. Carbohydrates are among the macronutrients that provide energy and can thus contribute to excess energy intake and subsequent weight gain. There is no clear evidence that altering the proportion of total carbohydrate in the diet is an important determinant of energy intake. However, there is evidence that sugar-sweetened beverages do not <b>induce</b> <b>satiety</b> to the same extent as solid forms of carbohydrate, and that increases in sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption are associated with weight gain. Findings from studies on the effect of the dietary glycemic index on body weight have not been consistent. Dietary fiber is associated with a lesser degree of weight gain in observational studies. Although it is difficult to establish with certainty that fiber rather than other dietary attributes are responsible, whole-grain cereals, vegetables, legumes and fruits seem to be the most appropriate sources of dietary carbohydrate. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group...|$|E

Endocannabinoids and their G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) are a current research {{focus in the}} area of obesity due to the system’s role in food intake and glucose and lipid metabolism. Importantly, overweight and obese individuals often have higher circulating levels of the arachidonic acid-derived endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2 -arachidonoyl glycerol (2 -AG) and an altered pattern of receptor expression. Consequently, this leads to an increase in orexigenic stimuli, changes in fatty acid synthesis, insulin sensitivity, and glucose utilisation, with preferential energy storage in adipose tissue. As endocannabinoids are products of dietary fats, modification of dietary intake may modulate their levels, with eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid based endocannabinoids being able to displace arachidonic acid from cell membranes, reducing AEA and 2 -AG production.

We found Sptr expression is required in four adult neurons that express neuropeptide F (NPF), the fly homologue of the vertebrate appetite regulator neuropeptide Y (NPY). As expected, feeding flies BH 4 rescues the loss of Punch and Purple in the fat body {{and the loss of}} Sptr in NPF neurons.

40|$|Oleylethanolamide (OEA) is a {{naturally}} occurring lipid that regulates satiety and body weight. Although structurally {{related to the}} endogenous cannabinoid anandamide, OEA does not bind to cannabinoid receptors and its molecular targets have not been defined. Here we show that OEA binds with high affinity to the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), a nuclear receptor that regulates several aspects of lipid metabolism. Administration of OEA produces satiety and reduces body weight gain in wild-type mice, but not in mice deficient in PPAR-alpha. Two distinct PPAR-alpha agonists have similar effects that are also contingent on PPAR-alpha expression, whereas potent and selective agonists for PPAR-gamma and PPAR-beta/delta are ineffective. In the small intestine of wild-type but not PPAR-alpha-null mice, OEA regulates the expression of several PPAR-alpha target genes: it initiates the transcription of proteins involved in lipid metabolism and represses inducible nitric oxide synthase, an enzyme that may contribute to feeding stimulation.

Twenty four obese women with body mass index greater than 30 kg/m 2 from an obesity clinic were studied. Twelve had the balloon and 12 the sham procedure. The balloon was removed after three months and the patients were followed for a further three months.

As thylakoid membranes themselves are nutrients, containing lipids and proteins, {{it is of}} interest to study the digestion of thylakoids by enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract. Thylakoid membranes were treated with pepsin, trypsin, gastric and pancreatic juice at 37 degrees C and the resulting enzymatic breakdown was analyzed by gel electrophoresis, electron microscopy and mass spectroscopy. In all cases, several of the proteins were degraded within half an hour, while the main parts of the pigment-protein complexes were resistant for hours. Oil emulsified thylakoids were more resistant towards the enzymatic breakdown. Electron microscopy demonstrated that, after treatments, the thylakoids still remained in a membrane vesicular form. The capacity of thylakoid membranes to inhibit the lipase/colipase activity was partly reduced in all cases. About 50 % of the inhibition capacity remained after treatment with pancreatic juice when the thylakoids were present in an oil emulsion. Delipidated thylakoids and plasma membranes, which lack the photosynthetic pigments, were degraded rapidly by pancreatic juice. Conclusion: The pigments, closely bound to the trans-membrane helices of thylakoid membrane proteins protect these from digestion by pepsin, trypsin, gastric and pancreatic juice.

This effect {{is due to}} their ability to reduce the rate of lipolysis through the inhibition of the lipase-colipase complex. They have a strong affinity to oil which both prevents the lipolytic enzymes from in close contact with its substrate {{and at the same time}} protects the thylakoids form proteolytic enzymes present in gastric juices form digesting the thylakoids as quickly. This affinity also imparts thylakoids interesting emulsification properties. The objective of this study was to characterize thylakoids’ ability to stabilize oil-in-water emulsions, and to study their interfacial properties in light of their capacity to inhibit pancreatic lipase-co lipase activity in vitro. As lipolysis is an inherently interfacial process it is important to quantify their interfacial properties and to maximize the oil-water interfacial area covered by the thylakoids in future food formulations. Thylakoids isolated from spinach were used for emulsification studies using a lab-scale high shear homogenizer. The oil-in-water emulsions produced had varying amounts of thylakoids and resulting emulsions were characterized by creaming phase volume, microscopy and light scattering to determine microstructure and droplet size distributions as well as surface load. Electron micrographs showed thylakoids adsorbed as loosely bunched vesicles on the drop surfaces approximately 1 micron in size, and were found to effectively stabilize the oil water interface, but with large droplet size (20 to 200 micron range) and relatively high surface loads (2 to 10 mg/m 2) ...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackground & aims: Infusion of fat {{into the}} small {{intestine}} <b>induces</b> <b>satiety.</b> Reducing fat droplet size accelerates fat digestion, but the effect on satiety after ileal fat infusion is not known. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare the effects of fat emulsions differing in droplet size (fine, coarse) infused in either duodenum or ileum on satiety, gastric emptying and peptide secretion. MethodsIn a randomized single-blind crossover study 15 healthy volunteers received, after intubation with a nasoileal tube, 4 different treatments on 4 consecutive days. After consumption of a liquid meal, 6  g of fine or coarse fat emulsion was infused into duodenum or ileum. Study parameters were satiety, gastric emptying and gut peptides. These parameters were statistically evaluated using ANCOVA. ResultsIn the duodenum, Fine emulsion significantly reduced hunger, increased fullness, delayed gastric emptying, but did not affect peptide secretion versus Coarse. In the ileum, Fine emulsion did not affect hunger, fullness, or gastric emptying, but significantly increased peptide secretion versus Coarse. ConclusionsCompared to larger fat droplets, smaller droplets significantly affect satiety, gastric emptying and gut peptide release, but with the effect being dependent on the intestinal location of fat delivery.

40|$|Previous {{studies in}} animals showed that {{phenolic}} compounds can reduce weight and food intake. However, the exact mechanism(s) behind these effects are still unknown. Cholecystokinin (CCK) hormone signaling pathway {{plays an important}} role in the regulation of food intake. CCK <b>induces</b> <b>satiety</b> by binding on its specific receptor (CCK 1 R), hereby reducing food intake. In this study, we investigated the possible interactions of 8 phenolic compounds from different classes (tannic acid, gallic acid, benzoic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, quercetin, kaempferol and resveratrol) with the CCK 1 R signaling pathway. We used a cell-based bioassay with Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing the rat CCK 1 R. Our results showed that the tested phenolic compounds could not activate the CCK 1 R. On contrary, we observed an anti-CCK 1 R activity. This antagonistic action might be explained by blocking of the functioning of the CCK 1 R receptor and/or by a sequestration activity of the CCK hormone. In conclusion, the reported activity of phenolic compounds in literature with a reduction in food intake and weight is not based on an activation of the CCK 1 R and could involve other mechanisms/ signaling pathways which are still needed to be investigated...|$|R
40|$|Endocannabinoids {{and their}} G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) are a current {{research}} {{focus in the}} area of obesity due to the system’s role in food intake and glucose and lipid metabolism. Importantly, overweight and obese individuals often have higher circulating levels of the arachidonic acid-derived endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2 -arachidonoyl glycerol (2 -AG) and an altered pattern of receptor expression. Consequently, this leads to an increase in orexigenic stimuli, changes in fatty acid synthesis, insulin sensitivity, and glucose utilisation, with preferential energy storage in adipose tissue. As endocannabinoids are products of dietary fats, modification of dietary intake may modulate their levels, with eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid based endocannabinoids being able to displace arachidonic acid from cell membranes, reducing AEA and 2 -AG production. Similarly, oleoyl ethanolamide, a product of oleic acid, <b>induces</b> <b>satiety,</b> decreases circulating fatty acid concentrations, increases the capacity for β-oxidation, and is capable of inhibiting the action of AEA and 2 -AG in adipose tissue. Thus, understanding how dietary fats alter endocannabinoid system activity is a pertinent area of research due to public health messages promoting a shift towards plant-derived fats, which are rich sources of AEA and 2 -AG precursor fatty acids, possibly encouraging excessive energy intake and weight gain.
