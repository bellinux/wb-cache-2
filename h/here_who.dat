In 1943 Riga Ghetto prisoners were brought <b>here</b> <b>who</b> were unable to work at Kaiserwald concentration camp, followed by those from the camp itself unable to work in 1944.

25|$|University Park (UPK) is {{a complex}} of two story {{buildings}} that include 40 studio, 86 one-bedroom, and 80 two-bedroom unfurnished apartments. UPK is located near the URMC, directly across from Southside off of Kendrick Road. Graduate {{students and their families}} are the primary occupants of these apartments, but some non-traditional undergraduate students are housed <b>here</b> <b>who</b> have been deemed too old for traditional undergraduate housing on the River Campus.

25|$|The {{divide between}} rich and poor can be seen in areas such as Atenas Street. Here, next to the Palacio de Covian, the site of the Secretary of the Government, there is a {{building}} damaged by the 1985 earthquake in which nine families live illegally. These families do not pay rent and the owner wants to evict them. These families earn money by selling crafts on the sidewalks in the colonia or by washing clothes. There are families that live on the streets <b>here</b> <b>who</b> survive on 20 pesos a day.|$|E
25|$|Cemeteries for {{deceased}} {{prisoners were}} gradually opened near the camps. It {{was a point}} of honour for the survivors {{to take care of}} their comrades’ final resting places. Most often, each nationality had its own reserved patch. In certain camps, such as Gardelegen, veritable monuments were erected. Roger Pelletier motivated his comrades: “Doesn’t it fall to us, who have known them, to all of us <b>here</b> <b>who</b> are their great family, to raise, in the cemetery where they rest, a monument of the French soul that, spreading above them like an aegis, will be above our dead, when we have left, as a memory and a goodbye?” Wilhelm Doegen estimates the number of dead in the camps at 118,159 but serious doubts surround this number, notably because Doegen failed to take certain diseases into account. Also according to Doegen, Russia suffered the heaviest losses (perhaps explained by the poorer nutrition of Russians, most of whom did not receive packages from their families) with a little over 70,000 dead, followed by France with 17,069 deaths, Romania with 12,512, and then Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E

He {{was considered one of}} the top Canadians committing to an NCAA program that year, in a list headlined by Andrew Nicholson and Kris Joseph. As soon as he arrived at EKU, he became close with the school. Oppong said, [...] "From the first day, I was accepted, as soon as I stepped on campus. I was here in the summertime and there were a few guys <b>here</b> <b>who</b> I knew and as soon as we came in August, I felt like I was part of the family."

500|$|Sam Huff, a linebacker, was {{inducted}} in 1982. Originally a third round selection by the New York Giants in the 1956 NFL Draft, Huff {{played for the}} Giants from 1956–1963 and later for the Washington Redskins from 1964–1969. Huff's football career, let alone his future in the NFL, [...] almost never came to pass, however. [...] As a junior in high school, WVU head coach Art Lewis came to Huff's town to look at another prospect. Luckily for Huff (and for the Mountaineers), Lewis wound up recruiting Sam instead. Fate intervened once more for Huff {{at the end of}} his collegiate career, as Giants scout Al DeRogatis came to Morgantown to look at All-American guard Bruce Bosley. DeRogatis instead discovered Huff, proclaiming that [...] "there's another guard <b>here</b> <b>who</b> will be even greater. His name is Sam Huff." [...] Huff became a five-time Pro Bowl selection, a four-time First-Team All-Pro selection, an inductee in the NFL 1950s All-Decade Team, and was named as one of the 70 Greatest Redskins of all-time. Huff was also recognized as the NFL's Top Linebacker in 1959.|$|E
500|$|... {{is one of}} the few Australian artists <b>here</b> <b>who</b> {{combines}} a firm technique with a sensitive and rich emotion. In some of the lighter landscapes in this exhibition, Miss Bellette seems to have been trying to solve some of the particular difficulties of painting Australian landscapes. The clear, strong light tends to flatten the form and bleach the colour; a problem that doesn't lend itself to the dramatic tensions and dark moods that are characteristic of her work. It requires a colder and more dispassionate approach. But when she finds landscapes to her taste, such as the rugged hills and beetling clouds in No. 8, the earth decaying with erosion in No. 19, or the prickly desolation of [...] "Rough Country", No. 14, she handles them with great skill and effectiveness. Her figure drawings are decisively drawn and firmly modelled. The girls have a pensive dignity as though they are pondering the burdens and joylessness of a future to be spent as caryatids. The still lives and the interior are admirable exercises in formal organisation, the colours being sombre yet rich.|$|E

[...] During the [...] "heartwarming" [...] musical sequence, Esmeralda [...] "pray selflessly {{on behalf of the}} world's outcasts." [...] "illed with religious imagery," [...] the song [...] "sum up everything that [...] stands for". Meanwhile, an earnest Quasimodo, enamored with Esmeralda's beauty and sincerity, hides in the bell tower, [...] "overhearing her prayer" [...] and [...] "being drawn down to her." ...|$|E

500|$|When a {{group of}} about 50 ZANU–PF activists briefly invaded Gwenoro in May 2000, Smith played down the incident, saying the intruders were just bored and out of work. [...] "There's no {{politics}} on the farm," [...] he said. Five months later, in England to address the Oxford Union, Smith described Mugabe as [...] "mentally deranged". The President announced in response that Smith would be arrested and tried for genocide if he ever came back to Zimbabwe, a threat that Smith mocked. [...] "I would love that. Let him try it," [...] he said—"It would give me the chance to tell the world the truth about this gangster... I will give him the date and time of arrival of my plane so he can meet me at the airport." [...] A mass of reporters descended on Harare International Airport on 7 November 2000 to witness Smith's arrest, but far from being detained, the former Prime Minister was greeted cheerily by immigration officers and allowed through without any obstruction. Telling the waiting pressmen that he was disappointed not to have met any confrontation, he commented: [...] "We have a president <b>here</b> <b>who</b> is mentally unstable and makes statements that have no bearing on reality", and went home unmolested.|$|E
500|$|Though Sakic {{was a quiet}} individual, he {{was able}} to motivate his team to play at higher levels, which earned him the respect of his peers and executives. The first signs of Sakic's {{leadership}} began to show while still a member of the Swift Current Broncos of the WHL. After the bus crash that killed four of his teammates, Sakic was seen {{as the leader of the}} team, acknowledging that the experience changed his outlook on life. Early in his career with the Nordiques (when Mike Hough was still captain), with the team hoping to rebuild around their top draft pick Eric Lindros, and holding onto Lindros' rights for the season when he refused to sign, Sakic suggested that the team could progress without Lindros, saying, [...] "We only want players <b>here</b> <b>who</b> have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here and there are a lot of others in this locker room who really care about the game." [...] Lindros was traded a year later, bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. Sakic's leadership qualities led him to be courted by other teams, such as in the summer of 1997, when the New York Rangers offered him a large contract in order to replace departed captain Mark Messier, though the Avalanche ultimately matched the offer and retained Sakic.|$|E
500|$|In 1989–90, {{his second}} NHL season, Sakic {{was able to}} switch his number back to his {{familiar}} #19 (Alain Côté had retired over the summer), and scored 102 points, which was ninth overall in the league. At {{the start of the}} next season, 1990–91, he was named co-captain along with Steven Finn (Sakic was captain for home games, Finn for away games) and again passed the 100 point mark, improving to 109 points and sixth overall in the league, but would slip during 1991–92 to 94 points, having missed 11 games. Early on in the season, Sakic showed some of his leadership qualities, even while Mike Hough was serving as captain, as he stood firm in the Eric Lindros holdout issue. With Lindros holding out against the Nordiques, who were one of the worst teams in league, Sakic commented, [...] "We only want players <b>here</b> <b>who</b> have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here {{and there are a lot}} of others in this locker room who really care about the game." [...] Lindros was traded a year later, ending the situation and bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. During their first four seasons with Joe Sakic, the Nordiques finished last place in the Adams Division and last in the entire league for three straight years, from 1989 to 1991.|$|E

500|$|My lads, {{you must}} all have {{observed}} the great {{increase in the}} enemy's force, and the threatening posture they have assumed. I {{have reason to believe}} they will attack us this night. I do not wish to conceal our real state, because I do not believe there is a man <b>here</b> <b>who</b> is afraid to face any sort of danger. We {{are in a position to}} defend ourselves against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act here. I have not observed that they have any muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E
500|$|With {{his career}} on hold, Hunt {{continued}} recording new songs and demos, posting {{them on his}} MySpace page, while Popular gained exposure among listeners through online music sharing. In 2009, he released the compilation album Use in Case of Emergency as a free download through his website. It featured previously unreleased material recorded by Hunt prior to Popular. He also continued touring, worked on an autobiographical book of short stories, entitled Tales of Friction, and studied classical piano. Hunt also took up photography after his girlfriend purchased him a camera. He started {{out on the streets}} of Los Angeles, where he photographed subjects on street corners and discarded objects, including furniture and numerous couches he found abandoned on the streets. In an interview for PopMatters, he explained how his photographying of people there inspired him: [...] "It's sad as you can quite imagine. It's also kind of welcoming to me. Sometimes I do get {{a chance to talk to}} them and hear a bit of their story. I'm not the only one out <b>here</b> <b>who</b> had an idea of trying to make it happen. Some of us are luckier than others. Some of us are more prepared than others. That's just the truth of the situation." [...] Along with photography, he was stimulated creatively after reading Legs McNeil's 1997 book Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk and relating to its themes of artistic frustration and rebelliousness.|$|E
500|$|Cuse and Lindelof {{admitted}} they took some {{inspiration from the}} final episode of , [...] "", where Captain Picard jumps between three time frames. The Lost writers compared Minkowski's role to Q, as [...] "someone who is undergoing and understands the same events as our protagonist". Faraday, on the other hand, was the expert that always appears in time travel fiction—as Lindelof put it, [...] "He's our Doc Brown <b>here,</b> <b>who</b> basically is gonna tell the protagonist to go and find him in the past". Whereas the average Lost episode took two weeks to plan and write, [...] "The Constant" [...] took five because the writers experienced difficulty when determining its effect on future stories. Popular Mechanics analyzed the possibility of time travel using Losts rules. [...] Michio Kaku claimed that [...] "the show's producers did their homework". [...] According to Kaku, [...] "there's no law of physics preventing this kind of time travel—just a lack of know-how… {{it would take a}} very advanced civilization to really do this". [...] Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] try to use enough science to give a sense of credibility". [...] "The Constant" [...] was the first episode set on the Kahana, but the writers decided to avoid using the new setting just to give new information—Lindelof has declared that [...] "you would have mindless exposition unless the characters were {{in a constant state of}} crisis". According to Lindelof, Desmond's confusion prevents the characters who arrived from the island from asking questions to the freighter's crew.|$|E
