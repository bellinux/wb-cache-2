5|$|Edward Grant, a {{historian}} of science, {{has provided evidence}} that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the celestial spheres to be solid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not consider them solid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> hard. The consensus was that the celestial spheres were made {{of some kind of}} continuous fluid.|$|E
5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun {{is the subject of a}} finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of civic or {{municipal}} botanical gardens were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries.

They were botanical gardens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> building up collections of plants and exchanging seeds with other gardens around the world, although their collection policies were determined by those in day-to-day charge of them. They tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were, indeed, often under general parks administrations.|$|E
