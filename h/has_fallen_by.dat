5|$|The {{price of}} PV modules per MW <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>by</b> 60 {{percent since the}} summer of 2008, {{according}} to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates, putting solar power {{for the first time}} on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries. Wind turbine prices have also fallen – by 18 percent per MW in the last two years – reflecting, as with solar, fierce competition in the supply chain. Further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar, wind and other technologies lie ahead, posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years.|$|E

EU-India trade in goods as a percentage of India's total trade has continuously declined going from 26.5% in 1996-97 (EU15) to 13.9% in 2011-12, 13.2% in 2013-14 (EU27) before a slight upturn to 13.3% in 2014-15 (EU28).|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} of Aarau grew continuously from 1800 until about 1960, {{when the city}} reached a peak {{population of}} 17,045, {{more than five times}} its population in 1800. However, since 1960 the population <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>by</b> 8%. There are three reasons for this population loss: firstly, since the completion of Telli (a large apartment complex), the city has not had any more considerable land developments. Secondly, the number of people per household has fallen; thus, the existing dwellings do not hold as many people. Thirdly, population growth was absorbed by neighboring municipalities in the regional urban area, and numerous citizens of Aarau moved into the countryside. This trend might have stopped {{since the turn of the}} 21st century. Existing industrial developments are being used for new purposes instead of standing empty.|$|E
25|$|Many Faroese {{consider}} the whale meat {{an important part}} of their food culture and history. Animal rights groups criticize the slaughter as being cruel and unnecessary. In November 2008, Høgni Debes Joensen, chief medical officer of the Faroe Islands and Pál Weihe, scientist, have recommended {{in a letter to the}} Faroese government that pilot whales should no longer be considered fit for human consumption because of the high level of mercury, PCB and DDT derivatives. However, the Faroese government did not forbid whaling. On 1 July 2011 the Faroese Food and Veterinary Authority announced their recommendation regarding the safety of eating meat and blubber from the pilot whale, which was not as strict as the one of the chief medical officer. The new recommendation says only one dinner with whale meat and blubber per month, with a special recommendation for younger women, girls, pregnant women and breastfeeding women. From 2002 to 2009 the PCB concentration in whale meat <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>by</b> 75%, DDT values in the same time period have fallen by 70% and mercury levels have also fallen.|$|E
25|$|Mallow {{is invited}} to tour a steel foundry {{belonging}} to Korell's government, where he notes guards carrying atomic handguns. He is {{surprised to discover that}} these weapons bear the markings of the Galactic Empire, which the Foundation assumes <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>by</b> this time. Mallow's discoveries lead him to believe that the Empire may be attempting to expand into the Periphery again, and has been providing weapons to client states such as Korell. Leaving the Republic and his ship, he journeys alone to the planet Siwenna, which he believes may be the capital of an Imperial province. He finds Siwenna a desolate and sad place, and meets the now-impoverished former patrician Onum Barr in the latter's isolated mansion, which is slowly crumbling. Barr, a former provincial senator and a leading citizen, had served in the Imperial government on Siwenna during a fairly stable time several decades earlier, before a series of corrupt and ambitious viceroys who each harbored dreams of becoming Emperor. After the previous viceroy rebelled against the Emperor, Barr participated in a revolution that overthrew the viceroy. However, the Imperial fleet also sent to remove the viceroy wanted to conquer a rebellious province even if it was no longer in rebellion, and began a massacre that claimed the lives of all but one of Barr's children.|$|E

25|$|Forest {{products}} {{have always been}} a staple to the economy, comprising 1% of the total gross state output and 9% of total manufacturing as of 2013. In 2007 Windham County contained the largest concentration of kilns for drying lumber east of the Mississippi River. The decline of farms has resulted in a regrowth of Vermont's forests due to ecological succession. Today, most of Vermont's forests are secondary. The state and non-profit organizations are actively encouraging regrowth and careful forest management. Over 78% of the land area of the state is forested compared to only 37% forest in 1880s when sheep farming was at its peak and large amounts of acreage were cleared for grazing land. Over 85% of that area is non-industrial, private forestland owned by individuals or families. In 2013 73.054 million cubic feet of wood was harvested in Vermont. A large amount of Vermont forest products are exports with 21.504 million feet being shipped overseas plus an additional 16.384 million cubic feet to Canada. Most of it was processed within the state. In this century the manufacture of wood products <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>by</b> almost half. The annual net growth has been estimated at 172.810 million cubic feet. The USDA estimates that 8.584 billion cubic feet remain in the state. Forest products also add to carbon sequestration since lumber and timber used in houses and furniture hold carbon {{for long periods of time}} while the trees that were removed are replaced overtime with new growing stock. While wood pellets are replacing coal in European power plants reducing CO2 emissions by up to 90% and preventing mountaintop removal for coal mining.|$|E
500|$|An example several {{commentators}} {{point to}} is a 2014 study funded by Save the Elephants {{that found that}} the price of ivory tripled in China during four years following 2011. It correlated that trend to an increase in poaching as well as an increase in the frequency of high-profile events in which stockpiles were destroyed. Research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research offer an alternative theory: that the increase in price and demand [...] "likely originated" [...] with CITES's experimental allowance of a legal sale of a large amount of ivory in 2008. More recently, however, Save the Elephants reported the cost of ivory in China <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>by</b> nearly half, following an announcement by the Chinese government that it would phase out its domestic trade. In Japan, the demand for ivory has decreased since 2012 as a result of new consumer awareness through education about the connection between buying ivory and the killing of elephants.|$|E

2500|$|Oil parity is the LNG {{price that}} would be {{equal to that of}} crude oil on a Barrel of oil {{equivalent}} basis.

[...] In 2009, in several spot cargo deals especially in East Asia, oil parity approached the full oil parity or even exceeds oil parity. In January 2016, the spot LNG price (5.461 US$/mmbtu) has broken oil parity when the Brent crude price (≤32 US$/bbl) has fallen steeply.

2500|$|As of 2011, {{the price}} of PV modules <b>has</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>by</b> 60% since the summer of 2008, {{according}} to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates, putting solar power {{for the first time}} on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries; an alternative and consistent price decline figure of 75% from 2007 to 2012 has also been published, though it is unclear whether these figures are specific to the United States or generally global. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) from PV is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions, particularly when the time of generation is included, as electricity is worth more during the day than at night. There has been fierce competition in the supply chain, and further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar lie ahead, posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years.
