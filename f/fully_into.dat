He turns into a bitter, arrogant, and lonely man after finding that the fame does not fill the void in his life. Khatana is now his manager, but fails to control him, and Jordan is constantly involved in fights with the media and fans. Inspite of all this, he remains a highly popular artist.|$|E
5|$|Henry II succeeded to {{the throne}} {{at the end of}} the Anarchy but during the revolt of 1173–74 he faced a {{significant}} uprising led by his son, Henry, backed by the French crown. The conflict spread across England and Kenilworth was garrisoned by Henry II's forces; Geoffrey II de Clinton died in this period and the castle was taken <b>fully</b> <b>into</b> royal possession, a sign of its military importance. The Clintons themselves moved on to Buckinghamshire. By this point Kenilworth Castle consisted of the great keep, the inner bailey wall, a basic causeway across the smaller lake that preceded the creation of the Great Mere, and the local chase for hunting.|$|E
5|$|In 1164-65 Manuel's cousin Andronikos, {{the future}} emperor, escaped from captivity in Byzantium and {{fled to the}} court of Yaroslav in Galicia. This situation, holding out the {{alarming}} prospect of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel's throne sponsored by both Galicia and Hungary, spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry of diplomacy. Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople in 1165. A mission to Kiev, then ruled by Prince Rostislav, resulted in a favourable treaty and a pledge to supply the Empire with auxiliary troops; Yaroslav of Galicia was also persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return <b>fully</b> <b>into</b> the imperial fold. As late as 1200 the princes of Galicia were providing invaluable services against the enemies of the Empire, at that time the Cumans.|$|E

5|$|US223 {{returns to}} a due west track as it crosses {{a branch of}} the Norfolk Southern Railway, and the roadway {{approaches}} the outskirts of Adrian. The highway runs along the southern city limits for Adrian as it meets M-52. The only business loop for US223 runs north of this intersection with M-52 into downtown Adrian while US223 continues through this secondary business corridor south and west of town. US223 crosses Beaver Creek and then intersects M-34 on the western city line in a residential section of Adrian. As US223 crosses <b>fully</b> <b>into</b> the city of Adrian, it continues northwesterly, then turns due west at the intersection were it meets its business loop's western terminus. Outside of town, the highway cross through more farmland continuing to northwestern Lenawee County.|$|E
25|$|Assyria {{began to}} once more expand from circa. 935 BCE, and Urartu and Assyria became fierce rivals. Urartu {{successfully}} repelled Assyrian expansionism for a time, however from the 9th to 7th century BCE it progressively lost territory to Assyria. It was to survive until the 7th century BCE, {{by which time}} it was conquered <b>fully</b> <b>into</b> the Neo Assyrian Empire (911–605 BCE).|$|E

25|$|Of the six {{orders of}} Pulmonata, two – the Onchidiacea and Soleolifera – solely {{comprise}} slugs. A third family, the Sigmurethra, contains various clades of snails, semi-slugs (i.e. snails whose shells {{are too small}} for them to retract <b>fully</b> <b>into)</b> and slugs. The taxonomy of this group {{is in the process}} of being revised in light of DNA sequencing. It appears that pulmonates are paraphyletic and basal to the opisthobranchs, which are a terminal branch of the tree. The family Ellobiidae are also polyphyletic.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2015–16 season, {{the league}} was {{expanded}} to 14 teams, accomplished by relegating only the last-place finisher in that season and promoting {{the top three}} teams from the 1st division. The 2016–17 season is the first for a new league structure. It begins with the teams playing a full home-and-away schedule, resulting in 26 matches for each team. At that time, the league splits into a six-team championship playoff and an eight-team qualifying playoff. All teams' table points and goals carry over <b>fully</b> <b>into</b> the playoffs.|$|E

25|$|The {{territory}} of modern Ukraine has been inhabited since 32,000 BC. During the Middle Ages, {{the area was}} a key centre of East Slavic culture, with the powerful state of Kievan Rus' forming the basis of Ukrainian identity. Following its fragmentation in the 13th century, the territory was contested, ruled and divided {{by a variety of}} powers, including Lithuania, Poland, the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary, and Russia. A Cossack republic emerged and prospered during the 17th and 18th centuries, but its territory was eventually split between Poland and the Russian Empire, and later merged <b>fully</b> <b>into</b> Russia.|$|E
25|$|Fanshawe was {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} elastic defence, where a lightly garrisoned front line would delay an enemy attack, and then a strong counter-attack would recapture lost ground, and had been training 48th Division in this mould since he took command in 1915; the Italian theatre was the first opportunity to put this approach <b>fully</b> <b>into</b> practice. The 48th Division was attacked on 15 June 1918 by the Austrians at the Battle of the Piave River; {{in keeping with the}} plan, leading elements fell back and a counter-attack was organised, recapturing the lost ground and stalling the offensive entirely.|$|E
25|$|The Walser {{emigrated from}} the Val Formazza Walser around 1240 {{at the request}} of the Lombardy rulers and the Capitanei of Locarno who needed a band of mercenaries. In 1244, a noble family from Locarno and the villagers of Losone leased from the {{pastures}} around the village. Later these pastures passed <b>fully</b> <b>into</b> their possession. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the Walser colony survived almost totally isolated. The rare contacts with the outside world were more with the Val Formazza or Valais than from the rest of Ticino. The geographic isolation strengthened the independent living habits and traditions of the village. The town was frequently buried by avalanches.|$|E

25|$|Most {{languages}} in the Athabaskan family have tone. However, this feature evolved independently in all subgroups; Proto-Athabaskan had no tones. In each case, tone evolved from glottalic consonants {{at the ends}} of morphemes; however, the progression of these consonants into tones has not been consistent, with some related morphemes being pronounced with high tones in some Athabaskan languages and low tones in others. It has been posited that Navajo and Chipewyan, which have no common ancestor more recent than Proto-Athabaskan and possess many pairs of corresponding but opposite tones, evolved from different dialects of Proto-Athabaskan that pronounced these glottalic consonants differently. Proto-Athabaskan diverged <b>fully</b> <b>into</b> separate languages circa 500 BC.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese {{brought to}} India a {{particularly}} militant brand of Christianity, {{the product of}} several centuries of struggle during the Reconquista, which they hoped to spread across the world. Facilitating this objective was the Padroado Real, a series of treaties and decrees in which the Pope conferred upon the Portuguese government certain authority in ecclesiastical matters in the foreign territories they conquered. Upon reaching India the Portuguese quickly ensconced themselves in Goa and established a church hierarchy; soon they set themselves to bringing the native Christians under their dominion. Towards this goal, the colonial establishment {{felt it necessary to}} conduct the Saint Thomas Christians <b>fully</b> <b>into</b> the Latin Rite, both in bringing them into conformity with Latin church customs and in subjecting them to the authority of the Archbishop of Goa.|$|E

They are members of the Assembly of the League of Nations, and their representatives have already attended meetings of the League. In other words, they have achieved full national status and they now stand beside the United Kingdom as equal partners in the dignities and responsibilities of the British Commonwealth. If there are any means by which that status can be rendered even more clear to their own communities and to the world at large, we shall be glad to have them put forward.|$|E

25|$|SR 674 {{was first}} {{designated}} in 1937 and has generally always {{followed the same}} US 22-Canal Winchester alignment. However, at its first designation, instead of turning <b>fully</b> <b>into</b> Franklin County at Lithopolis Road as it does today, it continued north into downtown Canal Winchester ending at Waterloo Street (then SR 31, became US 33 one year later). When US 33 was moved onto a bypass north of Canal Winchester by 1953, SR 674 was extended north along West Waterloo Street to end at an intersection with the new bypass. When US 33 was converted to a freeway {{in the area in}} the 1960s, SR 674 was extended slightly to the west to end at a new interchange with US 33. Between 1992 and 1995, the route was routed out of the center of Canal Winchester on the alignment it runs today.|$|E
25|$|In general, placenames of Welsh origin {{are found}} {{to the west of}} the border, and those of English origin to the east. However, many {{historically}} Welsh names are also found east of the border, particularly around Oswestry in northern Shropshire, such as Gobowen; in southern Shropshire, such as Clun; and in southern Herefordshire, such as Kilpeck and Pontrilas. Most of these areas were not incorporated <b>fully</b> <b>into</b> England until the 16th century, and native Welsh speakers still lived there until at least the 19th century. Equally, placenames of English origin can be found on the Welsh side of the border where there was Mercian and Norman settlement, particularly in the north east, such as Flint and Prestatyn; in English Maelor, such as Overton; in central Powys, such as Newtown and Knighton; in south Pembrokeshire and Gower; and in south-eastern Monmouthshire, including Chepstow and Shirenewton.|$|E
25|$|This {{style of}} connector, {{produced}} by Italian manufacturer BTicino, {{appeared in the}} 1960s and was intended {{as an alternative to}} the Europlug or CEI 23-16 connectors then in use. The socket is an almost rectangular socket, with one or more lateral key pins and indentations to prevent inverting the polarised plug, or connecting plugs and sockets with different current ratings. At least four models were produced: three single-phase general purpose connectors rated respectively 10 A, 16 A and 20 A; plus a three-phase industrial connector rated 10 A; all of them have different key-pin positioning so plugs and sockets cannot be mismatched. The socket is closed by a safety lid (bearing the word ‘’Magic’’ on it) which can be opened only with an even pressure on its surface, thus preventing the insertion of objects (except the plug itself) inside the socket. The contacts are blades positioned on both sides of the plug; the plug is energized only when it is inserted <b>fully</b> <b>into</b> the socket.|$|E
