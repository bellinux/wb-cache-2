He later wrote: [...] "After more than forty years, we have had no third world war, and the balance of nuclear terror... may have helped to prevent one. But I am {{not at all sure}} of this; back then, in those long-gone years, the question didn't even arise. What most troubles me now is the instability of the balance, the extreme peril of the current situation, the appalling waste of the arms race... <b>Each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> a responsibility to think about this in global terms, with tolerance, trust, and candor, free from ideological dogmatism, parochial interests, or national egotism." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 3 May 2013 Ecaterina Andronescu, former Minister of Education, professor, {{and member}} of the Social Democratic Party (Romania) {{declared}} in an interview when questioned about legalizing [...] same-sex marriage the following: [...] "You know, to answer this questions it's necessary to give a more extended commentary. On one hand I respect human rights, I know that my freedoms ends where I am interfering with yours, {{but at the same time}} <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> a mission on this earth, we must ensure future generations and this occurs naturally by marriage between men and women. If we go further we would understand that at some point humanity will come to an end if same-sex marriage is proliferated too extensively. That's why I, personally don't believe this is a solution, although I do agree that I must respect each individual's answer to the question [...] "What will he do with his life" [...] " ...|$|E

5000|$|The film puts an {{emphasis}} on the theme of [...] "coincidences". Movie critic George Peluranee notes that [...] "Tokyo Godfathers is a film that shows the small yet significant ties that <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> with supposed strangers, and tells well the story of miracles, family, love, and forgiveness." ...|$|R

6000|$|We parted rather hurriedly on the quay, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>having</b> his own {{pressing}} {{business to}} attend to.

40|$|Oppression often lodges in our bodies, {{stealing}} {{them away}} from us in a myriad of ways. What stories do <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> to tell about this thievery {{and the ways in}} which we resist it, working to reclaim our bodies? Using storytelling, images, and journal writing, this workshop explores these questions and issues across various identities, communities, and systems of oppression...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> a glassful, {{and it was}} delicious; and <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{drank the}} toast, 'Our love at parting.'

6000|$|It {{all came}} back as they talked,--that buoyant {{world of the}} reaper and the binder, when {{harvesting}} {{was a kind of}} Homeric game in which, with rake and scythe, these lusty young sons of the East contended for supremacy in the field. [...] "None <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> an extra dollar," [...] explained Stevens, [...] "but <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> what was better, good health and a faith in the future.

6000|$|... "We have fair interest," [...] Ralph said calmly, [...] "as {{apparently}} you <b>have,</b> yourself. <b>Each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have,</b> you see, used {{our interest}} in the way most pleasing to <b>us.</b> We <b>have</b> used ours to enable us {{to go with the}} army in the field, instead of being forced to remain inactive in Paris.

60|$|<b>Each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> {{a little}} pet new-fledged talent {{which we are}} {{faithfully}} cultivating {{in the hope that}} it will amount to something and soar highly some day.

6000|$|... "Martina," [...] I said, [...] "if I {{have lived}} {{to reach this}} hour, under God it is through you. Martina, they say that <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> a {{guardian}} angel in heaven, and if that be so, mine has come to earth.

6000|$|... "Ay, {{your sister}} is single, and can {{still think of}} her brother; but mine are married, and one letter a year {{would be a great}} deal.

6000|$|... "But <b>each</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> put in seventy-three cents," [...] said Mopsey, hesitatingly, {{after he}} had thought the matter over for several moments.|$|R
60|$|We {{were not}} overly well {{equipped}} {{in the way}} of weapons, although {{it is safe to say}} that <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> a firearm <b>of</b> some sort; but it seemed to give Sergeant Corney the fidgets to see us carrying such a motley collection of guns, and he insisted on making a quantity of wooden muskets to be used in the drill, to the end that we might present a more soldierly appearance when lined up before him.|$|R
5000|$|... "That {{completely}} {{misses the}} point. <b>Each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would <b>have</b> done {{it if we}} had had an unwanted pregnancy. That 'confession' was not a moral action but a political one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The vice-admiral has {{assigned}} to himself {{a division of}} six of the ships, and left me the other five. <b>Each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> his frigates and smaller vessels.

6000|$|... "What {{is the use}} of it?" [...] he said, {{rising from}} his chair as in anger. [...] "Why go back to all that which should be settled between us, as fixed by fate? <b>Each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> given to the other all that each has to give, and the {{partnership}} is complete.

6000|$|... "You {{have had}} your {{share in the}} fight, Zaki, just as I have had.

60|$|From {{the utter}} silence there emerged a deep, regular pat-pat. It was the tread of some animal--the rhythm of soft but heavy pads placed {{cautiously}} upon the ground. It stole slowly round the camp, and then halted near our gateway. There was a low, sibilant rise and fall--the breathing of the creature. Only our feeble hedge separated us from this horror <b>of</b> the night. <b>Each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> seized his rifle, and Lord John had {{pulled out a}} small bush to make an embrasure in the hedge.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was rough}} work, though short, father.

6000|$|... "And {{if they do}} {{not hold}} may the spirits of our {{ancestors}} reward the brave warriors upon the Vanator," [...] replied another of those upon the roof of the palace, [...] "for it will not be long from the moment her cables part before her crew dons the leather of the dead; but yet, Tanus, I believe they will hold.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} {{it has to do}} with; that is what I shall be obliged if you will find out," [...] {{answered}} Sir Robert with some asperity. [...] "One can't divide a matter of this sort into watertight compartments. It is true that in so important a concern <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> charge of his own division, {{but the fact remains that}} we are jointly and severally responsible for the whole. I am not sure that you bear this sufficiently in mind, my dear Vernon," [...] he added with slow emphasis.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Frank, I {{shall not}} try to dissuade you," [...] Abe said.
