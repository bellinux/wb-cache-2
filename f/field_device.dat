A primary shortfall is the ability to identify device components and analyze their lower level functionality. This paper describes the results obtained from hardware tear-downs of ICS <b>field</b> <b>devices.</b> The results demonstrate the ability to identify key components, analyze device firmware and examine backplane protocols – all necessary steps for the dynamic analysis and development of automated security solutions...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{concept was}} to connect as many <b>fields</b> <b>devices</b> {{as possible on}} controller field connection, limited only by signal strength.|$|R
5000|$|A major {{application}} of current loops is {{the industry standard}} 4-20 mA current loop for process control applications, where they are extensively used to carry signals from process instrumentation to PID controllers, SCADA systems, and Programmable logic controllers. They are also used to transmit controller outputs to the modulating <b>field</b> <b>devices</b> such as control valves. These loops have the advantages of simplicity and noise immunity, and have a large international user and equipment supplier base. Some 4-20 mA <b>field</b> <b>devices</b> can be powered by the current loop itself, removing the need for separate power supplies, and the [...] "smart" [...] HART Protocol uses the loop for communications between <b>field</b> <b>devices</b> and controllers. Various Automation Protocols may replace analog current loops, but 4-20 mA is still a principal industrial standard.|$|R
50|$|Different field busses {{can be used}} {{directly}} in the programming system CODESYS. For this purpose, the tool integrates configurators for the most common system such as PROFIBUS, CANopen, EtherCAT, PROFINET and EtherNet/IP. For some systems, additional protocol stacks {{are available in the}} form of CODESYS libraries which can be loaded subsequently.By means of a software plugin in the FDT (<b>Field</b> <b>Device</b> Tool) Frame application, additional device-specific user interfaces from third-party suppliers can be integrated. Communication between these interfaces will be realised through a communication Device Type Manager (DTM).|$|E
5000|$|Based on STANDARD ANSI/ISA S5.1 and ISO 14617-6, the P&ID is {{used for}} the {{identification}} of measurements within the process. The identifications consist of up to 5 letters. The first identification letter is for the measured value, the second is a modifier, 3rd indicates passive/readout function, 4th - active/output function, and the 5th is the function modifier. This is followed by loop number, which is unique to that loop. For instance FIC045 means it is the Flow Indicating Controller in control loop 045. This is also known as the [...] "tag" [...] identifier of the <b>field</b> <b>device,</b> which is normally given to the location and function of the instrument. The same loop may have FT045 - which is the flow transmitter in the same loop.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} PROFIBUS {{goes back to}} a {{publicly}} promoted plan for an association which started in Germany in 1986 and for which 21 companies and institutes devised a master project plan called [...] "fieldbus". The goal was to implement and spread {{the use of a}} bit-serial field bus based on the basic requirements of the <b>field</b> <b>device</b> interfaces. For this purpose, member companies agreed to support a common technical concept for production (i.e. discrete or factory automation) and process automation. First, the complex communication protocol Profibus FMS (Field bus Message Specification), which was tailored for demanding communication tasks, was specified. Subsequently in 1993, the specification for the simpler and thus considerably faster protocol PROFIBUS DP (Decentralised Peripherals) was completed. Profibus FMS is used for (non-deterministic) communication of data between Profibus Masters. Profibus DP is a protocol made for (deterministic) communication between Profibus masters and their remote I/O slaves.|$|E
25|$|There are {{wet and dry}} <b>field</b> {{electrosurgical}} <b>devices.</b> Wet <b>field</b> <b>devices</b> {{operate in}} a saline solution, or in an open wound. Heating is {{as a result of}} an alternating current that passes between two electrodes. Heating is usually greatest where the current density is highest. Therefore, it is usually the smallest or sharpest electrode that generates the most heat.|$|R
50|$|Some radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) tags utilize LF. These tags {{are commonly known as}} LFIDs or LowFIDs (Low Frequency Identification). The LF RFID tags are near <b>field</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Field</b> <b>devices</b> are {{designed}} to be reliable, often incorporating backup power and redundancy in the form of backup I/O cards. If a device is connected to an I/O card that fails, the device automatically gets connected to the redundant I/O. In the absence of this feature, if an input card fails, signals would be lost until the card is replaced. Through the use of SCADA and <b>Field</b> <b>Devices,</b> it becomes possible to monitor and control large scale systems (such as gas pipelines, which cover very large distances) cheaply and efficiently.|$|R
