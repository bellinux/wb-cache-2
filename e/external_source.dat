According to some models, there was insufficient outgassing of water during the Earth's formative period to form the oceans, requiring an <b>external</b> <b>source</b> such as a cometary bombardment.|$|E
5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle {{that can be}} recharged from an <b>external</b> <b>source</b> of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity stored in the rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of {{electric vehicle}}s that includes all-electric or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. In China, plug-in electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an <b>external</b> <b>source</b> of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of different <b>external</b> knowledge <b>sourcing</b> methods on service innovation performance. We identify three <b>external</b> knowledge <b>sourcing</b> methods: informal information transfer, R&D collaboration, and technology outsourcing. Three hypotheses are established {{to examine the relationship}} between these three <b>external</b> knowledge <b>sourcing</b> methods and service innovation. Our result shows that the relationship between the extent of <b>external</b> knowledge <b>sourcing</b> and service innovation performance varies depending on the particular <b>external</b> knowledge <b>sourcing</b> method. This research grants important implication to firms in selecting an appropriate <b>external</b> knowledge <b>sourcing</b> strategy in service industry.

5|$|The {{electrons}} in an atom {{are attracted to}} the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the {{electrons in}}side an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an <b>external</b> <b>source</b> of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound {{near the center of}} the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.|$|E
5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an <b>external</b> <b>source,</b> the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one way or another.|$|E
5|$|Inside of his chansons, {{he often}} used a cantus firmus, {{sometimes}} a popular song whose origin {{can no longer}} be traced, as in Si j'avoye Marion. Other times he used a tune originally associated with a separate text; and still other times he freely composed an entire song, using no apparent <b>external</b> <b>source</b> material. Another technique he sometimes used was to take a popular song and write it as a canon with itself, in two inner voices, and write new melodic material above and around it, to a new text: he used this technique in one of his most famous chansons, Faulte d'argent ("The problem with money"), a song sung by a man who wakes in bed with a prostitute, broke and unable to pay her.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact on {{innovative}} performance of alternative <b>external</b> <b>sourcing</b> strategies. In particular, the study under discussion compared <b>external</b> <b>sourcing</b> strategies based on specialization to those based on integrating various sourcing modalities (e. g., alliances and M 2 ̆ 6 amp;As). Survey data from three waves of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) in the Netherlands were used to investigate {{the implications of these}} sourcing strategies for innovative performance. The findings indicate that synergies exist among <b>external</b> <b>sourcing</b> modalities: Integrating different <b>external</b> <b>sourcing</b> modes is more effective than specializing in a single mode, especially when the specialization is focused on M 2 ̆ 6 amp;As. Among the specialized strategies, focusing on the use of strategic alliances leads to higher levels of innovative performance than relying exclusively on M 2 ̆ 6 amp;As...|$|R

25|$|Fusion {{reactions}} {{occur when}} {{two or more}} atomic nuclei come close enough for long enough that the nuclear force pulling them together exceeds the electrostatic force pushing them apart, fusing them into heavier nuclei.

Hence, nuclei smaller than iron-56 {{are more likely to}} fuse while those heavier than iron-56 are more likely to break apart.|$|E
