We cannot be crowded into matters, however great might be the blessing attending such procedure. We cannot be forced into living a celestial law; we must do this ourselves, of our own free will.

25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims about <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could {{have anything to say about}} practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have to be careful not to get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E

500|$|Matters worsened when Columbia Pictures {{experienced}} financial difficulties. Spielberg {{estimated the}} film would cost $2.7million {{to make in}} his original 1973 pitch to Columbia, but the final budget came to $19.4million. Columbia studio executive John Veich remembered, [...] "If {{we knew it was}} going to cost that much, we wouldn't have greenlighted <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> didn't have the money." [...] Spielberg hired Joe Alves, his collaborator on Jaws, as production designer. In addition the 1976 Atlantic hurricane season brought tropical storms to Alabama. A large portion of the sound stage in Alabama was damaged because of a lightning strike. Columbia raised $7 million from three sources: Time Inc., EMI, and German tax shelters.|$|E
500|$|Each night {{following}} the shows, the musicians and Dowd would [...] "grab some beers and sandwiches" [...] {{and head to}} Manhattan's Atlantic Studios {{to go over the}} performances. Set lists for following shows were crafted by listening to the recordings and going over what they could keep and what they would need to capture once more. [...] "We wanted to give ourselves plenty of times to do <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> didn't {{want to go back and}} overdub anything, because then it wouldn't have been a real live album," [...] said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette's harmonica when it didn't fit. [...] "That was our pinnacle," [...] said Dickey Betts later. [...] "The Fillmore days are definitely the most cherished memories that I have. If you asked everybody in the band, they would probably say that." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming for the {{television}} pilot began {{on location in}} Los Angeles in February 1999 and took six weeks. Ultimately, the network was unhappy with the pilot and decided not to place it on its schedule. Objections included the nonlinear storyline, the ages of Harring and Watts (whom they considered too old), cigarette smoking by Ann Miller's character and a close-frame shot of dog feces in one scene. Lynch remembered, [...] "All I know is, I loved making it, ABC hated it, and I don't like the cut I turned in. I agreed with ABC that the longer cut was too slow, but I was forced to butcher <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> had a deadline, and there wasn't time to finesse anything. It lost texture, big scenes and storylines, and there are 300 tape copies of the bad version circulating around. Lots of people have seen it, which is embarrassing, because they're bad-quality tapes, too. I don't {{want to think about}} it." ...|$|E
40|$|Why do rising incomes {{not make}} people happier? Some argue that <b>it</b> is <b>because</b> <b>we</b> quickly become {{accustomed}} to our new acquisitions.

But Avner Offer opines <b>it</b> is <b>because</b> <b>we</b> {{have a difficult time}} postponing gratification. This is an intriguing notion, one of many in his new book. ...|$|R

500|$|Of his {{approach}} to directing the film, Lane explains, [...] "Thunderbirds Are Go was done like an episode but on a bigger scale. Whereas we would think {{that it might be}} nice to do a particular shot on the series but couldn't afford to, with Thunderbirds Are Go we just did <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> had the money." [...] For the Swinging Star hall sequence, all the visual elements except Alan and Lady Penelope are displayed in black and white, with background characters appearing in the form of enlarged still photographs. On the surrealism of the Swinging Star scenes, aspects of which include pink space clouds made of dry ice and a giant guitar on which Cliff Richard and The Shadows perform part of [...] "Shooting Star", Anderson explains that the production team [...] "recreated a Busby Berkeley sequence", and that the appearance of puppet versions of real-life celebrities boosted the publicity value of the film.|$|E
500|$|On August 1, 2005, Rowland {{announced}} {{the release of}} a greatest hits album later that year during an interview with Billboard magazine.

[...] In September, the album's title #1's was revealed along with a release date on October 25, 2005. A DualDisc edition of #1's was also announced with the same songs of the standard edition mixed in 5.1 surround sound on a CD as well as bonus content on a DVD containing seven music videos and a trailer for the live album [...] (2005).

500|$|The Coens have {{acknowledged}} several cinematic inspirations for Barton Fink. Chief {{among these are}} three movies by Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski: Repulsion (1965), Cul-de-Sac (1966), and The Tenant (1976). These movies employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound the mental instability of the characters. Barton's isolation in his room at the Hotel Earle is frequently {{compared to that of}} Trelkovsky in his apartment in The Tenant. Ethan said regarding the genre of Barton Fink: [...] "t is kind of a Polanski movie. It is closer to that than anything else." [...] By coincidence, Polanski {{was the head of the}} jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991, where Barton Fink premiered. This created an awkward situation. [...] "Obviously", Joel Coen said later, [...] "we have been influenced by his films, but at this time we were very hesitant to speak to him about <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> did not want to give the impression we were sucking up".|$|E

500|$|After {{the first}} rumour circulated, Joe Goddard created a reverse rumour, saying that Minogue {{had written a}} track for Hot Chip. He told NME, [...] "Kylie wrote a song for us, She sent it through our {{management}} to us– it was totally bizarre. It was {{the beginnings of a}} track– I think she wrote it and just thought, 'This would be perfect for Hot Chip', or possibly for a collaboration. It's a crazy song. It's industrial and clanging and even has farmyard animal noises on it. It's the kind of music you'd never normally associate with Kylie. When I'm allowed to send it around it's going to change a few people's ideas about her. Maybe it's one for our next album, after Made in the Dark." [...] Taylor later admitted that it was a joke created to fool people because the band were tired of people phoning them up to ask why Minogue had apparently rejected a song she did not hear. Goddard said, [...] "We've been telling lots of lies and rumours about <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> found it quite funny." ...|$|E
500|$|After this album, {{the group}} planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to {{facilitate}} their solo careers. Beyoncé {{has noted that}} their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyoncé has said that [...] "the group felt it still had something to offer musically" [...] with the album before adding: [...] "We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> want to – not because it's a good business move." ...|$|E
500|$|Attanasio, Levinson and Fontana {{strove to}} make Homicide more {{realistic}} than other police dramas, even in minor details. For example, Levinson specifically asked that {{a dead body}} found by detectives in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] be badly decomposing and attracting flies because he felt other shows did not portray corpses in a realistic way. Some episodes, like [...] "Ghost of a Chance", focus on murders {{that take place in}} wealthy rural settings, rather than an urban or predominantly poorer location as most police dramas did. Homicide was noted for demonstrating better than most American television police shows that murders can take place in various socioeconomic circumstances. In striving for realism, some cases in Homicide remain unsolved and murderers go free, most notably in the Adena Watson case. This theme often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives, who wanted happier endings with more closure. Fontana said of the Watson investigation, [...] "We never solved <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> felt {{that it would be a}} disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." ...|$|E

500|$|Selena {{recorded}} [...] "God's Child (Baila Conmigo)", a {{duet with}} David Byrne that was included on the soundtrack of the comedy film Blue in the Face (1995). Byrne said the song was the last recording Selena made before she {{was shot and killed}} by Yolanda Saldívar, her friend and former manager of her Selena Etc. boutiques, on March 31, 1995. [...] Behar said promotion [...] "will be on the superstar scale" [...] and [...] " [...] didn't put this marketing campaign behind it because there was a tragedy. We put this marketing campaign behind <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> believed {{that this was going to}} be a huge album because of the music. This is a record that we're going to work over the next 10 months." [...] EMI Records and EMI Latin put aside [...] ($784,000 2015 USD) to complete Dreaming of You. [...] "Oh No (I'll Never Fall in Love Again)", a song intended to be recorded for Dreaming of You, was released on the SelenaQRadio (a free radio operated by Quintanilla, Jr.) in September 2015. Quintanilla, Jr. decided to release the demo version of the song after fans began requesting for it to be heard.|$|E
500|$|In the {{interlude}} {{before the}} first encore, U2 had a worried discussion over the introduction to [...] "Miss Sarajevo". [...] The song had only been played once prior—at a benefit concert in 1995 with Bono, The Edge, Eno, and Pavarotti. They returned to the stage and played [...] "Discothèque", [...] "If You Wear That Velvet Dress", [...] "With or Without You", and a rough version of [...] "Miss Sarajevo". Pavarotti {{was not at the}} concert to sing his part and so an antique gramophone was brought onto the stage in his place. Eno came on stage to sing backing vocals, and Bono invited Nogić on stage during the chorus. During the song, the video screen showed images from Carter's Miss Sarajevo documentary, including footage of the girls taking part in the beauty contest and the banner reading [...] "Please don't let them kill us". Bono apologized for the rocky performance {{at the end of the}} song, saying [...] "Sarajevo, this song was written for you. I hope you like <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> can't fucking play it." [...] The concert concluded with a second encore of [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me", [...] "Mysterious Ways", [...] "One", and an abbreviated cover of [...] "Unchained Melody".|$|E
500|$|On August 5, 2011, Guillermo del Toro {{stated that}} the remake would reflect his {{original}} vision for the film, {{and that it had}} been planned even when the first version was in production. [...] "Even when we produced the Spanish movie, I had intended to remake <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> had a very different screenplay that, because of money and time, got turned into the movie you saw – which is great, but there was this other structure for the original script that I wanted to try. So even before we shot the first film it was an economic decision, a pre-existing creative decision, to change it." [...] Del Toro also praised the new film's director. [...] "We have Mark Pellington attached as director – I'm a big fan of his The Mothman Prophecies and his video work – and we are out to actors, so we're hoping to get things going soon." [...] On August 30, 2011, it was reported that American actress Amy Adams was in talks to star as Laura, the main character, who was played by Belén Rueda in the original film. It was also {{stated that the}} current incarnation of the remake screenplay had been written by Larry Fessenden and Sergio G. Sánchez, the sole writer of the original film.|$|E

500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of the Adena Watson murder case, a story arc which began {{at the start of the}} first season. The Watson case was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book that served as the basis of the Homicide series. Elements of the interview in [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] were incorporated from real-life police interrogations in that case. The Wallace case was never solved, and Fontana insisted that the Watson case in Homicide remain unsolved as well, despite pressure from NBC for a more satisfying conclusion. Fontana said, [...] "We never solved <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> felt that it would be a disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." [...] The scene when Tucker admits for a moment he is not sure in his own mind that he didn't commit the murder was inspired by a similar real-life interaction Fontana found in a police interrogation transcript during his research. Fontana said, [...] "It was so chilling (and) I was like, 'Oh man, how do you get there?'" ...|$|E
500|$|The band made {{extensive}} use of the different rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)" [...] feature natural reverberation achieved by recording on a stone staircase, and [...] "Let Down" [...] was recorded in a ballroom at 3 a.m. Isolation allowed the band {{to work at a}} different pace, with more flexible and spontaneous working hours. O'Brien said that [...] "the biggest pressure was actually completing [...] We weren't given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted. We were delaying <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff." [...] Yorke was satisfied with the quality of the recordings made at the location, and enjoyed working without audio separation, meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately. O'Brien was similarly pleased with the recordings, estimating that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: [...] "I hate doing overdubs, because it just doesn't feel natural.... Something special happens when you're playing live; {{a lot of it is}} just looking at one another and knowing there are four other people making it happen." [...] Many of Yorke's vocals were first takes; he felt that if he made other attempts he would [...] "start to think about it and it would sound really lame." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{features}} {{the deaths of}} Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside {{the deaths of the}} aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the previous installment. Since Kirkman felt {{that there was a lot}} of potential development in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script. Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance. [...] "The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told Scott Wilson, 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing that and it felt like Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; we have to get something out of it. We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was well worth <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's eyes. So it was the right call to keep him alive." ...|$|E
