6000|$|Milly had, {{under her}} comrade's eyes, {{a minute of}} mute detachment. She had lived with Kate Croy for several days {{in a state of}} {{intimacy}} as deep as it had been sudden, and they had clearly, in talk, in many directions, proceeded to various extremities. Yet it now came over her as in a clear cold way that there was a possible account of their relations in which the quantity her new friend had told her might have figured as small, as smallest, beside the quantity she hadn't. She couldn't say, at any rate, whether or no she had made the point that her aunt designed her for Lord Mark: it had only sufficiently come out--which had been, moreover, eminently guessable--that she was involved in her aunt's designs. Somehow, for Milly, brush it over nervously as she might and with whatever simplifying hand, this abrupt extrusion of Mr. Densher altered all proportions, had an effect on all values. It was fantastic of her to let <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> that she couldn't in the least have defined--and she was at least, even during these instants, rather proud of being able to hide, on the spot, the difference it did make. Yet, all the same, the effect for her was, almost violently, of Mr. Densher's having been there--having been where she had stood till now in her simplicity--before her. It would have taken but another free moment to make her see abysses--since abysses were what she wanted--in the mere circumstance of his own silence, in New York, about his English friends. There had really been in New York little time for anything; but, had she liked, Milly could have made it out for herself that he had avoided the subject of Miss Croy, and that Miss Croy was yet a subject it could never be natural to avoid. It was to be added {{at the same time that}} even if his silence had been labyrinthe--which was absurd in view of all the other things too he couldn't possibly have spoken of--this was exactly what must suit her, since it fell under the head of the plea she had just uttered to Susie. These things, however, came and went, and it set itself up between the companions, for the occasion, in the oddest way, both that their happening all to know Mr. Densher--except indeed that Susie didn't, but probably would,--was a fact belonging, in a world of rushing about, to one of the common orders of chance; and yet further that it was amusing--oh, awfully amusing!--to be able fondly to hope that there was [...] "something in" [...] its having been left to crop up with such suddenness. There seemed somehow a possibility that the ground or, as it were, the air might, in a manner, have undergone some pleasing preparation; though the question of this possibility would probably, after all, have taken some threshing out. The truth, moreover--and there they were, already, our pair, talking about it, the [...] "truth!"--had not in fact quite cropped out. This, obviously, in view of Mrs. Lowder's request to her old friend.|$|E

The questions were (a) Do self-concept and achievement influence each other? and (b) Does <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> whether achievement is assessed by marks or by tests? The sample consisted of 697 students from 54 German elementary school classes. The design of the study allowed 3 measurement waves from Grade 2 to Grade 4. Mathematics achievement was measured both by marks and by tests. The results of the structural equation modeling analyses show that it makes a difference whether achievement is (as usually) measured with only one indicator (either mark or test performance), or if both indicators are integrated in the model. The latter model clearly supports the skill development model: In elementary school, prior self-concept does not significantly contribute to the prediction of subsequent achievement...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasingly}} ubiquitous {{notion of}} ‘patient centredness’ often causes confusion; indeed instruction received {{on this subject}} often left trainees with only the vaguest notion of {{how it could be}} put into practice, sometimes leading to bizarre interpretations of this idea. For example, one colleague described how he, in an attempt at ‘real’ patient centredness, had attempted a whole surgery without saying anything at all for as long as possible, presumably just nodding and gesticulating to compensate. Although we readily agree that non-verbal expression accounts for a considerable content of communication, this is perhaps taking things just too far. Patient centredness remains a central plank of clinical learning, teaching and assessment and nowadays is also central of policy development in the health service. But what do we mean by patient centredness? Is it really important? How important is it compared to other aspects of the consultation? Does <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference...</b>|$|E

While some linguists address these questions to develop {{a better understanding of}} how people acquire a grammar, language acquisition scholars are in search of the most effective way to approach the teaching of grammar in the language classroom. The individual chapters in this volume will explore a variety of approaches to grammar teaching and offer a list of principles and guidelines that those involved in language acquisition should consider to design and implement effective grammar tasks during their teaching. It proposes that the key issue is not whether or not we should teach grammar but how we incorporate a teaching grammar component in our communicative language teaching practices...|$|E

Starting from the premise that such failure is a common aspect of the everyday order of life, I reread the encounter through the work of Moira von Wright, Kelly Oliver, Gert Biesta and Adriana Cavarero, asking three questions. What is the interpersonal cost of a relationship which fails to recognize lived human uniqueness?

Thirdly, returning to the European Union itself, can and should the EU accede to the FCNM?

40|$|Do upper houses {{matter for}} cabinet formation? If so, does <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> how {{powerful}} they are? The most sophisticated study to give clear {{answers to these}} questions is still that of Druckman, Martin and Thies (2005), which argues that upper houses influence cabinet formation, regardless of their formal powers. We dispute these answers theoretically and empirically. Since adjusting cabinet formation to second chamber composition is not necessary and can be costly, we should expect that if upper houses matter at all, their formal powers should matter too. Replication shows that the empirical results are driven exclusively by two countries with weak upper houses, one of which (Ireland) is miscoded. If this case is recoded there is no statistically or substantially significant effect of upper houses, regardless of their power. We conclude that the two questions cannot yet be answered: we need more research based on broader samples in order to assess whether upper houses matter for cabinet formation and whether their formal powers make a difference...|$|E
