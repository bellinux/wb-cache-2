500|$|I {{grew up in}} a very {{comfortable}} environment. I wanted for nothing; serious things never <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> life. I have never been a victim of injustice, so I have nothing to protest. I don't have any particular origins which would be interesting to talk about. ... So, I do absurd stuff because I don't want to talk about other things.|$|E
500|$|A botched {{pit stop}} at the Singapore Grand Prix had demoted Massa from first {{position}} {{to the back of}} field. With three races remaining in the Championship and a seven-point deficit, Massa remained confident about his title chances: [...] "If you look at what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> Singapore where my gap went from one point to seven so suddenly, then you have to consider it could easily go the other way as well." [...] Hamilton emphasised the value that a conservative racing strategy could hold for his title chances: ...|$|E
500|$|People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's something I {{wanted to talk about}} ... and it's something that has <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the past... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E

6000|$|... "There's no {{knowing what}} may <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> this world," [...] said Kenneby, [...] "but {{sometimes}} I almost think I ain't fit {{to live in}} it, along with anybody else." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{song was}} played only once and {{received}} minor treatments afterwards, {{with the addition}} of a cello part in the introduction and some editing, which included removing a verse to reduce the song's length. Eno was outraged that U2 wanted to shorten the song, and he was adamant that the band not alter the original track too much, saying, [...] "These fucking guys, they're supposed to be so spiritual—they don't spot a miracle when it hits them in the face. Nothing like that ever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the studio in my whole life." [...] The band's original concept for No Line on the Horizon was to create an album of future hymns—songs that would be played forever. According to Eno and Lanois, [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] is the closest the band came to reaching that concept.|$|E
500|$|She later {{formed the}} Pagan Babies with friend Kat Bjelland, whom she {{met at the}} Satyricon club in Portland in 1984. As Love later reflected, [...] "The {{best thing that ever}} <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a way, was Kat." [...] Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they {{recruited}} bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Janis Tanaka. According to Bjelland, [...] " [...] didn't play an instrument at the time" [...] aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her. The group played several house shows and recorded one 4-track demo before disbanding in late 1985. After Pagan Babies, Love moved to Minneapolis, where Bjelland had formed the group Babes in Toyland, and briefly worked as a concert promoter before returning to California.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Domínguez {{signed with}} the Atlanta Beat in the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), the top division of professional soccer in the United States at the time. She was the first Mexican-born player to sign with the league {{since its inception in}} 2001. During her first month with the team, she was named the league's Player of the Month after scoring five goals and two assists in three games. [...] She scored seven goals during the 2003 season and was a leading scorer in the league. Of her experience, she said, [...] "It's very special for me to be in the top scoring position in this league. It's the best thing that has <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my career, right up there with scoring in the 1999 Women's World Cup." [...] The Beat finished second in the standings with a 9–4–8 record.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm almost broke," [...] he soliloquized, thoughtfully. [...] "The {{governor}} said I wouldn't make any money. He's right--so far. And he said I'd {{be coming home}} beaten. There he's wrong. I've got a hunch that something 'll <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> this Greaser town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your invitation," [...] I said, [...] "sounds most attractive. But I am {{curious to}} know what would <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the Rue Strelitz. Should I be offered poison in a jewelled cup, or {{disposed}} of in a cruder fashion? Let me make my will first, and I will come. I am really curious!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I {{keep the}} music and the lyrics {{separate}} for a long time. I just collect and collect for both sides and then, when it comes time, they kind of just naturally come together. Lyrically, I get a lot of inspiration about what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my day-to-day life. And also Charles Bukowski and David Lynch are very inspirational to me.” ...|$|R
500|$|The album {{features}} a noticeably darker sound and lyrical subject matter than Vanilla Ice's previous albums, such as To The Extreme and Mind Blowin. The album {{was described by}} CNN as a [...] "shrill confessional" [...] on which the performer [...] "flays his '80s persona, his fractured family and Attention Deficit Disorder, which he has." [...] Vanilla Ice explained that the album [...] "just comes out dark because that's the way I feel I've been treated" [...] and that the album [...] "wasn't intended to be so dark. I opened up to Ross and I told {{him a lot of}} things that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the past. It was like, really deep conversation, and he was like, you should write about that. And I was like, dude, I didn't want people to judge me for that. But he was right. It was like total therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the run of}} Sunset Boulevard at the West End's Adelphi Theatre in 1995, Paige {{discovered}} a lump in her breast, prompting her to consult her doctor, who at first reassured her {{there was nothing to}} be concerned about. She returned twice, and her doctor subsequently sent her for tests that confirmed the lump was cancerous, nine months after she discovered it. Continuing her role in the production Paige did not miss a show, and stated, [...] "When I did the show I became very emotional. Some of the lyrics suddenly took on an entirely different meaning. Words like, 'as if we never said goodbye' became more real". [...] Paige went in for day surgery on a Sunday due to her theatre commitments, had five years of medical treatment and completed a radiation programme. She spoke for the first time of her encounter with breast cancer in a 2004 interview, and has since described the period as [...] "the most awful thing that's <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my life".|$|E
500|$|By the {{following}} year, {{the case against}} Andrić was dropped {{due to lack of}} evidence, and he was released from prison on 20 March 1915. The authorities exiled him to the village of Ovčarevo, near Travnik. He arrived there on 22 March and was placed under the supervision of local Franciscan monks. Andrić soon befriended the friar Alojzije Perčinlić and began researching the history of Bosnia's Catholic and Orthodox Christian communities under Ottoman rule. Andrić lived in the parish headquarters, and the Franciscans gave him access to the monastery chronicles. In return, he assisted the parish priest and taught religious songs to pupils at the monastery school. Andrić's mother soon came to see her son, and offered to serve as a housekeeper for the parish priest. [...] "Mother is very happy," [...] Andrić wrote. [...] "It has been three whole years since she saw me. And she can't grasp all that has <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> that time, nor the whole of my crazy, cursed existence. She cries, kisses me and laughs in turn. Like a mother." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jones {{plays on}} two tracks on Foo Fighters' album In Your Honor. He plays {{mandolin}} on [...] "Another Round" [...] and piano on [...] "Miracle", {{both of which}} are on the acoustic disc. The band's frontman Dave Grohl (a big Led Zeppelin fan) has described Jones' guest appearance as the [...] "second greatest thing <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my life".|$|R
5000|$|Robertson's career {{suffered}} a minor set-back {{when she was}} injured after an attack on holiday in Portugal. Regarding this incident she's quoted as saying: [...] "I've never had anything so painful <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my life before. It was horrible, absolutely horrible. ... Stuff <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> you in life {{and you just have}} to get on with it and as long as I don't stop dancing it's ok...I'll be ok." ...|$|R
6000|$|The scales {{fell from}} my eyes. I understood. I {{had had the}} same sort of thing <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> moments of crisis. I {{remember}} once detaining a dentist with the drill at one of my lower bicuspids and holding him up for nearly ten minutes with a story about a Scotchman, an Irishman, and a Jew. Purely automatic. The more he tried to jab, the more I said [...] "Hoots, mon," [...] "Begorrah," [...] and [...] "Oy, oy". When one loses one's nerve, one simply babbles.|$|R
500|$|A {{pneumatic}} value {{failure in}} the preceding race, the United States Grand Prix, had forced Häkkinen to retire from the Grand Prix. With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, Häkkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I know that what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And {{the same can be said}} of the entire team." [...] Ferrari team principal Jean Todt and former World Champion Jody Scheckter called for Barrichello and Coulthard to race fairly as both drivers were ordered by their teams to assist their teammates in the Championship battle.|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{came up with}} Letter to My Daughter, {{which became}} a New York Times bestseller, while going through old boxes of notes and papers full of {{concepts}} for future books and poems, which she called [...] "WIP" [...] ("Works in Progress"). She found twenty years worth of notes written to her friend Oprah Winfrey, and realized that she should put the essays they inspired into a book so that others could read them. Although she had no daughters, and {{gave birth to a}} son (Guy Johnson), which she called [...] "the best thing that ever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my life", many women in Angelou's career looked to her as a mother figure. She wrote Letters to speak to those women and to share with them the wisdom she has gained throughout her long life. According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian, most of the essays [...] "end with the kind of wisdom that, depending on your taste, qualifies as either homespun or hokey". For example, she uses what has been called her most famous statement, when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz: [...] "We are more alike than unalike". Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her, Younge thinks Letter reads like an extended farewell; in her 500-word introduction she mentions death twice.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{press conference}} on May 19, Bunning called Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell a [...] "control freak": [...] "If Mitch McConnell doesn't endorse me, {{it could be the}} best thing that ever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> Kentucky." ...|$|E
6000|$|As he rode on, {{immersed}} in these unpleasant contemplations, and considerably lessened {{in his own}} esteem by what had happened, Wildrake, who rode by his side, and was no friend to long silence, began to enter into conversation. [...] "I have been thinking, Mark," [...] said he, [...] "that if you and I had been called to the bar--as, by the by, has been <b>in</b> danger of <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> more senses than one--I say, had we become barristers, I {{would have had the}} better oiled tongue of the two--the fairer art of persuasion." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] Dominey continued, [...] "if I seem to ask {{unnecessary}} questions. Remember that I {{spent the}} first portion of my exile in Africa in a very determined effort to blot out the memory of everything that had <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> earlier <b>in</b> life. So that is the popular belief?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In her 2010 {{episode of}} Behind the Music, Courtney Love {{reflected}} on her formative years in rock music in Portland, Oregon, and said, [...] "The {{best thing that}} ever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> a way, was Kat", noting their friendship and musical collaboration. Because of Kat's closeness with Kurt Cobain, Bjelland went to Seattle immediately after Kurt Cobain's death in 1994. Bjelland also participated in the Behind the Music segment on Love in 2010.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] Brand answered, [...] "he is Domiloff's man, {{and there}} is treachery afoot. I {{will tell you what}} <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the city." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then {{something}} did happen. Buck, it's the solemn truth, that nothing {{has ever happened}} to you in your life. Nothing had ever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not {{sit well}} with Dodgers {{co-owner}} Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as [...] "Rickey's prima donna". In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, [...] "Regardless of what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the future, it all can be placed on what you have done and, believe me, I appreciate it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not suppose," [...] {{the diary}} began, [...] "that what I write here {{will ever be}} read. It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the chances are immeasurably against it. Still, there is a {{possibility}} that it may fall into the hands of some of my countrymen when, as will surely be the case, the Mahdi's rebellion is crushed and order restored; and I intend, so long as I live, to jot down from time <b>to</b> time what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> order that the only person living interested <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> my wife, may possibly, someday, get to know what my fate has been. Therefore, should this scrap of paper, and other scraps that may follow it, be ever handed to one of my countrymen, I pray him to send it to Mrs. Hilliard, care of the manager of the Bank at Cairo.|$|R
5000|$|... "Beckett {{wrote to}} Richard Ellmann: 'All the jetty and howling wind are imaginary. It <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> summer 1945, <b>in</b> my mother's little house, named New Place, {{across the road}} from Cooldrinagh.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've lots {{to say to}} you," [...] Norgate {{admitted}} simply. [...] "I'll {{begin with}} the personal side of it. Here's just a brief narration of exactly what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the most fashionable restaurant of Berlin last Thursday night." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "What <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> down <b>in</b> Fort Myers when I {{was arrested}} evidently hurt me quite a bit", Williams told the New York Times in a {{telephone}} interview.

5000|$|Paul Douglas (a future {{president}} of the American Economic Association) {{was a graduate student}} under Taussig at Harvard in the Fall of 1915 and recalled the experience. Douglas had studied two years in graduate school at Columbia University with Edwin Seligman, who was an ideological enemy of Taussig. Given the opportunity to criticize the Columbia school of economic thought by confronting Douglas, Taussig attempted to humiliate him to the delight of the Harvard pupils who filled the lecture hall to witness the [...] "slaughter." [...] Eventually, Douglas turned the tables and trapped Taussig in a logical economic debate. Douglas recalled, [...] "The following day, Taussig cordially shook hands with me {{at the end of the}} hour.... We also became fast friends for the rest of his life. Trying as the experience was, it was the best thing <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my academic life. It forced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> master the reasoning of the great economic theorists and to stand my ground under verbal and logical bombardment." ...|$|R
