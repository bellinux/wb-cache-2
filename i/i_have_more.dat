25|$|It {{usually takes}} me {{an hour after}} I awaken {{to get all the}} pain out. It used to be easier when I was younger. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> muscle and joint {{difficulties}} now... Recently the only way I could get control over the pain was by sitting in bed, pulling a chair close, and pressing my larynx {{against the back of the}} chair. That was very uncomfortable: But it was discomfort I was deliberately creating.|$|E
25|$|I wish {{to obtain}} your blessing before that day, so that I {{may have the}} {{strength}} and light which I need so much {{in order to be}} unto the end a faithful son of our Redeemer, and a loyal and obedient servant of His Infallible Vicar. Now that the Masonic Lodges of the neighboring countries, instigated by Germany, are vomiting against me all sorts of atrocious insults and horrible calumnies, now that the Lodges are secretly arranging for my assassination, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> need than ever of the divine protection so that I may live and die in defense of our holy religion and the beloved republic which I am called once more to rule.|$|E
500|$|In late 2012, Simon was {{diagnosed}} with terminal colorectal cancer which later metastasized to his other organs, including his liver and kidneys. He had been feeling ill {{for some time and}} had earlier been misdiagnosed. He was given between three and six months to live; chemotherapy treatment reduced the size of his tumors over the following six months. He arranged for his fortune to be left to various charitable causes, stating [...] "The truth is, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> money than I'm interested in spending. Everyone in my family is taken care of. And I enjoy this." [...] Simon died in his Los Angeles home from complications from the disease on March 8, 2015, aged 59. His remains were interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Bakshi {{is quoted}} as saying that he had [...] "mixed feeling" [...] about Jackson's adaptations, {{although}} he had not seen the films. [...] "In some respects I feel good that Peter Jackson continued and went on, and in some respects I feel bad that Saul Zaentz, the producer, and various people never called me, thanked me, or asked my permission to do the movie. [...] has anyone sent me a bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> feelings on the business side of that than I do on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time than I did, and a lot better budget." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking to The Times {{about the}} ending of the show in 1989, Curtis hinted that the {{collaborative}} writing process caused tensions amongst the cast: [...] "Everybody on the show thinks they can put in good jokes, despite the fact that Ben Elton and I think there are already quite a few good ones in there to start with. It does usually end up funnier, but it's time to do something over which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> control." [...] Twenty years on, Curtis recalled in the documentary Blackadder Rides Again that: [...] "They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script...sometimes we would just say to them [...] "if you stood up and tried to act this script out, you would find out things about it." [...] Ben Elton stated that by opening it up, they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script.|$|E
2500|$|Though Livgren {{is known}} for his music, he {{is quick to point out}} that it is only one of his many pursuits. On his Web site, he quotes his biography: [...] "I'm a family man, I have a role in my church, I'm running a record label, a studio, a {{production}} company, a farm, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> hobbies and interests than there are hours in the day." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the {{founding}} of the Society of American Indians, Dagenett was the highest ranking American Indian in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. His friend and associate Arthur C. Parker, writing in 1914, described Dagenett's position as [...] "one of the most vital that a man can hold in the Indian Service," [...] adding that [...] "Mr. Dagenett is fearless in his recommendations to the Indian Bureau, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> than once witnessed his struggle to obtain justice for his brother Indian." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bryson scored 16 league {{goals for}} Derby in the 2013–14 season, {{which was more}} than he had scored in any of his {{previous}} three seasons combined. He put this improvement down to manager Steve McClaren: [...] "he's changed the formation slightly and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> freedom to get in the box and support Chris [...] We are a good partnership." [...] Scotland manager Gordon Strachan hailed the understanding between the two when he called them up for a friendly with Nigeria in May 2014: [...] "When you look at the link-up between [...] and Bryson, I think it's 40-odd goals they've scored between them. It's a smashing partnership." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a journal}} entry {{written in the}} 1970s, Oates sarcastically {{addressed}} her critics, writing, [...] "So many books! so many! Obviously JCO has a full career behind her, if one chooses {{to look at it}} that way; many more titles and she might as well... what?...give up all hopes for a 'reputation'? [...] but I work hard, and long, and as the hours roll by I seem to create more than I anticipate; more, certainly, than the literary world allows for a 'serious' writer. Yet <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> stories to tell, and more novels [...] ". In The New York Review of Books in 2007, Michael Dirda suggested that disparaging criticism of Oates [...] "derives from reviewer's angst: How does one judge a new book by Oates when one is not familiar with most of the backlist? Where does one start?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{his next}} single, [...] "The Fightin' Side of Me," [...] {{released}} by his record company in 1970 over Haggard's objections, Haggard's lyrics {{stated that he}} did not mind the counterculture [...] "switchin' sides and standin' up for what they believe in," [...] but resolutely declared, [...] "If you don't love it, leave it!" [...] In May 1970, Haggard explained to John Grissom of Rolling Stone, [...] "I don't like their views on life, their filth, their visible self-disrespect, y'know. They don't give a shit what they look like or what they smell like.... What do they have to offer humanity?" [...] In a 2003 interview with No Depression magazine, Haggard said, [...] "I had different views in the '70s. As a human being, I've learned [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> culture now. I was dumb as a rock when I wrote 'Okie From Muskogee.' That's being honest with you at the moment, and {{a lot of things that}} I said [...] I sing with a different intention now. My views on marijuana have totally changed. I think we were brainwashed and I think anybody that doesn't know that needs to get up and read and look around, get their own information. It's a cooperative government project to make us think marijuana should be outlawed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The anime {{adaptation}} of the series has received critical acclaim by reviewers. Jacob Hope Chapman from Anime News Network praised the cast and studio Bones' work. Additionally, he liked the consistency in quality and commented [...] "The contiguous threads laced through these episodic adventures are beginning to converge fast, and while I can't see the full picture yet, I know Rie Matsumoto is building the anime-original material of Leo's romance into something special. The animation continues to be jaw-dropping. The music continues to be soul-warming. There's never enough time in one writeup to talk about everything that makes the episode so damn good. Blood Blockade Battlefront continues to be The Very Best." [...] Jarius Taylor from the Fandom Post called it [...] "both ridiculously cool and ridiculously weird" [...] and praised the cast like Chapman. In a later review he said [...] "It’s still not entirely clear what this show is going for yet but for now it’s a good ride and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> than enough faith in the people behind it to believe the destination will be worthwhile." [...] Rachael Verret, a writer from The Mary Sue, gave the series a perfect score having pointed out its [...] "energy and joviality" [...] seen through the cast and the ending sequences which reminded her of another series, Baccano!. Similarly, Chapman wrote an article titled [...] "Three Reasons Why Blood Blockade Battlefront is the Best Show of the Spring" [...] commenting [...] "It's the coolest, cutest, and cleverest anime I've {{seen in a long}} time, easily the best new show of the Spring 2015." ...|$|E
