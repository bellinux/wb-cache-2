This assay utilizes the pseudo-substrate diabz-GSSG [where diabz stands for di-(o-aminobenzoyl) ], which is formed by the reaction of <b>isatoic</b> <b>anhydride</b> with the two free N-terminal amino groups of GSSG. The proximity of two benzoyl groups leads to quenching of the diabz-GSSG fluorescence by approx.   50 % in comparison with its non-disulphide-linked form, abz-GSH (where abz stands for o-aminobenzoyl). Therefore the PDI-dependent disulphide reduction can be monitored by the increase in fluorescence accompanying the loss of proximity-quenching upon conversion of diabz-GSSG into abz-GSH. The apparent Km of PDI for diabz-GSSG was estimated to be approx.   15  μM.

40|$|N 5 -Carboxyaminoimidazole {{ribonucleotide}} synthetase (N 5 -CAIR synthetase), a {{key enzyme}} in microbial de novo purine biosynthesis, catalyzes {{the conversion of}} aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) to N 5 -CAIR. To date, this enzyme has been observed only in microorganisms, and thus, it represents an ideal target for antimicrobial drug development. Here we report structural and functional studies on the Aspergillus clavatus N 5 -CAIR synthetase and identification of inhibitors for the enzyme. In collaboration with Dr. Hazel Holden of the University of Wisconsin, the three-dimensional structure of Aspergillus clavatus N 5 -CAIR synthetase was solved {{in the presence of}} either Mg 2 ATP or MgADP and AIR. These structures, determined to 2. 1 and 2. 0 Å resolution, respectively, revealed that AIR binds in a pocket analogous to that observed for other ATP-grasp enzymes involved in purine metabolism. On the basis of these models, a site-directed mutagenesis study was subsequently conducted that focused on five amino acid residues located in the active site region of the enzyme. These investigations demonstrated that Asp 153 and Lys 353 play critical roles in catalysis without affecting substrate binding. All other mutations affected substrate binding and, in some instances, catalysis as well. Taken together, the structural and kinetic data presented here suggest a catalytic mechanism whereby Mg 2 ATP and bicarbonate first react to form the unstable intermediate carboxyphosphate. This intermediate subsequently decarboxylates to CO 2 and inorganic phosphate, and the amino group of AIR, through general base assistance by Asp 153, attacks CO 2 to form N 5 -CAIR. To identify the inhibitors for this enzyme we have conducted high-throughput screening (HTS) against Escherichia coli N 5 -CAIR synthetase using a highly reproducible phosphate assay. HTS of 48, 000 compounds identified 14 compounds that inhibited the enzyme. The hits identified could be classified into three classes based on chemical structure. Class I contains compounds with an indenedione core. Class II contains an indolinedione group, and Class III contains compounds that are structurally unrelated to other inhibitors in the group. We determined the Michaelis-Menten kinetics for five compounds representing each of the classes. Examination of compounds belonging to Class I indicates that these compounds do not follow normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Instead, these compounds inhibit N 5 -CAIR synthetase by reacting with the substrate AIR. Kinetic analysis indicates that the Class II families of compounds are non-competitive with both AIR and ATP. One compound in Class III is competitive with AIR but uncompetitive with ATP, whereas the other is non-competitive with both substrates. Finally, these compounds display no inhibition of human AIR carboxylase indicating that these agents are selective inhibitors of N 5 -CAIR synthetase. Given the importance of the class II, non-competitive inhibitors, we developed a diazirine-based photocrosslinking agent to identify the binding site of these inhibitors. These studies revealed that the isatin core of class II inhibitors is capable of undergoing photochemical conversion to <b>isatoic</b> <b>anhydride.</b> Once formed, the anhydride is capable of reacting with the protein. Treatment of N 5 -CAIR synthetase with the photoreactive agent lead to the dimerization of two monomers of the synthetase. Proteomic analysis of the crosslinked protein identified serine 227 as a possible site of modification. These studies also revealed two peptides which were missing in the dimerized protein sample. These two peptides were located near serine 227. While compelling, the location of the missing peptides and serine 227 is 20 Å away from the dimerization interface observed in the crystal structure. Thus, our photocrosslinking studies suggest that N 5 -CAIR synthetase may exist in multiple dimmer conformations...|$|E
