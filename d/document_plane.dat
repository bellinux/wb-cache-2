Abstract is included in. pdf <b>document.</b> <b>Plane</b> waves propagating in a perfectly electrically conducting polytropic gas of otherwise uniform {{state in the}} presence of an arbitrarily oriented uniform magnetic field are studied; they correspond to plane simple waves in magnetohydrodynamics. Riemann invariants across finite amplitude waves in ordinary gasdynamics are generalized herein to take into account all possible magnetohydrodynamics effects. There exist totally seven types of waves, namely, contact surfaces, forward and backward facing transverse simple waves and forward and backward facing coupled (fast and slow) simple waves. But of these only coupled waves are genuinely nonlinear and receive most of our attention. The mathematical theory of simple waves is discussed first to give a general picture of the underlying structure of solutions. Contact surfaces and transverse simple wave solutions are given next with particular emphasis on the case of the contact surface adjacent to a vacuum, region. An exact analytical solution of coupled waves for gases of arbitrary value of [ [...] . ] is obtained in terms of generalized Riemann invariants; some of these invariants are expressed in terms of definite integrals of a parameter [ [...] . ]. The invariant relations among several physical quantities are thus expressed in a parametric form. An alternative method of solving coupled waves by graphical means is proposed and some detailed calculations are presented. General properties of physical variables across coupled waves are mentioned. For the special case of gas in a purely transverse magnetic field, a scheme of solving arbitrary flow problems is discussed briefly. The corresponding case of coupled wave solutions is given in terms of a hypergeometric function. Finally, some examples are shown to illustrate the application of the solutions to actual physical problems...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the plane sweep algorithm for optimal use of tandem replicated {{data in a}} document. It {{is based on an}} observation that the original plane sweep algorithm is used to search in <b>documents.</b> <b>Plane</b> sweep algorithm does not feature a fast algorithm to find the word that is repeated in tandem in a document. With the help of effective parameters we could make a new technique to create the algorithm that detect the number of tandem replicated words in a document and reduce the number of compares, thus reducing the number of keywords in a document speed up our search algorithm. For this purpose {{we need to have a}} link between words and documents that the proposed algorithm WPSR provides a similar solution as original plane sweep algorithm. However, considering the volume of data we get the canonical form that this situation helps us to increases recognition of duplicate words in large scale. In proposed algorithm time complexity with lower order has been created than the basic algorithm, also terms of the algorithm with the WPSR system reliability, consider the best web search. Finally, system efficiency and performance increase more than the previous similar algorithm in this field...|$|R

The presented work is a contribution to develop a new technique handling this problem. Basic principle of the proposed method is a special kind of light section, that works with a comparatively very broad stripe lighting by using one additional matrix camera. We can reconstruct the 3 d-surface of the document by simple capturing an image sequence of the stripe lighting of a common book scanner during the scanning process. Based on a surface model we transform the warped <b>document</b> in a <b>plane.</b> Result is the two-dimensional output being a nearly distortion-free digital copy of the original warped document...|$|R

40|$|Venus Flyer Robot (VFR) is an aerobot; an {{autonomous}} balloon probe designed for remote exploration of Earth's sister planet in 2003. VFR's simple navigation and control system permits travel to virtually any location on Venus, {{but it can}} survive for only a limited duration in the harsh Venusian environment. To help address this limitation, we develop: (1) a global circulation model that captures the most important characteristics of the Venusian atmosphere; (2) a simple aerobot model that captures thermal restrictions faced by VFR at Venus; and (3) one exact and two heuristic algorithms that, using abstractions (1) and (2), construct routes making {{the best use of}} VFR's limited lifetime.

A lower frequency (5 – 7.5 -MHz) setting may be needed for larger patients or for patients with a large axillary fat pad; however, the spatial resolution will be compromised. The patient should lie in a supine oblique position, with her hand above her head with the arm abducted and externally rotated (“bathing beauty” position). All findings should be <b>documented</b> in orthogonal <b>planes</b> with and without calipers and a lesion’s largest dimension should also be recorded. Some facilities employ grey-scale and colour Doppler US or power Doppler US during the study, especially when assessing lymph nodes. When colour Doppler US is used, {{it is important to}} use low wall filter settings and low velocity settings (higher pulse repetition frequency) to detect abnormal blood flow. The colour gain should be increased high enough to detect subtle flow without causing a colour noise artefact. When evaluating lymph nodes, ultrasound is 94  % sensitive and 72  % specific in characterising nodes as suspicious or benign based on size and morphologic features [2].|$|R

40|$|Background: Patients with lumbar {{stenosis}} experience {{a significant improvement}} after a decompressive surgery. However, still often non-specific symptoms in the lumbar spine occur after the successful operation. This could result from an unusual postoperative stress on the sacroiliac joint by an altered posture or altered gait. We studied the emergence of SIJ-associated symptoms after a decompression of the lumbar spinal canal without instrumentation. Method: The study examined the data of 100 consecutive patients who were treated in three institutions. All patients underwent microsurgical decompression of the spinal canal without instrumentation. Patients with postoperative pain in the lower lumbar spine received periarticular injections under the anterior-posterior (AP) radiograph. Thus, it was investigated whether the pain was sued postoperative ISG-associated symptoms. Radiological changes of SIJ were divided: group 1 : patients without postoperative SIJ-associated symptoms, group 2 : patients with postoperative SIJ-associated symptoms) <b>documented</b> in a <b>plane</b> radiograph. Result: In 22 patients medical treatment was required due to pain in the SIJ. While in both groups the walk distance significantly improved without a difference (p = 0. 150) the analysis of overall satisfaction favoured group 2 (p= 0. 047). Female patients had more post-operative pain in the SIJ (p = 0. 036). Age, the severity of radiological SIJ degeneration and number of decompressed segments {{did not affect the}} postoperative pain in the SIJ. Conclusion: The adaptation to postoperative changes in posture and gait can lead to a temporary overload in the SIJ and cause an SIJ-associated pain. Patients should be advised to avoid unnecessary confusion, dissatisfaction and unnecessary diagnosis and arrange for rapid, specific therapy. An undiagnosed SIJ-associated pain is a potential and reversible cause for a "failed back surgery syndrome"...|$|R
40|$|Knee {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) is {{a complex}} disease with several proposed mechanisms for both the initiation and progression of the disease. Within the next 30 years, 1 in 4 Canadians {{are expected to have}} OA and 30 % of the workforce will have difficulty performing occupational activities due to OA. One at-risk group is workers whose occupations require frequent and intermittent kneeling: habitual kneelers. To better our understanding of how knee OA is initiated in this population, biomechanical studies are needed to support or refute current hypothesized pathways that link occupational kneeling to knee OA. It is well <b>documented</b> that frontal <b>plane</b> knee laxity changes throughout the progression of knee OA but it is not known whether laxity changes are a cause or a result of the disease. This thesis work explores a laxity mechanism for knee OA initiation in habitual kneelers. Study 1 aimed to reliably capture frontal plane knee joint laxity using an improved device. Ten healthy, young participants volunteered (5 males, 5 females). ICC scores ranged from 0. 95 to 0. 99 suggesting excellent reliability of the device. An MDD of 1. 22 ˚ was calculated and used to inform laxity decisions in Study 2. Study 2 was novel as it was the first to determine what changes occur in passive frontal plane knee joint laxity - in addition to gait mechanics and muscle activation - following a kneeling exposure. Fifteen healthy, young participants volunteered (8 males, 7 females). Contrary to what was expected, frontal plane knee joint laxity did not change following the kneeling exposure. However, during gait, knee flexion angle at heel contact and peak knee flexion angle during early stance phase were both affected by the kneeling exposure. These findings link kneeling exposure to immediate changes in measures indicative of knee joint instability and altered loading that have the potential to damage knee joint cartilage. Thus, the findings support the epidemiological evidence of a higher risk of knee OA development in habitual workers, though likely through some other mechanism than increased frontal plane knee joint laxity...|$|R
