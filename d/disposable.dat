5|$|The soldier's sole {{substantial}} <b>disposable</b> income {{came from}} the donativa, or cash bonuses handed out periodically by the emperors, as these were paid in gold solidi (which were never debased), or in pure silver. There was a regular donative of 5 solidi every five years of an Augustus reign (i.e. one solidus p.a.) Also, on the accession of a new Augustus, 5 solidi plus a pound of silver (worth 4 solidi, totaling 9 solidi) were paid. The 12 Augusti that ruled the West between 284 and 395 averaged about nine years per reign. Thus the accession donatives would have averaged about 1 solidus p.a. The late soldier's <b>disposable</b> income would thus have averaged at least 2 solidi per annum. It is also possible, but undocumented, that the accession bonus was paid for each Augustus and/or a bonus for each Caesar. The documented income of 2 solidi was {{only a quarter of}} the <b>disposable</b> income of a 2nd-century legionary (which was the equivalent of c. 8 solidi). The late soldier's discharge package (which included a small plot of land) was also minuscule compared with a 2nd-century legionary's, worth just a tenth of the latter's.|$|E

5|$|Gross {{salary was}} subject to {{deductions}} for food, clothing, boots and hay (probably for the company mules). It is unclear whether the cost of armour and weapons was also deducted, or borne by the army. Deductions left the soldier with a net salary of 78 denarii. This sum was sufficient, {{on the basis of}} the food deduction, to amply feed an adult for a year. In 84AD Domitian increased basic legionary pay by 33% (from 225 to 300 denarii): a similar increase was presumably accorded to auxiliaries, boosting their net income to 140 denarii, i.e. more than two food allowances. It was entirely <b>disposable,</b> as the soldier was exempt from the poll tax (capitatio), did not pay rent (he was housed in fort barracks) and his food, clothing and equipment were already deducted. It should be borne in mind that most recruits came from peasant families living at subsistence level. To such persons, any <b>disposable</b> income would appear attractive. It could be spent on leisure activities, sent to relatives or simply saved for retirement.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, the {{unemployment}} rate in Canberra was 3.4% which was lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.1%.

5|$|The only useful ways {{to reduce}} the spread of cold viruses are {{physical}} measures such as hand washing and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and <b>disposable</b> gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly.

5|$|This led to {{proposals}} {{for a new}} radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately {{have to deal with}} the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, the system could be considered <b>disposable</b> and did not need anything like the sophistication or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies.|$|E

5|$|Coming {{from a small}} {{domestic}} market, Iceland's {{banks have}} financed their expansion with loans on the interbank lending market and, more recently, by deposits from outside Iceland (which are also a form of external debt).

This inflation was exacerbated by the practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds â€“ effectively, printing money on demand.|$|E
5|$|Draught {{beer from}} a {{pressurised}} keg using a lever-style dispenser and a spout {{is the most}} common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. Nitrogen produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, <b>disposable</b> kegs called beer balls. In traditional pubs, the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.|$|E

5|$|Far Side Virtual is the thirtieth studio album by the American {{electronic}} musician James Ferraro, {{released on}} October 25, 2011 by the record label Hippos in Tanks. First {{conceived as a}} series of ringtones, the album marked Ferraro's transition from his previous lo-fi recording approach to a sharply produced, electronic aesthetic that deliberately evokes sources such as elevator music, corporate mood music, easy-listening, and outdated computer sound design. The album has been interpreted as engaging with themes such as hyperreality, <b>disposable</b> consumer culture, 1990s retro-futurism, advertising, and musical kitsch.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, {{should not be confused with}} lithium batteries, which are <b>disposable</b> (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode. Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.|$|E

5|$|Other key {{sectors of}} the Turkish economy are banking, construction, home appliances, electronics, textiles, oil refining, {{petrochemical}} products, food, mining, iron and steel, and machine industry. In 2010, the agricultural sector accounted for 9 percent of GDP, while the industrial sector accounted for 26 percent and the services sector for 65 percent. However, agriculture still accounted {{for a quarter of}} employment. In 2004, it was estimated that 46 percent of total <b>disposable</b> income was received by the top 20 percent of income earners, while the lowest 20 percent received only 6 percent. The rate of female employment in Turkey was 30 percent in 2012, the lowest among all OECD countries.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{combine to}} create the dump months, most of them {{circumstances}} particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases. Both periods immediately follow the times of {{year in which the}} distributors concentrate films they expect to be the biggest critical and/or commercial successes, periods of increased spending on entertainment generally. While this often means that moviegoers have less <b>disposable</b> income afterwards, economics alone does not explain the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.|$|E
