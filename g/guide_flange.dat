25|$|Proper {{tracking}} {{of the blade}} is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to check that the two bandwheels or flywheels are co-planar. This {{can be done by}} placing a straightedge across the front of the wheels and adjusting until each wheel touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade guide rollers and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the <b>guide</b> <b>flange.</b> The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the guide rollers due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment. This can be remedied by cutting of a small step on the rollers' front edges to accommodate the protruding teeth. Ideally the rollers should be crowned, (see belt_and_pulley_systems) a configuration that assists in the proper {{tracking of}} bands and belts, at the same time allowing clearance for the set of the teeth.|$|E
50|$|Trains and trams {{can turn}} corners without wheel-slip because the outer {{horizontal}} {{part of the}} wheels has a slightly tapered rim. The <b>guide</b> <b>flange</b> (ridge) is on the inside to prevent the vehicle from slipping sideways off the rails. The horizontal (cone-shaped) rim makes contact with the slightly convex top of a steel rail in different (horizontal) places so that the outer wheel has a larger effective diameter than the inner wheel.|$|E

40|$|Treating diverse maxillofacial {{patients}} poses {{a challenge}} to the maxillofacial prosthodontist. Rehabilitation of hemimandibulectomy patients must aim at restoring mastication and other functions such as intelligible speech, swallowing, and esthetics. Prosthetic methods such as palatal ramp and mandibular <b>guiding</b> <b>flange</b> reposition the deviated mandible. Such prosthesis {{can also be used to}} restore speech in case of patients with debilitating speech following surgical resection. This clinical report gives detail of a hemimandibulectomy patient provided with an interim removable dental speech prosthesis with composite resin flange for mandibular guidance therapy...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of {{benign and}} {{malignant}} tumors may involve surgical resection of the mandible, {{which may be}} segmental or hemisectioned. The prosthetic rehabilitation of resected mandible becomes difficult when preprosthetic planning is not considered. Preprosthetic plastic surgery and/or implant assisted overdenture may enhance the prosthetic rehabilitation of edentulous patients who have undergone resection of the mandible. Due to medical conditions, unwillingness for additional surgery or economical restraints, the treatment is limited to guidance flange prosthesis. The guidance flange prosthesis helps in directing the deviating mandible to improve form and function. This case report describes a procedure for fabricating customized <b>guiding</b> <b>flange</b> prosthesis to rehabilitate edentulous segmental mandibulectomy...|$|R
2500|$|A non-magnetic, non-electric, hand-powered tape {{recorder}} was patented {{by two of}} the Volta associates in 1886 (...) [...] The tape was a 3/16inch (4.8mm) wide strip of paper coated by dipping it in a solution of beeswax and paraffin and then scraping one side clean before the coating had set. The machine, of sturdy wood and metal construction, was hand-powered by means of a knob fastened to a flywheel. The tape passed from one eight inch (20.3cm) diameter reel and around a pulley with <b>guide</b> <b>flanges,</b> where it came into contact with either the recording or playback stylus. It was then wound onto a second reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a sound-vibrated mica diaphragm, engraved a groove into the wax coating. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus attached to a rubber diaphragm rode in the recorded groove. The reproduced sound was heard through rubber listening tubes like those of a stethoscope.|$|R
40|$|Mandibular {{discontinuity}} defects {{following a}} segmental mandibulectomy defects present {{a major challenge}} to the rehabilitation team. With no immediate intervention to rehabilitate the patient, definitive mandibular guidance prostheses with a metal guiding flange and acrylic teeth on the resected side can be used successfully to stabilize the occlusion and correct the deviation. The present case report describes the prosthodontic rehabilitation of a patient with a segmental mandibulectomy using a mandibular prosthesis with a metal <b>guide</b> <b>flange</b> and a maxillary stabilizing metal framework...|$|E
40|$|Mandibular {{resection}} following {{surgical treatment}} for neoplastic lesions {{of the oral}} cavity leads to numerous complications including altered mandibular movements, disfigurement, difficult in swallowing, impaired speech and articulation, and deviation of the mandible towards the resected site. Various prosthetic methods are employed to reduce or minimize mandibular deviation and improve and restore the lost functions and esthetic, like maxillomandibular fixation, implant supported prosthesis, removable mandibular <b>guide</b> <b>flange</b> prosthesis, and palatal based guidance restoration. This clinical report describes the rehabilitation of a patient following segmental mandibulectomy using palatal ramp prosthesis...|$|E
40|$|Segmental {{resection}} of the mandible generally {{results in}} deviation of the mandible to the defective side. This loss of {{continuity of the}} mandible destroys {{the balance of the}} lower face and leads to decreased mandibular function by deviation of the residual segment toward the surgical site. Prosthetic methods advocated to reduce or eliminate mandibular deviation include intermaxillary fixation, removable mandibular <b>guide</b> <b>flange,</b> palatal ramp, implant-supported prosthesis and palatal guidance restorations which may be useful in reducing mandibular deviation and improving masticatory performance and efficiency. These methods and restorations would be combined with a well organized mandibular exercise regimen.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{audio tape}} recorder was a non-magnetic, non-electric version invented by Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory and patented in 1886 (...) [...] It employed a 3/16 in strip of wax-covered paper that was coated by dipping it {{in a solution}} of beeswax and paraffin and then had one side scraped clean, with the other side allowed to harden. The machine was of sturdy wood and metal construction, and hand-powered {{by means of a}} knob fastened to the flywheel. The wax strip passed from one eight-inch reel around the periphery of a pulley (with <b>guide</b> <b>flanges)</b> mounted above the V-pulleys on the main vertical shaft, where it came in contact with either its recording or playback stylus. The tape was then taken up on the other reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a vibrating mica diaphragm, cut the wax from the strip. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus, attached to a rubber diaphragm, carried the reproduced sounds through an ear tube to its listener.|$|R
40|$|A {{berthing}} mechanism {{especially for}} use in berthing and compliant air-tight securing between manned space vehicle and modules is disclosed. The interface is provided {{by a pair of}} annular rings, one of which is typically, mechanically attached to the vehicle and the other to the module to which it is to be docked and secured. One of the two rings is attached to a base by resilient bellows. The facing surface of one annular ring is joined to a base by a cable laced through alternating pulleys attached circumferentially so that the interface surface of that ring may be tilted to accommodate angular misalignment as the annular rings are brought into docking (berthing) contact. Interleaving <b>guide</b> <b>flanges</b> with chambered sides provide at least some rotational mialignmnet correction. A plurality of electromechanical actuator/attenuator units provide means for extending one annular ring toward the other {{in the final stages of}} docking, for absorbing the initial docking shock and for drawing the annular rings into tight interface contact. Locking hooks provide for securing the interfaces...|$|R
50|$|A plate switch {{incorporates}} the tapered points {{of a typical}} switch into a self-contained plate. Each point blade is moved separately by hand. Plate switches are only used for double-flanged wheels, with wheels running through the plates on their <b>flanges,</b> <b>guided</b> by {{the edges of the}} plate and the moveable blade.|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{resection}} of the mandible due to {{presence of}} benign or malignant tumor {{is the most}} common cause of the mandibular deviation. Depending upon the location and extent of the tumor in the mandible, various surgical treatment modalities like marginal, segmental, hemi, subtotal, or total mandibulectomy can be performed. The clinicians must wait for extensive period of time for completion of healing and acceptance of the osseous graft before considering the definitive prosthesis. During this initial healing period prosthodontic intervention is required for preventing the mandibular deviation. This case report describes early prosthodontic management of a patient who has undergone a reconstructed hemi-mandibulectomy with modified mandibular <b>guide</b> <b>flange</b> prosthesis. The prosthesis helps patient moving the mandible normally without deviation during functions like speech and mastication...|$|E
40|$|Loss of mandibular {{continuity}} {{results in}} deviation of remaining mandibular segment toward the resected side {{primarily because of}} the loss of tissue involved in the surgical resection. The success in rehabilitating a patient with hemimandibulectomy depends upon {{the nature and extent of}} the surgical defect, treatment plan, type of prosthesis, and patient co-operation. The earlier the mandibular guidance therapy is initiated in the course of treatment; the more successful is the patient′s definitive occlusal relationship. Prosthodontic treatment coupled with an exercise program helps in reducing mandibular deviation and improving masticatory efficiency. This case report describes prosthodontic management of a patient who has undergone a hemimandibulectomy and was rehabilitated using provisional <b>guide</b> <b>flange</b> prosthesis followed by a definitive maxillary and mandibular cast partial denture with precision attachments designed to fulfill the patient′s needs and requirements...|$|E

The gauge was to be , it is not clear who chose this, or why. A contract for the construction of the formation was let to Hugh McIntosh of London in June 1820, for 9s 3d per yard; {{it was to be a}} single line with a number of passing sidings (referred to as [...] "turnouts")—two per mile. Some sidings — at least at Roborough and Yelverton — were to be constructed of granite blocks dressed to as to provide a <b>flange</b> <b>guide,</b> similar to the construction of the main line of the Haytor Granite Tramway.|$|R
40|$|Grease is {{commonly}} used to lubricate various machine components such as rolling bearings and seals. In this paper the flow of lubricating grease passing restrictions is described. Such flow occurs in rolling bearings during relubrication events where the grease is flowing in the transverse (axial) direction through the bearing and is hindered by <b>guide</b> rings, <b>flanges</b> etc, {{as well as in}} seals where transverse flow occurs, for example during so-called breathing caused by temperature fluctuations in the bearing. This study uses a 2 D flow model geometry consisting of a wide channel with rectangular cross-section and two different types of restrictions to measure the grease velocity vector field, using the method of Micro Particle Image Velocimetry. In the case of a single restriction, the horizontal distance required for the velocity profile to fully develop is approximately the same as the height of the channel. In the corner before and after the restriction, the velocities are very low and part of the grease is stationary. For the channel with two flow restrictions, this effect is even more pronounced in the “pocket” between the restrictions. Clearly, {{a large part of the}} grease is not moving. This condition particularly applies to the cases with a low-pressure drop and where high consistency grease is used. In practice this means that grease is not replaced in such “corners” and that some aged/contaminated grease will remain in seal pockets...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{integrity}} {{assessment of}} reactor vessel internals {{should be conducted}} in the design process to secure the safety of nuclear power plants. Various loads such as self-weight, seismic load, flow-induced load, and preload are applied to the internals. Therefore, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code, Section III, defines the stress limit for reactor vessel internals. The present study focused on structural response analyses of the upper <b>guide</b> structure upper <b>flange.</b> The distributions of the stress intensity in the flange body were analyzed under various design load cases during normal operation. The allowable stress intensities along the expected sections of stress concentration were derived {{from the results of}} the finite element analysis for evaluating the structural integrity of the flange design. Furthermore, seismic analyses of the upper flange were performed to identify dynamic behavior with respect to the seismic and impact input. The mode superposition and full transient methods were used to perform time–history analyses, and the displacement {{at the lower end of}} the flange was obtained. The effect of the damping ratio on the response of the flange was also evaluated, and the acceleration was obtained. The results of elastic and seismic analyses in this study will be used as basic information to judge whether a flange design meets the acceptance criteria...|$|R
