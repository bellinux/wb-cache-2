5|$|In 2012, Coimbatore Municipal Corporation {{proposed}} three rail routes. The <b>first</b> <b>circular</b> route {{was planned}} to connect Gandhipuram with Ganapathy, Sivananda Colony, Sai Baba colony, RS Puram, Townhall and City Railway Station. The second circular route will connect Podanur with Trichy Road, Sungam, Redfields, Race Course, City Railway Station and Ukkadam. A linear line was proposed from Chinniampalayam to TNAU via airport, CODISSIA, PSG Tech, Lakshmi Mills, Gandhipuram, Coimbatore North Junction and Cowley Brown Road. Vadavalli and Thondamuthur {{were included in}} the linear line as part of the phase extension. In 2017, the government of Tamil Nadu announced that feasibility study for the metro will be conducted by Chennai Metro Rail corporation and will be funded partly by Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Buddha statues are in niches at the Rupadhatu level, {{arranged}} in rows {{on the outer}} sides of the balustrades, the number of statues decreasing as platforms progressively diminish to the upper level. The first balustrades have 104 niches, the second 104, the third 88, the fourth 72 and the fifth 64. In total, there are 432 Buddha statues at the Rupadhatu level. At the Arupadhatu level (or the three circular platforms), Buddha statues are placed inside perforated stupas. The <b>first</b> <b>circular</b> platform has 32 stupas, the second 24 and the third 16, which adds up to 72 stupas. Of the original 504 Buddha statues, over 300 are damaged (mostly headless), and 43 are missing. Since the monument's discovery, heads have been acquired as collector's items, mostly by Western museums. Some of these Buddha heads are now displayed in numbers of museums, such as the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam and The British Museum in London.|$|E

25|$|The {{circular}} saw is a metal disc or blade with saw teeth {{on the edge}} {{as well as the}} machine that causes the disk to spin.

25|$|The Russian capital's town-planning {{development}} {{began to}} show {{as early as the}} 12th century, when the city was founded.

The <b>first</b> <b>circular</b> defence walls set the trajectory of Moscow's rings, laying the groundwork for the future planning of the Russian capital.|$|E

25|$|Chapter houses {{often occur}} {{adjacent}} to monastic or cathedral churches. Few have survived intact from the Romanesque period. Early chapter houses were rectangular in shape, {{with the larger}} ones sometimes having groin or ribbed vaults supported on columns. Later Romanesque chapter houses sometimes had an apsidal eastern end. The chapter house at Durham Cathedral is a wide space with a ribbed vault, restored as originally constructed in 1130. The circular chapter house at Worcester Cathedral, built by Bishop Wulfstan (1062–95), was the <b>first</b> <b>circular</b> chapter house in Europe and was much imitated in England.|$|E

500|$|On 17November 1906 the Daily Mail {{newspaper}} {{offered a}} £10,000 prize {{for the first}} aviator to fly the [...] between London and Manchester, {{with no more than}} two stops, in under 24hours. [...] The challenge also specified that take-off and landing were to be at locations no more than five miles from the newspaper's offices in those cities. [...] Powered flight was a relatively new invention, and the newspaper's proprietors were keen to stimulate the industry's growth; in 1908 they offered £1,000 for the first flight across the English channel (won on 25July 1909 by the French aviator Louis Blériot), and £1,000 for the <b>first</b> <b>circular</b> one-mile flight made by a British aviator in a British aeroplane (won on 30October 1909 by the English aviator John Moore-Brabazon). [...] In 1910, two men accepted the newspaper's 1906 challenge; an Englishman, Claude Grahame-White, and a Frenchman, Louis Paulhan.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the most common rectangular shape, stamps have been issued in geometric (circular, triangular and pentagonal) and irregular shapes. [...] The United States issued its <b>first</b> <b>circular</b> stamp in 2000 as a hologram of the earth. Sierra Leone and Tonga have issued stamps in the shapes of fruit. Stamps that are printed on sheets are generally separated by perforations, though, more recently, {{with the advent of}} gummed stamps that {{do not have to be}} moistened prior to affixing them, designs can incorporate smooth edges (although a purely decorative perforated edge is often present).|$|E
2500|$|In {{probability}} theory and directional statistics, the von Mises distribution (also {{known as the}} circular normal distribution or Tikhonov distribution) is a continuous probability distribution on the circle. It is a close approximation to the wrapped normal distribution, which is the circular analogue of the normal distribution. A freely diffusing angle [...] on a circle is a wrapped normally distributed random variable with an unwrapped variance that grows linearly in time. On the other hand, the von Mises distribution is the stationary distribution of a drift and diffusion process on the circle in a harmonic potential, i.e. with a preferred orientation. The von Mises distribution is the maximum entropy distribution for circular data when the real and imaginary parts of the <b>first</b> <b>circular</b> moment are specified. The von Mises distribution is a special case of the von Mises–Fisher distribution on the N-dimensional sphere.|$|E
60|$|The {{form of this}} {{monument}} is {{not only}} described but delineated in most authors, and, indeed, {{it is hard to}} know the first but by the last. The figure was at <b>first</b> <b>circular,</b> and there were at least four rows or circles within one another. The main stones were placed upright, and they were joined on the top by cross-stones, laid from one to another, and fastened with vast mortises and tenons. Length of time has so decayed them that not only most of the cross-stones which lay on the top are fallen down, but many of the upright also, notwithstanding the weight of them is so prodigious great. How they came thither, or from whence (no stones of that kind being now to be found in that part of England near it) is still the mystery, for they are of such immense bulk that no engines or carriages which we have in use in this age could stir them.|$|E
