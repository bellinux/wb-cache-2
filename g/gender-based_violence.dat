40|$|This study informs {{healthcare}} {{approaches to}} <b>gender-based</b> family <b>violence</b> through focus groups with Jordanian women. The authors conducted a thematic qualitative analysis of 12 focus groups among 70 married, divorced, or widowed women {{about their experiences}} and beliefs regarding family violence. Five themes relevant to healthcare providers were identified. Three of the themes addressed participant-perceived causes of gender-based family violence: 1) unmet gender role expectations, 2) stigma and social norms, and 3) extended family roles. The fourth theme reflects effects on victims. The fifth theme reflects protective qualities and help seeking behaviors.

25|$|Studies {{throughout}} Europe {{have identified}} risks that make children vulnerable to exploitation {{that are also}} causes and contributing factors of child trafficking. These include social and economic marginalisation, dysfunctional family backgrounds, experiences of neglect, abuse or violence within the family or in institutions, exploitative relationships, <b>gender-based</b> <b>violence</b> and discrimination, experiences of living or working on the streets, precarious and irregular migration situations, aspirations to work and to earn money and limited opportunities to enter or remain in school, vocational training or regular employment.

The language of narratives was analyzed by LIWC (Language Inquiry and Word Count procedure). Results showed that the language and structure of narratives by women with a history of domestic violence indicated greater stress and trauma, more incoherent space-time organization, and poorer relationship quality. Women who experienced violence wrote longer narratives that contained proportionately more negative emotion words and more references to cognitions and physical/body issues, and indicated more disorganized structure by means of incoherent use of verbal tense, more impoverished use of connectives, and greater use of negative sentence syntax and discrepancy words. They also included proportionately more pronoun references to ‘I’,‘You’,’ and ‘He’, indicating self vs. partner conflictual relationships. However, women who had experienced relationship violence for longer decreased their references to the emotions of fear and anxiety, suggesting adaptation to violence over time...|$|R

Speaking at the UN General Assembly in 2010, the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, its Causes and Consequences noted women’s particular vulnerability and increased risk of experiencing violence following disasters. Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, large numbers of women and girls living in Internally Displaced Persons camps experienced sexual violence. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights recognized the need for state actors to respond to <b>gender-based</b> <b>violence</b> committed by private actors, {{in response to a}} petition by Haitian groups and human rights lawyers calling on the Haitian government and international actors to take immediate measures—like increasing lighting, security, and access to medical care—to address sexual violence against women and girls in the IDP camps.|$|E

A critique of this resolution is that UNSCR 1325 proposes the implementing gender mainstreaming, however the progress that has been accomplished in this area has focused on women, rather than on assessing the impacts of planned action on both men and women. In 2010, a comprehensive 10-year impact study was conducted to assess the success of this resolution and found that there was limited success with the implementation, particularly in the increasing women’s participation in peace negotiations and peace agreements, and sexual and <b>gender-based</b> <b>violence</b> has continued to be prevalent, despite efforts to reduce it.|$|E
25|$|A Tribunal is a {{governmental}} body {{that makes up}} courts with a special jurisdiction. As ad hoc courts, they have specific purposes and are created in a response to certain situations. When it comes to gender-targeted crimes, tribunals hear the trials of the related crimes. Two examples of tribunals that have carried out trials of gender-targeted crimes are the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). These two tribunals have particularly focused on gender-based crimes while other tribunals have not. For example, another failure that the Tokyo Tribunal was its omission to call the female victims to give evidence at trial. The ICTR and ICTY have made improvements in regards to effectively prosecuting gender-targeted crimes and have carried out indictments that charge the accused with <b>gender-based</b> <b>violence</b> other than just rape charges.

40|$|The express {{inclusion}} of various crimes of <b>gender-based</b> and sexual <b>violence</b> in the Rome Statute is closely {{connected with the}} increased international attention given to these crimes in recent years, most particularly {{in the form of}} prosecutions by the ad hoc tribunals. However, while these first prosecutions were celebrated as revolutionary, a conflict has emerged between the consent-based and the broader coercive circumstance approaches to rape. Not only do the International Criminal Court (ICC) instruments as they stand do little to clarify the issue but, bearing in mind the operation of Article 21, there are likely to be various competing pressures on the ICC in defining and prosecuting rape. This article argues that the ICC can address this challenge by providing a clear statement in its first judgments on point that the central principle underlying the definition of rape under international law is the protection of sexual autonomy...|$|R
40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) is {{a global}} public health problem that is significantly associated with morbidity and mortality. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the factors associated with attitudes toward wife beating among women in Bangladesh. From the sixth Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS- 2011) interview data, 17, 842 women were included in this study. A woman’s age, household economic status, education (including her husband’s), employment status, residence, region, decision-making autonomy, and religion were assessed in relation to acceptance or justification of wife beating under five hypothetical situations: if the wife burns the food, argues with husband, goes out without telling her husband, neglects the children, and if she refuses to have sexual intercourse with her husband. Of all the women who accept being beaten by their husbands, 23 % accept it as a result of an argument, 18 % due to neglecting their children, 17 % due to going out without their husband’s permission, 8 % due to refusal of sex with husband, and 4 % due to burning the food. Low household economic status, women’s lower education, and being Muslim are significant factors for a woman to accept being beaten under all five hypothetical situations. Bangladesh has a long way to go in preventing IPV, particularly when poverty, low level of education, and unequal power in the family makes women vulnerable to <b>gender-based</b> domestic <b>violence</b> like IPV...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine 1) the proportion of girls (≤ 18 years) and women (> 18 years) who experienced {{physical violence}} by a sexual partner, and 2) factors (including self-reported HIV infection) associated with girls and women who experienced physical violence by a sexual partner. Cross-sectional surveys conducted in the Gem Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) area in Siaya County, western Kenya in 2011 - 2012 (Round 1) and 2013 - 2014 (Round 2). Among 8003 unique participants (582 girls and 7421 women), 11. 6 % reported physical violence by a sexual partner in the last 12 months (girls: 8. 4 %, women: 11. 8 %). Three factors were associated with physical violence by a sexual partner among girls: being married or cohabiting (nearly 5 -fold higher risk), low education, and reporting forced sex in the last 12 months (both with an approximate 2 -fold higher risk). Predictive factors were similar for women, with the addition of partner alcohol/drug use and deliberately terminating a pregnancy. Self-reported HIV status was not associated with recent physical violence by a sexual partner among girls or women. <b>Gender-based</b> physical <b>violence</b> is prevalent in this rural setting and has a strong relationship with marital status, low education level, and forced sex among girls and women.

25|$|The Food Justice Movement {{has been}} seen as a unique and {{multifaceted}} movement with relevance to the issue of food security. It {{has been described as a}} movement about social-economic and political problems in connection to environmental justice, improved nutrition and health, and activism. Today, a growing number of individuals and minority groups are embracing the Food Justice due to the perceived increase in hunger within nations such as the United States as well as the amplified effect of food insecurity on many minority communities, particularly the Black and Latino communities. A number of organizations have either championed the Food Justice Cause or greatly impacted the Food Justice space. An example of a prominent organization within the food justice movement has been the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which is a worker-based human rights organization that has been recognized globally for its accomplishments in the areas of human trafficking, social responsibility and <b>gender-based</b> <b>violence</b> at work. The Coalition of Immoaklee Workers most prominent accomplishment related to the food justice space has been its part in implementing the Fair Food Program which increased the pay and bettered working conditions of farm workers in the tomato industry who had been exploited for generations. This accomplishment provided over 30,000 workers more income and the ability to access better and more healthy foods for themselves and their families. Another organization in the food justice space is the Fair Food Network, an organization that has embraced the mission of helping familIes who need healthy food to gain access to it while also increasing the livelihoold for farmers in America and growing local economies.

40|$|Abstract: The {{advent of}} {{democracy}} in South Africa in 1994 created a unique opportunity for new laws and policies to be passed. Today, a decade later, South African reproductive health policies and the laws that underwrite them {{are among the most}} progressive and comprehensive in {{the world in terms of}} the recognition that they give to human rights, including sexual and reproductive rights. This paper documents the changes in health policy and services that have occurred, focusing particularly on key areas of sexual and reproductive health: contraception, maternal health, termination of pregnancy, cervical and breast cancer, <b>gender-based</b> and sexual <b>violence,</b> HIV/ AIDS and sexually transmitted infections and infertility. Despite important advances, significant changes in women’s reproductive health status are difficult to discern, given the relatively short period of time and the multitude of complex factors that influence health, especially inequalities in socio-economic and gender status. Gaps remain in the implementation of reproductive health policies and in service delivery that need to be addressed in order for meaningful improvements in women’s reproductive health status to be achieved. Civil society has played a major role in securing these legislative and policy changes, and health activist groups continue to pressure the government to introduce further changes in policy and service delivery, especially in the are...|$|R
