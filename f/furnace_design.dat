40|$|The paper {{starts with}} a short {{analysis}} {{of the performance of}} currently applied glass melting processes/furnaces concerning their energy consumption levels (benchmarking), as well as NOx emissions. The best practice situations will be presented for few glass products (e. g. container glass). Potential improvements in <b>furnace</b> <b>designs</b> to obtain more intensified melting or smaller glass furnace sizes and improved-controlled process steps (melting-in, complete raw material (e. g. sand) digestion of the melt, fining, homogenization & conditioning) will be discussed. Important aspects per process step are control of the applied temperature level, finding optimum glass melt flow regimes and residence times in each compartment of the melting tank, dedicated for a specific process step. Controlled & intensified heat transfer to the batch blanket area is decisive for the possibility to reduce glass furnace size, and consequently lowering structural energy losses. Mathematical modeling studies support the development of new <b>furnace</b> <b>designs</b> and heating methods in industrial glass furnaces with targeted high energy efficiency and moderate / low NOx emissions. New technological elements, such as application of CFD models, innovative oxygen-firing glass <b>furnace</b> <b>designs,</b> improved refractory materials, and advanced process control systems support the development of new glass melting concepts and <b>furnace</b> <b>designs...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{examination}} {{has been}} made of several new <b>furnace</b> <b>designs</b> and applications for both atomic absorption and emission. Problems with current <b>furnace</b> <b>designs</b> are analyzed and experimental data from three new alternate designs are presented. These alternate <b>furnace</b> <b>designs</b> were developed specifically to increase the thermal energy available to analyte molecules before they diffused from the optical path. A two pronged support furnace was developed in which electric current passed across both ends of an 18 mm long graphite tube. The tube center, where the sample was placed, heated by thermal conduction from the ends. Thus the analyte vapor always encountered walls hotter than the surface it left as it diffused toward the furnace ends. This heating mode resulted in ten-fold improvements in lead recoveries from some chloride salts compared to the CRA- 63 atomizer. The dependence of lead recoveries on interferent/analyte ratios was also established for lead in magnesium chloride solutions. A double-walled furnace was also examined and compared to the twopronged support furnace. The heating of this furnace was spatially uniform during the atomization of lead and cobalt. Despite this, recoveries for lead and cobalt were equal or superior to those obtained with the two-pronged furnace. Recoveries for lead in ZnSO 4, however, were lower in the double-walled design.

The commercial software Fluent was adopted to carry out 3 dimensional computational fluid dynamics (3 D-CFD) simulations of the gas flow field under different, actually four kinds of, <b>furnace</b> <b>designs</b> in this article. The flow fields of the carburizing gas around the part were analyzed. According to the simulations and analysis, it was shown that the number of fans on gear’s carburizing is not a primary factor, using a air inducting tub can improve the carburizing process significantly and proper loading tray design can also be positive.

50|$|<b>Furnace</b> <b>design</b> is {{a complex}} process, and the design can be {{optimized}} based on multiple factors. Furnaces in foundries can be any size, ranging from small ones used to melt precious metals to furnaces weighing several tons, designed to melt hundreds of pounds of scrap at one time. They are designed according {{to the type of}} metals that are to be melted. Furnaces must also be designed based on the fuel being used to produce the desired temperature. For low temperature melting point alloys, such as zinc or tin, melting furnaces may reach around 500 C. Electricity, propane, or natural gas are usually used to achieve these temperatures. For high melting point alloys such as steel or nickel-based alloys, the furnace must be designed for temperatures over 1600 C. The fuel used to reach these high temperatures can be electricity (as employed in electric arc furnaces) or coke.|$|E

50|$|The Bill for the {{construction}} of the bridge was passed on 19 May 1882 after an eight-day enquiry, the only objections being from rival railway companies. On 21 December of that year, the contract was let to Sir Thomas Tancred, Mr. T. H. Falkiner and Mr. Joseph Philips, civil engineers and contractor, and Sir William Arrol & Co.. Arrol was a self-made man, who had been apprenticed to a blacksmith at the age of thirteen before going on to have a highly successful business. Tancred was a professional engineer who had worked with Arrol before, but he would leave the partnership during the course of construction. The steel was produced by Frederick and William Siemens (England) and Pierre and Emile Martin (France). Following advances in <b>furnace</b> <b>design</b> by the Siemens brothers and improvements by the Martin brothers, the process of manufacture enabled high quality steel to be produced very quickly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{ability to}} set and {{accurately}} control the desired growth conditions {{is crucial in}} order to attain high quality bulk growth of Silicon Carbide (SiC), especially when the ingot size is large (> 2 ” in diameter by> 2 ” long). However, these two aspects of SiC PVT (Physical Vapor Transport) growth technology are severely limited in “conventional ” SiC PVT growth reactors with single cylindrical heaters. To overcome such shortcomings, an “alternative ” <b>furnace</b> <b>design</b> with two plane resistive heaters is proposed. In order to verify benefits of this design, numerical modeling and comparative procedures have been employed. Detailed comparative analysis revealed two fundamental disadvantages of the conventional <b>furnace</b> <b>design,</b> attributed to (a) – significantly higher in magnitude and spatially nonuniform distribution of the thermal stress that consequently deteriorates structural quality of the growing SiC boule, and (b) – inability to grow long (> 2 ”) monocrystalline ingots of SiC.
