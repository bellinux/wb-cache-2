5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} {{it took me a}} little while {{to get used to the}} new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that. [...] But I think the album was necessary <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Maybe the band wouldn't have continued if we hadn't done Heritage. [...] I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think Heritage is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.|$|E
500|$|.....this ceremony, {{which is}} {{apparently}} done against {{the will of}} Rome, {{is in no way}} a schism. We are not schismatics! If an excommunication was pronounced against the bishops of China, who separated themselves from Rome and put themselves under the Chinese government, one very easily understands why Pope Pius XII excommunicated them. There is no question of us separating ourselves from Rome, nor of putting ourselves under a foreign government, nor of establishing a sort of parallel church as the Bishops of Palmar de Troya have done in Spain. They have even elected a pope, formed a college of cardinals... It {{is out of the question}} <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> such things. Far from us be this miserable thought to separate ourselves from Rome!" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{positively}} {{reviewed by the}} contemporary trade publications that garnered almost universal acclaim. The Moving Picture News stated {{that this was the}} first Shakespeare adaptation by an Independent producer and said, [...] "We were asked to inspect and criticize this film, and there was nothing <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but give our full approval and applause, which we do right heartily." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror praised the production and commented on the clear adaptation of Shakespeare's work, resulting in an unusually clear presentation of the story. Another review in The Moving Picture World praised the film in a follow-up to the first review, commenting on the ephemeral nature of the productions by saying [...] "Few, indeed, will be the releases of the month to surpass this, and few, indeed, are the pictures that seem so complete and in every way satisfactory." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, D’Esposito {{said he had}} {{considered}} making stand-alone shorts for several characters, including Loki, a young Nick Fury, Black Panther, Ms. Marvel, and Black Widow. Regarding Loki, D’Esposito said [...] "Being on Asgard is very difficult <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in a short. It’s just impossible for us cost wise. The short would be 30 seconds, and it’s over. One shot of Loki on Asgard." [...] On Fury and Black Panther, he remarked [...] "It’s very complicated to do: who plays those characters? And designing the costume, getting it going … We tried. We were there in development, and we tried, but they were very difficult for all the reasons I gave. And we don’t {{want to do something}} that’s half baked because it’s not good for us and it’s not good for our fans." [...] In February 2014, Pearce mentioned other shorts that he had written that never came to fruition, including ones based on Sin and Crossbones, Jessica Jones, and Damage Control.|$|E
500|$|Daft Punk {{have said}} that they donned their robot outfits to easily merge the {{characteristics}} of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later stated that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. [...] "But then it became exciting from the audience's point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower." [...] When asked whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated [...] "No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of glam, where it's definitely not you." [...] With the release of Human After All, the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of black leather jacket and pants and simplified versions of the Discovery headgear. The attire was designed by Hedi Slimane. Bangalter stated that, [...] "We never like {{to do the same thing}} twice. It's more fun and entertaining <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something different, whether it's wearing masks or developing a persona that merges fiction and reality. We're happy to give back to the masses".|$|E

500|$|On April 25, 2007, the duo {{announced}} that they would embark {{on a tour of}} Canada performing in all 10 provinces, plus Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest Territories. In the words of Jack: [...] "Having never done a tour of Canada, Meg and I thought it was high time to go whole hog. We want to take this tour to {{the far reaches of the}} Canadian landscape. From the ocean to the permafrost. The best way <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that is ensure that we perform in every province and territory in the country, from the Yukon to Prince Edward Island. Another special moment of this tour is the show which will occur in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia on July 14, The White Stripes' Tenth Anniversary." [...] Canadian fiddler Ashley MacIsaac opened for the band at the Glace Bay show; earlier in 2007, MacIsaac and Jack had discovered that they were distantly related. It was also at this time that White learned he was related to Canadian fiddle player Natalie MacMaster.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp Stölzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004. Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie. Every smile, that's a lie." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 30, 2010, the NBC network {{announced}} that {{an episode of}} 30 Rocks fifth season would be filmed and broadcast live on two occasions in the evening of October 14, 2010. The decision was made {{in part due to}} lagging ratings for all of NBC's Must-See TV line-up. The idea was originally conceived during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, when the cast performed two live versions of the season two episode [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] as a benefit at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. When asked by Entertainment Weekly the reason for doing a live episode, Fey said [...] " [...] was what made us {{think that it would be}} fun to do [...] And how far we've come... Now we're going to do it on TV." [...] In this same interview, Fey revealed that the episode would also be performed in front of a live audience. [...] "It will be exciting <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it for a live audience and see if we get live laughter." [...] Fey noted that the experience [...] "was so fun to feel the different timing of the show live and the audience response, which you just don't get in a single-camera show." [...] In another interview, Fey revealed that the staff have talked about doing a live show for years [...] "because we felt we had sort of interesting personnel for it." [...] Following the conclusion of the writers' strike they spoke to NBC about performing live and attempted to film it during the fourth season; however, they were unable to schedule it. For the fifth season, the writing staff began planning the live performance and waited until McCarthy-Miller—a recurring 30 Rock director—was available to helm it. Fey and Carlock said in separate discussions that another decision to do this episode of 30 Rock was based on the cast having theater and improvisation experience. Alec Baldwin had previously performed in the East and West live broadcasts of the Will & Grace [...] premiere episode, [...] "Alive and Schticking".|$|E
