40|$|The {{lower limb}} {{rehabilitation}} robot is {{an application of}} robotic technology for stroke people with lower limb disabilities. A new applicable and effective sitting/lying lower limb rehabilitation robot (LLR-Ro) is proposed, which has the mechanical limit protection, the <b>electrical</b> <b>limit</b> protection, and the software protection to prevent the patient from the secondary damage. Meanwhile, as {{a new type of}} the rehabilitation robots, its hip joint rotation ranges are different in the patient sitting training posture and lying training posture. The mechanical leg of the robot has a variable workspace to work in both training postures. So, if the traditional mechanical limit and the <b>electrical</b> <b>limit</b> cannot be used in the hip joint mechanism design, a follow-up limit is first proposed to improve the compatibility of human-machine motion. Besides, to eliminate the accident interaction force between the patient and LLR-Ro in the process of the passive training, an amendment impedance control strategy based on the position control is proposed to improve the compliance of the LLR-Ro. A simulation experiment and an experiment with a participant show that the passive training of LLR-Ro has compliance...|$|E

40|$|We measure basic network {{parameters}} of silvernanowire (AgNW) networks commonly used as transparent conductingelectrodes in organic optoelectronic devices. By means of four point probing with nanoprobes, the wire-to-wire junction resistance and {{the resistance of}} single nanowires are measured. The resistanceRNW of a single nanowire shows a value of RNW=(4. 96 ± 0. 18) [*]Ω/μm. The junction resistanceRJ differs for annealed and non-annealed NW networks, exhibiting values of RJ=(25. 2 ± 1. 9) [*]Ω (annealed) and RJ=(529 ± 239) [*]Ω (non-annealed), respectively. Our simulation achieves a good agreement between the measured network parameters and the sheet resistanceRS of the entire network. Extrapolating RJ to zero, our study show that we {{are close to the}} <b>electrical</b> <b>limit</b> of the conductivity of our AgNW system: We obtain a possible RS reduction by only ≈ 20 % (common RS≈ 10 [*]Ω/sq). Therefore, we expect further performance improvements in AgNW systems mainly by increasing NW length or by utilizing novel network geometries...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 23 - 30 In {{the course}} of modernizing an {{ethylene}} plant in 1985, Union Rheinische Braunkohlen Kraftstoff AG converted a propylene compressor with 4 process stages from a steam turbine drive to an electric motor drive. The economic objective of the conversion was to reduce the required high-pressure steam flowrate, e. g., initiated by converting from light to heavy feedstock. Speed control of the compressor was to be maintained, since conversion to another control system with constant speed {{would have been very}} difficult with the existing compressor. The decision between electrical variable speed motor and electric motor with geared variable speed turbo coupling was made in favor of the motor with geared variable speed turbo coupling type. It was necessary to extend the foundation itself, due to the greater overall length of the drive unit (geared variable speed turbo coupling/electric motor) compared to the steam turbine. Additionally, the platform was extended and supported. The geared variable speed turbo coupling and the electric motor were mounted on a common frame designed specifically to be particularly rigid. The variable speed fluid coupling operating on the hydrodynamic principle was incorporated in a common housing together with its gear stages. Available time: three months during a scheduled shutdown. No problems occurred during installation and commissioning. The process control system operated satisfactorily; all mechanical, <b>electrical</b> <b>limit</b> values and values relative to vibration were met with a safe margin...|$|E
40|$|As package-level heat {{generation}} pushes past 1 kW/cm 3 in various military, aerospace, and commercial applications, new thermal management technologies {{are needed to}} maximize efficiency and permit advanced power electronic devices to operate closer to their inherent <b>electrical</b> <b>limit.</b> In an effort to align with the size, weight and performance optimization of high temperature electronics, cooling channels embedded directly into the backside of the chip or substrate significantly reduce thermal resistances by minimizing the number of thermal interfaces and distance the heat must travel. One implementation of embedded cooling considers microfluidic jets that directly cool the backside of the substrate. However, as fluid velocities exceed 20 m/s the potential for particle erosion becomes a significant reliability threat. While numerous particle erosion models exist, seldom are the velocities, particle sizes, materials and testing times in alignment with those present in embedded cooling systems. This research fills the above-stated gaps and culminates in a calibrated particle-based erosion model for single crystal silicon. In this type of model the mass of material removed due to a single impacting particle of known velocity and impact angle is calculated. Including this model in commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes, such as ANSYS FLUENT, can enable erosion predictions {{in a variety of}} different microfluidic geometries. First, a CFD model was constructed of a quarter-symmetry impinging jet. Lagrangian particle tracking was used to identify localized particle impact characteristics such as impact velocity, impact angle and the percentage of entrained particle that reach the surface. Next, a slurry erosion jet-impingement test apparatus was constructed to gain insight into the primary material removal mechanisms of silicon under slurry flow conditions. A series of 14 different experiments were performed to identify the effect of jet velocity, particle size, particulate concentration, fluid viscosity and time on maximum erosion depth and volume of material removed. Combining the experimental erosion efforts with the localized particle impact characteristics from the CFD model enabled the previously developed Huang et al. cutting erosion model to be extended to new parameter and application ranges. The model was validated by performing CFD erosion simulations that matched with the experimental test cases in order to compare one-dimensional erosion rates. An impact dampening coefficient was additionally proposed to account for slight deviations between the CFD erosion predictions and experimental erosion rates. The product of this research will ultimately enable high fidelity erosion predictions specifically in mission-critical military, commercial and aerospace applications...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} silver nanowire as well as carbon nanotube networks as transparent conducting electrodes for small molecule organic solar cells. In {{the framework of the}} nanowire investigations, a low-temperature method at less than 80 °C is developed to obtain highly conductive networks directly after the deposition and without post-processing. In detail, specific non-conductive organic materials act as a matrix where the nanowires are embedded in such that a mutual attraction based on capillary forces and hydrophobic interaction is created. This process is mediated by the ethanol contained in the nanowire dispersion and works only for sublayer materials which exhibit hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups at the same time. In contrast to high-temperature processed reference electrodes (210 °C for 90 min) without matrix, a slightly lower sheet resistance of 10. 8 Ohm/sq at a transparency of 80. 4 % (including substrate) is obtained by using polyvinylpyrrolidone as the sublayer material. In comparison to annealed silver nanowire networks, the novel approach yields a performance enhancement in corresponding organic solar cells which can compete with ITO-based devices. Furthermore, a novel approach for scalable, highly conductive, and transparent silver nanowire top-electrodes for organic optoelectronic devices is introduced. By utilizing a perfluorinated methacrylate as stabilizer, silver nanowires with high aspect ratio can be transferred into inert solvents which do not dissolve most organic compounds making this modified dispersion compatible with small molecule and polymer-based organic optoelectronic devices. The inert silver nanowire dispersion yields highly performing top-electrodes with a sheet resistance of 10. 0 Ohm/sq at 80. 0 % transparency (including substrate) directly after low-temperature deposition at 30 °C and without further post-processing. In comparison to similarly prepared reference devices comprising a thin-metal film as transparent top-electrode, reasonable power conversion efficiencies are demonstrated by spray-coating this dispersion directly on simple, air-exposed small molecule-based organic solar cells. Moreover, {{a deeper understanding of the}} percolation behavior of silver nanowire networks has been achieved. Herein, direct measurements of the basic network parameters, including the wire-to-wire junction resistance and the resistance of a single nanowire of pristine and annealed networks have been carried out for the first time. By putting the values into a simulation routine, a good accordance between measurement and simulation is achieved. Thus, an examination of the <b>electrical</b> <b>limit</b> of the nanowire system used in this work can be realized by extrapolating the junction resistance down to zero. The annealed silver nanowires are fairly close to the limit with a theoretical enhancement range of only 20 % (common absolute sheet resistance of approximately 10 Ohm/sq) such that a significant performance improvement is only expected by an enlargement of the nanowire length or by the implementation of new network geometries. In addition, carbon nanotube networks are investigated as alternative network-type, transparent bottom-electrode for organic small molecule solar cells. For that purpose, cleaning and structuring as well as planarization procedures are developed and optimized which maintain the optoelectronic performance of the carbon nanotube electrodes. Furthermore, a hybrid electrode consisting of silver nanowires covered with carbon nanotubes is fabricated yielding organic solar cells with only 0. 47 % power conversion efficiency. In contrast, optimized electrodes comprising only carbon nanotubes show significantly higher efficiency. In comparison to identically prepared ITO devices, comparable or lower power conversion efficiencies of 3. 96 % (in p-i-n stack), 4. 83 % (in cascade cell) as well as 4. 81 % (in p-n-i-p architecture) are demonstrated. For an inverted n-i-p stack design, the highest power conversion efficiency of 5. 42 % is achieved...|$|E
