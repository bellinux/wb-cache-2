The line would have two southern branches that would diverge at 14th Street. A connection to the BMT Canarsie Line would use a pair of the tracks, while the other pair would go to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street in Brooklyn through an East River tunnel. Then it would turn down to Red Hook. There would also be a loop at Battery Park. Another branch would be built; it would consist of two tracks, and would go between 162nd Street and 190th Street via Amsterdam Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt was {{receiving}} many letters from supporters {{urging him to}} run, and Republican office-holders were organizing on his behalf. Balked on many policies by an unwilling Congress and courts in his full term in the White House, he saw manifestations of public support he believed would sweep him to the White House with a mandate for progressive policies that would brook no opposition. In February, Roosevelt announced he would accept the Republican nomination if it was offered to him. Taft felt that if he lost in November, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> repudiation of the party, but if he lost renomination, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rejection of himself. He was reluctant to oppose Roosevelt, who helped make him president, but having become president, {{he was determined to}} be president, and that meant not standing aside to allow Roosevelt to gain another term.|$|E

5|$|Both of the {{targeted}} airfields contained sector operations rooms {{from which the}} British fighters were directed into action.

5|$|It is, I believe, universally {{agreed that}} the only way to keep Indians from harassing the country is to visit them. But we find, by experience, that burning their empty towns has not the desired effect. They can soon build others.

5|$|A harbour {{was built}} {{south-east}} of the castle, which would originally {{have been used}} to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests. All that remains of the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, and {{it may not have been}} in frequent use during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of good weather. West of the castle is a later shieling, the earthwork remains of a longhouse. South of this is a rectangular earthwork, with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is in fact such a siege-work, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> unique survival in England from this period.|$|E
5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would not let Manu sleep with him, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sign of weakness. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E

5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E
5|$|After {{being unable}} to win the {{previous}} running of the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, Dumas said that Porsche had to be focused, remain calm, and ensure that the team did not make any mistakes. Brendon Hartley, driving the No. 1 Porsche vehicle, said he {{was looking forward to}} racing the circuit because it is one of his favourite tracks and he felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good race for him and his team-mates. He also felt that his defence of the World Drivers' Championship would be revived at the track following his disqualification from the Silverstone event. Toyota No. 5 car driver Anthony Davidson said that the race would give them an indication of the segments that needed focus on before heading to Le Mans and was looking forward to competing at Spa-Francorchamps. Having missed the previous year's running of the event due to injury, Kazuki Nakajima was pleased to return to the circuit and felt that the race would be better than Silverstone.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli had {{originally}} hired Richard Maibaum {{and his friend}} Wolf Mankowitz to write Dr. Nos screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey. Mankowitz left the movie, and Maibaum then undertook a second version, more closely {{in line with the}} novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> disaster. Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script. Terence Young described Harwood as a script doctor who helped put elements more in tune with a British character. Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; and claimed both her screenplays for Dr. No and her screenplay for From Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novels closely.|$|E

25|$|In {{any case}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> error {{to read the}} Satires as a literal account of normal Roman life and thought in the late first and early second centuries AD, just as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> error to give {{credence}} to every slander recorded in Tacitus or Suetonius against the members of prior imperial dynasties. Themes {{similar to those of}} the Satires are present in authors spanning the period of the late Roman Republic and early empire ranging from Cicero and Catullus to Martial and Tacitus; similarly, the stylistics of Juvenal’s text fall within the range of post-Augustan literature, as represented by Persius, Statius, and Petronius.|$|R
