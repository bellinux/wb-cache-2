2500|$|Drain {{efficiency}} is {{the ratio of}} output RF power to input DC power when primary input DC power has been fed to the drain of a field-effect transistor. Based on this definition, the drain efficiency cannot exceed 25% for a class A amplifier that is supplied <b>drain</b> <b>bias</b> current through resistors (because RF signal has its zero level at about 50% of the input DC). Manufacturers specify much higher drain efficiencies, and designers are able to obtain higher efficiencies by providing current to the drain of the transistor through an inductor or a transformer winding. [...] In this case the RF zero level is near the DC rail and will swing both {{above and below the}} rail during operation. [...] While the voltage level is above the DC rail current is supplied by the inductor.|$|E

40|$|Velocity {{overshoot}} is {{a critically}} important nonstationary effect utilized for the enhanced performance of submicron field-effect devices fabricated with high-electron-mobility compound semiconductors. However, the physical mechanisms of velocity overshoot decay dynamics in the devices {{are not known}} in detail. Therefore, a numerical analysis is conducted typically for a submicron GaAs metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor in order to elucidate the physical mechanisms. It is found that there exist three different mechanisms, depending on device bias conditions. Specifically, at large <b>drain</b> <b>biases</b> corresponding to the saturation drain current (dc) region, the velocity overshoot suddenly begins to drop very sensitively due to the onset of a rapid decrease of the momentum relaxation time, not the mobility, arising from the effect of velocity-randomizing intervalley scattering. It then continues to drop rapidly and decays completely by severe mobility reduction due to intervalley scattering. On the other hand, at small <b>drain</b> <b>biases</b> corresponding to the linear dc region, the velocity overshoot suddenly begins to drop very sensitively due to the onset of a rapid increase of thermal energy diffusion by electrons in the channel of the gate. It then continues to drop rapidly for a certain channel distance due to the increasing thermal energy diffusion effect, and later completely decays by a sharply decreasing electric field. Moreover, at <b>drain</b> <b>biases</b> close to a dc saturation voltage, the mechanism {{is a mixture of}} the above two bias conditions. It is suggested that a large secondary-valley energy separation is essential to increase the performance of submicron devices...|$|R

Reduction of the total resistance with decreasing gate voltage is observed, indicating the p-type characteristic of phosphorene. Linear I-V relationship of transistor at low <b>drain</b> <b>bias</b> suggests good contact properties at the phosphorene/metal interface. Good current saturation at high <b>drain</b> <b>bias</b> values was observed. However, it was seen that the mobility is reduced in few-layer phosphorene when compared to bulk black phosphorus. Field-effect mobility of phosphorene-based transistor shows a strong thickness dependence, peaking at around 5 nm and decrease steadily with further increase of crystal thickness.|$|E
50|$|Barrier {{lowering}} {{increases as}} channel length is reduced, even at zero applied <b>drain</b> <b>bias,</b> because {{the source and}} drain form pn junctions with the body, and so have associated built-in depletion layers associated with them that become significant partners in charge balance at short channel lengths, even with no reverse bias applied to increase depletion widths.|$|E
50|$|As {{the drain}} voltage increases, its {{control over the}} current extends further toward the source, so the uninverted region expands toward the source, {{shortening}} {{the length of the}} channel region, the effect called channel-length modulation. Because resistance is proportional to length, shortening the channel decreases its resistance, causing an increase in current with increase in <b>drain</b> <b>bias</b> for a MOSFET operating in saturation. The effect is more pronounced the shorter the source-to-drain separation, the deeper the drain junction, and the thicker the oxide insulator.|$|E

50|$|As {{channel length}} is reduced, {{the effects of}} DIBL in the {{subthreshold}} region (weak inversion) show up initially as a simple translation of the subthreshold current vs. gate bias curve with change in drain-voltage, which can be modeled as a simple change in threshold voltage with <b>drain</b> <b>bias.</b> However, at shorter lengths {{the slope of the}} current vs. gate bias curve is reduced, that is, it requires a larger change in gate bias to effect the same change in drain current. At extremely short lengths, the gate entirely fails to turn the device off. These effects cannot be modeled as a threshold adjustment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A novel bias-switching {{scheme for}} a high-efficiency power {{amplifier}} is proposed. Two voltage levels for the <b>drain</b> <b>bias</b> of the RF power amplifier are generated {{using a combination}} of a class E dc/ac inverter and a class E rectifier with offset voltage. When signal peaks occur, the output of the class E dc/ac inverter is rectified and the rectified dc is added to the offset voltage by the class E rectifier, which boosts the <b>drain</b> <b>bias</b> of the RF power ampli-fier. Except during peaks, the <b>drain</b> <b>bias</b> of the RF power amplifier is connected to the offset voltage directly. Since the efficiency when there are no peaks is very high due to the direct connection between the offset voltage and <b>drain</b> <b>bias,</b> the overall efficiency of the RF power amplifier can be improved dramatically in high peak-to-av-erage power ratio (PAPR) systems. The measured results show that the <b>drain</b> <b>bias</b> of the RF power amplifier is boosted up to approx-imately 1. 8 times the offset voltage when the RF peaks generate.
