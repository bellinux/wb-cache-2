5|$|Ahn's co-founding of the Association <b>for</b> <b>Teachers</b> <b>of</b> English in Korea (ATEK), and {{subsequent}} {{development of a}} controversial public information campaign protesting government discrimination against foreign teachers resulted in dozens of foreign teachers filing formal complaints against the Korean government with the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. Parties opposing Ahn's work countered with a smear campaign against him, spreading completely fabricated allegations of sex crimes in order to discredit him. After a stint in China he moved to Metro Manila, Philippines, establishing the country's first reputation management consultancy {{and two years later}} establishing the country's first digital public relations agency. Ahn taught a graduate-level course on digital public relations at De La Salle University, speaks on the subject of digital public relations at a wide variety of industry conferences, and writes on the subject. He also contributes occasional news features to a number of national media outlets and writes literary fiction.|$|E

Francis Wayland Parker invited her to head the vocal music department at the Chicago Normal School in 1897 and she was asked by John Dewey to teach at the University of Chicago {{as the head of}} the Department of Music, School of Education from 1901 to 1910.

25|$|However, {{what both}} Takeda {{and his son}} Tokimune says should be taken with a big pinch of salt. Famous proponents of the art {{including}} Kondo sensei and Sagawa sensei have {{been quoted as saying}} Takeda and his son had the same teaching system ie only to teach one or two people the real 'techniques' ie the aiki of the art. The rest are only taught the 'basics' or the external form of the art. As it stands, only a few were ever taught the real stuff and what the true masters of the art said or did was done to mislead a particular group of people into thinking that they were learning true aikijitsu. The same can be said <b>for</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> the modified form of daitoryu, the art of aikido.|$|E

25|$|Three years later, Wade {{helped to}} {{establish}} the postgraduate diploma in Russian at the Scottish College of Commerce in Glasgow, which {{became part of the}} University of Strathclyde the following year – it was an intensive course in Russian intended <b>for</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> other languages, and later for graduates in fields like politics and economics. Wade taught classes on Russian grammar, literature and political thought, and also helped to design the new university's Bachelor of Arts degree in Russian. In 1968, Wade graduated from the University of London with a first-class degree in Russian with Polish, and in 1977 he received a PhD from Strathclyde: his dissertation was about Russian prepositions. As well as teaching and planning courses, Wade served as a mentor to his colleagues and a counsellor to his students. He was promoted to senior lecturer in 1969, reader in 1981, and professor in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Barbireau {{may have}} been {{attached}} to the Church of Our Lady in Antwerp since childhood. Since 1482, the church {{was the center of}} his life. It is also probably the reason why it was impossible for him to study with of Agricola. In 1484, succeeding Antoine de Vigne, he became Kapellmeister, a position he held until his death. Although Barbireau was registered in the account books of the church as singing master or magister choralum since 1487, he held the post probably as early as 1484. In 1485 as a schoolmaster, he paid a contribution to the Capellanía Our Lady of Nieuwwerk, a foundation created <b>for</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> singing. At that time, the choir led by Barbireau consisted of twelve singers. Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, evidently held him in high regard, and when Barbireau went to Buda in Hungary in 1490, Queen Beatrix also spoke highly of him.|$|E
25|$|Croatia and the Holy See signed four concordats. The {{first is}} about {{cooperation}} {{in the field of}} education and culture; ratified on January 24, 1997; the second is about spiritual guidance of Catholics who are members of the Croatian armed forces and police, ratified on January 24, 1997; the third is about legal matters, ratified on February 9, 1997; the fourth is about economic cooperation, ratified on December 4, 1998. These concordats have allowed the Catholic Church to provide religious education in state primary and secondary schools, establish Catholic schools, conduct pastoral care among Catholics in the armed forces and police, and to get financed from the state budget. As regards to financing, the Church has received the following amounts of money over the last decade: 2001, 461.3 million kunas; 2004-2007, 532 million kunas; 2008-2011, 475.5 million kunas; 2012–2013, 523.5 million kunas; plus around 200 million kunas each year <b>for</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> religious studies in schools, and around 60 million kunas for maintenance of churches which are considered to be a cultural heritage.

2500|$|But, at {{the same}} time, there were {{quite a number of}} Russians collaborating with the Nazi authorities. They worked on the {{newspapers}} propagandising the myth of [...] "a national Russia" [...] free of Bolsheviks and Jews, and [...] "the liberating mission" [...] of the Wehrmacht. Russians were won over to militarised units. The Nazis made advances to those of the Russian population who had suffered from the Bolsheviks. The newspapers of that time were full of information about Russian national culture. In Daugavpils a Russian theatre was opened, at the Rēzekne Teachers' Institute a Russian-language class <b>for</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> Russian was set up.|$|E

2500|$|Anna T. Jeanes was {{a wealthy}} Quaker {{who lived in}} Philadelphia. She had outlived her other family members. She has been {{described}} as [...] "a remarkable woman with a vision for Christian peace which she used her fortune to promote." [...] As she neared the end of her life, she was approached by Dr. Booker T. Washington and others to see if she would help fund their efforts. If she could, she wanted to help [...] "the little country schools", and set aside $1 million from her family inheritance to establish a fund called the Jeanes Foundation. The purpose was to maintain and assist rural schools for African Americans in the South. The organization provided funds to employ supervisors of teachers who were dedicated to upgrading vocational training programs <b>for</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> black students.|$|E
2500|$|Schurz was {{referring}} to the various clubs and societies Germans developed in Milwaukee. The pattern of German immigrants to settle near each other encouraged the continuation of German lifestyle and customs. [...] This resulted in German language organizations that encompassed all aspects of life; for example, singing societies and gymnastics clubs. Germans also made a lasting impact on the American school system. Kindergarten was created as a pre-school for children, and sports programs of all levels, as well as music and art were incorporated as elements of the regular school curriculum. These ideas were first introduced by radical-democratic German groups, such as the Socialist Turner Societies, known today as the American Turners. Specifically in Milwaukee, the American Turners established its own Normal College <b>for</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> physical education and a German-English Academy.|$|E
