2500|$|After one {{abortive}} {{attempt to}} catch Mina, Clausel decided {{to strike at}} the guerilla leader's mountain base at Roncal. He assembled Edmé-Martin Vandermaesen's division of the Army of the North [...] plus the troops of Abbé and Barbot for the operation. Clausel left Eloi Charlemagne Taupin's 3rd Division of the Army of Portugal behind to police Navarre. The raid on 12–13 May destroyed the base and inflicted 1,000 casualties on the guerillas, but Mina himself got away. Clausel treated his prisoners humanely, but laid a <b>harsh</b> <b>hand</b> on the villages of northwest Navarre. The mountain operation was so remote that King Joseph was unable to communicate with Clausel's army.|$|E

The bloom had gone from her cheeks for ever, and their intense pallor was almost deathlike, matching very nearly her snow-white hair, but her eyes seemed to have retained much of their old power and sweetness, and the light which sometimes flashed in them lent her face a peculiar charm. But now they were full of a deep anxiety as she lay there, a restless disquiet which showed itself also in her nervously twitching fingers.|$|E

Here is a youth of good family, who elects {{to take up a}} life filled with mischief from the start. Discipline has been lacking. Here, at last, he so far oversteps the law that he appears before a jury. It seems to the Court necessary, for this young man's own good, that he feel the <b>harsh</b> <b>hand</b> of the law. According to the evidence adduced here to-day, he has been for years beyond the control of his parents, and must now know the inflexible purpose of law. I have in mind all that can be said in his favor: his youth, the disparity of age and physical power between himself and his accuser, the provocation, and the possession of the whip by the accuser--but all these are more than counterbalanced by the record of mischief and violence which stands against the prisoner." ...|$|E

50|$|In 776, {{after the}} death of Tian Shenyu (田神玉, Tian Shen'gong's brother), the acting {{military}} governor of Biansong Circuit (汴宋, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), Tian Shenyu's subordinate Li Lingyao (李靈曜) seized control of Biansong Circuit and tried to act independently as well. This time Emperor Daizong reacted by ordering Li Zhengji, Li Zhongchen, Li Mian, Ma Sui, and Chen Shaoyou (陳少遊) to attack Li Lingyao. The main attack against Biansong's capital prefecture Bian Prefecture (汴州) was commanded by Li Zhongchen and Ma, but the other military governors also attacked Biansong from other sides, and, as part of the campaign, Li Zhengji seized five of the eight Biansong prefectures and requested that they be merged into Pinglu. Emperor Daizong agreed, and Li Zhengji moved his headquarters from Qing Prefecture (青州) to Yun Prefecture (鄆州, in modern Tai'an, Shandong), leaving Qing Prefecture in Li Na's hands. Also at his request, Emperor Daizong incorporated Li Zhengji's line into the imperial clan rolls. It was said that by this point, Li Zhengji became the most powerful military governor, with 100,000 men in his army. He governed Pinglu with a <b>harsh</b> <b>hand,</b> such that the citizens in Pinglu did not dare to converse with each other publicly, but it was also said that his laws were fair and simple and the tax burden was low. The military governors of the nearby circuits were all fearful of him. Emperor Daizong created him the Prince of Raoyang.|$|E

40|$|As a storm chaser and {{meteorologist}} myself, I admit {{my expectations}} {{for this book}} by an 2 ̆ 2 outsider 2 ̆ 2 were relatively low. For the most part, however, Mathis has gotten it right, evidently {{as a result of}} extensive research on her part. The book alternates in a somewhat erratic fashion between tornado survivor anecdotes and narrative about the events of May 3, 1999, and the science behind those events. From a purely storytelling viewpoint, I find this alternation of topics somewhat distracting, though others might find it entertaining. 2 ̆ 2 This book, 2 ̆ 2 the author says in her introduction, 2 ̆ 2 is the life story of one tornado on one day and its consequences-not just any tornado, but the most powerful tornado to strike a metropolitan area. It is the life story of a tornado researcher and his legacy-not just any researcher, but the most brilliant meteorological detective of the twentieth century. And {{it is the story of}} the lives touched by such a <b>harsh</b> <b>hand</b> on May 3, 1999. 2 ̆ 2 While these somewhat hyperbolic rankings may be arguable close to the truth, the stories of several tornadoes are actually told here, as are the stories of several researchers.

Suddenly he snapped, striking with his fangs like a snake. The hand was jerked back, and the teeth came together emptily with a sharp click. Beauty Smith was frightened and angry. Grey Beaver clouted White Fang alongside the head, so that he cowered down close to the earth in respectful obedience.|$|R

40|$|Should {{copyright}} remedy laws {{be changed}} to address the proliferation of sharing of online content? On one <b>hand,</b> <b>harsh</b> penalties may improve compensation and infringement deterrence; on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>harsh</b> penalties may harm the interests of free expression and the enrichment of society through sharing. This article focuses on identifying the ideal level of enforcement and proposes a new remedy scheme to appropriately address social media sharing versus commercial misappropriation. In order to do that, Part I of this article explores the purposes of compensation and deterrence that are behind the copyright statutory remedy scheme. Thereafter, Part II sheds light on the history and policy choices made by courts and Congress as the remedy scheme evolved from the Copyright Act of 1790 up to the Copyright Act of 1976. Part III analyzes the Copyright Act of 1976 with respect to damages as set forth in § 504. From this analysis, {{it is clear that}} there has been a theme of arbitrary and punitive awards that has carried over into the online world. Finally, Part IV recommends building a stronger foundation for a revised remedy scheme to address the original purposes of statutory damages in the new digital age. This article will reveal how the Copyright Act of 1976, with respect to statutory damages, was built upon an improper foundation. Therefore, the proposed changes in copyright remedies are designed to tie back to the purposes of compensation and deterrence, to meet the demands of the new media age. The article also recommends a two-tiered system that would more effectively balance the competing interests of protecting expression and allowing sharing for societal benefit. The proposed system would allow courts flexibility in assessing damages while providing more directed guidance to prevent excessive awards...|$|R

500|$|The Kinder mass {{trespass}} was {{a deliberate}} act of civil disobedience (the law of trespass having already been repealed) by men of the Young Communist League of Manchester, and others from Sheffield. The protest was intended to secure free access to England's mountains and moorlands. The 'ramblers', led by Benny Rothman, walked from [...] Bowden Bridge Quarry, near Hayfield to climb the hill called Kinder Scout in the Derbyshire Peak District on 24 April 1932. A young man called James Henry Miller, better known as Ewan MacColl, was a keen rambler and an enthusiastic member of the Young Communist League. He played a major part in organising the publicity for the trespass, duplicating and handing out leaflets, though this role is disputed. He {{took part in the}} trespass, and was shocked by the violent reaction of the gamekeepers who met the ramblers on the hill, and the extremely <b>harsh</b> sentences <b>handed</b> down by the magistrates to the five ramblers who were arrested that day. What MacColl did not know was that the protest was to have a powerful long-term effect, leading to improved access to the countryside in the shape of national parks (from 1949), long-distance footpaths starting with the Pennine Way (opened in 1965) and various forms of the desired 'right to roam' (such as with the CRoW Act, 2000).|$|R
40|$|Objective: HIV/AIDS {{infection}} in injecting drug users occurs with explosive rapidity and, having occurred, they can form {{a core group}} for further sexual and vertical transmission. As HIV transmission among injecting drug users can be extremely rapid, various approaches to intervention and obstructing the spread of HIV infection have been explored. Overall, these have been relatively ineffective so what has emerged, both in the developed and developing world, is harm reduction. Material and Method: In the light of these general considerations, the authors reviewed the law of Thailand in relation to drug abuse and dependence according to the harm reduction {{for the prevention of}} HIV/AIDS {{infection in}} injecting drug users. Results: With the review, the authors recommend some changes in the law: 1. Introducing a law that allows IDUs to possess sterile syringes & needles while under supervision of a physician. 2. Introducing a law that allows for testing for HIV in people in custody in whom there are grounds for suspecting drug abuses. 3. Establishing and financing a Multi-disciplinary Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of HIV/AIDS (MCCPH/A) Conclusion: It should be emphasized that, as in other countries, drug abuse and dependence should, where appropriate, be decriminalized. A large proportion of people with drug-related problems are ill and in need of treatment rather than criminals requiring <b>harsh</b> penalties <b>handed</b> down by the courts...|$|R

60|$|Thus in {{literature}} as in civilisation generally, {{the culture of}} old Rome, either as handed down ecclesiastically through the Latin, or as handed down popularly through the Norman-French, overcame the native Anglo-Saxon culture, such as it was, and drove it utterly out of the England which we now know. Though a new literature, in Latin and English, sprang up after the Conquest, that literature had its roots, not in Sleswick or in Wessex, but in Greece, in Rome, in Provence, and in Normandy.
