5000|$|Generally, bread flours {{are high}} in gluten (hard wheat); pastry flours have a lower gluten content. <b>Kneading</b> {{promotes}} the formation of gluten strands and cross-links, creating baked products that are chewier (in contrast to crumbly). The [...] "chewiness" [...] increases as the dough is <b>kneaded</b> for longer times. An increased moisture content in the dough enhances gluten development, and very wet doughs left to rise {{for a long time}} require no <b>kneading</b> (see no-knead bread).

5000|$|Since {{most of the}} {{preferred}} [...] "domestic traits" [...] are neotenous or juvenile traits that persist in the adult, <b>kneading</b> may be a relic juvenile behavior retained in adult domestic cats.

Many cats purr while <b>kneading.</b> They also purr mostly when newborn, when feeding, or when trying to feed on their mother's teat. The common association between the two behaviors may corroborate the evidence in favor of the origin of <b>kneading</b> as a remnant instinct.|$|R

It was found that these climatic conditions influence in a different way the technological qualities of dough obtained from these sorts of flour, respectively the finished products obtained from them. Thus depending on the qualitative characteristics of the sorts of flour, which are directly influenced by the growing conditions (climatic conditions), the way of behaving during processing within the technological process is different.

40|$|Abstract. Hubbard {{trees are}} {{invariant}} trees connecting {{the points of}} the critical orbits of postcritically finite polynomials. Douady and Hubbard [DH 1] introduced these trees and showed that they encode the essential information of Julia sets in a combinatorial way. The itinerary of the critical orbit within the Hubbard tree is encoded by a (pre) periodic sequence on { 0, 1 } called <b>kneading</b> sequence. We prove that the <b>kneading</b> sequence completely encodes the Hubbard tree and its dynamics, and we show how to reconstruct the tree and in particular its branch points (together with their periods, their relative posititions, their number of arms and their local dynamics) {{in terms of the}} <b>kneading</b> sequence alone. Every <b>kneading</b> sequence gives rise to an abstract Hubbard tree, but not every <b>kneading</b> sequence occurs in real dynamics or in complex dynamics. Milnor and Thurston [MT] classified which <b>kneading</b> sequences occur in real dynamics; we do the same for complex dynamics in terms of a complex admissibility condition. This complex admissibility condition fails if and only if the abstract Hubbard tree has a so-called evil periodic branch point that is incompatible with local homeomorphic dynamics on the plane. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{traditional}} dough <b>kneading</b> machines the ingredients, e. g. flour, water, {{salt and}} yeast are filled into a cylindrical vessel and mixed {{by means of}} a rotating spiral. In order to assure consistent dough quality while environmental conditions and flour characteristics vary, an experienced baker needs to 1) manually set the rotational speed as well as the time for <b>kneading</b> and 2) continuously monitor the <b>kneading</b> process. The overall goal of this work is to develop an intelligent <b>kneading</b> machine that autonomously decides how to set the speed and when to stop <b>kneading.</b> This machine assists the bakers work and allows for more efficient use of kneaders as part of autonomous production systems. We describe the design of intelligent information processing algorithms that were implemented in a technology demonstrator and validated with the expertise of professional bakers. While focusing on the control software, the underlying concepts are explained and relevant results are shown. In particular, reliable detection of phase-shifts and model-based prediction of dough properties was achieved...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} the <b>kneading</b> and forming process or pasta quality have been investigated. Using the same blend of wheat flour and keeping mixing and drying {{conditions}} constant, three types of spaghetti were produced using the following three <b>kneading</b> and forming processes: A) <b>kneading</b> with a continuous press and forming by pressure-extrusion; B) <b>kneading</b> and forming by sheeting-rolls; C) <b>kneading</b> by hand and forming with sheeting-rolls. These three processes impart different mechanical work on the dough. The three types of dried spaghetti exhibited differences in cooking requirements and in cooing quality. Spaghetti (A) absorbed water more slowly and showed poor cooking quality. Spaghetti (B) and (C) had a shorter cooking time, no stickiness and good firmness after cooking. Spaghetti compactness seems to control water absorption during cooking, i. e., the greater the compactness, the longer the cooking time. Nevertheless, compactness does not explain differences in cooking quality. On the contrary, this characteristic is clearly related to the different organization of proteins, as transmission and scanning electron microscopy images revealed. In fact both spaghetti (B) and (C) showed a compact and continuous protein network, probably {{as a consequence of}} the mild and ordered <b>kneading</b> obtained by the sheeting process. Spaghetti (A), produced by dough <b>kneading</b> implying strong mechanical stresses, exhibited protein network breakage which may account for its poor cooking quality. The results of the present work indicate that industrial <b>kneading</b> and extrusion, as performed today in the continuous press, are unsuitable for making the best use of poor quality raw materials. The pressure-extrusion process requires technological innovations which could ensure spaghetti with cooking quality comparable to that produced in the traditional sheeting process as well as high productivity...|$|R
