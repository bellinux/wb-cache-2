In December 2006 Baird was one of thirteen Conservative MPs who voted against reopening the national debate on same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> the outcome of this operation {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E

5|$|The synagogue {{experienced}} difficulty {{during the}} Great Depression—membership dropped, the congregational school was closed, and staff had their salaries reduced—but conditions <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> {{by the late}} 1930s. In 1943 the synagogue {{changed its name to}} Temple Israel, and by the late 1940s membership had almost doubled from its low point in the 1930s. Ettelson retired in 1954, and was succeeded by Jimmy Wax.|$|E

5|$|Because his {{finances}} <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> {{and were}} now sufficient to support a family, he received permission to marry his fiancée, Sara Elisabeth Moræa. Their wedding was held 26 June 1739. Seven months later, Sara gave birth to their first son, Carl. Two years later, a daughter, Elisabeth Christina, was born, and the subsequent year Sara gave birth to Sara Magdalena, who died when 15 days old. Sara and Linnaeus would later have four other children: Lovisa, Sara Christina, Johannes and Sophia.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the storm}} struck, Honduras was facing {{decreased}} food supplies due to ongoing El Niño conditions. The economy {{had been growing}} at a rate similar to the previous year until Mitch struck, and was largely dependent on exports. About 73% {{of the population was}} living in poverty when the storm struck. Hurricane Mitch set back the economies of various countries in the region, including Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador, after they <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> throughout the 1990s.|$|E

Lancashire selected a replacement captain, but when MacLaren returned to England, he re-committed to the club, stating the visit to Australia <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> the health of his wife, and he was reappointed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRestricted {{isometry}} constants play {{an important}} role in compressed sensing. In the literature, E. J. Candès has proven that δ 2 k< 2 − 1 ≈ 0. 4142 is a sufficient condition for the l 1 minimization problem having a k-sparse solution. Later, S. Foucart and M. Lai <b>have</b> <b>improved</b> the condition to δ 2 k< 0. 4531 and S. Foucart <b>has</b> <b>improved</b> the bound to δ 2 k< 0. 4652. In 2010, T. Cai, L. Wang and G. Xu <b>have</b> <b>improved</b> the condition to δ 2 k< 0. 4721 for the cases such that k is a multiple of 4 or k is very large and S. Foucart <b>has</b> <b>improved</b> the bound to δ 2 k< 0. 4734 for large values of k. In this paper, we <b>have</b> <b>improved</b> the sufficient condition to δ 2 k< 0. 4931 for general k. Also, in some special cases, the sufficient condition can be improved to δ 2 k< 0. 6569. These new bounds have several benefits on recovering compressible signals with noise...|$|R
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> somewhat with uniforms, {{a modicum of}} training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway was at {{an all-time}} low. Ridership had dropped to 1910s levels, and {{graffiti}} and crime were rampant on the subway; in general, the subway was very poorly maintained during that time, and delays and track problems were common. Still, the NYCTA managed to open six new subway stations in the 1980s, make the current fleet of subway cars graffiti-free, as well as order 1,775 new subway cars. By the early 1990s, conditions <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> significantly, although maintenance backlogs accumulated during those 20 years are still being fixed today.|$|E
5|$|By this point, {{supplies}} of the Beaufighter {{and the new}} Mosquito <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> dramatically, and {{the decision was made}} to remove all single-engine designs from the night fighter force during 1942. Two Defiant units did switch to the Mk. VI, but they operated for only about four months before converting to the Mosquito. Production for the AI role ended, and the electronics were converted to Monica tail warning radars for the bomber force, until the mid-1944 knowledge of the Germans' Flensburg radar detector, which spotted Monica transmissions, was revealed to the British.|$|E

5|$|Flanders and his brother, Ernest, were {{instrumental}} in developing screw thread grinding machines. These incorporated advances in thread technology (furthered by the Hartness optical comparator) and Flanders’s engineering calculations for gear-cutting machinery. In 1946, the two brothers received the Edward Longstreth Medal of the Franklin Institute as recognition of this accomplishment. They <b>had</b> <b>improved</b> the accurate manufacture of die-cut screws in soft metal and solved the problem of thread-grinding on hardened work.|$|E

In the United States, William D. Harkins had used it to separate chlorine. Kistiakowsky was familiar with the work of Charles G.

5|$|Litter {{accumulation}} is {{a perennial}} {{problem in the}} subway system. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, as well as graffiti were a serious problem.
