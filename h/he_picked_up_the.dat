5|$|As 9 Staffel {{crossed the}} coast they were fired at by Royal Navy patrol boats. The machine gun fire was ineffective. However, the Royal Observer Corps Post K3, {{situated}} {{on top of}} Beachy Head, spotted the Dorniers. They immediately telephoned a warning to Observer Group Headquarters at Horsham and fighter sector stations in the area, including RAF Kenley. Wing Commander Thomas Prickman, the station commander at Kenley, noticed the low-flying Dornier plot appear on his situation map. They appeared to be heading away towards the west, and was unsure of their target. His controllers were organising Nos. 64 and 615 Squadrons to meet the high-altitude raid. Roth headed past Lewes until <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Brighton–London rail line. He then turned north-west.|$|E
5|$|Corporal Angel Mendez (1946–1967) {{was among}} the many men who volunteered to join the Marine Corps right {{after graduating from high}} school. He was {{assigned}} to Company F, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division on March 16, 1967, and conducting a search and destroy mission with his company when his company came under attack from a Viet Cong battalion. Half of a platoon was pinned down under enemy fire, and Mendez volunteered to lead a squad to assist the pinned-down Marines in returning to friendly lines with their two dead and two seriously wounded. Mendez exposed himself and opened fire on the enemy. His platoon commander, Lieutenant Ronald Castille, was seriously wounded and he fell, unable to move. Mendez shielded him with his body as he applied a dressing to the wound, <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lieutenant and started to carry him to friendly lines, which were more than seventy-five meters away. Mendez was hit in the shoulder, yet he chose to act as rear man and he continued to shield his lieutenant with his own body until he was mortally wounded. Mendez was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross and promoted to sergeant.|$|E

His father built a studio for Eric in their backyard, and Eric often had friends come by to jam; recordings with Clifford Brown from this studio document this early time.|$|E
25|$|Tanaka {{went on to}} win {{his second}} Sawamura Award as the Golden Eagles competed for their first Japan Series title. Taking postseason games into account, his 2013 record was 30-1. The lone loss came in Game 6 of the 2013 Japan Series, a 160-pitch {{complete}} game, and he avenged that loss as <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> save in the decisive Game 7.|$|E
25|$|Gibson {{made two}} Test {{appearances}} for the West Indies. In his first outing against England in 1995, <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wickets of Alec Stewart and Darren Gough {{in the first}} innings, finishing with figures of 2-81, but was less successful in the second with 0-51.

25|$|On January 11, 2009, McNabb led the Eagles {{past the}} Giants in the divisional {{round of the}} playoffs.

In the game, McNabb was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct when, after being tackled into the Giants' sideline after a lengthy run, <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Giants' coaching phone in jest.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season Morrison bowled consistently, {{but failed}} to make the headlines that he had done in his debut season. The highlight was undoubtedly Wellington's tour match against the MCC, when <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> prize wickets of England legends Trevor Bailey, Bill Edrich and Colin Cowdrey at the Basin Reserve. Ultimately, it was a disappointing season: Morrison finished well down the bowling averages, with just 16 wickets at nearly 30 apiece.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, when Garcia {{was playing}} with the Warlocks, he used a Guild Starfire, which he also used on the début album of the Grateful Dead.

During his time at talkSPORT, Irani also appeared as a guest on the BBC quiz show A Question of Sport.|$|E
25|$|But {{history was}} against Bayern. The {{advent of the}} Hitler regime saw President Landauer, a Jew, resigning quickly, and the team visiting him in his Swiss exile did not help their {{fortunes}} in the new era. Dombi, also a Jew, moved to the Netherlands, where <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> reins of SC Feijenoord in Rotterdam, laying the foundations for the future greatness of the club. In the ensuing years, the club decayed into irrelevance, disliked by the Nazis for its Jewish background and taunted as Judenklub.|$|E
5000|$|Rumstick is {{described}} in By Force of Arms as a great, [...] "jolly bear of a man."

50|$|Kirel can <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> {{blocks and}} drop them. He cannot jump higher than one block so must build {{staircases}} to reach high places.

50|$|However, after {{encouraging}} Christine {{to return}} home, Pignon makes a final gaffe: <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> telephone when she calls {{to talk to}} Brochant despite having previously {{told her he was}} in a phone booth, thus arousing her suspicions that he has simply been repeating lines fed to him by Brochant (as he indeed had been in previous conversations).|$|R
25|$|During {{the first}} innings of the 2015 Ashes series, <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> worst bowling figures of his career, 0–111, {{where he was}} torn apart by England's batsmen. However, in the 2nd Test at Lords, Johnson {{recovered}} to take 6 wickets in the match and a run-out of Ben Stokes to help Australia to a 405 run win to level the series with England at 1–1. In the next test at Edgbaston, Johnson became the first Australian player since Shane Warne to claim at least 300 wickets and score at least 2000 runs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, King {{published}} {{a handful of}} short novels—Rage (1977), The Long Walk (1979), Roadwork (1981), The Running Man (1982) and Thinner (1984)—under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. The idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident. An alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> name from the hard rock band Bachman-Turner Overdrive, {{of which he is}} a fan.|$|E
25|$|Clanton {{reported}} {{in his testimony}} afterward that Wyatt Earp cursed him. He said Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan Earp offered him his rifle and to fight him {{right there in the}} courthouse, which Clanton declined. Clanton also denied ever threatening the Earps.

Virgil Earp told Clanton he would leave Clanton's confiscated rifle and revolver at the Grand Hotel which was favored by Cowboys when in town. Clanton testified that <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> weapons from William Soule, the jailer, a couple of days later.|$|E
60|$|GEORGE (grinning, and {{not quite}} at ease). You might imagine I was embarking in the gent's {{furnishing}} business, {{instead of going to}} war.

25|$|Now {{approaching}} {{forty years}} old, Brain's form began to tail off, {{although he was}} still good enough to take a total of 106 first-class and 46 List A wickets {{in the next two}} seasons, with 6–68 against Glamorgan in May 1980 a highlight of his later years. He took his last first-class wicket (John Barclay) against Sussex in July 1981, although he did play two further Championship games without reward. His final List A game was for Minor Counties against Leicestershire in the 1982 Benson and Hedges Cup; <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wickets of ex-Test cricketers Chris Balderstone and Roger Tolchard.|$|E
25|$|The earth {{inductor}} compass failed {{soon after}} takeoff and after {{an attempt to}} fix it, Hegenberger disregarded the instrument. At 7:45a.m. <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Crissy beacon as planned, but within an hour the receiver failed. Hegenberger seemingly repaired the radio by switching out the batteries, but the signal was lost again after another thirty minutes, forcing Hegenberger to navigate by dead reckoning using the magnetic compass and driftmeter. As part of his pre-flight planning, Hegenberger had computed azimuth and altitude for the sun, as well as selecting stars for sighting, for various points along the route. He used these figures for celestial observations to supplement his dead reckoning.|$|E

In total, Cooper scored eleven tries including three doubles during the regular season, he then tasted his first representative honour being selected to play for Country in the annual City and Country Origin.
