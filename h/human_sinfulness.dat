50|$|As Luther {{understood}} it, {{these two}} theologies had two radically different starting points: they had different epistemologies, or ways of understanding how {{people know about}} God and the world. For the theologian of glory, reason and personal perceptions should be employed to increase knowledge about God and the world. Thus, because an action appears to be good, it must be good. For the theologian of the cross, it is only from the self-revelation of God that people can learn about God and their relation to God—and the most perfect self-revelation of God is God's Word become flesh, Jesus the Christ. Thus, even if an action appears good, still Christ died on the cross for <b>human</b> sins and <b>sinfulness,</b> so the action {{is not as good}} as it appears.|$|R

In one discussion of religious life, one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, distinguishes two types within this stage, which have been called Religiousness A and Religiousness B. One type is symbolized by the Greek philosopher Socrates, whose passionate pursuit of the truth and individual conscience came into conflict with his society. Another type of religiousness is one characterized by {{the realization that the}} individual is sinful and is the source of untruth. [...] In time, through revelation and in direct relationship with the paradox that is Jesus, the individual begins to see that his or her eternal salvation rests on a paradox—God, the transcendent, coming into time in human form to redeem human beings. For Kierkegaard, the very notion of this occurring was scandalous to human reason—indeed, it must be, and if it is not then one does not truly understand the Incarnation nor the meaning of <b>human</b> <b>sinfulness.</b> For Kierkegaard, the impulse towards an awareness of a transcendent power in the universe is what religion is. Religion has a social and an individual (not just personal) dimension. But it begins with the individual and his or her awareness of sinfulness. Here are several quotes from Kierkegaard's where he discusses his concept of sin. The sin/faith opposition is the Christian one which transforms all ethical concepts in a Christian way and distils one more decoction from them. At the root of the opposition lies the crucial Christian specification: before God; and that in turn has the crucial Christian characteristic: the absurd, the paradox, the possibility of offense. And it is of the utmost importance that this is demonstrated in every specification of the Christian, since offense is the Christian protection against all speculative philosophy. In what, then, do we find the possibility of offense here? In the fact that a person should have the reality of his being, as a particular human being, directly before God, and accordingly, again, and by the same token, that man’s sin should be of concern of God. This notion of the single human being before God never occurs to speculative thought; it only universalizes particular human phantastically into the human race. It is exactly for this reason that a disbelieving Christianity {{came up with the idea}} that sin is sin, that it is neither here nor there whether it is before God. In other words, it wanted to get rid of the specification ‘before God’, and to that end invented a new wisdom, which nevertheless, curiously enough, was neither more nor less than what the higher wisdom generally is-old paganism.

40|$|The {{creation}} {{stories in}} Genesis, when read together, suggest {{that humans are}} marked by both dignity and finitude or frailty. This same dialectic appears paradigmatically in Psalm 8 and, it is argued, also {{in the rest of}} the Psalter. In spite of the major difference in perspective, the same anthropology is presupposed in Proverbs. In a section of Job and in Qoheleth, however, there are attempts to dissolve the dialectic. In the culmination of his argument, Job speaks of a form of human dignity that stands apart from human frailty; in Qoheleth human frailty eclipses human dignity. It is argued that the main line in the Old Testament maintains the dialectical tension and that Christian theologians should do likewise. Theologically one should indeed go further and speak of <b>human</b> queenship and <b>sinfulness.</b> The paper ends by suggesting than room should also be left for forms of human indignity that stand apart from finitude and sinfulness...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to analyze the motif, or {{collection}} of motifs, of divine accommodation as they appear in the thought of John Calvin. After introducing the subject and critically summarizing the relevant secondary literature, the course for the thesis is plotted. To determine the most basic elements of a reference to accommodation, these are set out in the form of three questions. 1. What is human capacity? 2. What is the character of the accommodating responses of God to that capacity? 3. What do Calvin's explanatory statements, which often accompany his remarks on accommodation, teach us about his accommodating God? Each of these is given individual attention. Chapter two examines human capacity, concluding with an attempt to reassess the three-fold division of it into <b>human</b> finitude, <b>sinfulness,</b> and Jewish barbarity which has arisen in scholarly discussion. Next, God's responses to that captus are considered. Here their scope and character are appraised by means of constructing a taxonomy of them, which is organized on the supposition that they appear in different spheres of the divine-human relationship, namely, the pedagogic, legislative, cultic, pastoral, incarnational, and covenantal spheres. In chapter four, Calvin's observations on the reasons, intentions, and motives behind God's selfadapting are explored towards the end of drawing the portrait of the reformer's accommodating God. The thesis finds that accommodation is so pervasive in Calvin that it appreciably penetrates his thinking about God. Accommodation touches on many different aspects of the divine-human relationship and is a frequent theme in the reformer's interpreting of God's behavior. In addition, Calvin's reflections on the Almighty's reasoning behind his accommodating actions are wide-ranging, and often depict God in surprising ways. All of this results in questions being raised about the character of Calvin's God, the coherence of Calvin's theology, and the relationship which exists between the reformer's dogmatic and exegetical works, which are addressed in the concluding chapter...|$|R

40|$|Peter Hollingworth’s {{downfall}} was clinched by his incapacity to act - {{and think}} - like a politician, argues APO’s associate editor, David Burchell THERE is a piquant paradox in the otherwise sad misfortunes of our now-departed governor-general. For many years, opinion polls have registered a {{slow but steady}} decline in the public standing {{of some of the}} most important professions in our country - most notably politicians. Until recently, one of the few traditional pillars of the community to be exempt from this trend was the clergy. When asked, Australians regularly complain that politicians are untrustworthy and have poor ethical standards. Yet Peter Hollingworth’s ascent to, and subsequent descent from, the governor-generalship has revealed some unusual facts about our moral standards. We are prepared to accept that our senior churchmen and women may make questionable ethical decisions and mis-speak on important social issues, it seems. But if they make the transition to being public officials we are much less forgiving. Perhaps, after all, our moral standards for political life are rather higher than those for ‘private’ professions - even ministry in the church. Of course, as republicans have gleefully pointed out, the governor-generalship is a decidedly unusual public position. And this may have something to do with the widespread controversy over Hollingworth’s behaviour in his former office as archbishop of Brisbane. After all, the only means of appointment to the position is by the vaguely defined ‘advice’ of the prime minister to our constitutionally vested head of state, the Queen. There is no position-statement, let alone a person-specification. There are no well-defined standards of conduct; indeed, some of the precedents in this respect are rather unfortunate. Nor is there any clear specification of the position and its powers in the Constitution. In all of these respects Hollingworth may be a victim not so much of sexual abuse lobby groups (as he seems to believe), but of the indirect political style of the Prime Minister. John Howard seems to have decided to turn the position from vice-regal appointment into fully-fledged head of state, without in any way attempting to define its role, responsibilities or standards of conduct. So it is only natural that the public should apply the same ethical standards which we would normally apply to our elected public officials - which is to say, our politicians. And by those standards the governor-general has, in many people’s minds, been found wanting. Equally disconcerting for many Australians has been the apparent difficulty Hollingworth has had in recognising his errors, in acknowledging them and (most strikingly of all) in apologising adequately for them. Any politician worth their salt always has one eye fastened on the formal requirements of their position, and the other on the prevailing moral standards by which the public will judge them. In Hollingworth’s case one of these eyes must have seemed decidedly misty. But the other seems to have been closed altogether. Why is this? Perhaps other clergy-people are best qualified to explain. At the time Hollingworth’s serious errors of judgment first came to light Bruce Stevens, a clinical psychologist and Anglican priest, offered some telling insider’s thoughts on ABC radio. Asked why it was that the churches so often seem to respond inadequately to scandals involving the behaviour of individual clergy, Stevens responded that they had no training in or understanding of professional ethics in the ordinary sense of that term. Rather, their ingrained instinct is to respond to claims of abuse from within a framework of ‘grace and forgiveness’. In other words, many church people are trained to think of professional misdemeanours as just particular instances of the wider cosmic tug-of-war between sin and redemption, failing and forgiveness, grace and faith. It is easy in such circumstances to think of all examples of misbehaviour as manifestations of basic <b>human</b> incapacity or <b>sinfulness</b> (and our striving to overcome this condition), rather than as specific failures to discharge specific appointed responsibilities. There is indeed a long Christian tradition behind this way of thinking. Throughout the Middle Ages and beyond, theologians in the West were consistently hostile to any attempt to define an ethics specific to profession, vocation or status in life. Even today many theologically informed versions of professional ethics represent the field as simply a subcategory of universal moral principles, as if specific ethical codes cannot be really ethical in their own right. And yet the churches may not be alone in this regard. One of the reasons for our pervasive disdain for politicians may well be the perception that while they may act appropriately according to the requirements of their positions, their behaviour is still distasteful according to other (higher) moral standards. A politician may succeed in getting a policy reform through by means of a perfectly legal mixture of flattery, cajolery and exchanges of favours. And yet we are bound to see their behaviour as irretrievably grubby and distasteful. Even the hoops through which aspiring politicians must jump in order to secure preselection (let alone election) necessarily appear morally dubious and undignified. All that tacky sweet-talking! All those false smiles! Hence the piquant paradox. We have measured the governor-general by the standards routinely applied to our elected public officials and found him wanting. Yet so often we judge our elected politicians by standards devised by the church, and find them wanting, too.
