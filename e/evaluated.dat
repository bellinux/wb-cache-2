However, in order to guarantee their genetic qualities, the bulls are subject to a strict selection scheme to increase the accuracy of the different genetic indexes. The best bulls identified at Lanaud are sent to another test station at Naves in Corrèze. Here they are tested more accurately and <b>evaluated</b> for feed conversion efficiency, growth and muscle development. Progeny of the top 10 bulls out of this testing, and the best natural service bulls, are then <b>evaluated.</b> Cows are inseminated to produce 60 to 80 calves per bull tested, which are in turn <b>evaluated.</b>|$|E
