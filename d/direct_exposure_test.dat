Fiven microbial strains (S. aureus, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis and C. albicans) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were inoculated in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) and incubated at 37 ºC for 24 h. For the <b>direct</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>test</b> (DET), 72 paper points were contaminated with the standard microbial suspensions and exposed to the root canal filling pastes for 1, 24, 48 and 72 h.

An inoculum of 0. 1 mL obtained from LB was then transferred to 7 mL of BHI, under identical incubations conditions and the microbial growth was evaluated.

Methodology Tetraclean, MTAD and five experimental solutions that were modifications of existing formulae including MTAD + 0. 01 % cetrimide (CTR), MTAD + 0. 1 % CTR, MTAC- 1 (Tween 80 replaced by 0. 01 % CTR in MTAD), MTAC- 2 (Tween 80 replaced by 0. 1 % CTR) and MTAD-D (MTAD without the Tween 80 and no CTR added) {{were used as}} disinfectants in the experiments. In the <b>direct</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>test,</b> a suspension of Enterococcus faecalis was mixed {{with each of the}} solutions. After 0. 5, 1, 3 and 10 min, an inactivator was added and the number of surviving bacteria was calculated. A mixed-species biofilm from subgingival plaque bacteria was grown in brain heart infusion broth in anaerobic conditions on synthetic hydroxyapatite discs. Two-week-old biofilms were exposed to the solutions for 0. 5, 1 and 3 min. The samples were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy after bacterial viability staining. The scans were quantitatively analysed, and the volume of killed cells of all cells was calculated for each medicament. Results Tetraclean and MTAC- 2 (0. 1 % CTR) killed planktonic E. faecalis in < 30 s. Complete killing of bacteria required 1 min by MTAC- 1, 3 min by MTAD + 0. 1 % CTR and 10 min by MTAD, MTAD-D and MTAD + 0. 01 % CTR. In the biofilm test, there were significant differences in microbial killing between the different solutions and times of exposure (P < 0. 005). MTAC- 2 showed the best performance, killing 71 % of the biofilm bacteria in 3 min, followed by MTAC- 1 and Tetraclean. MTAD and the three MTAD modifications demonstrated the lowest antibacterial activity. Conclusion Tetraclean was more effective than MTAD against E. faecalis in planktonic culture and in mixed-species in vitro biofilm. CTR improved the antimicrobial properties of the solutions, whereas Tween 80 seemed to have a neutral or negative impact on their antimicrobial effectiveness.

All samples were aseptically transferred into BHI culture medium to quantify microbial concentration in periods of 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Turbidity of the culture medium was measured via optical density (OPD) method with a spectrophotometer (wavelength= 540 nm). Results were then analysed statistically using student t-test. RESULTS: Mean difference of optical density between Bioglass 45 S 5 and calcium hydroxide appeared insignificant within 1 hour of the test period (P> 0. 05); however calcium hydroxide showed significantly greater antimicrobial properties after 24 hours (P< 0. 05). Antimicrobial effect of both materials displayed significant increases with time.

Such toxicity data may be obtained by assays allowing for <b>direct</b> <b>exposure</b> of introduced <b>test</b> microorganisms to the toxicants, as they appear in solid solution equilibria in the natural soil. We describe a novel sensitive solid-phase contact assay for in situ toxicity testing of soil pollutants based on a recombinant bioluminescent reporter strain of Nitrosomonas europaea. A slurry of the reporter strain and soil sample was shaken for 1 h, after which bioluminescence was measured either directly (soil slurry protocol) or in the supernatant obtained after centrifugation (soil extract protocol). The assay was validated for both protocols by using linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) as a toxic and adsorptive model compound in the soil samples. Interestingly, LAS showed the same toxicity to the reporter strain with either soil incubation (both protocols) or pure culture, suggesting that adsorbed LAS pools contributed to the observed toxicity. The solid-phase contact assay that used the reporter strain of lux-marked N. europaea was slightly more sensitive for the detection of LAS toxicity in soil than activity-based assays targeting indigenous nitrifiers and much more sensitive than assays targeting indigenous heterotrophic microbes. We conclude that the new solid-phase contact assay, which is based on direct interaction of the test microorganisms with bioavailable pools of the toxicants in soil, provides a most sensitive and relevant method for evaluating the in situ toxicity and assessing the risks of soil contaminants...|$|R
