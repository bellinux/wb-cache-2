5000|$|The Old English {{word for}} bread was hlaf (hlaifs in Gothic: modern <b>English</b> <b>loaf),</b> {{which appears to}} be the oldest Teutonic name. Old High German hleib and modern German Laib derive from this Proto-Germanic word, which was {{borrowed}} into Slavic (Polish chleb, Russian khleb) and Finnic (Finnish leipä, Estonian leib) languages as well.The Middle and Modern English word bread appears in Germanic languages, such as Frisian brea, Dutch brood, German Brot, Swedish bröd, and Norwegian and Danish brød; it may be related to brew or perhaps to break, originally meaning [...] "broken piece", [...] "morsel".|$|E

5000|$|Traditional Eastern Finnish {{rye bread}} is called [...] "limppu". The closest {{translation}} to <b>English</b> would be <b>loaf,</b> {{but that does}} not actually describe the round, bulbous bread that is actually known as limppu, and could cause confusion as rectangular loaves are also available and are not called limppu. This bread is dark, sour in taste, dense, heavy and comparatively dryish. Its mouthfeel still remains soft enough to be bitten off easily, and leavening is easily discernible even by eye. This kind of bread was usually produced at steady intervals throughout the year, whereas Western Finnish tradition stressed rare baking sessions combined with long-term storage.|$|R
