I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that." [...] However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

One Soviet trade unionist put the matter to us in this way. [...] "We are not afraid of war. We have been through it and survived its cruelties and horrors. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> take it. Just because we have been through it and suffered from it, we know how terrible war is. It wastes materials, but worse than that, it squanders human idealism, energy, wealth and life. Still worse, those of us who are trying to build a socialist society are diverted and preoccupied by war. We know from bitter experience that if we are to engage in socialist construction we cannot fight wars. War is a full-time occupation." ...|$|E

[...] Palin also said that she hoped [...] "to reach out and work with those who are {{on the other side of}} this issue, because I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all agree on the need for and the desire for fewer abortions in America and greater support for adoption, for other alternatives that women can and should be empowered to embrace, to allow that culture of life." [...] Gibson noted that Republican presidential nominee John McCain allows exceptions for rape or incest, and asked, [...] "Do you believe in it only in the case where the life of the mother is in danger?" [...] Palin answered, [...] "That is my personal opinion." [...] When pressed on the matter, she said, [...] "My personal opinion is that abortion allowed if the life of the mother is endangered.

For a diffeomorphism f of a 3 -manifold M that realizes a Smale solenoid, it is natural to ask whether f− 1 also realizes a Smale solenoid.
