5|$|Birds {{have been}} seen as symbols, and used as such, though {{perceptions}} of bird species vary widely across cultures: some birds have a positive <b>image</b> <b>in</b> some regions, a negative <b>image</b> <b>in</b> others. Owls are associated with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa, but are regarded as wise across much of Europe. Hoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia, but were thought of as thieves across much of Europe, and harbingers of war in Scandinavia.|$|E

5|$|The {{image of}} the Aeolian harp was a popular <b>image</b> <b>in</b> turn of the 19th-century {{literature}} and collections were built around poems dedicated to the harps. Coleridge's possible poetic influences include James Thomson's Ode on Aeolus's Harp, The Castle of Indolence, and Spring.|$|E

It has been reprinted several times. In it she {{analyses}} the different types of images and motifs that he uses in his plays. She also shows that there is a [...] "cluster", or there are several [...] "clusters", of <b>images</b> <b>in</b> each of the major plays, for instance, illness and injury <b>images</b> <b>in</b> [...] "Hamlet", and light and darkness <b>images</b> <b>in</b> [...] "Romeo and Juliet".|$|R

Although other items associated with Tipu, including his sword, {{have recently been}} purchased and brought back to India by billionaire Vijay Mallya, Tipu's Tiger has not itself {{been the subject of}} an official repatriation request, presumably due to the ambiguity underlying Tipu's <b>image</b> <b>in</b> the eyes of Indians; his being an object of loathing in the eyes of some Indians while considered a hero by others.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1960, Dutton {{was named}} {{president}} of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede on a two-year term. He had been a Stampede director for ten-years previous to his appointment. As head of the exhibition, he also spoke for the Stampeders hockey team of the Western Hockey League, and was its chief negotiator. Through his work and community spirit, Dutton {{played a major role}} in helping Calgary and the surrounding area shed its rural <b>image</b> <b>in</b> the 25 years following World War II.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{tradition}} {{refers to}} only five likenesses of the Buddha, made during his lifetime; two were in India, two in paradise, {{and the fifth}} is the Mahamuni Buddha <b>image</b> <b>in</b> Myanmar. According to the legend, the Buddha visited the Dhanyawadi city of Arakan in 554 BC. King Sanda Thuriya requested that an image was cast of him. After casting the Great Image, the Buddha breathed upon it, and thereafter the image became the exact likeness of the Mahamuni.|$|E
30|$|The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for aorta, {{portal vein}} and liver {{parenchyma}} {{in comparison with}} that for muscle was calculated with the equation: CNR[*]=[*](ROIo – ROIm)/SDn, where ROIo was the attenuation of a given organ, ROIm was the attenuation of the paraspinal muscle, and SDn was the average standard deviation of subcutaneous fat tissue (or the <b>image</b> noise). <b>In</b> addition, increases in the mean CNRs for 50 -keV VM <b>images</b> <b>in</b> Group A, 65 -keV VM <b>images</b> <b>in</b> Group B, and 50 -keV VM <b>images</b> <b>in</b> Group B over those for the 65 -keV VM <b>images</b> <b>in</b> Group A were calculated and defined as ratios of increase in CNR for each phase.|$|R

5|$|During {{the filming}} and {{promotion}} of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo {{went to great lengths}} to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview. During this interview they noted that the use of cloth bags in particular had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their perceived <b>image</b> <b>in</b> the media.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Burmese monarchs, offerings were made daily to the Great <b>Image</b> <b>in</b> a formal way.

In conjunction with rapid freezing techniques, electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport, for instance in demonstrating that exocytotic vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses.|$|E
5|$|Images of Norman {{have been}} used to attract {{attention}} by some outside of the Unarius Academy of Science. In 1996, an MTV executive viewed a picture of Norman and decided to use her <b>image</b> <b>in</b> an advertising campaign for the MTV Music Video Awards. The network contacted the Unarius Academy of Science and received permission to use a look-alike in their promotions. In 2000, Norman was featured on the cover of , a book about personalities with fringe beliefs.|$|E
5|$|In April 2000 Nicolai Bo Larsen {{was tested}} with a 51 {{hematocrit}} level, but wasn't fired, {{as he had}} been tested with a 47 level the day before. The morning after his result of 51, he again tested 47%. However, the apparent double standards harmed its <b>image</b> <b>in</b> Denmark and Jack & Jones did not prolong sponsorship, despite Bo Larsen's later being acquitted of doping by a medical report.|$|E

5|$|Star Wars creator George Lucas {{personally}} directed Shaw for {{his appearance}} in the final scene of the film, {{in which he is}} a Force Ghost of Anakin. Shaw's <b>image</b> <b>in</b> this scene was replaced with that of Christensen in the 2004 release. This last attempt to tie the prequel and original trilogies together proved to be possibly the most controversial change in the Star Wars re-releases.|$|E
5|$|Szabó {{emphasizes}} iconography in his films, {{insofar as}} {{he tends to}} invest certain objects and places with symbolic meaning.

40|$|The {{sites of}} airway {{obstruction}} and dilatation after terbutaline administration were studied by inhalation imaging and {{pulmonary function tests}} in 12 stable asthmatic patients. Inhaled terbutaline as a therapeutic aerosol decreased airway resistance (Raw) and improved radioaerosol (Ae) <b>images</b> <b>in</b> nine, delta V max 50 in three, and xenon (Xe) <b>images</b> <b>in</b> five of 12 subjects, suggesting that its predominant site of action was on major airways. Subcutaneously injected terbutaline improved Raw, delta V max 50, and Ae <b>images</b> <b>in</b> 11 and Xe <b>images</b> <b>in</b> eight subjects indicating that it released bronchospasm in the major and minor airways.

5|$|The Mahamnuni {{image and}} its precincts {{suffered}} damage from fires in 1879 and 1884. In {{the fire that}} broke out {{during the reign of}} King Thibaw, the seven-tiered spire on the brick temple, devotional halls, causeways and others were burnt down, although the Great Image itself was saved. Gold recovered after the fire was made into a robe that currently adorns the <b>image.</b> <b>In</b> 1887, Minister Kinwun Mingyi U Kaung took charge of the site and in 1896 constructed the present temple around the original shrine built by King Bodawpaya.|$|E
5|$|The Wicklow Way is waymarked in both {{directions}} and can be started at Marlay Park or Clonegal. The trail is marked with square black posts with an <b>image,</b> <b>in</b> yellow, of a walking man and a directional arrow.

Brown fingerposts are used on sections that follow roads. The Way is typically completed in five to seven days.|$|E
5|$|The {{field is}} so small {{that only a few}} {{foreground}} stars in the Milky Way lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are galaxies, some of which are among the youngest and most distant known.
