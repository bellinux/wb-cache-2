5|$|The {{history of}} American {{football}} {{can be traced}} to early versions of rugby football and association football. Both games have their origin in varieties of football played in Britain in the mid-19th century, in which a football is <b>kicked</b> <b>at</b> a goal or kicked over a line, which in turn were based on the varieties of English public school football games.|$|E
5|$|A PAT is most {{commonly}} attempted from the two- or three-yard line, {{depending on the}} level of play. If scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, and is typically called the extra point. Conversely, a team may elect to run a single play from scrimmage and attempt, once again, to achieve what would normally be considered a touchdown. In such a case, a successful attempt is called the two-point conversion and is worth two points. For the 2015 season, the NFL adopted a rules on PATs that stated during an extra point the placekick must be <b>kicked</b> <b>at</b> the 15-yard line and on extra points if the kick is blocked and the opposing team returns it into the end zone or if during a two-point conversion the ball is fumbled or intercepted and returned to the end zone the opposing team will score two points. No points are awarded on a failed extra point or two-point conversion attempt. In general, the extra point is almost always successful in professional play and is only slightly less successful at amateur levels, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.|$|E
5|$|United {{responded with}} their first {{extended}} period of possession of the half, working the ball into wide areas to be crossed into the middle, but Rooney's first couple of attempted centres were well cleared by Piqué. At the third attempt, though, Rooney's cross evaded the Barcelona defence as Touré <b>kicked</b> <b>at</b> thin air; however, it also failed to find a Manchester United player in the penalty area, both Ronaldo and Park going close. After Ronaldo was called offside in the 59thminute – despite appearing to be level with the last defender – Giggs stole the ball mid-way inside the Barcelona half before playing the ball to Ronaldo on the left wing. The Portuguese forward stepped over the ball several times {{in an attempt to}} wrong-foot Puyol, before cutting inside and playing the ball across the edge of the area towards Carrick. A sliding challenge from Busquets prevented a shot, only for the English midfielder to slide the ball out for a Barcelona goal kick while attempting to play Rooney through. Rooney was again played down the right wing a few moments later, but his low cross was diverted behind by Piqué, and the resulting corner came to nothing. A left-wing attack from Ronaldo followed, but after cutting inside, he gave the ball away cheaply. Barcelona immediately went on the attack down the other end, but Henry was unable to get past O'Shea and his shot was well saved by Van der Sar low at the near post.|$|E

50|$|Although {{statistics}} on the success rate of <b>kicks</b> <b>at</b> goal were not kept until the late 1980s, {{it is believed that}} Steyn also holds the record for most consecutive successful <b>kicks</b> <b>at</b> goal in Tests. He had a streak of 41 successful <b>kicks</b> <b>at</b> goal, which started during the Boks' Test against Italy on 19 June 2010 and ended on 6 November 2010 against Ireland.|$|R

25|$|He played {{mostly as}} a half forward flanker {{and was one}} of the first players to use the 'banana kick' as well as the 'checkside' punt. This goal sense saw him top Essendon's goalkicking in 1909 with 40 majors. Such was his {{consistency}} up forward that he kicked a goal in each of his 17 games in the 1911 season but finished the year with just 25 goals. He was a member of Essendon premiership sides in 1911 and 1912. A Victorian interstate representative, Shea coached Essendon Association in the VFA for a period after retiring from the VFL. He holds the record for most VFL goals <b>kicked</b> <b>at</b> the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, with 85.|$|E

2500|$|Schultz is the full-forward in Norwood's {{official}} [...] "Team of the Century" [...] {{and holds}} the club record for most goals <b>kicked,</b> <b>at</b> 669. His best match tally of 19 goals, which included two posters, was achieved in his penultimate game. He scored 10 or more goals in a game on 12 occasions and averaged 5.4 goals a game, which for comparison is more than prolific VFL/AFL forwards Gary Ablett, Jason Dunstall and Tony Lockett managed in their careers. On the six occasions he represented the South Australian interstate team, he kicked 23 goals.|$|E

One was near the {{entrance}} to police station No. 2 and the regional anti-terrorist center, where most of the windows had been blown out and even tramway lines outside had been brought down. [...] Seven more bodies were sprawled across the street, most with horrific head wounds. Heavily armed police poked and <b>kicked</b> <b>at</b> the bodies, presumably those of militants, all clad in tracksuits and running shoes. [...] Outside the local Federal Security Service building, several heavily armed officers picked gingerly through a black backpack that had apparently belonged to a militant, pulling out a candy bar, a bottle of water and a black T-shirt." ...|$|E
2500|$|If a team {{is awarded}} a penalty {{they can choose}} {{to take a shot}} at goal, kick the ball or tap the ball with their foot and run it. A {{successful}} shot at goal scores three points. The opposing team must stand still with their hands beside their sides until after the ball has been <b>kicked</b> <b>at</b> the goal. If the ball is kicked into touch the team that kicked it gets the throw in at the resulting line-out and it is always taken where the ball crosses the line. Free kicks are similar, except a shot at goal can not be taken and if the ball is kicked into touch the kicking team does not receive the throw at the ensuing line-out. There is also no gain in ground from the free kick if kicked directly into touch, unless it was taken from behind the kicking team's 22-metre line. Opposition players can also try and charge down free kicks as soon as the kicker makes a move to kick. The captain can always choose to take a scrum from a penalty or free kick. A player can claim a mark by catching the ball directly from a kick (except a kick-off) inside their own 22 and shouting [...] "mark" [...] at the same time. The player that claimed the mark cannot be tackled and is awarded a free kick.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{receiving}} game, the ultra-competitive Jared Abbrederis, a senior draft prospect, {{had more than}} twice as many receptions as the second-leading receiver on the team; Abbrederis earned first team all-conference accolades, and totaled 73 receptions for 1051 yards and 7 touchdowns. Senior tight end Jacob Pedersen was the team's second-leading receiver with 36 receptions, 501 yards, and 3 touchdowns. White caught 37 passes for 292 yards. A trio of other wide receivers – senior Jeff Duckworth, sophomore Jordan Frederick, and freshman Alex Erickson – also contributed, with each catching between 8 and 10 passes and between 100 and 200 yards. Wisconsin's offensive line was plagued by injuries all season long. Entering the bowl game, center Dallas Lewallen engaged in limited practice participation, and his status was [...] "a major question mark"; if he could not play, Dan Voltz would start at center. Starting guard Kyle Costigan was also banged up entering the game. Other starters on the offensive line included sophomore Tyler Marz, who achieved honorable mention all-conference honors, [...] junior right tackle Rob Havenstein, who achieved second team all-conference honors, and first-team all-conference left guard Ryan Groy, a senior. Two kickers contributed during the season – sophomore Jack Russell, who made 8 of 11 field goal attempts with a long of 48 yards, and junior Kyle French, who made 5 of his 8 field goal attempts with a long of 42 yards ... French <b>kicked</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of the season, but midway through, Russell replaced him.|$|E
