40|$|<b>Diabetes</b> {{mellitus}} <b>is</b> {{a disease}} {{in which a}} person's blood sugar level is high either because the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or the insulin that is produced is not effectively used up by {{the cells of the}} body. As a result of these, blood glucose level rises up which spills into the blood. Insulin is a hormone which is needed by the body to convert sugar and other starch into useful energy. Type 1 <b>diabetes</b> <b>is</b> when the body fails to produce adequate amount of insulin. Type 2 <b>diabetes</b> <b>is</b> when the body cannot properly make use of the insulin that <b>is</b> produced. Gestational <b>diabetes</b> occurs in pregnant women. Other forms of <b>diabetes</b> may <b>be</b> congenital or due to use of steroids and glucocorticoids or caused by cystic fibrosis. <b>Diabetes</b> <b>is</b> the world’s fastest growing chronic disease with about 285 million patients.

40|$|Background— Diabetes {{and heart}} failure {{frequently}} coexist. Our {{aim was to}} assess the association between diabetes and short- and long-term outcomes in all patients admitted to the hospital {{for the first time with}} heart failure in Scotland between 1986 and 2003. Methods and Results— A total of 116 556 patients were studied, of whom 13 % (n= 15 161) had a diagnosis of diabetes. At 30 days, <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> associated with a lower case fatality. By 1 year, the association between diabetes and better outcome <b>was</b> reversed, and <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> a significant independent predictor of higher case fatality. The longer term risk of death associated with <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> greatest in younger patients. In patients aged 65 years or younger, the hazard ratio for mortality at 5 years associated with <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> 1. 41 (95 % CI, 1. 31 to 1. 52) for men and 1. 64 (1. 50 to 1. 79) for women. The risk associated with <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> less in patients aged 75 years or older: a hazard ratio in men 1. 16 (1. 10 to 1. 22) and in women 1. 15 (1. 10 to 1. 20). In the younger age group the risk associated with <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> significantly greater in women than in men (P= 0. 005 for diabetes-sex interaction). <b>Diabetes</b> <b>was</b> also a significant independent predictor of heart failure readmission, and again the risk was greatest in younger women. Conclusions— Although <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> associated with a lower case fatality at 30 days, by 1 year it was a significant independent predictor of higher case fatality. The risk associated with <b>diabetes</b> <b>was</b> greatest in young patients, and in young patients the risk was greatest in women...|$|R
