Eisenia fetida removed all the twelve different chlorophenols more than 95  % from the sludge which is declared as carcinogenic compounds by United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) in 90  days of incubation. Heavy metals concentration was decreased significantly during the incubation period whereas some metal concentration was also {{increased in the}} sludge due to mineralization.

In this work, sludge samples drawn from sludge treatment units have been digested and analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma- Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for metal evaluation. Samples were also extracted and analyzed by microcoulometric titrations, following modified DIN 38414 T 17 standard, for EOX analysis. Analytical results showed a slight enrichment {{of the contents of}} certain metals (Cd < 2 mg/kg, Cr < 51. 5 mg/kg, Cu < 105. 8 mg/ kg, Hg < 1. 4 mg/kg, Ni < 35. 9 mg/kg, Pb < 58. 7 mg/kg, Zn < 410. 1 mg/kg, Ba < 317. 1 mg/kg, Co < 1 mg/kg, Mo < 5 mg/kg, Mn < 106. 7 mg/kg), so almost all of the sludge would be suitable for agricultural use following Italian and European regulations. The evaluation of EOX was carried out by using hexane and ethyl acetate as extraction solvents, and a measurable organic halogen content (ranging from 0. 31 to 39. 5 mg Cl/kg DM) was clearly detected in the sludge. The lowest concentrations of EOX were found in sludge coming from the smallest MWWTPs, which is to be considered more suitable for agricultural use. Additionally, analytical assays on composts, peat and soils were performed to compare EOX concentrations between these matrices and sludge...|$|E

30|$|The {{discussion}} about the determination of indicative or key parameters is an old one; which criteria should be chosen, however, is questionable. Conceivable would be, for example, selection according to functional group, the concentration that occurs in the environment, or the toxicity of each substance (which, however, with only few exceptions has not been assessed). In the meantime national and international research groups, as well as DIN, {{are working on the}} development of methods for the determination of cumulative parameters, e.g. similar to the AOX (Adsorbed <b>Organic</b> <b>Halogen)</b> method. In this sense, the EOF method (<b>Extractable</b> <b>Organic</b> Fluorine) aims at the cumulative determination of PFC in solid samples such as soil or sediments. The AOF method (Adsorbed Organic Fluorine), on the other hand, is used to detect organic fluorine compounds as cumulative parameters in aqueous samples. At present, it would appear that both EOF and AOF offer the possibility of establishing a cumulative parameter “total organic fluorine”. The question remains, however, how to evaluate the measurements obtained by these methods. For the environmental sector 5 there are, with only one exception, 6 no permissible limits or reference values for individual PFC or for cumulative parameters.|$|R

40|$|Materials {{of steam}} water cycles can suffer from {{corrosion}} induced by halide anions in feedwater. <b>Organic</b> <b>halogen</b> compounds in feedwater can be degraded and release halide anions under high temperature and pressure. Therefore {{it is necessary}} to be able to measure the <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> concentration. Existing measurements including Adsorbable <b>Organic</b> <b>Halogens</b> and Gas Chromatography are either not convenient, affordable, accurate or reproducible enough at these very low concentrations, meaning a new method should be developed. In this research the option of destroying the organic compounds to release the halide anions and measure them with ion chromatography was studied. The question is, which {{is the best way to}} destroy the organic compounds and release the halides anions. Six <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> model compounds were tested: aliphatic and aromatic fluorine, chlorine and bromine containing compounds. Two main methods were studied: UV/vacuumUV (VUV) photolysis and wet chemical oxidation with K 2 S 2 O 8. There are three phases in the research: 1. Study different UV lamps and oxidants on the target compounds and find the optimal combinations. 2. Try different dosages of K 2 S 2 O 8 and find an optimum. 3. Test halide release of target compounds in power plant conditions. In the experiments, three kinds of lamps were applied: VUV, low pressure (LP) lamp and medium pressure (MP) lamp. H 2 O 2 and TiO 2 were used as a catalyst. Last but not least, wet chemical oxidation was tested, with varying dosages of K 2 S 2 O 8. The experiments were executed with both single compounds and mixed compounds. The results show that the organic fluorine is the hardest to degrade while organic bromine is the easiest. Aromatic compounds are easier to degrade than aliphatic compounds. This happens not only in AOP process, but also in power plant conditions. The recovery of bromide and chloride in most methods could reach 95 % while aliphatic fluorine could only reach at most 70 %. It can be concluded that MP/H 2 O 2 is the most effective method for degradation of <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> compounds since it requires less time for the reaction to be completed, but wet chemical oxidation also showed high recoveries for all halide anions.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{availability}} of soil phosphorus (P) to crops has been an important issue for years in different agroecosystems around the world. Because of the complex P cycling in soils this has been studied from different points of view. The study of soil P forms has been seen as a possible way to explain many processes and changes occurring in plant-soil interactions. The purpose of this research was to characterize soil P forms under different land uses and evaluate the relationship between different land use areas and the spatial distribution of soil P forms. The study was carried out in Costa Rica on a Typic Hapludand under coffee plantation (Coffea arabica), sugar cane plantation (Saccharum spp.), and secondary forest. A modified Hedley soil P fractionation methodology was used for determining the soil P forms. Means of the relative content of P forms were 0. 43 % labile-Pi, 6. 44 % NaOH-Pi, 9. 20 % HCl-Pi, 32. 55 % <b>extractable</b> <b>organic</b> P and 51. 37 % residual-P. Inorganic fertilization was correlated with labile-P, NaOH-Pi, and HCl-Pi forms. In the first experiment the sugar cane yields were correlated with labile-Pi and NaOH-Pi. Organic fertilizer increased the <b>extractable</b> <b>organic</b> P suggesting an accumulation in this form. In the second descriptive study a spatial relationship was found with soil management areas. Sugar cane soil accumulated more P in HCl-Pi, <b>extractable</b> <b>organic</b> P, and residual-Pi forms. Coffee soil had the highest values in labile-Pi and NaOH-Pi that were correlated with the higher rate of fertilizer application. Secondary forest had intermediate values between these two cropped areas. The third experiment showed that under greenhouse conditions P uptake was closely related to labile-Pi and NaOH-Pi suggesting also that a sparingly available P form could be related to P uptake by plants in time. <b>Extractable</b> <b>organic</b> P and residual-P were suggested to act as a sink of the available P forms.

Tracking how energy flows {{within and across}} ecosystems is imperative for understanding interactions among biogeochemical cycles. Aquatic ecosystem metabolism is inextricably linked to the terrestrial landscape, with many lakes getting over 50 % of their carbon from terrestrial sources. Nonetheless, there are few large scale measurements of actual carbon export from terrestrial ecosystems. Instead, scientists have relied on a mass balance approach to estimate the quantity of carbon coming into aquatic ecosystems based on estimates of riverine carbon delivery to the ocean. This approach has left many unanswered questions related to the controls on terrestrial organic matter export, {{both in terms of}} quantity and quality. Here I used Water <b>Extractable</b> <b>Organic</b> Carbon (WEOC) to estimate potential terrestrial carbon export and to understand the mechanisms controlling these exports. Results from extractions performed at 19 grassland sites across the United States suggested that 1 - 5 % of their total soil carbon was in the water <b>extractable</b> <b>organic</b> carbon pool. In addition, this work suggested that soils selectively retained nitrogen and phosphorus, with less organic nutrient export relative to organic carbon to aquatic ecosystems.

We measured C and N concentrations in soil light fraction, microbial biomass, <b>extractable</b> <b>organic</b> matter, heavy fraction, and total soil C and N. The results showed that total soil C and N, and heavy fraction C and N were not significantly affected by N addition after 9 years of treatments. In contrast, different N enrichment levels changed soil light fraction C and N, ranging from 4. 3 to 27. 7 % and 3. 3 - 30. 0 %, respectively. Moreover, both light fraction C and N had a nonlinear relationship with N addition rates, and the threshold for N-induced change in light fraction C and N was near 16 g N m(- 2) year(- 1) in this semiarid grassland. Increases of soil light fraction C and N primarily resulted from changes in biotic (N-stimulated aboveground biomass) and abiotic (soil temperature, moisture and pH) factors under N enrichment. Soil microbial biomass exponentially declined with increasing N, but <b>extractable</b> <b>organic</b> C showed a positive linear response to N enrichment rates. Changes in microbial biomass C and <b>extractable</b> <b>organic</b> C were primarily due to the reduced soil pH under N addition. Our findings suggest that various soil C fractions differentially respond to elevated N, because different sets of biotic and abiotic factors regulate those fractions under N enrichment...|$|R

40|$|A steel-slag/compost {{fertilizer}} can {{be useful}} in supplying complex Fe(II) species to barren coastal regions. Seawater <b>extractable</b> <b>organic</b> matter (SWEOM) was examined for use as a novel chelator of Fe(II) in the compost. The dissociation kinetics for Fe(II) -SWEOM were evaluated, based on the rate of ligand-exchange with ortho-phenanthroline. The ΔH‡ for the Fe(II) -SWEOM (19 kJ mol^[- 1]) was significantly smaller than the corresponding values for Fe(II) complexes with humic substances (27 kJ mol^[- 1]), suggesting that the Fe(II) -SWEOM is kinetically less stable...|$|R
