40|$|The cadmium {{concentrations}} {{depend on}} the environmental conditions and food production methods. The monitoring of cadmium concentration in meat is important for human health. The concentrations of cadmium in meat and meat products collected from central Slovakia, in the central Europe region and from different countries of West Europe were assessed using by AA spectrometer with graphite furnace (PerkinElmer AAnalyst 80, MA, USA). Within starting materials we detected the highest values of cadmium in beef from foreign production (0. 1101 ppm), followed by pork from foreign production (0. 0901 ppm) in Lovecka salama and pork thigh (0. 0523 ppm) in selected ham. In Lovecka salami we were found the highest concentration of cadmium in <b>final</b> <b>samples</b> from foreign starting materials, followed by homogenized samples from foreign starting materials, <b>final</b> <b>samples</b> from domestic starting materials and homogenized samples from domestic starting materials (0. 3728, 0. 3549, 0. 2387, 0. 2112 ppm, respectively). The highest concentration of cadmium in selected ham were found in final products from foreign starting materials, homogenized samples from foreign starting materials, final products from domestic starting materials and homogenized samples from domestic starting materials (0. 1453, 0. 1382, 0. 0810, 0. 0734 ppm, respectively). The obtained results suggested that the concentrations of cadmium are higher in homogenized samples and final products in Lovecka salami and selected ham in comparison with to starting materials.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} FAST, a novel two-phase sampling-based algorithm for discovering association {{rules in}} large databases. In Phase I a large initial sample of transactions is collected {{and used to}} quickly and accurately estimate the support of each individual item in the database. In Phase II these estimated supports are used to either trim "outlier" transactions or select "representative" transactions from the initial sample, thereby forming a small <b>final</b> <b>sample</b> that more accurately reflects the statistical characteristics (i. e., itemset supports) of the entire database. The expensive operation of discovering association rules is then performed on the <b>final</b> <b>sample.</b> In an empirical study, FAST was able to achieve 90 [...] 95 % accuracy using a <b>final</b> <b>sample</b> having a size of only 15 [...] 33 % of that of a comparable random sample. This efficiency gain resulted in a speedup by roughly a factor of 10 over previous algorithms that require expensive processing of the entire database [...] even efficient algorithms that exploit sampling.
