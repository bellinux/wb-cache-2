Produced by Pritish Nandy, publishing director of The Times of India, the film was made on a budget of Rs.25million (US$525,000), marking the sixth <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> small to medium budget films made by Pritish Nandy Communications (PNC). Despite {{being part of a}} wave of offbeat films that mostly failed to make an impact at the box office, it drew public attention upon its release, which led to a commercial success among a restricted audience targeted by a selective release in twenty cities. It {{was one of the first}} films made in Hinglish, a mixture of Hindi and English. In 2005, she starred in Shaadi No. 1, which had no female lead. This comedy, based on the theme of modern marriage, was directed by David Dhawan, a renowned film director from this genre.|$|E
5|$|Hristofor Žefarović, {{an artist}} from Macedonia, painted the frescos in the rebuilt {{church of the}} Serbian Monastery of Bođani, in the Bačka region (then part of the Kingdom of Hungary) in 1737. There, he {{depicted}} Jovan Vladimir <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> six Serb saints, wearing a crown and sceptre, clad in a full-length tunic, loros (a type of stole), and chlamys. In the same row stands another Serb saint from present-day Montenegro, Stefan Štiljanović. Žefarović's frescos in Bođani are regarded as the earliest work showing Baroque traits in the Serbian art. Žefarović created in 1742 in Vienna a copperplate with scenes of the saint's life and miracles. Its printed impressions were disseminated to many Orthodox Christian homes in the Balkans. The same author included him among the rulers and saints whom he illustrated in his Stemmatographia.|$|E
5|$|Juventus re-capitalized on 28 June 2007, {{increasing}} €104,807,731.60 of share capital. The {{team made}} an aggregate net {{loss in the}} following seasons (2006 to date): –€927,569 (2006–07), –€20,787,469 (2007–08), net income €6,582,489 (2008–09) and net loss €10,967,944 (2009–10). After an unaudited €43,411,481 net loss was recorded {{in the first nine}} months of 2010–11 season, the board of directors announced that a capital increase of €120million was planned, scheduled to submit to the extraordinary shareholder's meeting in October. Eventually, the 2010–11 season net loss was €95,414,019. In the 2012–13 season, Juventus continued to recover from recent seasons' net losses thanks to the biggest payment in UEFA's Champions League 2012–13 revenue distribution, earning €65.3million. Despite being knocked out in the quarterfinal stage, Juventus took the lion's share thanks to the largesse of the Italian national TV market and the division of revenues with the only other Italian team making the competition's final phase, Milan. Confirming the trend of marked improvement in net result, the 2013–14 financial year closed with a loss of €6.7 million, but with the first positive operating income since 2006. In the 2014–15 season, by the excellent sports results achieved (the fourth year <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> Serie A titles, the tenth Coppa Italia title and playing the Champions League final), net income reached €2.3million. Compared to the loss of €6.7million last year, 2014–15 showed a positive change of €9million and returned to a profit after six years since 2008–09.|$|E

500|$|Neoromicia malagasyensis {{is known}} {{only from the}} {{vicinity}} of Isalo National Park, an area of about 2000km2 (800sq mi), in interior southwestern Madagascar.

Peterson and colleagues reported {{that it had been}} collected near the village of Marinday, but Goodman and Ranivo suggested that it may instead have come from near Ilakaka. Two specimens, a male and a female, were collected at different localities in Isalo National Park in early December 2002, both in mistnets near rivers. The male had enlarged testes and the female had recently stopped lactating and had large mammae. Two others followed in 2003, also from the national park, and caught in woodland near rivers. A 2009 study on echolocation described the call of six individuals of N.malagasyensis from an unspecified site within the national park. In view of its small known range and the threat of habitat destruction, the IUCN Red List assesses the species as [...] "Endangered"; further research is recommended on its roosting and dietary habits.|$|E

500|$|The pelvic fins are {{distinct}} from the disc and have rounded outer margins. The short and thick tail bears skin folds along either side and two dorsal fins on top. The first dorsal fin is slightly larger than the second. The well-developed caudal fin is triangular with blunt corners, and is approximately {{as long as the}} space between it and first dorsal fin. The skin is smooth and soft, entirely lacking dermal denticles. The dorsal coloration of the common torpedo is light to dark brown, with distinctive large spots ("ocellae") on the disc; each ocellus is blue and encircled by darker and lighter rings. Typically there are five ocellae arranged symmetrically <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> three and another of two; rays with 0–4 ocellae are less common, and those with more than five are rarer still. An unusual male with eight ocellae was caught off Tunisia, and another with nine off southern France. When present, the sixth ocellus is similarly sized to the first five and positioned at their center; any additional ocellae tend to be smaller than the first six and placed asymmetrically towards the snout. The underside is cream-colored, with dark disc margins. An adult albino female was captured off Tunisia. Males and females typically measure [...] long respectively; the largest individual on record was [...] long. Rays from off West Africa grow larger than those from the Mediterranean.|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, Eminent Hipsters, Fagen {{notes that}} the cover figure [...] "wasn't {{supposed}} to be a stand-in for any particular jazz DJ," [...] but noted a few personalities from the period that factored into the creation: Ed Beach, Dan Morgenstern, Martin Williams, R.D.

[...] "He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you'd had." [...] At the time of the album's release, he remembered that jazz music offered him an escape from the adults in his life: [...] "When I saw E.T.,' I realized that the E.T. in my bedroom was my Thelonious Monk records. Everything that he represented was totally unworldly in a way, although at the same time jazz to me seemed more real than the environment in which I was living." [...] The Wall Street Journal Robert J. Toth writes, [...] "The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we see Mr. Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> tract homes — or maybe the artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration." [...] Robert Palmer, of The New York Times, continued in this line of thinking: [...] "Inside, there's a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He's playing it softly, so his parents won't wake up, and he can barely make out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen." ...|$|E
500|$|The Buccaneers {{surprised}} the NFL by reeling off wins {{in their first}} five games, an accomplishment that left them as the season's last undefeated team and landed them {{on the cover of}} Sports Illustrated. It also put them in first place for good in the NFC Central. The team's youth became an issue later on, as they went into a late-season losing streak on the verge of earning their first playoff spot. It was felt that more veteran leadership would have helped the team during the stretch run. Linebacker Dave Lewis publicly stated that the team was [...] "choking", while Selmon compared the difficulty of getting the playoff-clinching win to the difficulty of getting the expansion team's first win. After dropping three games <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row,</b> <b>of</b> which winning any of the three would have clinched the division, McKay launched into an obscenity-laced tirade against reporters who called the team a [...] "laughingstock" [...] and [...] "Chokeneers". Even against a schedule that featured only two opponents with winning records it took until the final game of the season for the Buccaneers to win their tenth game. A better conference record gave the Buccaneers the division win over the also-10-6 Chicago Bears. Of all NFC Central teams other than the Vikings, the Buccaneers became only the second to win the division since 1970, and the only one to advance in the playoffs. The Buccaneers were {{considered by many to be}} an unworthy division champion, even called [...] "cheesecake champions" [...] by opponents, until they advanced to the [...] with a [...] over the Philadelphia Eagles.
