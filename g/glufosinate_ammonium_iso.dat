Pre- and postinoculation treatments of this herbicide reduced disease development. <b>Glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> specifically impeded appressorium {{formation of the}} pathogens Magnaporthe grisea and Cochliobolus miyabeanus on hydrophobic surface and on transgenic rice. In contrast, conidial germination remained unaffected. <b>Glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> diminished mycelial growth of two pathogens; however, this inhibitory effect was attenuated in malnutrition conditions. <b>Glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> caused slight chlorosis and diminished chlorophyll content; however, these alterations were almost completely restored in transgenic rice within 7 d. <b>Glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> triggered transcriptions of PATHOGENESIS-RELATED (PR) genes and hydrogen peroxide accumulation in transgenic rice and PR 1 transcription in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) wild-type ecotype Columbia harboring 35 S:bar construct. All transgenic Arabidopsis showed robust hydrogen peroxide accumulation by <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium.</b> This herbicide also induced PR 1 transcription in etr 1 and jar 1 expressing bar; however, no expression was observed in NahG and npr 1. Fungal infection did not alter transcriptions of PR genes and hydrogen peroxide accumulation induced by <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium.</b> Infiltration of <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> did not affect appressorium formation of M. grisea in vivo but inhibited blast disease development.

40|$|A simple {{analytical}} method {{was developed to}} measure concentrations of <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> and its metabolites, 3 -methylphosphinico-propionic acid (MPP) and 2 -methylphosphinico-acetic acid (MPA), in field soil samples. To determine the minimum quantification limit, samples were spiked at different levels (0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 [*]mg/kg). Soil samples were extracted with ammonium hydroxide solution 5 % (v/v), concentrated, and reacted with trimethyl orthoacetate (TMOA) {{in the presence of}} acetic acid for derivatization. The derivatives were quantified by gas chromatography (GC) using a flame photometric detector (FPD). The linear correlation coefficients of <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium,</b> MPP, and MPA in soil were 0. 991, 0. 999, and 0. 999, respectively. The recoveries of this method for <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium,</b> MPP, and MPA in soil were 77. 2 – 95. 5 %, 98. 3 – 100. 3 %, and 99. 3 – 99. 6 % with relative standard deviations (RSD) of 1. 8 – 4. 1 %, 0. 4 – 1. 4 %, and 1. 3 – 2. 0 %, respectively. <b>Glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> dissipated rapidly in soil to MPA in hours and gradually degraded to MPP. The half-life of <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> degradation in soil was 2. 30 – 2. 93 days in an open field.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{sensitivity}} of weed species to herbicides is variable, {{and the behavior}} can be repeated or not in the next generation. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the response of morningglory plants to different doses of <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> and the {{sensitivity of}} plant populations and their progenies to the herbicide. Three studies were conducted, all in a greenhouse and repeated in two periods. In the first study, two experiments were conducted to examine the dose-response curve, and the treatments were seven different doses of the herbicide <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> (0, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1, 600 g a. i. ha- 1), with four replications each. In the second study, which examined the range in sensitivity of morningglory to <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium,</b> 44 plants were sprayed with a dose of 200 g a. i. ha- 1 of the herbicide. Finally, in the third study, the range in sensitivity of morningglory progenies to <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> was investigated; in this experiment, the progenies of seven of the previous plants were sprayed with 200 g a. i. ha- 1 of herbicide. The ammonium contents in the tissues were measured, and percent injury were visually assessed. Ammonium content in morningglory leaves was increased more than seven times by glufosinate application and the maximum ammonium content was observed for the highest herbicide dose. Variability existed in the ammonium content among the individuals of the morningglory population; however, the behavior was not replicated in the same way in progenies. Plants survival after herbicide application allows the production of progenies with wide variability in their sensitivity to the product, regardless of the behavior verified in progenitor plants...|$|R

Several formulations of alternative herbicides applied singly or repeatedly during the growing season were evaluated and compared with conventional herbicides (glyphosate and <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium)</b> or with flaming or mulching. Citric-acetic acid formulations, clove oil, limonene, or pelargonic acid applied as foliar sprays immediately desiccated foliage, but the efficacy lasted for no longer than five weeks.

The {{aim of this study}} was the quantitative determination of all three pesticides, by High Performance Liquid Chromatography with evaporative light scattering and refractive index detection as well as Ion Chromatography with suppressed conductimetric detection. A novel method for the determination of Fosetyl-Al, Glyphosate and <b>Glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> in pesticide formulations was developed, using anion exchange chromatography with conductimetric detection. The chromatographic method was based on an AS 14 anion exchange column and a DX- 100 ion chromatographic system. Fosetyl-Al, Glyphosate and <b>Glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> are ionic compounds so they appear as ideal candidates for determination with ion chromatography and conductimetric detection. The objective of this study was the development of a fast, reliable and simple method for the analysis of the three pesticides. The optimized mobile phase for the elution of Fosetyl-Al, was 5 mM NaOH in an isocratic mode at a rate of 1. 2 mL/min with a retention time of 6 min. The regression line was linear (concentration range 5 - 50 μg/mL) with a correlation coefficient of 0. 999. Detection and quantitation limits were found to be 0. 61 μg/mL and 1. 9 μg/mL, respectively. The developed method was used for the separation of Fosetyl-Al from impurities (HPO 42 - and HPO 32 -) with Rs> 4, while their determination was achieved with a different mobile phase (NaOH, 10 mM). In this case the detection limit for HPO 42 - and HPO 32 - were 0. 28 and 0. 51 μg/mL, respectively. The content of HPO 42 - and HPO 32 - in raw material were found to be 5. 15 % and 0. 19 %, respectively. The above method was used to determine the amount of Fosetyl-Al in four commercial pesticide formulations. No sample pretreatment was needed other than dilution with mobile phase. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated by recovery experiments with spiking diluted sample solutions. The recoveries obtained (96. 4 % - 101. 7 %) reveal good accuracy and repeatability (RSD= 2. 25 %). Further study of the matrix (excipients) effect on the determination was carried out by dilution experiments (determination in commercial pesticide formulations using a varying dilution factor D (Vinitial/ Vfinal) at three different levels). The correlation curve of the concentration found (in the diluted solution) versus D were linear (r 2 = 0. 999) with a slope equal to the content of the formulation and a statistically zero intercept (proven by t-test). Similarly, the correlation curves for the content found versus D were linear as well with statistically zero slope. The results obtained reveal the absence of any constant or proportional determinate error from the excipients. The determination of Fosetyl-Al in soil and water samples was not achieved due to co-eluting peaks with the analyte and inability of isolation of Fosetyl-Al from the sample matrix. [...] . ...|$|R

[...] et al. Pesticide risk {{assessment}} on terrestrial vertebrates {{is based on}} oral exposure of birds and mammals, being such scenario considered to cover risks to reptiles. However, topic exposure during egg incubation, as well as dermal uptake and/or overspray of pesticides once hatchlings leave the nest could constitute relevant exposure ways for reptiles. We conducted a two-stage exposure of Podarcis muralis eggs and hatchlings to three pesticides in order to analyse the effects of pesticide exposure on each developmental stage and to compare {{the relative importance of}} dermal and oral exposure of juveniles through different exposure routes. Eggs were incubated in soils previously sprayed with a pesticide solution corresponding to 40 % of the field application rate (to consider relevant crop interception) of formulations of either <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> (herbicide), folpet (fungicide) or fenpyroximate (insecticide). Eggs exposed to folpet hatched with a lower body mass than controls, whereas fenpyroximate showed effects on morphological differentiation. Upon hacthing, animals were assigned to a juvenile treatment consisting in the exposure through spiked soil (dermal) or food (oral) in a factorial block design considering both in-ovo and hatchling exposure. Concentrations during the hacthling exposure corresponded to 25 % of the application rate. Interestingly, egg exposure but not hatching exposure determined the body mass gain during the post-hatch stage of lizards exposed to <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium,</b> which highlights the importance of considering lagged effects in pesticide {{risk assessment}}. Effects of pesticides on juveniles exposed either dermally or orally were very similar, which suggests the convenience of considering dermal exposure in risk assessment for reptiles as an additional route of pesticide uptake. Financed by the EU’s FP 7 (IEF- 2012 - 328328). Peer reviewe...|$|R

The objective of this work {{was to assess the}} production performance and germination seeds in response to differents stages and desiccation chemicals products to early harvest of soybean cultivars. The experiment was conducted in Campos Novos, in two harvests, it was used a randomized complete block design disposed in split-split-plots. Two phenological stages of application (stage R 7. 1 and R 7. 3) were tested in the main plot. Five soybean cultivars (NA 5909 RG, CD 2585 RR, BMX Turbo RR, SYN 1059 RR and BENSO 1 RR were evaluated in the subplots, and three desiccants <b>ammonium</b> <b>glufosinate,</b> paraquat, carfentrazone-ethyl in the 2011 / 12 season and one control (without the desiccant application) were evaluated in the sub-subplots. In the 2012 / 13 season the carfentrazone-ethyl was substituted by diquat. It were evaluated the number of the days in the early harvest, yield, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, mass of 100 seeds and germination percentage. The chemical dessecation with the use of <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> and paraquat applied in R 7. 1 stage allowed to anticipate the harvest in six days (2011 / 12) and provided maintenance germination percentage (90...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTSunflower (Helianthus annuus) sown offseason, after soybean crop (Glycine max), is {{affected}} by the competition imposed by volunteer plants. Two experiments were carried out to evaluate the control of volunteer soybean plants in sunflower crops. The sulfentrazone herbicide (75 g ha- 1, 100 g ha- 1 and 250 g ha- 1) causes phytotoxicity to sunflower immediately after application, however, plants recover, with no yield losses. These doses do not cause the total death of volunteer soybean plants, but temporarily paralyzes their growth, avoiding the competition with the sunflower crop. The <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> and ametryn herbicides are effective in controlling volunteer soybean plants, however, symptoms of phytotoxicity in the sunflower crop are high, reflecting in losses of dry weight biomass and crop yield. The other treatments do not provide satisfactory control of volunteer soybean plants and even reduce the sunflower dry weight biomass and yield...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the protein binding of <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> (GLF) and several factors affecting this binding using human serum albumin (HSA) and human volunteer serum under various conditions. The mean ratios {{of the free}} GLF (RFr-GLF) to 4 % HSA were examined in the sera of patients described elsewhere at GLF levels from 1 pg/mL to 500 pg/mL; the range {{was found to be}} only from 0. 80 to 0. 88. Neither the incubation temperature nor buffers containing different chloride ion concentrations had any effect on the RFr. GLF to HSA. Moreover, the addition of heparin, glycoprotein-u,l-acid (AAG), and sodium azide had no effect on the RFr-GLF. However, pH of the isotonic phosphate buffer and the addition of palmitic or oleic acid were seen to have an effect. In this study, the mean RFr-GLF to healthy human serum was 0. 99. This high value was evidenced that GLF was rapidly excreted through the renal route...|$|R
40|$|<b>Glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> (GLA) is {{the active}} {{component}} of herbicides {{widely used in}} agriculture, truck farming, or public domains. GLA acts by inhibiting the plant glutamine synthetase (GlnS). It also inhibits mammalian GlnS in vitro and ex vivo. In {{the central nervous system}} this enzyme is exclusively localized in glial cells. Whereas acute neurotoxic effects of GLA are well docu-mented, long-term effects during chronic exposure at low doses remain largely undisclosed. In the present work, C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were treated intraperitoneally with 2. 5, 5, and 10 mg/kg of GLA three times a week during 10 weeks. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments were performed at high field (9. 4 T) and the images were analyzed with four texture analysis (TA) methods. TA highlighted structural changes in seven brain structures after chronic GLA treatments. Changes are dose dependent and can be seen at a dose as low as 2. 5 mg/kg for two areas, namel...|$|R

Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture, 66, (2), 79 - 88. Sponsorship: BBSRC /State Education Commission of China / British Council /MAFF Crop Molecular Genetics Programme. Fertile transgenic plants of oat (Avena sativa L. var. Melys) were produced following microprojectile bombardment of primary embryogenic calli from immature embryos with two plasmids containing the bar gene or the ?-glucuronidase (uidA) gene, after selection with <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium.</b> Eleven plants were regenerated from phosphinothricin resistant callus, {{with three of}} the eleven plants containing either intact or rearranged copies. No plants co-transformed with the non-selected uidA gene were detected.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work {{was to determine the}} inheritance and stability of transgenes of a transgenic bean line expressing the genes rep-trap-ren from Bean golden mosaic virus and the bar gene. Crosses were done between the transgenic line and four commercial bean cultivars, followed by four backcrosses to the commercial cultivars. Progenies from each cross were evaluated for the presence of the transgenes by brushing the leaves with <b>glufosinate</b> <b>ammonium</b> and by polymerase chain reaction using specific oligonucleotides. Advanced generations were rub-inoculated with an isolate of Bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV). The transgenes were inherited consistently in a Mendelian pattern in the four crosses studied. The analyzed lines recovered close to 80 % of the characteristics of the recurrent parent, as determined by the random amplified DNA markers used, besides maintaining important traits such as resistance to BCMNV. The presence of the transgene did not cause any detectable undesirable effect in the evaluated progenies...|$|R
