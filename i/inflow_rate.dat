40|$|AbstractWe {{estimated}} <b>inflow</b> <b>rates</b> of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) to Tokyo Bay, Japan, between February 2004 and February 2011 by a receptor-oriented approach {{based on}} quarterly samplings {{of the bay}} water. Temporal trends in these <b>inflow</b> <b>rates</b> are an important basis for evaluating changes in PFOS and PFOA emissions in the Tokyo Bay catchment basin. A mixing model estimated the average concentrations of these compounds in the freshwater inflow to the bay, which were then multiplied by estimated freshwater <b>inflow</b> <b>rates</b> to obtain the <b>inflow</b> <b>rates</b> of these compounds. The receptor-oriented approach enabled us to comprehensively cover inflow to the bay, including inflow via direct discharge to the bay. On a logarithmic basis, the <b>rate</b> of <b>inflow</b> for PFOS decreased gradually, particularly after 2006, whereas that for PFOA exhibited a marked stepwise decrease from 2006 to 2007. The <b>rate</b> of <b>inflow</b> for PFOS decreased from 730 kg/y during 2004 – 2006 to 160 kg/y in 2010, whereas that for PFOA decreased from 2000 kg/y during 2004 – 2006 to 290 kg/y in 2010. These reductions probably reflected reductions in the use and emission of these compounds and their precursors in the Tokyo Bay catchment basin. Our estimated per-person <b>inflow</b> <b>rates</b> (i. e., <b>inflow</b> <b>rates</b> divided by the estimated population in the basin) for PFOS were generally comparable to previously reported per-person waterborne emission rates in Japan and other countries, whereas those for PFOA were generally higher than previously reported per-person waterborne emission rates. A comparison with previous estimates of household emission rates of these compounds suggested that our inflow estimates included a considerable contribution from point industrial sources...|$|R

50|$|When in operation, Andrews Geyser shoots water {{continuously}} to {{a height}} of about 80 feet. Its water supply is drawn from a pond located at the current site of the Inn on Mill Creek, a local Bed & Breakfast. The Inn's property contains the original dam constructed by the railroad in the late 19th century, and the pond formed by the dam with {{the water of the}} Long Branch of Mill Creek. A 6 in cast iron pipe runs from the dam, through a hidden gate valve, then underground approximately two miles downhill to the fountain. The water comes out a half-inch nozzle pointed skyward, and the 500 feet of elevation difference creates the pressure that drives the fountain. Extended dry condition in the area can limit the ability for the fountain to operate continuously. When the natural water <b>inflow</b> <b>rate</b> to the supply pond falls below {{the rate at which the}} fountain draws, the fountain can only be run periodically, at best to match the amount of water inflow over an extended period of time.|$|E
50|$|Furrow {{irrigation}} {{is conducted}} by creating small parallel channels along the field length {{in the direction}} of predominant slope. Water is applied to the top end of each furrow and flows down the field under the influence of gravity. Water may be supplied using gated pipe, siphon and head ditch, or bankless systems. The speed of water movement is determined by many factors such as slope, surface roughness and furrow shape but most importantly by the <b>inflow</b> <b>rate</b> and soil infiltration rate. The spacing between adjacent furrows is governed by the crop species, common spacings typically range from 0.75 to 2 metres. The crop is planted on the ridge between furrows which may contain a single row of plants or several rows {{in the case of a}} bed type system. Furrows may range anywhere from less than 100 m to 2000 m long depending on the soil type, location and crop type. Shorter furrows are commonly associated with higher uniformity of application but result in increasing potential for runoff losses. Furrow irrigation is particularly suited to broad-acre row crops such as cotton, maize and sugar cane. It is also practiced in various horticultural industries such as citrus, stone fruit and tomatoes.|$|E

Common minerals that are found in these deposits include blödite, borax, epsomite, gaylussite, glauberite, mirabilite, thenardite and trona. Non-marine deposits may also contain halite, gypsum, and anhydrite, and may in some cases even be dominated by these minerals, although they did not come from ocean deposits. This, however, does not make non-marine deposits any less important; these deposits often help to paint a picture into past Earth climates. Some particular deposits even show important tectonic and climatic changes. These deposits also may contain important minerals that help in today's economy. Thick non-marine deposits that accumulate tend to form where evaporation rates will exceed the <b>inflow</b> <b>rate,</b> and where there is sufficient soluble supplies. The inflow also has to occur in a closed basin, or one with restricted outflow, so that the sediment has time to pool and form in a lake or other standing body of water.

Saline lakes includes things such as perennial lakes, which are lakes that are there year-round, playa lakes, which are lakes that appear only during certain seasons, or any other terms that are used to define places that hold standing bodies of water intermittently or year-round.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the Black Sea Water (BSW) inflow on the {{circulation}} and the water mass characteristics of the North Aegean Sea is investigated using a high-resolution 3 D numerical model. Four climatological numerical experiments are performed exploring {{the effects of the}} exchange amplitude at the Dardanelles Straits in terms of the mean annual volume exchanged and the amplitude of its seasonal cycle. Larger inflow of low salinity BSW influences the water characteristics of the whole basin. The largest salinity reduction is encountered in the upper layers of the water column, and the most affected region is the northeastern part of the basin. The winter insulation character of the BSW layer (low-salinity layer) is reduced by the seasonal cycle of the inflow (minimum during winter). The maximum atmospheric cooling coincides with the minimum BSW <b>inflow</b> <b>rate,</b> weakening the vertical density gradients close to the surface and thus facilitating the vertical mixing. The <b>inflow</b> <b>rate</b> of BSW into the North Aegean Sea constitutes an essential factor for the circulation in the basin. Increased <b>inflow</b> <b>rate</b> results into considerably higher kinetic energy, stronger circulation and reinforcement of the mesoscale circulation features. Although the position of the front between BSW and waters of Levantine origin does not vary significantly with the intensity of the BSW <b>inflow</b> <b>rate,</b> the flow along the front becomes stronger and more unstable as the <b>inflow</b> <b>rate</b> increases, forming meanders and rings.

The mines are extracting the PGE minerals, which comprise Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium and Gold, together with base metals Copper and Nickel. This article focuses on {{the description of the}} aquifer systems associated with the Bushveld Complex’s mafic and ultramafic rocks and attempts to characterise the shallow groundwater as well as mine fissure inflows within different geographical settings. The general aquifer model for the Bushveld Complex comprises a perched, shallow aquifer in the weathered zone underlain by a deeper, semi-confined fractured bedrock aquifer. The weathered aquifer system,, as well as the upper portions of the underlying fractured bedrock aquifer, are partially dewatered in the vicinity of mining operations. Groundwater <b>inflow</b> <b>rates</b> into shallow mining operations within the weathered aquifer vary significantly depending on the structural setting within which the mines are located.

Similarly, close relationships between <b>inflow</b> <b>rate</b> and the CDOM absorption coefficient at 350 nm a(350) and with terrestrial humic-like fluorescence C 3 and a negative relationship between <b>inflow</b> <b>rate</b> and the first principal component (PC 1) scores, which, in turn, were negatively related to the concentrations and relative molecular size of CDOM (p < 0. 001), i. e. the concentration and molecular size of CDOM entering the lake increased proportionately with <b>inflow</b> <b>rate.</b> Furthermore, stable isotopes (?D and ? 18 O) were depleted in the upstream river mouth relative to downstream remaining lake regions, substantiating that riverine CDOM entering the lake was probably driven by <b>inflow</b> <b>rate.</b> This was further underpinned by remarkably higher mean chlorophyll-a and in situ measured terrestrial CDOM fluorescence (365 / 480 nm) and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), and notably lower mean PC 1 and CDOM spectral slope (S 275 - 295) recorded in the upstream river mouth than in the downstream main lake area. Strong negative correlations between <b>inflow</b> <b>rate</b> and a(250) :a(365), S 275 - 295, and the spectral slope ratio (SR) implied that CDOM input to the lake in rainy period was dominated by larger organic molecules with a more humic-like character.
