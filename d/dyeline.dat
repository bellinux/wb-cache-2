25|$|Many of the {{drawings}} originally used at Doncaster Works for the A1 Peppercorn class had been preserved at the NRM, {{and a team}} of volunteers spent three days collating these in the autumn of 1991. The original drawings were India ink drawings on linen; these had to be scanned into a Computer Aided Design (CAD) software program, as the microfilm NRM copies were not suitable for manufacturing purposes, and direct <b>dyeline</b> copies could not be made. About 95 percent of the original drawings were found, with 1,100 scanned by 1993, and a further 140 in 2001. A few poor-quality originals required re-drawing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{turbulent}} free convection in a horizontal fluid layer above a heated surface. Experiments {{have been carried}} out on a heated surface to obtain and analyze the planform structure and the heat transfer under different conditions. Water is the working fluid and the range of flux Rayleigh numbers (Ra) covered is 3 × 10 ^ 7 - 2 × 10 ^ 10 The different conditions correspond to Rayleigh-Benard convection, convection with either the top water surface open to atmosphere or covered with an insulating plate, and with an imposed external flow on the heated boundary. Without the external flow the planform is one of randomly oriented line plumes. At large Rayleigh number Ra and small aspect ratio (AR), these line plumes seem to align along the diagonal, presumably due to a large scale flow. The side views show inclined <b>dyelines,</b> again indicating a large scale flow. When the external flow is imposed, the line plumes clearly align in the direction of external flow. The nondimensional average plume spacing, Ra_λ^ 1 / 3, varies between 40 and 90. The heat transfer rate, for all the experiments conducted, represented as Ra_δ_T^- 1 / 3, where δ_T is the conduction layer thickness, varies only between 0. 1 – 0. 2, showing that in turbulent convection the heat transfer rates are similar under the different conditions...|$|R

50|$|In 1982 Hobs Manchester {{opened on}} Kennedy Street {{comprising}} a branch manager, two printers and a delivery girl. In 1983, Hobs bought-out CT Reprographics Ltd on Deansgate and moved its operations from Kennedy Street to CT Reprographics existing building. The staff {{doubled in size}} overnight. Hobs dropped its name in favour of the already well established CT Reprographics Ltd brand. The same year CT Reprographics was the first company in the UK to purchase the advanced Xerox 2080 printer which became a welcomed addition to the two <b>dyeline</b> printing machines. Because {{of the size of}} the Xerox 2080, Kieran O'Brien had to seek new premises on Deansgate to house this machine. In 1987, bigger premises became available on Deansgate, so CT Reprographics and the Xerox 2080 were both co-located in the new building, and the CT Reprographics brand reverted to Hobs Manchester. Today in 2010 it offers a complete range of printing solutions.|$|E
