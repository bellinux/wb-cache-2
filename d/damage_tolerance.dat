In 1993, Grumman updated the <b>damage</b> <b>tolerance</b> {{assessment}} and Force Structural Maintenance Plan and Damage Threat Assessment. Over the next few years, problems with wing structure fatigue, first noticed in production years earlier, began {{to come to the}} fore. The process of implementing the maintenance plan was greatly delayed by the base re-alignment and closure commission (BRAC), which led to 80% of the original workforce being let go.|$|E
5|$|Translesion {{synthesis}} (TLS) is a DNA <b>damage</b> <b>tolerance</b> {{process that}} allows the DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as thymine dimers or AP sites. It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V, from the Y Polymerase family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching {{is thought to be}} mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication processivity factor PCNA. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, Pol η mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation, whereas Pol ι introduces mutations at these sites. Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the T^T photodimer using Watson-Crick base pairing and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using Hoogsteen base pairing. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand crosslink, GT, although can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations. Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in Escherichia coli by replicating a GT-modified plasmid in E. coli with specific DNA polymerase knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II, pol IV, and pol V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases.|$|E

25|$|DNA {{damage has}} been one of the many causes in {{diseases}} related to aging. The stability of the genome is defined by the cells machinery of repair, <b>damage</b> <b>tolerance,</b> and checkpoint pathways that counteracts DNA damage. One hypothesis proposed by Gioacchino Failla in 1958 is that damage accumulation to the DNA causes aging. The hypothesis was developed soon by physicist Leó Szilárd. This theory has changed over the years as new research has discovered new types of DNA damage and mutations, and several theories of aging argue that DNA damage with or without mutations causes aging.|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of metals and fiber reinforced plastics {{is also known}} as hybrid metal composites. They offer the fusion of the good static mechanical properties of the fiber reinforced plastics and the good dynamic mechanical properties of the metal. For that reason, parts made of hybrid metal composites are predestined for the use as load relevant parts. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop new technologies for semi finished hybrid metal composite materials. Thermoplastic Fiber-Reinforced Composites (TP-FRC) were arranged with new, isotropic, closed pore Aluminum Foam (AF) structures to an Extrinsically Combined Composite Sandwich (ECCS) by adhesive bonding. They form the basis for novel weight-optimized as well as cost-effective applications. The entire manufacturing process for the continuous semi-finished product was examined and verified according DIN EN 2563.

Therefore, materials are specifically positioned according to their mechanical properties in the technical system, and manufactured to meet a manageable manufacturing strategy to the component or semi-finished product. By using this fusion of technology, high-performance components fulfill the claims for high economic and technical performance in complex assembly structures of today’s (and tomorrow’s) technical systems. They are flexible, compact and meet the current requirements for efficiency and safety. Due to the achievable synergy effects, multi-material assemblies are increasingly applied, especially in automotive lightweight design.

40|$|Sandwich {{structures}} {{consist of}} one light core layer and two top layers, which form the load-bearing structure. These layers {{have to be}} stiff and strong and have to protect the structure against indentations. The main task of the core layer {{is to keep the}} top layers in place and to generate a high shear stiffness. In order to obtain the required space between the top layers, the core layer has to have a high specific volume. Different sandwich materials with aluminium or steel top layers and cores of aluminium combs, corrugated aluminium sheets or aluminium foams are already known. In order to obtain better properties in terms of strength fibre-reinforced plastics (FRP) are utilised as top layers; this is the focus of numerous of the current research studies. The sole use of these materials leads to negative effects regarding the damage and impact behaviour. New top layers with high strength and high stiffness characteristics as well as good <b>damage</b> <b>tolerances</b> are to be expected by utilising metal layers in combination with endless fibre-reinforced plastics, so called hybrid laminates. These hybrid laminates combine the positive properties of metals (e. g. ductility) and fibre-reinforced plastics (e. g. tensile strength). The focus of this investigation lies on the production and characterisation of sandwich structures with aluminium foam core layers and hybrid laminate top layers. The foam cores consist of closed pore aluminium foams produced by utilising ingot and powder metallurgical techniques. The top layers consist of glass fibre-reinforced thermoplastics and aluminium layers. The production of the sandwich materials is realised by means of thermal pressing...|$|R
40|$|Endotoxin {{tolerance}} {{is defined}} as a reduced responsiveness to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge following a first encounter with endotoxin.

Endotoxin tolerance involves the participation of macrophages and mediators, such as glucocorticoids, prostaglandins, IL- 10, and transforming growth factor-β. Endotoxin tolerance is accompanied by the up-regulation of inhibitory molecules that down-regulate the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 dependent signaling pathway. Cross-tolerance between LPS and other TLR specific ligands, as well as IL- 1 and TNF, has been regularly reported. A similar loss of LPS reactivity has bee...|$|R

Extensive tests were conducted on sandwich beams, laminated plates and stiffened panels. Conditions for failures were investigated by impact tests on statically loaded test specimens. Lightly loaded graphite structures (such as aircraft secondary structure) were insensitive to impact damage. In more heavily loaded structures, (such as wing panels), appreciable reductions in compressive strength occurred. The implications of the tests for structural design are discussed by comparing panel masses for designs where ultimate strains were reduced due to impact considerations with the masses of designs with higher ultimate strains.

40|$|Conventional energy {{conversion}} architectures in photovoltaic (PV) systems are often forced to tradeoff conversion efficiency and power production. This paper introduces an {{energy conversion}} approach that enables each PV element {{to operate at}} its maximum power point (MPP) while processing {{only a small fraction}} of the total power produced. This is accomplished by providing only the mismatch in the MPP current of a set of series-connected PV elements.

Several differential power processing architectures are analyzed and compared with Monte Carlo simulations. Local control of the differential converters enables distributed protection and monitoring.

40|$|Abstract Plants defend {{themselves}} against herbivores via resistance, which reduces <b>damage,</b> and <b>tolerance,</b> which minimizes {{the negative effects of}} damage. Theory predicts the existence of tradeoffs between defense and growth, as well as between resistance and tolerance, that could maintain the genetic variation for resistance and tolerance often observed in plant populations. We examined resistance and toler-ance among aspen (Populus tremuloides) trees grown under divergent soil nutrient regimes. This common garden experiment revealed substantial genetic variation for resistance and tolerance under both low- and high-nutrient conditions. Costs of resistance exist, particularly under high-nutrient conditions where allocation to resistance chemicals competes directly with growth for limited carbon resources. We found no significant costs of tolerance, however, under either nutrient condition. Despite genetic variation for both resistance and tolerance, we found no evidence for a tradeoff between these two defense traits suggesting that resistance and tol-erance are complementary, rather than mutually exclusive, defenses in aspen...|$|R
