40|$|The EU direct {{payments}} system {{is about to}} change and Italian agriculture will face a scenario of decreasing aid. The present work is an attempt to estimate the types of <b>farm</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> in such a scenario by analyzing Italian FADN data. We have estimated a profitability index relating real net income to a reference revenue that takes into account the opportunity cost of resources. This has allowed us to highlight situations where farms are unable to remunerate the factors employed fairly and to identify areas of Italian agriculture at risk. By comparing profitability indices with and without public aid and by analyzing demographic factors and production characteristics, it is possible to investigate how EU payments affect the persistence of non-profitable farms...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that, in Switzerland, {{communal}} grazing of livestock on alpine pastures {{plays an important role}} in the spread of BVD virus. Analogously, we might expect that the communal raising on farms specialising in raising heifers of animals born on different farms would also favour the spread of BVDV. This study investigated whether a persistently infected (PI) breeding heifer kept on this type of farm over a period of 26 months would put the other animals <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of being infected. The PI-animal was in contact with 75 heifers (here defined as contact animals) on this farm. Thirty-two of the contact animals that were probably pregnant (animals <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of giving birth to a PI-calf) were moved to 8 different breeding farms (here defined as <b>farms</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk).</b> On these 8 farms, 246 calves were found to be <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of being infected with BVDV. We examined 78 calves and investigated whether the move of the pregnant animals from their original farm had permitted the virus to spread to these 8 other farms. The contact animals had a seroprevalence of 92 % and the animals <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> a seroprevalence of 100 %. Only one PI-animal was found on the <b>farms</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> This BVD infection, however, occurred independently of the PI-breeding animal. Seropositive calves were found only on 2 farms. This study did not provide any proof for a spread of BVDV with the PI-breeding animal as a source; likewise, no persistent infection was proven to exist on the <b>farms</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> This result is likely to be representative for the endemic situation of BVD in Switzerland. Thus, PI-animals present on heifer raising farms infect calves well before servicing. Hence, no new PI-animals are generated, and the infection becomes self-limiting. When we reconstructed the animal movements between the farms and determined the animals to be examined with the aid of the Swiss national animal traffic database (TVD) we found the data of 37 % of the heifers to be incomplete and failed to successfully establish the whereabouts of 3 animals...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Recent {{studies in}} France {{have shown that}} Absidia corymbifera and, {{to a lesser degree}} Eurotium amstelodami and Wallemia sebi, play a role in farmer's lung disease (FLD), but that Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, classically incriminated, does not. Little is known about farmers' {{reactions}} to these fungi or the circumstances which lead to exposure. AIMS: To investigate the conditions which favour the development of these microorganisms in hay and to analyse the relation between their concentration and the risk of occurrence of FLD. METHODS: Sequential microbiological analyses of each batch of hay stored in 10 <b>farms</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for FLD and a serological survey of 10 farmers (five with a past history of FLD). RESULTS: Exposure to microorganisms varied widely according to farms and periods. These microorganisms usually reached a peak in January and proliferated when harvesting conditions favoured excessive humidity in hay (rain during harvest, soil in the hay). Three of the five FLD patients presented with FLD respiratory recurrence and positive serology for A corymbifera during the winter (2000 - 01), after exposure to a significantly higher amount of A corymbifera than other farmers. Similar, but less significant, results were found for E amstelodami exposure, but not with W sebi. CONCLUSIONS: Results contribute to confirming A corymbifera as a major aetiological agent of FLD in Doubs, and encourage further studies with a view to implementing preventive measures...|$|R

In this study, vie have examined the effect of farm type on the prevalence of fattening pigs shedding Salmonella on 12 <b>farms</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for harboring Salmonella. On six open (grow-to-finish) and six closed (farrow-to-finish) farms, the prevalence of pigs shedding Salmonella was determined on two occasions approximately 2 months apart. The serovar, phage type, and antimicrobial resistance of the obtained Salmonella isolates were determined. On all farms, pigs shedding Salmonella were detected {{on at least one}} of the two sampling days. The mean within-herd prevalence was 7. 8 %. Closed farms were two times less likely to have pigs shedding Salmonella than open farms. On open farms, the odds of finding Salmonella shedding in pigs were 1. 9 times higher when sampling was performed at slaughter age than when samples were taken halfway through the fattening period. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was the most predominant serotype, with a prevalence of 62 to 63 % on both farm types. Of all the Salmonella Typhimurium isolates, 65 % had the tetraresistant profile ASSuT (ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and tetracycline) with or without additional resistance to trimethoprim-sulfonamide. Phage type DT 120 seemed to be especially associated with this antimicrobial-resistant profile. The prevalence of Salmonella Typhimurium isolates showing resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, sulfonamide, trimethoprim-sulfonamide, and lincomycin hydrochloride and spectinomycin sulfate tetrahydrate was significantly higher on open farms than on closed farms...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a risk based {{surveillance}} model for environmental pollutants, monitoring the presence and the quantity of toxic contaminants in cattle and sheep products. Methods: The province of Latina was chosen as study area. The official list of polluted sites was provided by the Province. This was then integrated into a Geographic Informative System together with geographical, hydrographic, and geological data along with information regarding the farms that was obtained from the National Livestock Registry. In order to identify the monitoring priority of polluted sites, a semi-quantitative risk assessment was then set up. A score for each of the attributes considered in the risk evaluation was given to each site, based on two main criteria: the environmental hazard characterization and the quantification of the exposed animal population. The sample of farms to be monitored was defined according to statistical criteria. Results: 12 polluted sites were chosen as “at major risk” among the 58 identified therefore, inside the respective surrounding risk areas, 24 farms were chosen to be monitored. Biological materials to be sampled were also defined. As a result, it was determined that 104 samples collected throughout a year would be sufficient to detect any contamination in the territory of the Province, with an admitted prevalence of 10 % among <b>farms</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> (CL 95 %). Conclusions: Risk based surveillance is more sensitive in detecting environmental pollution than surveillance that is randomly performed, based on the same allocation of financial resources...|$|R

40|$|The 2001 {{epidemic}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK {{resulted in the}} death of nearly 10 million livestock at a cost that was estimated to be up to 8 billion pounds. Owing to the controversy surrounding the epidemic, {{the question of whether or}} not alternative policies would have resulted in significantly better control of the epidemic remains of great interest. A hexagonal lattice simulation of FMD in Cumbria is used to address the central question of whether or not better use could have been made of expert knowledge of FMD transmission to target pre-emptive culling, by assuming that the premises <b>at</b> greatest <b>risk</b> of becoming infected can be targeted for culling. The 2000 UK census and the epidemiological database collected during the epidemic are used to describe key characteristics of disease transmission, and the model is fit to the epidemic time-series. Under the assumptions of the model, the parameters that best fit the epidemic in Cumbria indicate that a policy based on expert knowledge would have exacerbated the epidemic compared with the policy as implemented. However, targeting more distant, high-risk farms could be more valuable under different epidemic conditions, notably, if risk factors of sufficient magnitude could be identified to aid in prioritizing vaccination or culling of <b>farms</b> <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> of becoming infected...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the 2009 H 1 N 1 influenza pandemic (H 1 N 1 pdm 09) highlighted the need for sustainable surveillance strategies to monitor swine influenza virus (SIV) evolution and to improve knowledge on swine influenza (SI) epidemiology. Vietnam has the second highest pig population in Asia, and its local context is conducive to inter-species transmission of influenza. I performed {{an analysis of the}} pig value chain in Northern Vietnam, from which I selected a collective slaughterhouse, three local slaughterhouses, a weaner market and 15 sentinel familial farms for inclusion in SI pilot surveillance protocols, along with 39 health actors and traders for syndromic surveillance. I found that SIV isolation was only successful at the collective slaughterhouse with 78 viruses obtained. Four groups were identified based on hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences. The H 1 N 1 pdm 09 viruses showed no reassortment, while H 1 N 2 and H 3 N 2 were all reassortants, often with some internal genes from H 1 N 1 pdm 09. There was virological and serological evidence of circulation of the different hemagglutinin lineages in both the company and familial farming sectors. Monthly seroprevalence was high in slaughterhouses (27 %- 89 %) but low in the market (0 - 17 %). Based on pig origin data, seroprevalence at the pig-level in local slaughterhouses and farm-level in the collective slaughterhouse was significantly higher in companies (100 % and 97 % respectively) compared to familial farms (60 - 78 % and 74 %). In six sentinel <b>farms,</b> seroconversion occurred <b>at</b> an average age of 4 months (2. 4 - 6. 4), following maternal antibody decay. The health-related syndromic indicators did not show any clear trends related to influenza circulation. I then considered the cost-effectiveness of the alternative surveillance protocols. Overall the collective slaughterhouse surveillance was the most cost-effective protocol due to successful virus isolation and informative seroprevalence data. Sentinel farm surveillance was also useful as it provided valuable data on SI transmission dynamics in farms. The cost-effectiveness of the other protocols was considered to be lower. I conducted a risk assessment to estimate the risk of SIV circulation in the different farm categories linked to pig introduction, and found that the familial <b>farms</b> most <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of SI circulation were large farrow-to-finish farms and secondarily large fattening farms. The main outcome of this work was the evaluation of SI surveillance strategies for long term monitoring of SIV evolution and pandemic preparedness, and the identification of surveillance at collective slaughterhouses as having particular value. The implementation of a similar protocol in collective slaughterhouses in Southern Vietnam would allow further study of SIV evolutionary dynamics at the regional level. Risk-based surveillance could be developed in swine farms using the epidemiological results of this study, targeting <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>farms</b> and <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> pig age period (3 - 4 months old). Further studies are needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of a syndromic surveillance strategy which would allow spatio-temporal sampling in farms based on high incidence of influenza-like illness. One immediate next step in my current study would be an assessment of the pandemic potential of the SIV isolates. More broadly, a One Health approach including surveillance of influenza viruses in animals and humans and the animal-human interface should be developed. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|A {{system to}} {{overcome}} dry land salinization of farming systems in medium to low (300 - 600 mm) rainfall areas of southern Australia is proposed. Phase farming with trees (PFT) {{is designed to}} use trees grown in very short term rotations (3 - 5 years) to rapidly de-water <b>farming</b> catchments <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of salinity, by depleting soil water while producing utilizable products such as wood fibre and biomass.

Potential benefits include decreased salinization, improved soil structure and acting as a disease and weed break. Production of large amounts of biomass suitable for "green" electricity will decrease Australia's emissions of Greenhouse gases. The biophysical feasibility of PFT was assessed for several sites in the 300 - 600 mm rainfall zone of southern Australia using the WAVES model. Several scenarios were examined, with these suggesting broad differences in likely response to the PFT system. The modelling suggests that the premise of the PFT system (viz. depletion of sub-soil moisture reserves under trees and subsequent recharge under agriculture) is realistic.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{continuing}} {{expansion of}} high incidence areas of bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) in Great Britain (GB) raises {{a number of}} questions concerning the determinants of infection at the herd level that are driving spread of the disease. Here, we develop risk factor models to quantify the importance of herd sizes, cattle imports from Ireland, history of bTB, badgers and cattle restocking in determining bTB incidence. We compare the significance of these different risk factors in high and low incidence areas (as determined by parish testing intervals). Results Large herds and fattening herds are more likely to breakdown in all areas. In areas with lower perceived risk (longer testing intervals), the risk of breaking down is largely determined by the number of animals that a herd buys in from high incidence areas. In contrast, in higher perceived risk areas (shorter testing intervals), the risk of breakdown is defined by the history of disease and the probability of badger occurrence. Despite differences in the management of bTB across different countries of GB (England, Wales and Scotland), we found no significant differences in bTB <b>risk</b> <b>at</b> the national level after these other factors had been taken into account. Conclusions This paper demonstrates that different types of <b>farm</b> are <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of breakdown and that the most important risk factors vary according to bTB incidence in an area. The results suggest that significant gains in bTB control could be made by targeting herds in low incidence areas that import the greatest number of cattle from high incidence areas. </p...|$|R

In the Province of Lucca, the presence of reproductive wolf packs has already been confirmed in natural reserves, but occasional signs of presence of the predator have been reported also in neighbouring areas. The present research has been carried out in this Province (between the Orecchiella Natural Reserve and the medium Serchio Valley), in order to obtain more complete information on the location of the wolf (with transects, wolf- howling and snow-tracking), and to verify the real impact and risk factors of predation on live- stock (by means of on-farm surveys carried out in 42 semi-extensive farms) in this area. The presence of wolf was confirmed in the study area with a minimum of four adult individuals and at least one pup: this pack lives around the peaks of the Apennines in the municipalities covered by this investigation. A growing conflict between the wolf and the sheep and goat farms was observed: since 2007 there have been 25 attacks and three farms can be considered subject to chronic predation.

An accurate knowledge of wolf presence and the identification of the <b>farms</b> mostly <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> can be useful for future planning of interventions aimed at prevention and support of farmers, in order to mitigate the conflict caused by predation...|$|R
40|$|For {{decades the}} routine meat {{inspection}} for the zoonotic parasite Cysticercus bovis {{has been conducted}} by way of ante and post mortem examination only. According to VO (EG) 854 / 2004 cuts on the cysticerci of Taenia saginata („Finnenschnitte“) are prescribed by law. This method of diagnosis {{is based on a}} visual examination, leading to a significant underestimation of the prevalence and also of consequences on human health as well. The present study tries to identify risks in cattle keeping systems and environmental conditions and tries also to find out factors which minimize the risk of the occurrence of Cysticercus bovis. For that a questionnaire was developed. 38 ecologically run cattle farms were visited and data collected. In 11 of these farms Taenia saginata had occurred before. The farms under examination were dairy farms, mother cow farms and also mixed farms. The collected operation data were statistically examined using the IBM SPSS Statistics 23 program statistically (determination of frequencies, crosstabs, Chi-squared tests, Odds ratios, resume of selected variables and logistic regression). With the method of Cluster analysis (Spearmans rank correlation coefficient, distance measure, merger algorithm by using the Ward procedure and Scree-Plot) farm structures were identified and served as a base for identifying farms of similar structure and categorizing them. Veterinary farm service was identified as a risk-minimizing factor for the occurrence of Cysticercus bovis (p value: 0, 031). After that an investigation was carried out into possible correlations between other factors or structures and the veterinary farm service. The use of hygiene rules and cleaning of stables (well-swept) turned out to be significant factors correlating with veterinary farm service. A prophylactic use of antiparasitic agents {{did not seem to be}} significant, but in mathematical term, farms with veterinary farm service applied antiparasitic agents significantly more frequently. The cluster analysis showed similar farm structures and environmental conditions in some farms. These clusters were investigated for cysticerci: In cluster 1 14, 3 % cysticerci, in cluster 2 50 % cysticerci, in cluster 3 30 % cysticerci and in cluster 4 0 % cysticerci were found. Main characteristics of cluster 2 were inter alia a higher risk in the areas of tourism and water reservoirs, main characteristics of cluster 4 were a lower risk in terms of flooded areas and storage of dung. A general analysis of similiar farms including work practices, structures of hygiene and determination of medical data (cysticerci found in cattle holding farms, taeniosis in humans) could serve as a base for determining farms which are in principle <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and as a base for expanding the traditional post mortem examination. This base could be used to work together with the human medicine in order to use existing data in a new way, to combine data in veterinary and human medicine, to create a new data interconnected system or to come to a data exchange system. New outbreaks of cysticercosis and taeniosis could be recorded immediately and farms exposed to higher risks could be identified and be treated preventively under cooperation with the respective veterinarian. In cooperation with veterinary farm service a risk based identification of <b>farms</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> could serve as a supplement to the visual meat inspection as traditionally practised today...|$|R

This study attempted to identify milk quality parameters that are associated with the occurrence of veterinary drug residues using multivariate principal component analysis (PCA). A total of 132 raw milk samples were collected from 45 dairy farms in the state of Minas Gerais - Brazil and analyzed for 42 analytes, including pyrethroids, macrocyclic lactones and antibacterials, using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in tandem mode and gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Out of the 132 milk samples, 40 samples tested positive for at least one analyte (above the detection limit). The milk parameters associated with the antimicrobial residues by confirmatory tests were lactose and nonfat concentrations, as revealed by PCA. This analysis showed that fat and total solid concentrations, as well as the somatic cell and total bacteria counts were associated with macrocyclic lactone residues in bulk tank milk. A PCA assessing pyrethroid residues in bulk tank milk revealed that the lactose and nonfat solid concentrations and titratable acidity were inversely associated with these residues. Thus, the data analysis indicated that the veterinary drug residues were associated with certain milk quality parameters {{that can be used to}} target <b>farms</b> <b>at</b> higher <b>risk</b> of veterinary drug residue contamination for testing programs in combination with incentives, education and training programs to improve mammary health, milk hygiene and safety...|$|R

There is also weaker, but suggestive evidence that farmers more often have knee OA and LBP than workers in occupations with fewer physical demands.

For some outcomes, the link with occupational risk factors (such as heavy loading of joints and whole-body vibration) is sufficient to suggest the course that future prevention should take, but for several outcomes more research is first needed.

A case-control study of breakdowns to tuberculosis infection in cattle herds in the Central North Island of New Zealand was conducted to identify risk factors other than exposure to tuberculosis in local possum populations. The cross-sectional study was based on data gathered some years earlier in the Hauhungaroa Ranges from a number of traplines with a total length of 60 km, hence it provided information about the epidemiology of possum tuberculosis on a large geographical scale with varying environmental conditions. The results from the study showed that disease occurrence was clustered in space with local prevalence reaching up to 20 % while the overall prevalence was about 1. 2 %. The longitudinal study was conducted using an area of 21 hectare of mixed pasture and bush on a sheep/beef farm. The study showed that incidence and prevalence of tuberculosis infection in possum populations has distinct spatial and temporal patterns. Environmental conditions were a major factor in determining the temporal pattern. Spatial and temporal analysis of the occurrence of different strains of Mycobacterium bovis allowed inferences to be made about the importance of particular transmission paths. Survival of possums depended on environmental conditions and tuberculosis disease status. Adverse weather conditions increased mortality and the incidence of clinical disease in possums. On average clinically tuberculous possums survived for about 2 to 3 months from the onset of clinical disease. The simulation model uses a Monte-Carlo modelling approach and incorporates geographical features. Biological mechanisms which are considered important for population and infection dynamics were implemented in the model. These include mating, density-dependent and -independent mortality, pseudo-vertical transmission, transmission through spatial or temporal proximity, and transmission during mating contact. Each possum's movements and behaviour are simulated on a day-by-day basis. Simulations are conducted using a geography and possum population based on data from the longitudinal field study. For preliminary validation, model output was compared with field data from the longitudinal study. Sensitivity analyses and some initial simulation experiments were conducted to identify areas in the model structure which require the collection of additional field data. Use of the model for simulation of a possum population occupying a 400 ha area in the Central North Island of New Zealand is demonstrated. The case-control study of breakdowns to tuberculosis infection in cattle herds showed that in the Waikato area of New Zealand exposure to tuberculosis infection in local possum populations was not the dominant cause of breakdowns when the study was conducted in 1989 / 90, at a time when tuberculous possums were first discovered in the region. Farmers who had breakdowns tended to follow cattle purchase and management practices which traditionally have been considered to put <b>farms</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of introducing tuberculosis. The results of the study indicate that there was a lack understanding among farmers about the epidemiology of tuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Although {{still of}} central importance, farming {{on its own}} is {{increasingly}} unable to provide a sufficient means of survival in rural areas. Further, the asset base of farmers is not diversified, so loss of farming productivity during severe drought results in the total loss of assets and hence results in food insecurity and dependency on food aid. Therefore, it was crucial to identify the causes and consequences of food insecurity; assess the different livelihood strategies and their role to household food security status; and {{examine the effect of}} livelihood diversification to household food security status in order to recommend possible alternative actions. To achieve these objectives, data was collected from primary and secondary sources to understand the determinants, events and processes involved in people‟s livelihoods. Livelihood strategies and food security status of 120 farm households were examined. The qualitative data was analyzed in the form of narratives, content analysis, comparison and triangulation where as the quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, and chi-square to test the significance. The major findings of the study imply that rapid population growth, resource degradation and shrinkage of cultivated land, drought, land fragmentation, weak financial and institutional organizations have puts the <b>farm</b> households <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of food insecurity. This necessitates the need for enormous efforts in interventions in areas that help households to diversify their livelihoods both within and outside the agricultural system even though the chi- square test indicates insignificant associations. However, based on this result the researcher did not jump to the conclusion that diversification has no effect on food security status of farm households, but this result {{may be due to the}} different types of livelihood diversification strategies, their nature, and level and I recommend further in-dept...|$|R
40|$|The Ohio-Mississippi Disaster of 1937 In {{the early}} days of 1937, the Ohio River, swollen by heavy winter rains, began rising. And rising. And rising. By the time the waters crested, the Ohio and Mississippi had climbed to record heights. Nearly four hundred people had died, while a million more had run from their homes. The deluge caused more than half a billion dollars of damage {{at a time when the}} Great Depression still {{battered}} the nation. Timed to coincide with the flood’s seventy-fifth anniversary, The Thousand-Year Flood is the first comprehensive history of one of the most destructive disasters in American history. David Welky first shows how decades of settlement put Ohio valley <b>farms</b> and towns <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and how politicians and planners repeatedly ignored the dangers. Then he tells the gripping story of the river’s inexorable rise: residents fled to refugee camps and higher ground, towns imposed martial law, prisoners rioted, Red Cross nurses endured terrifying conditions, and FDR dispatched thousands of relief workers. In a landscape fraught with dangers—from unmoored gas tanks that became floating bombs to powerful currents of filthy floodwaters that swept away whole towns— people hastily raised sandbag barricades, piled into overloaded rowboats, and marveled at water that stretched as far as the eye could see...|$|R
40|$|This study explores and {{provides}} new insight in {{to how the}} increase in sea surface temperature {{as a result of}} climate change may affect the marine farming industry and coastal zone management of New Zealand. As the world’s population grows and the effects of climate change intensify there will be a greater demand for sustainable food resources. Aquaculture can provide our growing population with this resource {{as long as there is}} effective environmental management. Policy and decision makers must review and consider the full array of effects climate change may have on the coastal zone and aquaculture. A marine farmer questionnaire was developed to gain insight into how current marine farmers viewed important variables in marine farm site selection and climate change. A number of GIS techniques were used to identify what species are <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of experiencing water temperatures that exceed their physiological threshold. A simple agent-based model was developed to estimate the potential loss in the numbers of those animals that may experience extreme water temperatures. Lastly, a suitability analysis was developed to identify alternative sites for <b>farming</b> the <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> species. A majority of marine farmers rated some important physical and social variables in marine farm site selection as less important than farmers 15 years ago. A majority of marine farmers feel they are somewhat informed and have little concern for climate change. The King Salmon is <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of experiencing water temperatures that exceed its physiological threshold. Around 15 - 66 % of the salmon currently being farmed in the Marlborough Sounds could be lost to water temperature greater than 17 °C. Alternative sites for farming salmon are located in the middle-lower regions of the South Island, New Zealand under the IPPC’s A 2 and B 1 emissions scenarios. The findings from this research are useful to organisations such as Aquaculture NZ and the Marine Farming Association in planning for the future of the industry. These findings are also useful to policy and decision makers for developing effective management strategies and in marine space allocation in the wake of climate change. This is a novel study for New Zealand, as very little research has been undertaken to explore the effects of climate change on the aquaculture industry and coastal zone management. Based on the results the current literature gaps in the body of knowledge are filled. It also provides a solution to help mitigate the effects of climate change for decision makers and those farms that are may experience extreme water temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Inherent {{in their}} living and working conditions, Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers (MSFWs) are exposed to a {{multitude}} of environmental and psychosocial stressors that make them susceptible to adverse health outcomes. Utilizing a resilience framework, the current study examined both the physical and psychological health functioning of MSFWs in Georgia, a state heavily reliant on farm worker labor where relatively few research studies with MSFWs have been conducted to date. Based on a sample of 120 Latino, male, MSFWs in South Georgia, results indicated that approximately 1 out of 3 <b>farm</b> workers were <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for iron-deficiency anemia. Similar to other psychological health studies conducted with MSFWs located in the Eastern U. S., the prevalence rate of depression in the current sample was elevated. MSFW stress {{was found to be}} a risk factor for psychological health and positive well-being and accurate farm worker expectations were found to be assets associated with better psychological health outcomes. Farm worker expectations was also found to be a protective factor for physical health such that having accurate expectations buffered the relationship between MSFW stress and adverse biomedical health. Results show the usefulness of the resilience framework, and highlight the importance of establishing prevention, intervention, and policy efforts for MSFWs that aim to increase assets and minimize risk in this population...|$|R
40|$|Even in {{relatively}} peripheral areas, {{such as the}} Portuguese-Spanish border regions, agriculture and food systems have changed greatly in the last decades. Traditional agricultural systems have been declining and some products are no longer appreciated, or even tend to become quantitatively insignificant. Not only are producers ageing but their knowledge and know-how along with the local genetic heritage and biodiversity associated with <b>farming</b> are <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of disappearing. Local products and markets have been progressively integrated into the larger framework of the global food market. Distributors, restaurant owners and consumers in general rely {{more and more on}} exogenous food products, despite the undeniable quality of the existing products and the emerging new urban demand for these products at a larger scale. Recent studies show that there is still room for small-scale production and localized food systems, although a considerable effort needs to be made {{if they are to be}} strengthened or re-established. This paper presents a comparative study of both the potential and limitations of traditional local products in the border area of Northern Portugal and the Spanish Province of Salamanca, in Castilla-Léon. It analyzes the types of products, production processes, qualification strategies, as well as the markets and commercialization approaches. The study is based on official published documents and interviews with local producers. Results show that the Portuguese regions are better positioned in terms of number of producers of traditional products, especially the organic products. On the whole, the major difficulties seem to lie in adequately qualifying, promoting and commercializing the products. Besides, co-operation among local agri-food entrepreneurs (in each zone and across the border) is quite feeble and does pose a challenge for the future. In general, localized systems tend to be quite weak, due to the decrease in population and the poor co-ordination among actors and the organization of local supply chains.

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of noncommunicable diseases in a true rural farming population in South India and compare the data with the landmark contemporary Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study. Methods: Local Ethics Committee approval and {{informed consent was obtained}} from all participants. Inclusion criteria were participants, aged ≥ 20 and ≤ 85 years, from Nallampatti, a classical farming village from Tamil Nadu state, India. All participants were administered a detailed questionnaire, had anthropometric measurements including height, weight, and waist circumference. Bloods were drawn for random blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c), nonfasting lipid profile, Cystatin C, uric acid, and hemoglobin. All participants had carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) done by high-resolution B-mode carotid ultrasound. Results: More than 50 % of the population had either diabetes or prediabetes based on HbA 1 c. Nearly, 40 % of the population had hypertension with suboptimal control in those with known hypertension. Nearly, a third of the population had dyslipidemia, elevated cystatin C levels, and abnormal CIMT. The burden was higher than the comparable ICMR-INDIAB study in rural Tamil Nadu. Conclusion: One-third to one-half of this rural <b>farming</b> population is <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of cardiovascular disease, with poor control of preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Current Indian data may underestimate the risk in different ethnic populations and regions of India. Long-term follow-up of this cohort for the incident cardiovascular disease will shed light on the true cardiovascular risk in a typical South Indian rural farming population...|$|R
40|$|Although 46 % of the Romanian {{population}} lives in rural areas, {{little is known}} about injuries and violence rural residents experience. Research worldwide consistently shows that farm related activities are a major cause of rural injuries. While such injuries can result in considerable suffering and fi nancial losses, little data are available on the prevalence and potential causes of injuries, especially among small farming operations. In Romania, the majority of farming operations are backyard farms, which are a method of survival agriculture, and also provide a place for work and recreation. This project assessed the burden of <b>farm</b> injuries, populations <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and injury risk factors among backyard family farms in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. 150 backyard farms were targeted, with data collected on injury occurrence, defi ned as an injury that restricted rural inhabitants from normal activities for at least 4 h, or resulted in loss of consciousness, loss of awareness, or loss of memory for any length of time, or required professional care including backyard farm workers, non-working rural residents and visitors. At the time of abstract submission, data is being collected. Data will include the prevalence and risk factors for injury. The project is unique because it is the fi rst to address backyard farm injuries in Romania. This data will provide the first public health information about backyard farm injuries, which will provide a baseline for future research projects on rural injuries as well as frame backyard farm injury prevention strategies and policies...|$|R
