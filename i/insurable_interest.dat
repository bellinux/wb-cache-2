25|$|Critics {{assert that}} naked CDSs should be banned, {{comparing}} them to buying fire insurance on your neighbor’s house, which creates a huge incentive for arson. Analogizing {{to the concept}} of <b>insurable</b> <b>interest,</b> critics say you should not be able to buy a CDS—insurance against default—when you do not own the bond. Short selling is also viewed as gambling and the CDS market as a casino.|$|E
25|$|Insurance is {{a method}} of {{shifting}} risk from one party to another. Insurers use actuarial methods to calculate appropriate premiums, {{which is similar to}} calculating gambling odds. Insurers set their premiums to obtain a long term positive expected return in the same manner that professional gamblers select which bets to make. While insurance is sometimes distinguished from gambling by the requirement of an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest,</b> the equivalent in gambling is simply betting against one's own best interests (e.g., a sports coach betting against his own team to mitigate the financial repercussions of a losing season).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Insurable</b> <b>interest</b> – {{the insured}} {{typically}} must directly {{suffer from the}} loss. [...] <b>Insurable</b> <b>interest</b> must exist whether property insurance or insurance on a person is involved.

2500|$|Builder's risk {{insurance}} insures {{against the}} risk of physical loss or damage to property during construction. Builder's risk insurance is typically written on an [...] "all risk" [...] basis covering damage arising from any cause (including the negligence of the insured) not otherwise expressly excluded. Builder's risk insurance is coverage that protects a person's or organization's <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> in materials, fixtures or equipment {{being used in the}} construction or renovation of a building or structure should those items sustain physical loss or damage from an insured peril.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there are}} also many differences, the most {{important}} being that an insurance contract provides an indemnity against the losses actually suffered by the policy holder on an asset in which it holds an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest.</b> [...] By contrast a CDS provides an equal payout to all holders, calculated using an agreed, market-wide method. [...] The holder {{does not need to}} own the underlying security and does not even have to suffer a loss from the default event. The CDS can therefore be used to speculate on debt objects.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the event}} of default the buyer of the CDS {{receives}} compensation (usually the face value of the loan), and the seller of the CDS takes possession of the defaulted loan. [...] However, anyone can purchase a CDS, even buyers who do not hold the loan instrument and who have no direct <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> in the loan (these are called [...] "naked" [...] CDSs). If there are more CDS contracts outstanding than bonds in existence, a protocol exists to hold a credit event auction; the payment received is usually substantially less than the face value of the loan.|$|E

2500|$|An entity which {{provides}} insurance {{is known as}} an insurer, insurance company, or insurance carrier. [...] A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or policyholder.

[...] The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms, and must involve something in which the insured has an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> established by ownership, possession, or preexisting relationship.|$|E

50|$|Legal {{guidelines}} {{have been}} established in many jurisdictions which establish the kinds of family relationships for which an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> exists. The <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> of family members {{is assumed to be}} emotional as well as financial. The law allows <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> on the presumption that a personal connection makes the family member more valuable alive than dead. Thus, husbands/wives have an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> in their spouse, and children have an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> in their parents (and vice versa). Brothers/sisters and grandchildren/grandparents are also assumed to have an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> in the lives of those relatives. But cousins, nieces/nephews, aunts/uncles, stepchildren/stepparents and in-laws cannot buy insurance on the lives of others related by these connections.|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} of <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> on life insurance {{is that a}} person or organization can obtain an insurance policy {{on the life of}} another person if the person or organization obtaining the insurance values the life of the insured more than the amount of the policy. In this way, insurance can compensate for loss. A company may have an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> in a President/CEO or other employee with special knowledge and skills. A creditor has an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> {{in the life of a}} debtor, up to the amount of the loan. A person who is financially dependent on a second person has an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> in the life of that second person.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases where}} the policy owner is not the insured (also {{referred}} to as the celui qui vit or CQV), insurance companies have sought to limit policy purchases to those with an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> in the CQV. For life insurance policies, close family members and business partners will usually be found to have an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest.</b> The <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> requirement usually demonstrates that the purchaser will actually suffer some kind of loss if the CQV dies. Such a requirement prevents people from benefiting from the purchase of purely speculative policies on people they expect to die. With no <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> requirement, the risk that a purchaser would murder the CQV for insurance proceeds would be great. In at least one case, an insurance company which sold a policy to a purchaser with no <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> (who later murdered the CQV for the proceeds), was found liable in court for contributing to the wrongful death of the victim (Liberty National Life v. Weldon, 267 Ala.171 (1957)).|$|E
50|$|This {{is a very}} {{misunderstood}} concept. <b>Insurable</b> <b>interest</b> either exists when {{a policy}} is issued, or it does not. If an insured is premium financing a policy, and his direct blood relatives are named as the beneficiaries when the policy is issued, then <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> is never an issue. If an insured changes ownership of the policy {{as soon as it}} is issued, but the beneficiaries are related by blood when the policy was issued, there is no <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> issues.|$|E

5000|$|Most, {{and until}} 2005 all, common law jurisdictions require the insured {{to have an}} <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> in {{the subject matter of}} the insurance. An <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> is that legal or {{equitable}} relationship between the insured and {{the subject matter of the}} insurance, separate from the existence of the insurance relationship, by which the insured would be prejudiced by the occurrence of the event insured against, or conversely would take a benefit from its non-occurrence. <b>Insurable</b> <b>interest</b> was long held to be morally necessary in insurance contracts to distinguish them, as enforceable contracts, from unenforceable gambling agreements (binding [...] "in honour" [...] only) and to quell the practice, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, of taking out life policies upon the lives of strangers. The requirement for <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> was removed in non-marine English law, possibly inadvertently, by the provisions of the Gambling Act 2005. [...] It remains a requirement in marine insurance law and other common law systems, however; and few systems of law will allow an insured to recover in respect of an event that has not caused the insured a genuine loss, whether the <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> doctrine is relied upon, or whether, as in common law systems, the courts rely upon the principle of indemnity to hold that an insured may not recover more than his true loss.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, life {{insurance}} is {{regulated by the}} states.

50|$|People have an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> {{in their}} {{property}} {{up to the}} value of the property, but no more. The principle of indemnity dictates that the insured be compensated for a loss of property, but not paid more than what the property was worth. A lender who grants a mortgage on the security of a house has an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> in that house, but only up to the amount outstanding on the loan.|$|E
5000|$|This {{caused the}} English courts {{to declare that}} an {{individual}} taking out a life insurance contract {{on the life of}} an insured must have an [...] "Insurable Interest" [...] in their life. This means, in its simplest terms, you must benefit more by having the individual insured alive, than dead. Direct blood relatives certainly have an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> in a family member. A business partner can have an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> in another business partner.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{court cases}} have been hearing {{arguments}} from insurance carriers regarding the sale, or transfer of ownership of policies in courts around the nation (circa 2010) by insureds that have sold their policies to investors. The courts have overwhelmingly found {{in favor of the}} insureds, finding that <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> existed at the time the policy was issued, and there for the right to sell or transfer the policy after issuance was the choice of the insured enjoyed by any asset holder. Many life insurance carriers have tried, and generally unsuccessfully, to challenge these sales based on <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> or by trying to prove that the insured [...] "intended" [...] to sell the policy. The courts have found that [...] "intent" [...] is irrelevant, when <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> exists at policy issuance.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} {{of the concept of}} <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> as a prerequisite for the purchase of insurance distanced the insurance business from gambling, thereby enhancing the industry's reputation and leading to greater acceptance of the insurance industry. The United Kingdom was a leader in that trend by passing legislation that prohibited insurance contracts if no <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> could be proven, notably the Life Assurance Act 1774 which renders such life insurance contracts illegal, and the Marine Insurance Act 1906, s.4 which renders such contracts void.|$|E
50|$|If {{the insured}} {{does not have}} an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> in the object, the {{contract}} will be void and unenforceable, and regarded essentially as a gamble or wager. The purpose of the requirement of <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> is to distinguish insurance from wagering. The basic principle of insurance is to protect against loss; it is not concerned with the creation of opportunities for speculative gain. In the formative days of insurance law, things were quite different; insurance was in fact often indistinguishable from gambling. Excesses led in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries to the outright banning of life insurance, for example, in France, the Dutch Republic and Sweden. The more reasonable course, requiring an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> as a prerequisite for the purchase of insurance, was pioneered in England, making insurance more than a mere game of chance, improving the repute of the insurance industry (formerly frowned upon as an aleatory contract), and gaining wider acceptance for it. As we have seen, South Africa formally imported the doctrine of <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> from England, but in 1977 the legislature repealed the colonial ordinances which had achieved this. The Appellate Division, in Mutual and Federal v Oudtshoorn Municipality, took their repeal to mean that the Roman-Dutch law of insurance is now the common law for insurance.|$|E
50|$|STOLI {{became so}} popular that many {{producers}} and insurers confused it with legitimate life settlements, which are transacted on properly originated policies with valid <b>insurable</b> <b>interest</b> at issue.|$|E
50|$|Whether or not an {{indirect}} economic interest is enough to constitute an <b>insurable</b> <b>interest,</b> {{as opposed to a}} mere wager, will depend on the facts of each case.|$|E
