25|$|The Council of London in 1102 in 1102, {{called at}} the urging of Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, {{explicitly}} denounced homosexual behavior as a sin {{for the first time at}} an English council. Anselm felt that sodomy was widespread and was not condemned strongly enough or regarded with the seriousness that it should have. Confessors were urged to take account of such ignorance when hearing confessions for sodomy, and to take into account mitigating factors such as age and marital status before prescribing penance; and counselling was generally preferred to punishment. In Canons 28 and 29 the Council decreed that the people should be informed of the gravity of the sin, and their obligation to confess (particularly if they derived pleasure from it). Nevertheless, Anselm <b>deferred</b> <b>publication</b> of the proceedings, arguing further time was needed to clarify certain matters. Boswell argues the decrees were never published at all.|$|E

50|$|Noguchi {{had in fact}} {{already written}} the sequel, The American Letters of a Japanese Parlor-Maid, {{at the time of}} the American Diary 's publication, but Stokes, citing lackluster sales, {{declined}} to publish the sequel, thus obliging Noguchi to <b>defer</b> <b>publication</b> until his return to Japan in 1904. There, Tokyo publisher Fuzanbo issued a new edition of The American Diary of a Japanese Girl (this time under Noguchi's own name, with an appendix documenting the book's history) as well as The American Letters of a Japanese Parlor-Maid (1905), published with a preface by Tsubouchi Shoyo. Another publisher issued Noguchi's Japanese translation of The American Diary of a Japanese Girl under the title 邦文日本少女の米國日記 in 1905. In 1912, Fuzanbo published a new edition of The American Diary with a fold-out illustration (kuchi-e) by ukiyoe artist Eiho Hirezaki, which was also sold under the imprint of London publisher and bookseller Elkin Mathews. In 2007, The American Diary of a Japanese Girl was reissued in an annotated edition by Temple University Press.|$|R
5|$|As the {{publication}} date neared, difficulties arose. In January 1869, Dallas asked Trollope {{for permission to}} <b>defer</b> serial <b>publication</b> by three months. As Trollope had agreed not to allow another of his novels to run serially {{during the first six}} months of The Vicars career, the editor's request would have diminished the author's income. Trollope initially refused, but subsequently agreed to a delay of two months, with publication to begin in early July.|$|R

Then Secretary of War William Howard Taft decided to <b>defer</b> its <b>publication</b> for fear of antagonizing both Americans and Filipinos. In 1909 a second {{attempt was made to}} publish the volumes when President Taft's former secretary James A. LeRoy wrote a scathing critique objecting to its publication. The Bureau of Insular Affairs then abandoned the project. It was subsequently published in the Philippines in 1968 by the Eugenio Lopez Foundation.|$|R
40|$|The {{observation}} that testicle extract markedly enhances the infectivity of certain viruses and bacteria, reported {{by one of}} us (Duran-Reynals (1)) has been confirmed and extended {{by a number of}} investigators (2). It has been further shown that testicle extract exerts an inhibitory influence on the growth of a transplantable epithelioma of the rabbit (3) and to a less extent on a sarcoma of the mouse (4). It is of interest to know what effect testicle extracts will have on the chicken neoplasms, transmissible by cell-free extracts. Recently Hoffman, Parker and Walker (5) have published the results of a similar investigation in which they report evidence of the enhancement of the chicken tumor agent by rabbit testicle extract, but none by that from rooster testicle. This evidence is based on two positive experiments, but the same testicle extract was used in both tests. They draw no conclusions as {{to the nature of the}} tumor agent from these results, but give the impression that further investigation with the method might lead to some conclusions on the question. During the last 3 or 4 years a considerable amount of data had been accumulated in this laboratory, but had not been published at the time the article referred to appeared. Since our results dif- " fered from those reported by the above authors, we <b>deferred</b> <b>publication</b> until additional tests could be made with certain minor modifications in technique suggested by their paper. * This investigation was carried out by means of the Rutherford Donation...|$|E

50|$|He was {{a generous}} patron of men of letters. When Dryden was {{dismissed}} from the laureateship, he {{made him an}} equivalent pension from his own purse. Matthew Prior, in dedicating his Poems on Several Occasions (1709) to Dorset's son, affirms that his opinion was consulted by Edmund Waller; that the Duke of Buckingham <b>deferred</b> the <b>publication</b> of his Rehearsal until he was assured that Dorset would not rehearse upon him again; and that Samuel Butler and Wycherley both owed their first recognition to him. Prior's praise of Dorset is no doubt extravagant, but when his youthful follies were over {{he appears to have}} developed sterling qualities, and although the poems he has left are very few, none of them are devoid of merit. Dryden's Essay on Satire and the dedication of the Essay of Dramatick Poesie are addressed to him. Walpole (Catalogue of Noble Authors, iv.) says that he had as much wit as his first master, or his contemporaries Buckingham and Rochester, without the royal want of feeling, the duke's want of principles or the earl's want of thought; and Congreve reported of him when he was dying that he slabbered more wit than other people had in their best health.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The primary {{rationale}} o f the Early Indian Petroglyphs Project is {{to investigate}} {{claims of the}} occurrence of Lower Palaeolithic petroglyphs in central regions o f India. Other purposes of this multi facetted research project are to provide new data for the chronology of the Middle and Late Pleistocene hominin history of India; to introduce scientific methods of rock art dating in this country; and to investigate its Lower Palaeolithic stone tool industries. This project, a collaboration of Indian and Australian researchers, was commenced in 2001. It involves archaeological excavations, a range of analytical studies and intensive field surveys, and it will continue for several more years. Since its findings are of considerable significance {{it would not be}} appropriate to <b>defer</b> the <b>publication</b> of all details until after its completion. The present paper is a detailed progress report o f this work, offering an overview of its theoretical base and presenting its first tangible results. They indicate that Lower Palaeolithic petroglyphs have been located at two sites, and may exist at a few others not yet adequately investigated. These initial results also provide the first datings of Indian rock art, secured from many sites o f petroglyphs and pictograms in various parts o f central India...|$|R

40|$|The data {{analysis}} from the TGRS experiment is continuing, although the UC Berkeley PI, K. Hurley, {{is no longer}} funded for this effort. This experiment has been returning data on the energy spectra and time histories of cosmic gamma-ray bursts since November 1994, and continues to operate in good health. Over a 3 year period ending in November 1997, 41 bursts have been detected simultaneously by TGRS and Dr. Hurley's Ulysses gamma-ray burst experiment. By comparing the times of arrival of a burst at Ulysses and TGRS, we can obtain an annulus of arrival directions for the event. Typical 3 sigma annulus widths range from several arcminutes to tens of arcminutes. Because the WIND spacecraft {{is as far as}} several light-seconds from Earth, it is sometimes possible to obtain a second annulus using the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) aboard the GRO spacecraft. 23 of the 41 bursts were also observed by this experiment. Generally, the two annuli intersect at grazing incidence, leading to a long, narrow error box which reduces somewhat the error circles obtained from BATSE alone. Table 1 summarizes the burst data from TGRS. We plan to <b>defer</b> the <b>publication</b> of these locations until a larger number of events has been accumulated. Measuring the energy spectra of cosmic gamma-ray bursts to search for line emission is one of the prime objectives of this experiment. However, an intense gamma-ray burst is required, or the statistics become too weak to draw meaningful conclusions. One such event has occurred to date, on August 22, 1995, and we have examined it in detail. The spectrum shows no evidence for lines, however...|$|R

6000|$|The {{publication}} of Hints from Horace had been entrusted by Dallas to Cawthorn in July-August, 1811. It may be gathered {{from various sources}} (Letters, 1898, ii. 24, 54, 56) that Byron was {{at work on the}} proofs as late as September 4; that by October 11 he had resolved to <b>defer</b> the <b>publication</b> of the Hints; and that, accordingly on October 13, 1811, [...] "they stood still." [...] It was not, however, till after the appearance of Childe Harold's, etc. (May-June, 1812) that Byron determined to suppress the already printed Fifth Edition of English Bards, {{and at the same time}} to abandon the {{publication of}} his two other Satires. At this time, says Dallas (Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron, 1898, p. 241), [...] "the Hints from Horace was far advanced." [...] In his Recollections, etc. (pp. 104-113), he gives, by way of a [...] "fair specimen," [...] 156 [...] "lines of the still-unpublished poem; and, as these extracts are taken from the first 211 lines, and his text corresponds with proof B (see Poetical Works, 1898, i. 390, variants ii., iii.), it may be inferred that Dallas transcribed them from his fragmentary proof-sheets, and that the press was stopped at line 272. In 1830, in his Notices of the Life of Lord Byron (vol. i. pp. 263-269), Moore printed 165 lines of the [...] "Paraphrase;" [...] but his selections are drawn from lines 1-458, and it is evident that he had access to an original MS. (MS. M.), which is now in Mr. Murray's possession. The full text, which follows the same MS., was first published in vol. v. pp. 273-327 of the six-volume edition of 1831 (vide ante, No. xliii. of [...] "Collected Editions").|$|R
6000|$|And whence has the Barrister learnt {{that the}} Epistles are not equally binding on Christians as the four Gospels? Surely, of St. Paul's at least, the {{authenticity}} is incomparably clearer {{than that of}} the first three Gospels; and if he give up, as doubtless he does, the plenary inspiration of the Gospels, the personal authority of the writers of all the Epistles is greater than two at least of the four Evangelists. Secondly, the Gospel of John and all the Epistles were purposely written to teach the Christian Faith; whereas the first three Gospels are as evidently intended only as 'memorabilia' {{of the history of the}} Christian Revelation, as far as the process of Redemption was carried on in the life, death, and resurrection of the divine Founder. This is the blank, brazen, blushless, or only brass-blushing, impudence of an Old Bailey Barrister, attempting to browbeat out of Court the better and more authentic half of the witnesses against him. If I wished to understand the laws of England, shall I consult Hume or Blackstone--him who has written his volumes expressly as comments on those laws, or the historian who mentions them only as far as the laws were connected with the events and characters which he relates or describes? Nay, it is far worse than this; far Christ himself repeatedly <b>defers</b> the <b>publication</b> of his doctrines till after his death, and gives the reason too, that till he had sent the Holy Ghost, his disciples were not capable of comprehending them. Does he not attribute to an immediate influence of especial inspiration even Peter's acknowledgment of his Filiation to God, or Messiahship?--Was it from the Gospels that Paul learned to know Christ?--Was the Church sixty years without the awful truths taught exclusively in John's Gospel? ...|$|R
40|$|The Myers-Pospelov (MP) {{model is}} an {{effective}} field theory (EFT), including dimension five operators, which describes the phenomenology of active Lorentz invariance violation produced by a preferred reference frame. We concentrate here {{in the case of}} the modified electrodynamics. The point of view taken in this work is that the Lorentz violating part of the action in the MP model, which includes higher order time derivative (HOTD) operators, is to be considered as a perturbation over the dynamics described by standard Electrodynamics, particularly in the quantum case. HOTD theories, besides incorporating additional degrees of freedom, suffer from well known difficulties in their quantization, among which one finds Hamiltonians which are not bounded from below. Thus, in order to cope with these challenges it will be necessary to deal with a modified perturbation theory which is well described in the literature. We apply such methods to this specific model providing a quantization of the free sector of the theory by identifying the modified normal mode expansions of the fields together with the modified propagators and the interaction terms. The calculation of interacting processes, together with radiative corrections, is beyond the scope of the present article and will be <b>deferred</b> for future <b>publications...</b>|$|R
