40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to provide an {{overview}} of recent developments in the fields of small-scale and multiscale relief mapping. <b>Hypsometric</b> <b>tinting,</b> relief shading, continuous color shading, plan oblique relief and other techniques are widely used for maps covering large territories at small scales. The main difference between these techniques and large-scale terrain cartography is that the representations become highly abstract at the observational scale and thus require a high level of generalization. At very small scales, the terrain is stylized to convey distinctive geographic and morphological features. The positional accuracy of valleys and mountain chains becomes less important, and terrain features are depicted as abstracted symbols at the smallest scales. Thus, two main topics are of interest in this chapter: the automation of representation techniques and the generalization of digital elevation models. We focus on both small-scale and multi-scale mapping, which are interrelated because related generalization techniques are specific to the representation techniques. The following sections first discuss general requirements for digital terrain generalization at small scales, then discuss terrain visualization with (a) traditional relief shading and plan oblique relief, (b) continuous color shading and (c) <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tinting...</b>|$|R
40|$|In terrain mapping, {{there are}} so many ways to measure and {{estimate}} the terrain measurements like contouring, vertical profiling, hill shading, <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tinting,</b> perspective view, etc. Here in this paper we are using the contouring techniques to generate the contours for the different digital elevation data like DEM, HGT, IMG etc. The elevation data is captured in dem, hgt and img formats of the same projected area and the contour is generated using the existing techniques and applications. The exact differences, errors of elevation (contour) intervals, slopes and heights are analyzed and recovered. Comment: 07 Pages, 10 Figure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method for <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tinting</b> for small-scale maps. The method generalises digital elevation models by removing small unnecessary details and accentuating major valleys and ridgelines. The elevation data are filtered with lower and upper quartile filters that are combined using a drainage network. The lower quartile filter is applied in valleys, delimited by the drainage network, the upper quartile filter is used elsewhere. The level of generalisation is adjusted by simplifying the drainage network with an algorithm that removes the shortest streams. The resulting hypsometric layers match the quality standards of manually generalised reference layers and {{are appropriate for}} small-scale mapping...|$|R

50|$|<b>Hypsometric</b> <b>tints</b> are colors used to {{indicate}} elevation, usually together with contour lines. They {{can be used}} to depict ranges of elevation as bands of color, usually in a graduated scheme, or as a color ramp applied to contour lines themselves. A typical scheme progresses from dark greens for lower elevations up through yellows/browns, and on to grays and white at the highest elevations. Hypsometric tinting of maps and globes is often accompanied by a similar method of bathymetric tinting to convey depth of oceans; lighter shades of blue represent shallower water such as the continental shelf and darker shades deeper regions.|$|E
50|$|Of course, to {{determine}} differences in elevation between two points, the contour interval, or distance in altitude between two adjacent contour lines, must be known, {{and this is}} normally stated in the map key. Usually contour intervals are consistent throughout a map, but there are exceptions. Sometimes intermediate contours are present in flatter areas; these can be dashed or dotted lines at half the noted contour interval. When contours are used with <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tints</b> on a small-scale map that includes mountains and flatter low-lying areas, {{it is common to}} have smaller intervals at lower elevations so that detail is shown in all areas. Conversely, for an island which consists of a plateau surrounded by steep cliffs, it is possible to use smaller intervals as the height increases.|$|E
50|$|His father John Bartholomew Senior {{started a}} cartographical {{establishment}} in Edinburgh,Scotland {{and he was}} educated in the work. He was subsequently assistant to the German geographer August Petermann, until in 1856 he took up the management of his father's firm. For this establishment, {{now known as the}} Edinburgh Geographical Institute, Bartholomew built up a reputation unsurpassed in Great Britain for the production of the finest cartographical work. Bartholomew was an in-house cartographer for George Philip.Bartholomew is best known for the development of colour contouring (or <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tints),</b> the system of representing altitudes on a graduated colour scale, with areas of high altitude in shades of brown and areas of low altitude in shades of green. He first showcased his colour contouring system at the Paris Exhibition of 1878; although it initially met with skepticism, it went on to become standard cartographical practice.|$|E
50|$|In 1842 Alexander Keith Johnston (1804-1871) visited Gotha {{to discuss}} several {{projects}} with Perthes. These negotiation first {{resulted in the}} publication of the National Atlas of General Geography, which contained 4 maps by Berghaus. Though Berghaus deemed the commercial and scientific climate in England not ready for scientific maps Johnston persisted in wanting to publish a translation of the Physikalischer Atlas, on which he requested aid from Berghaus. With a letter of recommendation by von Humboldt in October 1844 Heinrich ‘Henry’ Lange joined Johnston in Edinburgh for this purpose. Petermann stayed behind in Gotha and became teacher in the 2nd course of Berghaus’ school. In April 1845 he followed Lange, who received him in his house in Edinburgh and acquainted him with the friends he had made. Together they made a tour through the Grampians, applying what they had learned by using barometers for height measurements and taking geological and botanical samples. Meanwhile, they also worked on the Johnston’s Physical atlas (Physical geography, illustrating in a series of original designs, the elementary facts of geology, hydrology, meteorology and natural history etc.) and several other cartographic publications.During his time in Edinburgh he may have come into contact with the publisher G.H. Swanston, for whom he constructed several maps for The Royal Illustrated Atlas, Of Modern Geography, 1st edition published in 27 parts 1854-62. and republished probably in 1872. He also may have met in Edinburgh with John Bartholomew Jr. (1831-1893), who created many maps in the same atlas. John Bartholomew became Petermann’s student in Gotha from 1855 till he was recalled to his father’s firm in 1856. The German school of cartography was pre-eminent, and four generations of Bartholomews widened their knowledge by studying with the German masters. John George’s son Ian studied in Leipzig (1907-8) with Oswald Winkel. His grandson John Christopher carried on the tradition, studying with Eduard Imhof, the great Swiss cartographer, in Berne and Zurich in 1960, and his son John Eric followed in 1977 with Imhof’s pupil, Ernst Spiess."Bartholomew is best known for the development of colour contouring (or <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tints),</b> the system of representing altitudes on a graduated colour scale, with areas of high altitude in shades of brown and areas of low altitude in shades of green. He first showcased his colour contouring system at the Paris Exhibition of 1878; although it initially met with skepticism, it went on to become standard cartographical practice". However, he might have picked up this idea during his time in Gotha as the colour scheme was first introduced by Emil von Sydow (1812-1873) in 1838 when he developed a color methodology for landscape features using hachures, where green was depicted for lowlands and brown used for highlands. The white for the higher reaches might later have been used by Hermann Haack (1872-1966) for his Perthes’ wall maps.Several maps have been co-constructions of Petermann and Bartholomew.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hypsometric</b> <b>tints</b> {{have been}} a favored mapping {{technique}} for over 150 years. By the mid-twentieth century, <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tints</b> {{based on the work}} of JohnBartholomew, Jr., Eduard Imhof, and Karl Peucker became the de facto standardfor physical reference maps at small scales. More recently, the role and design ofhypsometric tints have come under scrutiny. One reason for this is the concern thatpeople misread elevation colors as climate or vegetation information. Cross-blendedhypsometric tints, introduced in 2009, are a partial solution to this problem. Theyuse variable lowland colors customized to match the differing natural environmentsof world regions, which merge into one another. In the short time since theirintroduction, cross-blended <b>hypsometric</b> <b>tints</b> have proved to be a popular choiceamong professional mapmakers. Most maps made with cross-blended hypsometrictints also contain shaded relief (terrain represented with modulated light andshadows) ...|$|E
