[...] However, Becky Bain of Idolator thought the [...] "pulsating dance song" [...] was underwhelming. [...] "We have to admit, we’re not bowled over by this one, which pretty much follows a standard, predictable dance-pop formula from the double shout-out at the start to the 'woosh'ing fade-out finish". However Bain also pointed out that current trends on the US Billboard Hot 100 were unpredictable, [...] "then again, since when has the Hot 100 shyed away from generic pop tunes we’ve heard over and over again?

It was sold exclusively online {{and had a}} [...] "not commercial" [...] sound, hence she did not consider it as an [...] "official" [...] follow-up to Believe. The singer began work on her twenty-fourth studio album in 2000. She began giving hints of the album at the time, calling it [...] "son of Believe" [...] because [...] "that's how I differentiate it in my mind", and elaborated that [...] "If you liked Believe, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> the new one, because the new one is so much fun", calling it [...] "so terrific".

In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News, [...] "I can understand why people would make that association, but my performance is really not a statement about eating disorders themselves." [...] Gaga confessed on Today, [...] "Millie and I know that not everybody's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> that performance, but we both really believe in artistic expression and strong identities, and I support her and what she does. Artpop, my new album, is about bringing art and music together in the spirit of creative rebellion, and for us, that performance was art in its purest form." ...|$|E
500|$|Nicole is Roman Harris' (Conrad Coleby) {{daughter}} {{and she was}} often mentioned on-screen before producers decided to introduce her into the serial.

Speaking of working on the serial James stated: [...] "Working on a series like this [...] is the best training you can get, I look at it like an apprenticeship and never forget how lucky I am."

[...] "Amor Gitano" [...] is completely dominated by flamenco guitars which is interlaced with alternating vocals. With {{what has been}} described as a [...] "thrilling blend of the stars" [...] by James P.

[...] Critic John Alfred Avant recognized that the volume would be popular due to the success of Caged Bird, but he characterized it as [...] "rather well done schlock poetry, {{not to be confused with}} poetry for people who read poetry" [...] and stated, [...] "This collection isn't accomplished, not by any means; but some readers are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> it." [...] Martha Liddy, who reviewed the collection in the same issue of the Library Journal in 1971, classified it, like Caged Bird, in the young adult category and called Diiie a [...] "volume of marvelously lyrical, rhythmical poems". [...] Kirkus Review also found the poems in the volume unsophisticated yet sensitive to the spoken aspects of poetry, such as rhythm and diction, and considered her prose more poetic and unrestrained than her poetry.|$|E

He addressed the inspiration behind Voodoo, saying [...] "It was a love for the dead state of black music, a love to show our idols how much they taught us [...] I hope you enjoy it. Just have an open mind to new shit. Just give us that." [...] Questlove discussed his expectations of a reaction from music listeners to the concept, saying in an interview for Entertainment Weekly upon the album's release, [...] "We knew this album would be a hard pill to swallow. People may want D to play into their R love-god fantasies—wearing Armani suits, singing something sweet in your ear—but he made {{a conscious effort to}} shake people up, to take a chance.

Rich Lopez of the Dallas Voice cited the song as {{being one of the}} [...] "better" [...] songs of Love? and was surprised it had [...] "yet to be released as a single". Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly complimented the potential of the song by stating that it is [...] "sure to fit right into club DJ mixes and get people dancing"; however, he criticized that Gaga was [...] "all over the song ... as if Lopez went into the booth trying to emulate her delivery." [...] Emily Exton of Popdust agreed, adding that [...] "you'd be silly not to think" [...] that the song's chorus will become a dance-floor chant among [...] "slightly intoxicated females (and males) in bars across America this summer". She additionally wrote that it was [...] "impossible to get [...] out of your head after more than one listen" [...] although becoming [...] "increasingly monotonous over nearly three and half minutes" [...] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey roughly expanded on this view, stating that [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is not anything [...] "we haven't heard before," [...] although elaborating that it is worthy of a standalone release.|$|E

[...] "It's not something I changed purposefully", Spears said of the album's sound and added: [...] "It's just something that kind of changed on itself with me being older.
