40|$|Numerous studies {{reported}} a strong link between working memory capacity (WMC) and fluid intelligence (Gf), although views differ {{in respect to}} how close these two constructs are related to each other. In the present study, we used a WMC task with five levels of task demands to assess the relationship between WMC and Gf {{by means of a}} new methodological approach referred to as <b>fixed-links</b> modeling. <b>Fixed-links</b> models belong to the family of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and are of particular interest for experimental, repeated-measures designs. With this technique, processes systematically varying across task conditions can be disentangled from processes unaffected by the experimental manipulation. Proceeding from the assumption that experimental manipulation in a WMC task leads to increasing demands on WMC, the processes systematically varying across task conditions can be assumed to be WMC-specific. Processes not varying across task conditions, on the other hand, are probably independent of WMC. <b>Fixed-links</b> models allow for representing these two kinds of processes by two independent latent variables. In contrast to traditional CFA where a common latent variable is derived from the different task conditions, <b>fixed-links</b> models facilitate a more precise or purified representation of the WMC-related processes of interest. By using <b>fixed-links</b> modeling to analyze data of 200 participants, we identified a non-experimental latent variable, representing processes that remained constant irrespective of the WMC task conditions, and an experimental latent variable which reflected processes that varied as a function of experimental manipulation. This latter variable represents the increasing demands on WMC and, hence, was considered a purified measure of WMC controlled for the constant processes. <b>Fixed-links</b> modeling showed that both the purified measure of WMC (β =. 48) as well as the constant processes involved in the task (β =. 45) were related to Gf. Taken together, these two latent variables explained the same portion of variance of Gf as a single latent variable obtained by traditional CFA (β =. 65) indicating that traditional CFA causes an overestimation of the effective relationship between WMC and Gf. Thus, <b>fixed-links</b> modeling provides a feasible method for a more valid investigation of the functional relationship between specific constructs...|$|R
40|$|The {{position}} effect describes {{the influence of}} just-completed items in a psychological scale on subsequent items. This effect has been repeatedly reported for psychometric reasoning scales and is assumed to reflect implicit learning during testing. One way to identify the {{position effect}} is <b>fixed-links</b> modeling. With this approach, two latent variables are derived from the test items. Factor loadings of one latent variable are fixed to 1 for all items to represent ability-related variance. Factor loadings on the second latent variable increase from the first to the last item describing the position effect. Previous studies using <b>fixed-links</b> modeling on the position effect investigated reasoning scales constructed in accordance with classical test theory (e. g., Raven’s Progressive Matrices) but, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, no Rasch-scaled tests. These tests, however, meet stronger requirements on item homogeneity. In the present study, therefore, we will analyze data from 239 participants who have completed the Rasch-scaled Viennese Matrices Test (VMT). Applying a <b>fixed-links</b> modeling approach, we will test whether a position effect can be depicted as a latent variable and separated from a latent variable representing basic reasoning ability. The results have implications for the assumption of homogeneity in Rasch-homogeneous tests...|$|R
40|$|When {{observers}} {{are presented with}} two visual targets appearing {{in the same position}} in close temporal proximity, a marked reduction in detection performance of the second target has often been reported, the so-called attentional blink phenomenon. Several studies found a similar decrement of P 300 amplitudes during the attentional blink period as observed with detection performances of the second target. However, whether the parallel courses of second target performances and corresponding P 300 amplitudes resulted from the same underlying mechanisms remained unclear. The aim of our study was therefore to investigate whether the mechanisms underlying the AB can be assessed by <b>fixed-links</b> modeling and whether this kind of assessment would reveal the same or at least related processes in the behavioral and electrophysiological data. On both levels of observation three highly similar processes could be identified: an increasing, a decreasing and a u-shaped trend. Corresponding processes from the behavioral and electrophysiological data were substantially correlated, with the two u-shaped trends showing the strongest association with each other. Our results provide evidence for the assumption that the same mechanisms underlie attentional blink task performance at the electrophysiological and behavioral levels as assessed by <b>fixed-links</b> models...|$|R

40|$|By {{means of}} <b>fixed-links</b> {{modeling}} {{the present study}} assessed processes involved in visual short-term memory functioning and investigates how these processes are related to intelligence. Using a color change detection task, short-term memory demands increased across three experimental conditions {{as a function of}} number of presented stimuli. We measured amount of information retained in visual short-term memory by hit rate as well as speed of visual short-term memory scanning by reaction time. For both measures, <b>fixed-links</b> modeling revealed a constant process reflecting processes irrespective of task manipulation as well as two increasing processes reflecting the increasing short-term memory demands. For visual short-term memory scanning, a negative association between intelligence and the constant process was found but no relationship between intelligence and the increasing processes. Thus, basic processing speed, rather than speed influenced by visual short-term memory demands, differentiates between high- and low-intelligent individuals. Intelligence was positively related to the experimental processes of shortterm memory retention but not to the constant process. In sum, significant associations with intelligence were only obtained when the specific processes of short-term memory were decomposed emphasizing the importance of a thorough assessment of cognitive processes when investigating their relation to intelligence...|$|R
40|$|The attentional blink (AB) is a {{fundamental}} limitation {{of the ability to}} select relevant information from irrelevant information. It can be observed with the detection rate in an AB task {{as well as with the}} corresponding P 300 amplitude of the event-related potential. In previous research, however, correlations between these two levels of observation were weak and rather inconsistent. A possible explanation of this finding might be that multiple processes underlie the AB and, thus, obscure a possible relationship between AB-related detection rate and the corresponding P 300 amplitude. The present study investigated this assumption by applying a <b>fixed-links</b> modeling approach to represent behavioral individual differences in the AB as a latent variable. Concurrently, this approach enabled us to control for additional sources of variance in AB performance by deriving two additional latent variables. The correlation between the latent variable reflecting behavioral individual differences in AB magnitude and a corresponding latent variable derived from the P 300 amplitude was high (r=. 70). Furthermore, this correlation was considerably stronger than the correlations of other behavioral measures of the AB magnitude with their psychophysiological counterparts (all rs<. 40). Our findings clearly indicate that the systematic disentangling of various sources of variance by utilizing the <b>fixed-links</b> modeling approach is a promising tool to investigate behavioral individual differences in the AB and possible psychophysiological correlates of these individual differences...|$|R

The first instruction required mainly perceptual processes, whereas the second involved mostly memory processes. Using a model with fixed links between manifest and latent variables, and a step-wise procedure to determine parameters, enabled us to study the influences these processes have on intelligence individually. The results of our study show a much stronger influence of memory processes than of perceptual processes.

40|$|Microwave fixed links play a {{vital role}} {{supporting}} infrastructure requirements in telecommunications. As the demand for their use increases, particularly in providing backhaul for mobile networks, {{it is important that the}} microwave spectrum is exploited efficiently. This paper investigates the use of equipment selection algorithms within the microwave <b>fixed-links</b> frequency assignment problem. Standard data-rates are often supported by two alternative radio system types; one utilising a relatively lower-order modulation scheme and the other using relatively higher-order modulation. The higher-order modulation radios use less bandwidth to achieve the same data rate, but at the expense of higher wanted signal levels and lower interference thresholds. Hence while higher-order modulation is the more spectrally efficient option for an individual link considered in isolation, it may not be the most efficient when the wider network is taken into account. In this paper we provide a new model for the fixed link frequency assignment problem with equipment selection, formulated as an integer program, and investigate the nature of the trade-off between local and global spectral efficiency on a range of representative data...|$|R
40|$|Many studies {{obtained}} reliable {{individual differences}} in speed of information processing (SIP) as measured by elementary cognitive tasks (ECTs). ECTs usually employ response times (RT) as measure of SIP, but different ECTs target different cognitive processes (e. g., simple or choice reaction, inhibition). Here we used modified versions of the Hick and the Eriksen Flanker task to examine whether these tasks assess dissociable or common aspects of SIP. In both tasks, task complexity was systematically varied across three levels. RT {{data were collected from}} 135 participants. Applying <b>fixed-links</b> modeling, RT variance increasing with task complexity was separated from RT variance unchanging across conditions. For each task, these aspects of variance were represented by two independent latent variables. The two latent variables representing RT variance not varying with complexity of the two tasks were virtually identical (r =. 83). The latent variables representing increasing complexity in the two tasks were also highly correlated (r =. 72) but clearly dissociable. Thus, RT measures contain both task-unspecific, person-related aspects of SIP as well as task-specific aspects indicating the cognitive processes manipulated with the respective task.

40|$|The attentional blink {{phenomenon}} (AB) represents impaired {{identification of}} the second of two targets presented in rapid succession within a stream of stimuli. Despite the well-known association between attentional processes and psychometric intelligence (PI), evidence for a relationship between AB and PI is highly inconsistent. Theory and empirical findings suggest AB to be multifaceted. Hence, relations between AB and PI may be blurred when AB is measured as a single process. Furthermore, different aspects of PI might be differentially related to AB. The present study explored the relationship between processes underlying AB and general PI as well as specific aspects of PI (Reasoning, Speed, Memory, and Creativity) in 201 female students. <b>Fixed-links</b> modeling revealed three processes underlying AB: (1) a U-shaped process positively related to Speed and negatively related to Memory but unrelated to Reasoning, Creativity, and general PI, (2) an increasing process positively related to Reasoning, Speed, Memory, and general PI but not to Creativity, and (3) a decreasing process positively related to general PI and Memory but not to other aspects of PI.

We conducted an experiment where the participants were presented with a color change detection task. Task complexity was manipulated through varying the number of presented stimuli (set size). We collected hit rate and reaction time (RT) as indicators {{for the amount of}} information retained in VSTM and speed of VSTM scanning, respectively. Due to the impurity of these measures, however, the variability in hit rate and RT was assumed to consist not only of genuine variance due to individual differences in VSTM retention and VSTM scanning but also of other, non-experimental portions of variance. Therefore, we identified two qualitatively different types of components for both hit rate and RT: (1) non-experimental components representing processes that remained constant irrespective of set size and (2) experimental components reflecting processes that increased as a function of set size. For RT, intelligence was negatively associated with the non-experimental components, but was unrelated to the experimental components assumed to represent variability in VSTM scanning speed. This finding indicates that individual differences in basic processing speed, rather than in speed of VSTM scanning, differentiates between high- and low-intelligent individuals. For hit rate, the experimental component constituting individual differences in VSTM retention was positively related to intelligence. The non-experimental components of hit rate, representing variability in basal processes, however, were not associated with intelligence.

The stimulus-locked parietal P 3 amplitude has been shown to reflect stimulus salience but also attentional control available for stimulus processing. Known stimuli requiring truthful responses (targets) and known stimuli requiring deceptive responses (probes) were hypothesized to be more salient than unknown stimuli. Thus, a larger P 3 was predicted for known truthful and deceptive stimuli than for unknown stimuli. The Medial Frontal Negativity (MFN) represents the amount of required cognitive control and was expected to be more negative to known truthful and deceptive stimuli than to unknown stimuli. Moreover, we expected higher sensitivity to injustice (SI-perpetrator) and aversiveness (Trait-BIS) to result in more intense neural processes during deception. N = 102 participants performed a deception task with three picture types: probes requiring deceptive responses, targets requiring truthful responses to known stimuli, and irrelevants being associated with truthful responses to unknown stimuli. Repeated measures ANOVA and <b>fixed-links</b> modeling suggested a more positive parietal P 3 and a more negative frontal MFN to deceptive vs. irrelevant stimuli. Trait-BIS and SI-perpetrator predicted an increase of the P 3 and a decrease of the MFN from irrelevants to probes. This suggested an intensification of stimulus salience and cognitive control across picture types in individuals scoring either higher on Trait-BIS or higher on SI-perpetrator. In contrast, individuals with both higher Trait-BIS and higher SI-perpetrator scores showed a less negative probe-MFN suggesting that this subgroup invests less cognitive control to probes.
