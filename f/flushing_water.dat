40|$|This {{report is}} in {{response}} to the request to provide a recommendation for the prevention of possible microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) for the RHLWE (Replacement High-Level Waste Evaporator) <b>flush</b> <b>water</b> (FW) system. The recent occurrences of MIC at DWPF prompted HLWE to evaluate the possibility of MIC occurring in this 304 L stainless steel RHLWE <b>flush</b> <b>water</b> system. Concern was heightened {{by the fact that the}} well water used and the other conditions at H-Tank Farm are similar to those at DWPF. However, only one known leak has occurred in the existing 304 L evaporator <b>flush</b> <b>water</b> systems in either tank farm (in 1 H system), and no MIC Corrosion has been confirmed in the tank farm area. The design of the RHLWE <b>flush</b> <b>water</b> system (completed long before the occurrence of MIC at DWPF) was modeled after the existing evaporator <b>flush</b> <b>water</b> systems and did not specifically include MIC prevention considerations. Therefore, MIC prevention was not specifically considered during the design phase of this <b>flush</b> <b>water</b> system. The system is presently being installed. After an extensive evaluation, a task team concluded that the best biocide to prevent the occurrence of MIC would be NaOH at fairly low concentration.

40|$|Domestic {{water closet}} (WC) {{flushing}} consumes {{a considerable amount}} of the total water supply in a typical apartment; however, {{there is a lack of}} concern about the consumption of <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> due to occupant load patterns in cities having a high population density, e. g. Hong Kong. Indeed, <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> consumption is of primary importance in designing a plumbing and drainage system for buildings. This paper proposes a mathematical model of <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> consumption for residential developments. Density functions of the model parameters, including the installed cistern capacity and usage patterns of water closets, occupant load and its diurnal variations, were determined from a recent survey for water consumption in some residential buildings in Hong Kong. In particular, numerical values of the parameters were sampled from the density functions using the Monte Carlo technique in order to determine the probable <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> consumption for a residential development. The model accuracy was verified by the measured <b>flushing</b> <b>water</b> consumption in a residential building.

The model parameters were identified from a recent survey on the water closet (WC) usage patterns of 14 high-rise residential buildings. The occupant load factor, diurnal variation of flushing, discharge and refilling durations and volume of the WC cistern recorded from 597 households were used to determine the uncertainties of consumption and flow rates, and hence the risk of overloading a plant.

40|$|Abstract Background Cultural {{heritage}} {{objects are}} subject to the deposition of a multitude of airborne pollutants even when kept inside museums, archives, historical buildings or showcases. Some of the pollutants are quickly deposited onto any available surface, including the interior walls and CH objects themselves. This might make the compounds seem absent from analyses of indoor air samples. Context and purpose of the study A new method of detecting water soluble pollutants without taking samples from the interior walls or from the CH objects themselves has been developed. The method involves sampling the pollutants accumulated on a surface near the CH object, e. g. a nearby wall or an interior glass surface of a showcase. The samples were obtained by gently flushing the surface with deionised water to collect the ions readily removed from the surface. The method was tested on a variety of surfaces. Results and main findings The <b>flushed</b> <b>water</b> were analysed with IC (Ion Chromatography) and ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) and included ions of Al, As, Ba, Ca, CH 3 COOH, Cl, Co, (COOH) 2, Cr, Cu, F, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, NH 4, Ni, Pb, S, Sb, Si, Sn, Sr, Ti and Zn, and the ions NO 3 2 ̆ 212, PO 4 32 ̆ 212, and SO 4 22 ̆ 212. The resulting concentrations were converted to 5 Eq, providing the ionic balance and the relative amounts of the ions and elements present. Ionic balance was observed on smooth and inert surfaces, but in some cases the chemistry of the wall contributed to the <b>flush</b> <b>water.</b> Solid samples of some of the surfaces have been analysed by XRF to clarify these more complex situations. Conclusions Clear results appear from smooth or well defined surfaces, whereas more complex situations arise when the underlying surface itself contributes to the <b>flush</b> <b>water.</b> The method is working very well and is easy and cheap to implement by curators and conservators, who can the send the <b>flush</b> <b>water</b> to specialized laboratories.
