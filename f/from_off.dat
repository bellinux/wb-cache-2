5|$|Around {{the same}} time, a {{separate}} tropical cyclone {{formed in the}} western Atlantic. It moved <b>from</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Florida to near Bermuda between October 24 and November 1, brushing the coast from St. Augustine to Charleston with gale-force winds. No significant damage occurred, though coastal flooding and heavy rainfall that caused a break in an earthen dam were reported {{along the coast of}} Georgia.|$|E

Against Gonzaga, his 13 points {{included}} basket with 1:28 remaining {{that helped the}} Shockers secure only the fifth sweet sixteen appearance by a number 9 seed since the tournament went to 64 teams in 1985. His 12 points against Ohio State included a late basket that helped the Shockers become the fifth team with a seeding higher than eight {{to make it to}} the final four since 1979 when seeding began.|$|E

5|$|Only nine quagga {{catshark}} specimens {{have been}} recorded. In addition to Alcock's type specimen, four males were trawled <b>from</b> <b>off</b> the eastern Somalian coast {{by the research}} ship RV Anton Bruun in 1964. Four more individuals, two male and two female, were found amongst the contents of commercial fishing trawls conducted off Quilon, India in 2010. A male specimen reported from the Gulf of Aden in 1939 was later re-identified as a speckled catshark (H. boesemani).|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} {{is found}} in the western Atlantic Ocean, from Chesapeake Bay southward through the Florida Keys, the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles; on rare occasions it is found as far north as New Jersey and Massachusetts, as far south as Venezuela, and as far west as Mexico. It is absent from the southern Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean coast of Central America. Reports of this species <b>from</b> <b>off</b> Brazil and Argentina likely represent misidentifications of the groovebelly stingray (D.hypostigma).|$|E
5|$|The diamond {{stingray}} {{is found}} in the eastern Pacific Ocean from southern California to northern Chile, as well as around the Galápagos and Hawaiian Islands; it is very abundant around Baja California and in the Gulf of California. At the northern and southern extremes of its range, it is generally only present during periods of suitably warm water brought about by El Niño. There is a record of this ray <b>from</b> <b>off</b> British Columbia, which is unconfirmed and would be highly anomalous as it is known to be a tropical and warm-temperate species.|$|E

5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray occurs {{widely in}} the Indo-Pacific, {{with a range}} extending <b>from</b> <b>off</b> eastern South Africa to the Arabian Peninsula, westward {{along the coast of}} the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia, and reaching as far as Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands to the north, and New Guinea and northern Australia to the southeast. It has also colonized the eastern Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal, i.e. it is a Lessepsian migrant, and it is now common in the south eastern Mediterranean. This species seems to be common only in Australian waters, where it occurs from Shark Bay to Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|The {{silvertip shark}} is widely but not {{continuously}} {{distributed in the}} tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the western Indian Ocean, this species occurs from the Red Sea to South Africa, including Madagascar, the Seychelles, the Aldabra Group, Mauritius, and the Chagos Archipelago. In the western Pacific, it is known <b>from</b> <b>off</b> southern Japan to northern Australia, including Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, Guam, Palau, the Solomon Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Phoenix Islands, and Tahiti. In the eastern Pacific, it occurs from southern Baja California to Colombia, including the Cocos, Galapagos, and Revillagigedo Islands. Its presence in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea is unconfirmed.|$|E
5|$|Though rarely encountered, {{the false}} {{catshark}} {{has been caught}} from locations scattered around the world, indicating a wide circumglobal distribution. In the western Atlantic, {{it has been reported}} from Canada, the United States, Cuba, and Brazil. In the eastern Atlantic, it is known from the waters of Iceland, France, Portugal, and Senegal, as well as the islands of Madeira, the Azores, the Canaries, and Cape Verde. Records from the Indian Ocean have come <b>from</b> <b>off</b> Madagascar, the Aldabra Group, Mauritius, Indonesia, and Australia. In the Pacific Ocean, it has been documented from Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, the Coral Sea, New Zealand, and the Hawaiian Islands.|$|E

5|$|Patrick {{gets on the}} bus to go {{home but}} accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to get on the}} bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits in a very long line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming <b>from</b> <b>off</b> in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E
5|$|Prince George {{was back}} in action on 12 and 13 July, {{supporting}} French troops with gunfire support <b>from</b> <b>off</b> of Krithia and Achi Baba. On 18 and 19 December she covered the evacuation of Allied troops from Suvla Bay, and the evacuation from West Beach on 8 and 9 January 1916; she {{was hit by a}} torpedo off Cape Helles on 9 January, but it failed to explode and she suffered no damage. She was at Salonika in January and February. Prince George left the Mediterranean at the end of February and paid off at Chatham Dockyard in March to provide crews for antisubmarine vessels. She remained at Chatham in a care and maintenance status through February 1918, serving as an auxiliary sickbay and in other subsidiary duties, then served as an accommodation ship there from March 1916 to May 1918.|$|E
5|$|Revenge {{participated in}} her first action of the war when she joined the gunboat , six British and four French destroyers, and a French torpedo boat in bombarding German troops <b>from</b> <b>off</b> Nieuwpoort, Belgium, on 22 November 1914. On 15–16 December 1914, Revenge bombarded German heavy {{artillery}} batteries, during which time she received two 8-inch (203-mm) shell hits, one of which penetrated her hull below the waterline and caused her to be withdrawn for repairs. In early 1915, the ship participated in experiments using aircraft to observe and control her gunfire, but these were only partially successful. In April and May 1915 she underwent a refit at Chatham Dockyard {{in which she had}} anti-torpedo bulges fitted. Afterwards, Revenge conducted trials using sea-based observers on off-shore platforms to direct the bombardment. On 2 August 1915, she was renamed Redoubtable.|$|E

5|$|Some {{uncertainty}} {{exists in}} the distribution data for the spinner shark due to confusion with the blacktip shark. In the western Atlantic Ocean, it occurs from North Carolina to the northern Gulf of Mexico, including the Bahamas and Cuba, and from southern Brazil to Argentina. In the eastern Atlantic, it occurs <b>from</b> <b>off</b> North Africa to Namibia. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from South Africa and Madagascar, to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, to India and nearby islands, to Java and Sumatra. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs off Japan, Vietnam, Australia, and possibly the Philippines. Parasitological evidence suggests that Indian Ocean spinner sharks have passed through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea, becoming Lessepsian migrants.|$|E
5|$|The Whitetip reef shark is {{distributed}} widely {{across the entire}} Indo-Pacific region. It was once thought to have formerly existed in the Atlantic Ocean, based on fossil teeth found in North Carolina dating to the Miocene epoch. However, more recent research indicates that the teeth belonged to a mackerel shark, and that this species has never colonized the Atlantic. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa to the Red Sea and the Indian subcontinent, including Madagascar, Mauritius, the Comoros, the Aldabra Group, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka, and the Chagos Archipelago. In the western and central Pacific, it occurs <b>from</b> <b>off</b> southern China, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands, to the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia, to northern Australia, and is also found around numerous islands in Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, as far as Hawaii {{to the north and}} the Pitcairn Islands to the southeast. In the eastern Pacific, it occurs from Costa Rica to Panama, and off the Galápagos Islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{kitefin shark}} has an almost circumglobal range in {{tropical}} and warm-temperature waters, {{consisting of a}} number of widely separated populations with likely little interchange between them. This shark has not been reported from the eastern Pacific and northern Indian Oceans. In the northern Atlantic, it occurs in the Georges Bank and the northern Gulf of Mexico, and from the North Sea to Cameroon, including around the British Isles, in the western and central Mediterranean Sea, and off Madeira and the Azores. In the Indian Ocean, it is found off South Africa and Mozambique. In the Pacific, it occurs off Japan, Java, Australia and New Zealand, and the Hawaiian Islands. There is a single record of this species in the southern Atlantic, <b>from</b> <b>off</b> southern Brazil.|$|E

5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} is widely {{distributed}} in the Indo-Pacific region. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa northward to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and India, including Madagascar, Mauritius, the Chagos Archipelago, the Seychelles, and the Maldives. In the western Pacific, it occurs from southern Japan and the coast of China to the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia, to {{as far south as}} the northern coast of Australia. In the central Pacific, it has been reported <b>from</b> <b>off</b> New Caledonia, Samoa, Palau, the Marshall Islands, and Tahiti. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in the Pirabas Formation of northern Brazil, dating back to the Lower Miocene (2316 Ma). The presence of these fossils indicates that the range of the {{tawny nurse shark}} once extended to the tropical Atlantic Ocean, prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama.|$|E
5|$|With the French Navy in the Mediterranean defeated, {{other nations}} were {{encouraged}} to join the Second Coalition and {{go to war with}} France. Portugal, the Kingdom of Naples, the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire all subsequently deployed forces to the Mediterranean. The Russians and Turks participated in the blockade of Egypt and operations in the Adriatic Sea while the Portuguese joined the Siege of Malta, which was distantly conducted by Nelson from his lodgings in Naples. Nelson, who had been wounded at the Battle of the Nile, became involved in Neapolitan politics and encouraged King Ferdinand {{to go to war with}} France, resulting in the loss of his mainland kingdom. In the Western Mediterranean, Vice-Admiral Earl St Vincent, who commanded the Mediterranean fleet <b>from</b> <b>off</b> Cadiz, deployed forces against Menorca, rapidly captured the island and turned it into an important naval base.|$|E
