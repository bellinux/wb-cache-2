60|$|At {{very nearly}} the same moment {{as the man who}} had called himself Dr. Wilmot had leaped from the library window of Deringham Hall, Mr. Sabin sat alone in his sanctum waiting for a visitor. The room was quite a small one {{on the ground floor of}} the house, but was {{furnished}} with taste and evident originality in the Moorish fashion. Mr. Sabin himself was ensconced in an easy chair drawn close up to the fire, and a thin cloud of blue smoke was stealing up from a thick, <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarette</b> which was burning away between his fingers. His head was resting upon the delicate fingers of his left hand, his dark eyes were fixed upon the flaming coals. He was deep in thought.|$|E
60|$|And {{then came}} the {{aggravation}} of all these distresses by an abrupt abandonment of smoking and alcohol. Alcoholic relaxation, a necessary mitigation of the unreality of peacetime politics, becomes a grave danger in war, and it was with an understandable desire to forward the interests of his realm that the King decided to set his statesmen an example--which unhappily was not very widely followed--by abstaining from alcohol during the continuance of the struggle. It did however swing over the Bishop of Princhester to an immediate and complete abandonment of both drink and tobacco. At that time he was finding comfort for his nerves in Manila cheroots, and a particularly big and heavy type of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarette</b> with {{a considerable amount of}} opium, and his disorganized system seized upon this sudden change as a grievance, and set all his jangling being crying aloud for one cigarette--just one cigarette.|$|E

60|$|He went to Brighton-Pomfrey too {{upon the}} score of his general health, and Brighton-Pomfrey revised his general regimen, {{discouraged}} indiscreet fasting, and suggested a complete abstinence from red wine except white port, if indeed {{that can be}} called a red wine, and a moderate use of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarettes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Tastes in Europe and the United States shifted {{away from}} Turkish tobacco and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarettes</b> towards Virginia tobacco, {{during and after the}} First World War. What {{remained}} of the Greek-run tobacco industry in Egypt was nationalized after the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Egyptian-made cigarettes were thereafter sold only domestically, and became known for their poor quality (and low price).|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{between the}} 1880s {{and the end}} of World War 1, the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarette</b> {{industry}} was a globally successful manufacturer and exporter of cigarettes. Non-Egyptian tobacco companies adopted Egyptian motifs in their advertising to take advantage of this. Although the Egyptian industry had begun to decline by the late 1920s as popular taste shifted away from the Turkish tobacco it used.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarette</b> {{industry}}, {{during the}} period between the 1880s {{and the end of}} the First World War, was a major export industry that influenced global fashion. It was notable as a rare example of the global periphery setting trends in the global center in a period when the predominant direction of cultural influence was the reverse, and also as one of the earliest producers of globally traded manufactured finished goods outside the West.|$|E
50|$|In the English-speaking world, the use {{of tobacco}} in {{cigarette}} form became increasingly widespread {{during and after the}} Crimean War, when British soldiers began emulating their Ottoman Turkish comrades and Russian enemies, who had begun rolling and smoking tobacco in strips of old newspaper for lack of proper cigar-rolling leaf. This was helped by the development of tobaccos suitable for cigarette use, and by the development of the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarette</b> export industry.|$|E

50|$|Tobacco {{cultivation}} is {{not legal}} in Egypt, therefore companies who produce tobacco products {{must rely on}} imported raw tobacco largely imported from India and China, {{as well as from}} Brazil, Italy, Syrian Arab Republic, and the United States of America. Egypt's tobacco industry is dominated by the Eastern Tobacco Company (ETC), the largest cigarette manufacturer in the Middle East. A small but ever increasing amount of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarettes</b> are exported to neighboring countries, mostly to serve Egyptians working abroad.|$|R
50|$|In 1913, R.J. Reynolds {{developed}} an innovation: the packaged cigarette. Most tobacco users who smoked cigarettes preferred to roll their own, {{and there was}} thought to be no national market for pre-packaged cigarettes. Reynolds worked to develop a flavor he thought would be more appealing than past products, creating the Camel cigarette, so named because it used Turkish paper, in imitation of then-fashionable <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> Reynolds undercut competitors on the cost of the cigarettes, and within a year, he had sold 425 million packs of Camels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarettes</b> made by Gianaclis {{and others}} became so popular in Europe and the United States that they {{inspired}} {{a large number}} of what were, in effect, locally produced counterfeits. Among these was the American Camel brand, established in 1913, which used on its packet three Egyptian motifs: the camel, the pyramids, and a palm tree. Fellow Greeks in the United States, also imported or produced such cigarettes. For example, S. Anargyros first imported Egyptian Deities and then produced Murad, Helmar and Mogul, and the Stephano Brothers produced Ramses II.|$|R
50|$|The {{founder of}} the {{industry}} was Nestor Gianaclis, a Greek who arrived in Egypt in 1864 and in 1871 established a factory in the Khairy Pasha palace in Cairo. After British troops began being stationed in Egypt in 1882, British officers developed a taste for the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and they were soon being exported to the United Kingdom. Gianaclis and other Greek industrialists such as Ioannis Kyriazis of Kyriazi frères successfully produced and exported cigarettes using imported Turkish tobacco to meet the growing world demand for cigarettes in the closing decades of the nineteenth century.|$|R
60|$|In {{the club}} to which I belong, in a quiet corner where the {{sunlight}} falls in sideways, there may be seen sitting of an afternoon my good friend of thirty years' standing, Mr. Edward Sims. Being somewhat afflicted with gout, he generally sits with one foot up on a chair. On a brass table beside him are such things as Mr. Sims needs. But they are few. Wealthy as he is, the needs of Mr. Sims reach scarcely further than Martini cocktails and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> Such poor comforts as these, brought by a deferential waiter, with, let us say, a folded newspaper at five o'clock, suffice for all his wants. Here sits Mr. Sims till the shadows fall in the street outside, when a limousine motor trundles up to the club and rolls him home.|$|R
25|$|A fastidious dresser, Caruso took {{at least}} two baths a day and enjoyed good food and convivial company. He forged a {{particularly}} close bond with his Met and Covent Garden colleague Antonio Scotti– an amiable and stylish baritone from Naples. Caruso was superstitious and habitually carried several good-luck charms {{with him when he}} sang. He played cards for relaxation and sketched friends, other singers and musicians. His wife, Dorothy said that by the time she knew him, her husband's favorite hobby was compiling scrapbooks. He also amassed a valuable collection of rare postage stamps, coins, watches and antique snuffboxes. Caruso was a heavy smoker of strong <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> too. This deleterious habit, combined with a lack of exercise and the punishing schedule of performances that Caruso willingly undertook season after season at the Met, {{may have contributed to the}} persistent ill-health which afflicted the last year of his life.|$|R
60|$|One day Martin {{became aware}} that he was lonely. He was healthy and strong, and had nothing to do. The {{cessation}} from writing and studying, the death of Brissenden, and the estrangement from Ruth had made a big hole in his life; and his life refused to be pinned down to good living in cafes and the smoking of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> It was true the South Seas were calling to him, but he had a feeling that the game was not yet played out in the United States. Two books were soon to be published, and he had more books that might find publication. Money could be made out of them, and he would wait and take a sackful of it into the South Seas. He knew a valley and a bay in the Marquesas that he could buy for a thousand Chili dollars. The valley ran from the horseshoe, land-locked bay to the tops of the dizzy, cloud-capped peaks and contained perhaps ten thousand acres. It was filled with tropical fruits, wild chickens, and wild pigs, with an occasional herd of wild cattle, while high up among the peaks were herds of wild goats harried by packs of wild dogs. The whole place was wild. Not a human lived in it. And he could buy it and the bay for a thousand Chili dollars.|$|R
60|$|Another {{check was}} in the same mail, sent from a New York weekly in payment for some humorous verse which had been {{accepted}} months before. It was for ten dollars. An idea came to him, which he calmly considered. He did not know {{what he was going to}} do, and he felt in no hurry to do anything. In the meantime he must live. Also he owed numerous debts. Would it not be a paying investment to put stamps on the huge pile of manuscripts under the table and start them on their travels again? One or two of them might be accepted. That would help him to live. He decided on the investment, and, after he had cashed the checks at the bank down in Oakland, he bought ten dollars' worth of postage stamps. The thought of going home to cook breakfast in his stuffy little room was repulsive to him. For the first time he refused to consider his debts. He knew that in his room he could manufacture a substantial breakfast at a cost of from fifteen to twenty cents. But, instead, he went into the Forum Cafe and ordered a breakfast that cost two dollars. He tipped the waiter a quarter, and spent fifty cents for a package of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> It was the first time he had smoked since Ruth had asked him to stop. But he could see now no reason why he should not, and besides, he wanted to smoke. And what did the money matter? For five cents he could have bought a package of Durham and brown papers and rolled forty cigarettes--but what of it? Money had no meaning to him now except what it would immediately buy. He was chartless and rudderless, and he had no port to make, while drifting involved the least living, and it was living that hurt.|$|R
60|$|On {{a certain}} September day, {{about six weeks}} after the funeral of Sir Geoffrey Kynaston, Mr. Brown was {{spending}} {{what appeared to be}} a very pleasant afternoon. He was lying stretched out at full length on a dry mossy bank, with a volume of Shelley in his hand, and a case of thick <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cigarettes</b> by his side. In his ears was the whispering of the faint breeze amongst the pines, and the soft murmuring of the sea, hundreds of feet below, seen like a brilliant piece of patchwork through the fluttering leaves and dark tree-trunks which surrounded him. There was nothing to disturb the sweet silence of the drowsy afternoon. It was a charming spot which he had chosen, and he was quite alone. People, amongst whom for the last few weeks his name had become a fruitful source of conversation, were already beginning to fancy him flying across the country in an express train, or loitering on the docks at Liverpool, waiting for an Atlantic liner, or sitting at home trembling and fearful, struggling to hide his guilt beneath a calm exterior. But, as a matter of fact, he was doing none of these things. The harsh excitement of the busy gossips, and their stern judgment, troubled him nothing, for he was unconscious of them. He was away in thoughtland, dreaming of a fair, proud young face seen first on the rude pavement of an old Italian town, where its sweet composed freshness, amongst a pile of magnificent ruins, had captivated his artist's sense almost before it had touched his man's heart. He thought of the narrow street shutting in the sky till, looking upwards, it seemed like one deep band of glorious blue--of the ruined grey palace, with still some traces left of its former stately grace, and of the fountain playing in the moss-encrusted courtyard, gleaming like silver in the sunlight as it rose and fell into the worn stone basin. Here, where the very air seemed full of the records of a magnificent decay, everything seemed to form a fitting framework in his memory for that one face. It had been an artist's dream--or had it been the man's? Never the latter; he told himself sadly. Such were not for him. It had been better far that he had never seen her again. Before, the memory had been a very sweet one, stored away in his mind amongst all the great and beautiful things he had seen in his wanderings, always with a dainty freshness clinging to it, as though it had lain carefully preserved in perfume and spices. Was this new joy, of having seen and spoken to her, a better thing? this vague unsettlement of his being, which played havoc with his thoughts, and stirred up a whole host of strange new feelings in his heart? Surely not! It seemed to him like the breathing of warm new life into what had been a crystallized emotion--the humanizing of something spiritual. Surely, for him, it had better have remained in that first stage.|$|R
5000|$|Ruth Denis {{was raised}} on a small farm in New Jersey, {{daughter}} of Ruth Emma Hull Denis (a physician by training), and Thomas Laban Denis, an inventor, where she studied both Christian Science and theosophy. As a child, she learned exercises based on François Delsarte's Society Gymnastics and Voice Culture. This {{was the beginning of}} St. Denis's dance training, and was instrumental in developing her technique later in life. In 1894, after years of practicing Delsarte poses, she debuted as a skirt dancer for Worth's Family Theatre and Museum. From this modest start, she progressed to touring with an acclaimed producer and director, David Belasco, under whom her stage name, [...] "St. Denis", was created. While touring in Belasco's production of Madame DuBarry in 1904 her life was changed. She was at a drugstore with another member of Belasco's company in Buffalo, New York, when she saw a poster advertising <b>Egyptian</b> Deities <b>cigarettes.</b> The poster portrayed the Egyptian goddess Isis enthroned in a temple; this image captivated St. Denis on the spot and inspired her to create dances that expressed the mysticism that the goddess's image conveyed. From then on, St. Denis was immersed in Oriental philosophies. In 1905, St. Denis left Belasco's company to begin her career as a solo artist. The first piece that resulted from her interest in the Orient was Radha performed in 1906. Drawing from Hindu mythology, Radha is the story of Krishna and his love for a mortal maid.Radha was originally performed to music from Léo Delibes' opera Lakmé. This piece was a celebration of the five senses and appealed to a contemporary fascination with the Orient. Although her choreography was not culturally accurate or authentic, it was expressive of the themes that St. Denis perceived in Oriental culture and highly entertaining to contemporary audiences. St. Denis believed dance to be a spiritual expression, and her choreography reflected this idea.|$|R
