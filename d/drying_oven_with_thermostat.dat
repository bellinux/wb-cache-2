30|$|To {{describe}} {{the effects of}} the drying–wetting cycles on aggregate breakdown and water stability of aggregates, the yellow–brown earth samples were subjected to several drying–wetting cycles. In the present study, 10 drying–wetting cycles were applied. Each cycle was consisted of 96  h drying of the soil samples by air <b>dry</b> <b>oven</b> <b>with</b> 40  °C (Relative Humidity – 34 %), and 96  h wetting by immersing the soil samples in water at room temperature of 20  °C. From the climatic changes in Fig. 3 we can know that the interval between two precipitations is approximately 7 – 10 d. Thus, we determine the duration of each drying-wetting cycle as 8 d. In drying period, the surface temperature under direct sunshine is about 40  °C and the air <b>dry</b> <b>oven</b> is used to make the air-drying occur sufficiently slowly and tenderly so as to decrease the influence at most. In rewetting process, we apply the immersing method, which is not as violent as in nature. So we reasonably extend the rewetting duration, which should be improved in the following research in order to restore the real field conditions as far as possible. The wet sieving was applied to the subsamples in the wetting state of the first, second, fifth and tenth cycles to obtain the mass contents of the water–stable aggregates.|$|R

After sterilization, all of the indicators were cultured on Nutrient Agar Plate (NAPS), and the subsequent growth was assessed. The colony forming units (CFUs) were counted by Stuart Electric Bacteria Colony Counter. Adequate positive and negative controls were used in every cycle. The results showed that after autoclavization, all spores were killed.

40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the plant growth regulator application, in different doses, on priming, with and without water restriction, in corn seeds. Evaluations were carried out in two periods (0 to 30 days of storage), with treatments consisting of seeds primed in water (0. 0 MPa) and polyethylene glycol 6000 solution (- 0. 4 MPa), with or without plant growth regulator added in different doses, plus a control group. The amount of plant growth regulator was standardized by the gibberellic acid concentration in the commercial product, adopting the doses zero, 1, 2 and 3 mg of gibberellic acid. L- 1 solution. After priming, the seeds were <b>dried</b> in an <b>oven</b> <b>with</b> forced air circulation for nine hours, and evaluated for water content, percentage and first count of germination, percentage of abnormal seedlings and non-germinated seeds, cold test, seedling length and dry weight and vigor index. Priming with water restriction - 0. 4 MPa, in solution of polyethylene glycol 6000, improves the vigor; however, the addition of plant growth regulator in priming does not provide increase in corn seeds quality. Corn priming in water, regardless the addition of plant growth regulator, reduces {{the ability of the}} seeds to withstand storage...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this work}} were to adjust {{different}} mathematical models to experimental data describing the drying of the Valiosa cultivar soybean grain, to determine and to evaluate the effective diffusion coefficient and to obtain the activation energy and the thermodynamic properties of the drying process under different air conditions. The experiments were conducted at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Goiás (Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia Goiano – Câmpus Rio Verde). The Valiosa cultivar soybean grains, with an initial moisture content on a dry basis of 0. 56 (d. b., decimal), were <b>dried</b> in an <b>oven</b> <b>with</b> forced air ventilation at five different temperatures (40, 55, 70, 85 and 100 °C) until reaching a moisture content of 0. 133 ± 0. 019 (d. b.). Of the models analyzed, Page’s model was selected to best represent the drying phenomenon. The effective diffusion coefficient of soybeans increased with the air temperature and was described by the Arrhenius equation; an activation energy of 22. 77 kJ mol– 1 was reported for liquid diffusion in the drying of the soybeans. The enthalpy and entropy decreased with increasing temperature, while the Gibbs free energy increased with increasing drying temperature...|$|R
50|$|In {{factories}} in the 2010s, large jerky ovens are built using insulated panels. Inside these low-temperature <b>drying</b> <b>ovens</b> are many heater elements and fans. The ovens have exhaust ports to remove the moisture-laden air. The combination of fast-moving air and low heat dries the meat to the desired moisture content within a few hours. The raw, marinated jerky strips are placed on racks of nylon-coated metal screens which have been sprayed with a light vegetable oil to allow the meat to be removed easily. The screen trays are placed closely in layers on rolling carts which are then put in the <b>drying</b> <b>oven.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{specimens}} were <b>oven</b> <b>dried</b> at 60 °C for 48  h. This procedure {{ensured that}} the equilibrium was reached in adsorption. Residual moisture content, as compared <b>with</b> <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> at 103 °C, was around 1.36  ±  0.49 %. Specimens were then kept for 3  weeks in controlled conditions of 20  ±  2 °C and 65  ±  5 % RH. This procedure was repeated before any mechanical measurement. Specific gravity γ (both <b>oven</b> <b>dried</b> and air dried) and EMC were recorded. EMC of native wood was of 7.9  ±  0.8 %.|$|R
