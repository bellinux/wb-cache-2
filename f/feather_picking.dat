50|$|Eclectus parrots are {{generally}} calm birds in captivity, displaying a pensive nature {{when faced with}} novel items or situations, which may give rise to the mistaken impression that the species is 'dull-witted'. The eclectus may also exhibit a more neophobic nature than other species of companion bird. Eclectus parrots are prone to <b>feather</b> destruction (<b>picking,</b> pulling, cutting and or barbing) in captivity. Causes {{can be difficult to}} pin down, but diet is generally the primary cause, along with failure to provide a soft wood perch to chew, with health problems and hormonal changes thought to be additional causes, as well as clipping primary wing feathers so that the cut ends irritate the bird's sides. Once this behavior begins it is nearly impossible to stop unless the cause has been addressed. Often only a mechanical barrier (e-collar) is successful in keeping the afflicted parrot from completely stripping all but its head of feathers. Other captive species that are prone to this behavior are the cockatoo, African grey, and to some extent the macaw.|$|R

5000|$|When social {{interactions}} amongst birds are absent or inadequate, abnormal social behaviour may develop. For example, a study regarding parrots {{that had been}} isolated in cages demonstrated that most birds showing this social deprivation had significant behavioural disturbances, such as aggressive behaviour, <b>feather</b> <b>picking,</b> self-mutilation, restlessness, screaming, apathetic behavior, and stereotypies. [...] Cannibalism often occurs in large animal husbandry systems, which are usually impoverished environments {{with a lack of}} opportunities. In addition, studies of caged canaries have revealed two common stereotypies. These include spot picking, where birds repeatedly touch a particular spot in the environment with the tip of their beak, and route tracing, a pacing behaviour associated with physical restrictions in movement imposed by the cage. The absence of song learning in zebra finches has also been implicated as a behavioural abnormality. In these birds, the social interaction of a young male with his song tutor is important for normal song development. Without the stimulus, the song, which is necessary for mating behavior, will not be learned.|$|E

40|$|Feather {{damaging}} behaviour (also {{referred to}} as <b>feather</b> <b>picking</b> or feather plucking) is a behavioural disorder that is frequently encountered in captive parrots. This disorder has many characteristics {{that are similar to}} trichotillomania, an impulse control disorder in humans. Unfortunately, to date much of the information regarding the aetiology and treatment in both syndromes is based on ‘expert’ opinion rather than on experimentally founded results. Comparative research in humans and parrots might therefore be mutually beneficial. Feather damaging behaviour (FDB) may also share similarities with behavioural disorders present in other bird species. Feather pecking (FP) in poultry is of particular interest in this case. Because of the major impacts on welfare and economy, the disorder has been thoroughly investigated. It has been shown that genetic, socio-environmental and neurobiological factors all play a role in FP. Several theories have been postulated about the different motivational systems that affect the behaviour, of which (redirected) foraging appears to be the most generally accepted. FDB may result from similar motivations and underlying mechanisms, but has also been regarded as a grooming disorder. Grooming or preening is behaviour that serves both physical and social purposes. In the presence of stressors, such as novelty, so-called displacement grooming may develop that can result in excessive grooming when chronic stress is experienced (maladaptive behaviour). Adrenocorticotropic hormone, opiate, dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems have been shown to influence the onset, development and maintenance of this behaviour.

40|$|In this study, {{certain aspects}} of psittacine beak and feather disease and {{budgerigar}} fledgling disease were investigated to gather information about the distribution and the clinical manifestation of the diseases in patients of the “Klinik für Vögel der LMU München”. Furthermore different organ samples were compared for their reliability of routine post mortem PCR-diagnoses of peracute PBFD in young african grey parrots. Regarding intra vitam detection of the aetiological agents of both diseases (BFDV and BFPyV), following observations were made: while in birds with physiological plumage, DNA of neither virus could be detected (BFDV: n = 79; BFPyV: n = 47), birds with feather disorders were regularly BFDV (18. 2 %) and BFPyV (10. 7 %) positive. In psittacines with feathering disorders an BFPyV-infection was only seen in budgerigars. The six affected budgerigars show acute loss of flight and tail feathers. In two birds a concurrent infection of BFPyV and BFDV could be detected {{and in one of}} the two birds a deformation of feathers could be seen. Characteristic feather disorders, as discribed for chronic PBFD, like constriction in feather sheats, remaining feather sleeves, discolouration as well as hemorrhages in the feather shaft, were only present in nine of the 24 BFDV-positive birds. The clinical signs of the remaining 15 BFDV-infected birds were only feather loss and <b>feather</b> <b>picking.</b> In contrast to BFPyV-infection, which could only be detected in budgerigars, the BFDV positive birds belong to different species of the order Psittaciformes. The testing of intra vitam samples showed, that in four of the BFDV-positive birds viral DNA could not be detected in all samples tested (2 x cloacal swab, 1 x blood, 1 x blood and cloacal swab). To increase the reliability of intra vitam diagnosis all three samples should be taken for virus detection. Within the group of birds presented for necropsy, the share of BFDV- and BFPyVpositive birds was even higher (25. 5 % and 21. 9 %) as in birds with feather disorders. In these birds a BFPyV-infection could be demonstrated in samples of seven birds of different species under the age of one year. Besides one budgerigar, who died of a streptococcus septicemia, all 13 BFDV-positive birds, who died with physiological plumage, were young african grey parrots. By testing DNA dilutions of different organ samples (skin-with-feather, spleen, bursa of Fabricius and liver) of young grey parrots suffering from peracute PBFD, an infection could be proven in 29 of 34 birds. In positive birds viral DNA of BFDV could be detected in all organ samples except for three single samples (2 x bursa of Fabricius and 1 x liver). But using undiluted isolated DNA, a great part of the spleen- (19 of 28) and bursa of Fabricius-samples (13 of 25) and a smaller part of liver- (6 of 28) and skin-with-feather-samples (3 of 29) gave a negative result Because of the high number of false negative PCR-tests the labarotories need to establish reliable internal controls PCR-diagnostic.

40|$|In the Netherlands {{there are}} 30, 7 million {{companion}} animals. A {{part of this}} consists of dogs and cats, {{the rest of it}} are exotic animals. From a brief research from the sector itself, it is known that on a yearly basis many pets are handed over or are left behind at petting zoos. However, a systematic research has never done before. The purpose of this research is to make an inventory of the species and numbers of exotic animals that are handed over or are left behind at petting zoos in the Netherlands, the reasons for relinquishment and to make an inventory of the health and welfare condition of the animals. Finally there has been investigated what happens to the animals after the arrival on the petting zoo. For this research a digital survey was used, this survey was sent to 421 petting zoos in the Netherlands. Seven petting zoos were also interviewed. 175 petting zoos filled in the digital survey, this is a response percentage of 41, 6 %. At 92 % of the responding petting zoos exotic animals are being offered of relinquished. In 61 % of the cases the owners ask permission before giving an animal to the petting zoo, in 38 % of the cases the animals are left behind. On a yearly basis 9. 277 animals are offered to the 175 responding petting zoos which are not accepted and 12. 422 mammals, 6. 575 birds, 149 fish, 274 reptiles and 36 amphibians are presented and accepted or relinquished at petting zoos. 80, 9 % of the petting zoos notice seasonal differences either in species or number of animals that are offered or relinquished at petting zoos. Especially in summer more animals were presented to petting zoos. This are mostly rabbits (mentioned by 83, 7 % of the petting zoos) and guinea pigs (mentioned by 52, 7 % of the respondents). Reasons given by the owner for surrendering an animal were: an allergy of the owner or family members (37 % of the cases), loss of interest (14 %) and shortage of time (13 %). 32, 5 % of the responding petting zoos also state that there are species differences in reasons for surrender. Chickens were more often given away because they cause inconvenience or there is a surplus of (male) animals. Rabbits and guinea pigs are mainly given away because of a loss of interest in the animal, allergies and shortage of time. Rabbits are also relinquished because of behaviour problems (aggression). Most of all these animals (46 %) are adults. In response to the question about what percentage of the presented and relinquished animals have health or behaviour problems, the majority of the respondents state that 0 - 5 % of the animals have these problems. However, higher percentages are also mentioned for mammals and birds (more than 5 % is mentioned in 55 % of the cases for mammals and 22 % for birds). When asked for a further specification of health and behaviour problems the following items were mentioned: aggression (rabbits), skin disorders (guinea pigs with scabies), dental problems, overweight, long nails and diarrhoea are mentioned for mammals. For birds parasites, aggression, diarrhoea and <b>feather</b> <b>picking</b> are mentioned. The majority of petting zoos also mentioned that 0 - 10 % of the animals show signs of neglect, however for mammals higher percentages were also mentioned. Most respondents mention that 0 - 5 % of the animals die within a few days after arrival on the petting zoo. In most cases animals die because they were already in a poor condition. 57, 5 % of the petting zoos places an animal in quarantine after arrival. In the long term animals are being kept in the petting zoo, alternatively, the petting zoo finds new owners for the animal, the animals go to a pet shelter or to an animal trader. The average time an animal stays at the petting zoo, varies (from one day until the animal dies). From the interviews and the results of the survey it appeared that petting zoos suspect that animals are bought in an impulse and that the knowledge level of consumers of the natural behaviour and the needs of an animal is insufficient. Especially with exotic animals an adequate nutrition, care and housing are important for a good health condition and a good welfare. A better education of consumers at selling points and a more efficient use of reliable and central information points such as the National Information Center for Companion Animals, is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Although a {{large body}} of {{research}} on health aspects can be found via the web or in conference proceedings, only few papers reach the peer reviewed literature. This aspect makes it difficult to judge the quality of available data that relate to health aspects associated with organic livestock production. Many data deal with "on farm case type studies" which often do not lead to a direct relation between certain management procedures and incidence of certain health aspects. The principle that organic held animals are in better condition concerning their health as compared to conventionally held animals has not yet been proven. Well-controlled studies are needed to show the effects of organically held animals on innate and adaptive immune responses and disease susceptibility. The conditions in organic livestock production lead to novel challenges concerning social interactions, physical requirements, climatic conditions and infectious burden which requires certain breeds of animals that differ considerably from the conventionally held animals. More research is needed to identify these breeds whereby breeding selection criteria specific to organic conditions and principles should be used. A number of health problems such as infestation with parasites is an important problem that has been noted in organic livestock (poultry and pig) production and {{more research is needed to}} both prevent and treat these infections. Although largely recommended, phytotherapy and homeopathy do not have any demonstrated efficacy in managing helminths. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to address these questions. Investigations should be concerned with aspects such as rotation, stocking density, disinfections strategies, genetic predisposition and novel (plant derived or biological) antihelminthics. A major drawback in the use of phytotherapeuticals is the lack of good clinical trials, most claims are based on traditional use, anecdotal evidence or extrapolation of human data. Another problem is the consistency/standardisation of the product; variations exist in the levels of "active" ingredients between lots. Extensive studies have shown that garlic has a beneficial effect on human health and therefore would possibly be a suitable candidate to increase the health of animals in organic production. Further research is needed to substantiate this claim. Although mastitis is not seen more often in organic dairy production compared to conventional farms, it is still frequently encountered and both basic and applied research concerning prevention and cure without the traditional use of antibiotics is needed. More knowledge is needed concerning effects of alternative treatments in organic livestock production. As long as alternative treatments have not formally been proven to be effective, allopathic treatments should be preferred. Studies are needed concerning the welfare aspects of disease and insufficient or postponed treatment in organic animal production systems. It is generally accepted that <b>feather</b> <b>picking</b> and cannibalism is a major problem in organic poultry and more research is needed to counter this unwanted behaviour of the animals. The following aspects including genetic influences, housing environment, feed composition and the presence of external parasites may be involved. Vaccination has been one of the largest success factors in the prevention of disease in production animals. Most vaccines used nowadays are genetically engineered and should thus carry the GMO label. GMO based vaccines produced by incorporating genetic material from bacteria or viruses into plants is an attractive approach but does not comply with the principles of organic farming. Investigations concerning various vaccination strategies with or without GMO approaches should be evaluated to prevent various infectious diseases in organic livestock production systems. Organic livestock production leads to an increase or re-emergence of certain zoonotic diseases (Campylobacter, toxoplasma). This is a serious drawback concerning claims that organic products are healthier as compared to conventional products and research into the prevalence of certain zoonotic infections, risk factors, farm management, post slaughter decontamination and consumer perception/education is badly needed. Several micro-organisms are described to be present in feeds and could be sources of infections of farm animals. Such pathogens can be either present on the outside of the plant (epiphytes) or on the inside of the plant (endophytes). The incidence of pathogenic bacteria in/on plants used for organic animal feed is not clear and therefore research on the incidence of these pathogens is needed. Biological cycles such as the utilisation of manure from organic farms may potentially lead to the creation of infectious reservoirs. Research is needed to provide evidence for this hypothesis and strategies should be devised to prevent this problem. Little is known about the role of pests in the occurrence of disease in organic livestock production. Research is needed into the efficacy of alternative pest control strategies since current pest control methods are not in agreement with organic production principles (use of anticoagulants for rodent control). The obligatory use of straw bedding in swine household management leads to higher dust and bioareosol (endotoxin) levels in stables. This may affect susceptibility to lung disease (farmer and animal) and investigations concerning measures to reduce dust and bioaerosol levels are needed. Current literature on this subject is not concordant and true differences may exist between management systems from different countries. Piglet mortality is an important problem in organic production systems and research concerning genetic and housing aspects is currently performed but not yet reported in the peer-reviewed literature. Amino acid imbalance and research into novel feed sources with high protein content is needed. More knowledge is known concerning possible anti-nutritive factors in these feeds and the effects of these new nutrients on gut health of the animals. Amino acid imbalance may lead to higher excretion of excess amino acids into the environment. On farm research should be performed to substantiate whether these claims also apply to organic production systems. It has been suggested that organic feeds for animals in organic production systems may contain higher mycotoxin levels thereby adversely affecting their health status. As yet no conclusive data concerning this issue has been published and research into this area is needed to prove or reject this myth. As yet it is not known whether phytase levels in organic feed for pigs are sufficient to allow optimal utilisation of organic phosphor thereby also leading to a lower environmental pollution; further investigations are needed in this area...|$|E
