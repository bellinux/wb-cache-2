The noblest attempt to pull <b>free</b> <b>the</b> sword first followed by those ranked after them. Sigmund, son of King Völsung, takes his turn, and—as if the sword had lay loose for him—he draws it from the trunk. The saga then continues.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} {{branching}} into different timelines {{that can be}} experienced in any order, depending on the choices made by the player. While completing {{the first set of}} puzzle rooms, the participants learn of a pandemic caused by Radical-6, a virus that slows down its victims' cognition and drives them to suicide. Depending on the given timeline, the characters also discover either the murdered body of an old woman or antimatter bombs. The other participants' backstories are explored: Luna is a humanoid robot, tasked with maintaining the Nonary Game; K was raised by Zero Sr. inside of the facility; Tenmyouji willingly joined the game, together with his adopted grandson Quark, after being promised a chance to find a certain woman; Alice and Clover are government secret agents tasked with stopping the religious cult <b>Free</b> <b>the</b> Soul; and Dio is a member of <b>Free</b> <b>the</b> Soul.|$|E
5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs <b>free.</b> <b>The</b> sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{a portion of}} the mountain, the player reaches a basecamp intermezzo with multiple opportunities for collecting new abilities.

50|$|In general, solving these {{nonlinear}} equations {{presents a}} formidable challenge {{because of the}} huge range over which <b>the</b> <b>free</b> concentrations may vary. At the beginning, values for <b>the</b> <b>free</b> concentrations must be estimated. Then, these values are refined, usually by means of Newton-Raphson iterations. The logarithms of <b>the</b> <b>free</b> concentrations may be refined rather than <b>the</b> <b>free</b> concentrations themselves. Refinement of the logarithms of <b>the</b> <b>free</b> concentrations has <b>the</b> added advantage of automatically imposing a non-negativity constraint on <b>the</b> <b>free</b> concentrations. Once <b>the</b> <b>free</b> reactant concentrations have been calculated, the concentrations of the complexes are derived from them and the equilibrium constants.|$|R

5|$|Amid {{a torrent}} of Japanese fire, the Australians broke contact and made for the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded out with them. The embarkation took only five minutes, but as the vessels attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and stuck fast. In an effort to lighten the load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of the vessels to float <b>free.</b> <b>The</b> other, however, remained stuck.
