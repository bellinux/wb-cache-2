25|$|A ripe avocado yields to gentle {{pressure}} when held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> {{the hand}} and squeezed.

A few drops of cleaner are applied to the lens while it rests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> the hand; the lens is rubbed for about 20 seconds with a clean {{fingertip}} (depending on the product) on each side. Lens must then be rinsed. This system is commonly used to care for rigid lenses.|$|E

25|$|Pali {{sources say}} that beings in Maitreya's time will be much bigger than {{during the time of}} Sakyamuni. In one prophecy his disciples are contemptuous of Mahakasyapa, whose head is no larger than an insect to them. Buddhas robe barely covers two fingers making them wonder how tiny Buddha was. Mahākāśyapa is said to be small enough in {{comparison}} to cremate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> Maitreya's hand.|$|E
25|$|As a note, {{a patient}} with true carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (entrapment of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel) will not have any sensory loss over the thenar eminence (bulge of muscles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> hand and {{at the base of}} the thumb). This is because the palmar branch of the median nerve, which innervates that area of the palm, branches off of the median nerve and passes over the carpal tunnel. This feature of the median nerve can help separate carpal tunnel syndrome from thoracic outlet syndrome, or pronator teres syndrome.|$|E

25|$|An off {{break is}} bowled by holding the cricket ball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> the {{hand with the}} seam running across under all the fingers. As the ball is released, the fingers roll down {{the right side of}} the ball (for a {{right-handed}} bowler), giving the ball a clockwise spin as seen from behind. When the ball bounces on the pitch, the spin causes it to deviate towards the right from the bowler's perspective, this is to the left from the batsman's point of view or towards the leg side of a right-handed batsman. The ball spins away from the off side.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} {{instruments}} of the lute-family (among such different instruments like the mandolin and the sitar) the player makes the sound by picking the strings with a plectrum (pick). The Arabian {{term for the}} pick is reesha, which originally was made of a pinfeather of an eagle. One impressive aspect of Bashir was the precision of his risha. His style emphasized a clean risha, while most other oud players have a heavy risha. The reesha is held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> one's hand, resulting in a difficultly learnable picking technique; furthermore the doubled strings have a less controllable attack than single strings.|$|E
25|$|A leg {{break is}} bowled by holding the cricket ball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> the {{hand with the}} seam running across under all the fingers. As the ball is released, the wrist is rotated {{to the left and}} the ball flicked by the ring finger, giving the ball an {{anti-clockwise}} spin as seen from behind. When the ball bounces on the pitch, the spin causes it to deviate towards the left from the bowler's perspective; this is to the right from the batsman's point of view, or towards the off side of a right-handed batsman. The ball spins away from the leg side, and this is where it gets the name leg break, meaning it breaks away from the leg. The turn is mostly when the ball pitches.|$|E

25|$|Shure {{introduced}} the FP31 mixer in 1983. The FP31 was smaller and lighter than similar {{products of the}} time—small enough to hold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> the hand and weighing just 2.2 pounds. This positioned it to complement the one-piece Sony Betacam video camera, which had been widely adopted by remote video broadcast crews. The FP31 could operate up to eight hours on two standard 9-volt batteries, and included two separate microphone/line outputs for two-camera video shoots. Its master section featured an adjustable threshold limiter to prevent overload distortion, {{and there was a}} separate microphone/line switch with low-cut filter on each channel. By 1984, just a year after its introduction, the FP31 was being used by ABC, CBS, NBC, Turner Broadcasting System, and was later succeeded by the Shure FP33.|$|E
25|$|Athena {{is shown}} to have an aegis diagonally across her peplos in the sculpture. The aegis has a {{miniature}} Gorgon's head on it along with a border of snakes. Its small dimensions make it {{to be more like}} a marker of Athena’s identity than an actual piece of armament. The diagonal positioning of the aegis is seen to give Athena a swaying motion — some say in order to have the viewer’s eye look towards what Athena was holding in her right hand. There is a hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> the right hand and the right thumb indicating that Athena was originally holding an item, but that item's identity it is not certain. Some suggest it might have been an owl or the representation of victory, Nike. It is also thought that Athena may have held in her left hand a spear or a shield.|$|E
25|$|Antony and Cleopatra {{was never}} {{intended}} to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could not live without the other, it does not take much to be able {{to point out that the}} basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he never believed their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> her hands, to always be in control of his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he was sad or fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.|$|E

500|$|Farmiga {{portrayed the}} lead role of Kate Coleman in Jaume Collet-Serra's {{psychological}} thriller Orphan (2009). Farmiga's performance was praised, with Toby Young of The Times writing that she [...] "becomes more convincing as the story unfolds. By the end, she has you <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> her hand". She then appeared as Aurora de Valday in Niki Caro's romantic drama A Heavenly Vintage, which premiered at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival under the title The Vintner's Luck.|$|E

Großadmiral Alfred von Tirpitz remarked that [...] "On 16 December, Ingenohl had {{the fate of}} Germany <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> his hand. I boil with inward emotion whenever I think of it." [...] The captain of the battlecruiser [...] was even more scathing; he stated that Ingenohl had turned away [...] "because {{he was afraid of}} eleven British destroyers which could have been easily eliminated ... Under the present leadership we will accomplish nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|The type {{species of}} genus Rhodotus was {{originally}} described as Agaricus palmatus in 1785 by French botanist Jean Bulliard; mycologist Elias Magnus Fries later included {{it under the}} same name in his Systema Mycologicum. It {{was transferred to the}} then newly described genus Rhodotus in a 1926 publication by French mycologist René Maire. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin palmatus, meaning [...] "shaped like a hand"—possibly a reference to the resemblance of the cap surface to the lines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> a hand. Common names for R.palmatus include the netted rhodotus, the rosy veincap, and the wrinkled peach.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television sources and critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode an 8.4/10, calling {{the change of}} pace from the show's usual random storytelling [...] "pleasant". The Misery segment was criticized as being flat, but was made up for by the other two, particularly The Shawshank Redemption. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave it a B- and called the Stand by Me story [...] "too earnest to turn into much of a comic romp" [...] and that the gags in The Shawshank Redemption were [...] "too expected". He called Misery a [...] "hoot", stating: [...] "Anything where Brian is held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> diabolical Stewie works wonders for me".|$|E

[...] The single [...] "Hell in Paradise" [...] was a hit, reaching No. 16 on the US dance charts and No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the video, directed by Zbigniew Rybczyński received major airplay on MTV and won [...] "Most Innovative Video" [...] at Billboard Music Video Awards in 1986. In 1986, Ono set out on a goodwill world tour for Starpeace, primarily visiting Eastern European countries.|$|E
500|$|Bryan's opening claimed no {{personal}} prestige for himself—but nevertheless placed {{him as the}} spokesman for silver. According to Bensel, the self-deprecation helped disarm the delegates. As Bryan was not deemed a major contender for the nomination, even delegates committed to a candidate could cheer him without seeming to betray their allegiance. Bryan then recounted {{the history of the}} silver movement; the audience, which had loudly demonstrated its approval of his opening statements, quieted. Throughout the speech, Bryan had the delegates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> his hand; they cheered on cue. The Nebraskan later described the audience as like a trained choir. As he concluded his historical recitation, he reminded the silver delegates that they had come to crown their victory, [...] "not to discuss, not to debate, but to enter up the judgment already rendered by the plain people of this country".|$|E
