5|$|For the {{remainder}} of Anderson's childhood, the Queales lived at 56 Villa Street, in a house abutting Yeronga Memorial Park. On {{the opposite side of}} the park was Yeronga State School, the school at which Anderson began her formal education. In spite of its reputation as one of the best state schools in Queensland at the time, Yeronga State School rapidly became a site of dread and frustration for Anderson, who suffered from a speech <b>impediment</b> that caused strife for her in the classroom. Anderson's speech <b>impediment</b> (as well as her occasional flirtations with truancy) became such a hindrance to her education that her parents decided that she was to be home-schooled by her mother for a year, while attending weekly speech therapy sessions in the city. In spite of these efforts, Anderson's slight stammer was to stay with her for the rest of her life; several observers commented that the <b>impediment</b> lent her speech a careful and deliberate air. Following her primary school education, Anderson attended high school at Brisbane State High School. Upon graduation, she attended Brisbane Technical College Art School.|$|E

40|$|Using the {{findings}} of the 1999 Survey of Innovation in the Canadian manufacturing sector, we analyse the <b>impediments,</b> i. e. the problems and obstacles, that firms in the sector face when they innovate. In particular, we assess the factors which inhibit innovation, especially with regard to by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). First we try to establish the relationship between the <b>impediments</b> to innovation and various firm characteristics. Then we assess whether these <b>impediments</b> actually prevent firms from innovating or whether firms are able to overcome them. We find that the perception of <b>impediments</b> to innovation vary according to firm characteristics. For example, large firms are more likely to report the high cost of developing innovation and organizational rigidities as <b>impediments</b> than small firms. However, they seem to have less difficulty with regard to financing innovation projects compared to SMEs. Our results also show that firms {{seem to be able to}} overcome most of the obstacles to innovation. Therefore, the <b>impediments</b> featured in innovation survey(s) should not be interpreted as impenetrable barriers that prevent innovation. The sole exception is organizational rigidities. Firms facing organizational rigidities are less likely to become innovative, whether they are small, medium, or large. From our results, we conclude that small firms do not face particular <b>impediments</b> which prevent them from becoming innovative. Innovation, <b>Impediments,...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>impediments</b> to exporting faced by manufacturing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Australia using survey data. The {{results suggest that}} all factors identified as <b>impediments</b> to exporting have some bearing on exporting, but some factors feature more prominently than others as <b>impediments.</b> While {{a number of major}} <b>impediments,</b> such as the lack of export initiatives and competitiveness are very internal to SMEs, some other important ones such as tariffs and the lack of government assistance are external to them. SMEs, through productivity gains, innovation, networking, strategic alliances and improvements in management capabilities and appropriate training for staff, can help overcome many <b>impediments</b> that are internal to SMEs. Government policy initiatives can contribute to improve export performance of SMEs if they are directed to the areas of market access, export promotion and export facilitation...|$|R

40|$|New Zealand's Land Transport Management Act 2003 {{places a}} {{statutory}} requirement on transport agencies to improve access and mobility. However, the access and mobility needs of New Zealanders, and existing <b>impediments</b> to access and mobility, {{are not well}} understood. This thesis focuses on groups of people that international research suggests {{are at risk of}} social exclusion. It investigates their transport needs and <b>impediments</b> related to access and mobility, by reviewing the international literature and by conducting face-to-face interviews with eight people selected from these potentially at-risk groups. The understanding gained from this present research of mobility needs and <b>impediments,</b> and the effects of these <b>impediments,</b> are discussed. This thesis suggests that mobility <b>impediments</b> are resulting in social exclusion in New Zealand, and that while current consideration of the transport-disadvantaged in New Zealand is largely focussed on the elderly and the disabled, other groups identified internationally, such as young people and new settlers, are also at risk of social exclusion because of <b>impediments</b> to their mobility. This thesis has examined what people perceive as their mobility needs, and suggests that as needs are variable, it is not possible or appropriate to identify basic mobility needs that should apply to everyone. Also, mobility <b>impediments,</b> rather than being a matter of can or cannot, are a matter of degree. The ways in which identified mobility <b>impediments</b> might be addressed are described. It is suggested that because of the difficulties in establishing and providing for access and mobility needs, it may be more appropriate to focus on providing access and mobility opportunities instead. The usefulness and limitations of this present research are discussed, together with the prospects of subsequently applying the research method on a wider scale in order to develop a fuller understanding of the range of access and mobility needs and <b>impediments</b> of New Zealanders...|$|R

By elevating another archbishop, Offa would reduce the political power of the archbishops of Canterbury.

This work builds upon major methodological and practical issues encountered in measuring such <b>impediments</b> in the 1995 PECC Survey of <b>Impediments</b> to Trade and Investment in the APEC Region. Conceptual and measurement issues in deriving partial equilibrium estimates {{of the effects of}} service trade <b>impediments</b> are discussed. The feasibility and use of partial estimates, especially price-impact measures, as a means of benchmarking competitive outcomes is examined. A current joint research project involving the Australian National University, the Australian Industry Commission and the University of Adelaide will be drawn upon in which a seven step approach is being developed to identify, evaluate and measure the impact of Australian <b>impediments</b> to services trade. Australia’s telecommunications sector is used as a case study of how to measure the domestic economic efficiency gains of regulatory reforms. Some important areas for future work, including the link to services trade of foreign direct investment controls, are highlighted. Such work should be of interest to economic modellers as it will provide some insights into how partial measures of <b>impediments</b> can be constructively used to model the economic gains from trade liberalisation of services within APEC...|$|R
