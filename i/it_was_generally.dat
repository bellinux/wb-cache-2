5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{was not as}} {{successful}} as the original upon its release, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> critically well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Modern critics and scholars have noted the strong lesbian overtones of the film, which Universal acknowledged {{from the start of}} filming and exploited in some early advertising.|$|E
5|$|On 29 March 2008, Zimbabwe held {{a presidential}} {{election}} along with a parliamentary election. The results of this election were withheld for two weeks, after which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> acknowledged that the Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai (MDC-T) had achieved a majority of one seat in the lower house of parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} a major {{commercial}} failure, and Looking Glass ceased its self-publishing operations after its release. Despite this, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> well reviewed by critics, who praised Jim McKay's commentary and the game's graphics and atmosphere. Criticism was leveled against its lack of multiplayer or course creation functionality, and some reviewers found fault with its brevity.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{functions}} of voice in Tagalog is to code definiteness, analogous {{to the use of}} definite and indefinite articles in English. When the patient is marked with the direct case particle, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> definite, whereas when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> marked with the indirect case <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> indefinite.|$|R

5|$|Written by Ben Aaronovitch, {{this story}} {{concerned}} privatisation. This idea was submitted in May 1987, the then script editor Andrew Cartmel liked {{some of the}} concepts, but he felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> inappropriate for Doctor Who, {{and that there were}} too many supporting characters. However, Andrew Cartmel encouraged Ben Aaronovitch to pitch more stories, and led to the story Remembrance of the Daleks.|$|E
5|$|Before Glöckner's 2003 {{article on}} the origin of the Magnificat, and for some authors still after that, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> assumed that Bach had {{composed}} his Magnificat in the quiet time of Advent 1723 for a first performance at the Christmas vespers. For that performance Bach composed four laudes, songs of praise partly in German, partly in Latin to be inserted at certain points in the E-flat major version of the Magnificat. The E-flat major version of the Magnificat including these interpolations is known as BWV 243a.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the game's {{graphics}} were good, enjoyed Uematsu's score, and several praised the concepts behind the Job and leveling systems. Alongside this, unanimous criticism was laid against the gameplay pace, its convoluted interface, bugs and glitches, and {{the slow pace of}} the story. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> seen as a great disappointment both as an MMORPG and a mainline entry in the Final Fantasy series. Later, as part of an interview concerning the game's later development, 1UP.com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls had turned the game into something more playable.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{sometimes}} gruesome testimony <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> believed the hearings were politically motivated and that individual excesses could largely be traced only to Lang and Dorcas Williams, {{both of whom}} had been acting under the orders of a Marine Corps officer who had since been committed to an insane asylum. Both of the accused gendarmerie officers had been indicted by U.S. Navy court-martial prior to the hearings. A separate inquiry conducted by the Haitian government concluded that, outside of 10 killings attributed to Lang and Williams, the gendarmerie's conduct of the war had been justifiable.|$|E
5|$|He was {{transferred}} to command of the 177th (2/1st Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade, part of the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division in January 1916. The 59th was a second-line Territorial Force division, formed from those Territorials and new volunteers who had not volunteered for overseas service. As a result, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> undermanned and underequipped, with priority given to equipping its first-line counterpart, and tasked mostly with home defence duties. The 177th Brigade had been formed as the duplicate of the 138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade, with two second-line battalions of the Lincolnshire Regiment {{and two of the}} Leicestershire Regiment.|$|E
5|$|John Schneider {{was brought}} in to play Jonathan Kent. Schneider was already well known as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard, and Gough {{believed}} Schneider's experience from The Dukes of Hazzard added believability to the idea that he could have grown up running a farm. Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, but during filming <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> agreed—Ettinger included—that she was not right for the role. Annette O'Toole, who previously portrayed Lana Lang in Superman III, and who was fresh off the recent cancellation of her television series The Huntress, was cast in Ettinger's place, reshooting the scenes Ettinger had filmed.|$|E

5|$|The Ordinances {{were never}} again reissued, and {{therefore}} hold no permanent {{position in the}} legal history of England {{in the way that}} Magna Carta, for instance, does. The criticism has been against the conservative focus of the barons' role in national politics, ignoring the ascendancy of the commons. Yet the document, and the movement behind it, reflected new political developments in its emphasis on how assent was to be obtained by the barons in parliament. It {{was only a matter of}} time before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> acknowledged that the Commons were an integral part of that institution.|$|E
5|$|The county {{magistrate}} and commandery administrator {{were the}} official court judges {{of the county}} and commandery, respectively. Their jurisdictions overlapped, yet the commandery administrator only interfered in county court cases when necessary; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> agreed that whoever arrested a criminal first {{would be the first}} to judge him or her. If a commandery-level court case could not be resolved, the central government's Commandant of Justice was the final authority of appeal before the emperor. Yet he most often dealt with cases of political rebels and regicide in regards to kings, marquesses, and high officials. Above the Commandant was the emperor, the supreme judge and lawgiver.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{date of the}} war's end is {{also not}} universally agreed upon. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> {{accepted}} {{at the time that}} the war ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (2 September 1945). A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951. A treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place in 1990 and resolved other post-World War II issues.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} {{directed}} by Takaaki Ishiyama, and features character designs by Shuichi Shimamura, script supervision by Toshiki Inoue, and music by Takeshi Abo. The series has been released on home media by VAP in Japan, Funimation in North America, Madman Entertainment in Australia, and Manga Entertainment in the United Kingdom. Reviewers have been mostly critical of the story; while some still found it engaging, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> considered confusing. The animation and visuals received {{a wide range of}} opinions from critics, while the series' soundtrack received praise.|$|E
5|$|Throughout most of {{the history}} of Poland, the banner of Poland {{was one of the main}} symbols of the Polish State, {{normally}} reserved for use by the head of state. Although its design changed with time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> a heraldic banner, i.e., one based directly on the national coat of arms: a crowned White Eagle on a red field (Gules an eagle Argent crowned Or). The banner should not be confused with the flag of Poland, a white and red , officially adopted in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Uranus {{had been}} {{observed}} {{on many occasions}} before its recognition as a planet, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> mistaken for a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchos, who in 128 BCE might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's Almagest. The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769, including on four consecutive nights.|$|E

5|$|Yugoslav naval {{policy in}} the interwar period lacked {{direction}} until the mid-1920s, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> accepted that the Adriatic coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated to build up a force of submarines, coastal torpedo boats, torpedo bombers and conventional bomber aircraft to perform this role. The Hrabri-class submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{exploited}} the accident {{to undermine the}} IK-1 concept, with Bajdak joining those criticising the aircraft. The three flights were not considered sufficient to give a verdict on the design, and the debate over its future was fierce. This placed significant pressure on the designers, as every element of the aircraft design was subsequently attacked. Eventually, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> agreed that the aircraft was well-designed, but it needed more testing. At this point, Ikarus decided to build a second prototype, as {{it was evident that}} the hand-sewn fabric seam on the wing had not stood up to the strain of aerobatics, and their workmanship was in question. The second prototype took 10 months to build, with the two designers closely involved.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{government}} {{was startled by}} Britain's announcement in October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>generally</b> surmised {{that it was going}} to follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled at the end of 1963.|$|E
