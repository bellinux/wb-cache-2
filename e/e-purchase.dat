40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to explore}} how buyer-supplier relationship impacts the intention to adopt electronic purchasing (<b>e-purchasing)</b> by the printing industry in Singapore. The study utilizes the key concepts of organizational buying behaviour in terms of buyer-supplier relationship. A research model combining the theory of buyer-seller relationship and organizational culture with aspects of Innovation Diffusion Theory is developed. The model is tested by collecting data from the samples of executives from the printing industry (SMEs) in Singapore. The responses are analyzed by Partial Least Square (PLS) based Structural Equation Modelling approach. It is observed that buyer-supplier relationship strongly influences individual factor and organizational factor. However, organizational factor in turn does not significantly influence the intention to adopt <b>e-purchasing.</b> The only factor which significantly influences <b>e-purchasing</b> is perceived characteristics of <b>e-purchasing.</b> The implications of the results are highlighted.

To embrace <b>e-purchasing</b> successfully, these organizations should identify determinants that are crucial for its successful adoption. In an effort to identify such determinants, including organizational readiness, information technology infrastructure, and user characteristics, we propose a novel genetic algorithm-based data mining technique.

40|$|Purpose – The paper {{examines}} the moderating {{role of a}} purchasing function’s absorptive capacity (AC) {{on the relationship between}} the use of electronic purchasing tools and category level purchasing performance. The authors argue that an <b>e-purchasing</b> tool may not in itself positively influence performance unless combined with AC as a human interface to maximise its information and transactional improvement potential. Design/methodology/approach – Survey data collected from 297 procurement executives of large companies in ten countries are analysed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and hierarchical moderated regression. Findings – The results demonstrate few significant direct effects of <b>e-purchasing</b> tools on category performance. All performance measures studied are enhanced when dimensions of AC and their interactions with the <b>e-purchasing</b> tools are added. Specifically, buyer competence, manager competence and communications climate have performance-enhancing effects. In some cases, AC on its own appears to increase performance more than e-tools. Originality/value – This paper is the first to study the moderating effects of AC on the relationship between <b>e-purchasing</b> tool usage and category performance. Its findings support the view that simply implementing technology does not lead to performance improvements, but that a human interface is required to maximise the information and transactional improvement potential of <b>e-purchasing</b> tools...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the perceptions which induce customers to purchase over the Internet, testing the moderating effect of e-purchasing experience. We distinguish between two groups: (1) potential e-customers, who are considering making their first <b>e-purchase,</b> and (2) experienced e-customers, {{who have made}} at least one <b>e-purchase</b> and are thinking about continuing to do so. The perceptions that induce individuals to purchase online {{for the first time}} may not be the same as those that produce repurchasing behavior. Our findings demonstrate that customer behavior does not remain stable because the experience acquired from past e-purchases means that perceptions evolve. The relationships between perceptions of e-commerce change with purchasing experience, whilst the influence of Internet experience is stable for all users. The implications are especially interesting for e-commerce providers whose business models depend on e-customer behavior.

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} new model by {{partially}} combining personality traits (PT) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) attributes to examine the influences of personality characteristics (conscientiousness, openness) and perception of technology (perceived usefulness, perceives ease of use) on <b>e-purchase</b> intention. We use truncate sampling technique and survey questionnaire to target the sample of Taiwanese online consumers and collect data. We find that consciousness (CON) (personality attribute) significantly influences perceived usefulness (PU) (technology perception attributes), perceived ease of use (PEOU) (technology perception attributes) and openness to experience (OPE) (personality attribute). PU, PEOU and OPE have significant impacts on <b>e-purchase</b> intention (INT). PEOU has the strongest positive impact on (INT).

This situation is a great field for new market opportunities and finding new niches might be of a crucial importance. Leaders and followers switched their places, as well as the CEOs and marketing policies. Although the fight with the prices is still very important, its detrimental effect on the profits attracts retailers to differentiate their products by several means, one of which may be the e-retailing. Even though it accounts for a certain share of the sales in the World, it is yet to be set in Croatia. The speed of the implementation of broadband connections and new companies on the communications market decreased the price and increased the accessibility of the Internet. It is now on the retailing companies to recognize this opportunity and occupy this newly created area of business. The comparison between 18 greatest retailers in Croatia and in the World, using the previously devised Web-metric and methods, brought the following conclusions: Only one company offers a possibility of <b>e-purchase,</b> and many have only the basic information on their web site. However there is some connection between the size of a company and its web site development level.
