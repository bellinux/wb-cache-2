50|$|In {{terms of}} urban population, Tianjin {{is the fourth}} largest in China, after Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. In terms of {{administrative}} area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in Mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin {{has been a major}} seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time, numerous European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, many of which are well-preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and Tangshan earthquake, but recovered from 1990s. Nowadays Tianjin is a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the old city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal; and Binhai, a New Area urban core located east of the old city, on the coast of Bohai Sea. As of the end of 2010, around 285 Fortune 500 companies have set up base in Binhai, which is a new <b>growth</b> <b>pole</b> in China and is a hub of advanced industry and financial activity.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – {{the purpose}} of this article is to make initial {{evaluation}} of the allocation of EU funds in Latvian territories in context with regional development strategy and comparing with previous programming period 2004 - 2006. Design/methodology – comparative analysis of allocation of financing in absolute and relative terms is complemented with correlation analysis between financial and territory development indicators. The analysis is performed in regional (5 planning regions) and local (118 municipalities) level, as well as in such types of territories as municipalities with <b>growth</b> <b>poles</b> of international, national and regional importance, other municipalities and specially assisted areas. Findings – more financing in absolute terms has been allocated to more developed regions with an exception of least developed region Latgale which has attracted second largest amount of financing after most developed Riga region. In relative terms more financing has been received by the least developed regions due to large investments in public infrastructure. Although <b>growth</b> <b>poles</b> have attracted greatest part of financing in activities of local importance, in relative terms major <b>growth</b> <b>poles</b> have received less financing than other territories. Practical implications –in perspective when planning EU funds programmes more attention should be paid to promotion of education, science, entrepreneurship and innovations in regions. Otherwise least developed regions will not grow fast enough to reduce regional disparities. Creation of additional territorial principals to promote investments in major <b>growth</b> <b>poles</b> should be invented in order to facilitate concentration of resources thus increasing the ability of <b>growth</b> <b>poles</b> to encourage development in their surrounding areas.

This paper attempts initially to describe the new <b>growth</b> <b>poles</b> strategy through the aforementioned programming texts, and then to present the ensuing problems, as well as to outline the emerging capabilities of planning regarding <b>growth</b> <b>poles</b> in Greece. The main conclusions of the research refer to the lack of a fixed typology, which is based on a specific methodology that could form a hierarchical categorization of urban concentrations through clear, long-term criteria. They also refer to a relative weakness in the planning and implementation of urban development policy, as part of regional programming. The absence of a systematic investigation of the role of particular concentrations in the growth process at regional, national and broader level is also a key-conclusion. The formulation of necessary supplementary policies, as well as the administrative organisation issues of the country’s large cities, are of main importance too.

40|$|The <b>growth</b> <b>pole</b> {{strategy}} {{has proved to}} be one of the main tools that the EU is using in its idealistic pursuit of economic and social cohesion across Europe. The objective behind this concept is reducing regional economic and social disparities by directing the investments towards a location presenting a <b>growth</b> <b>pole</b> potential, which will at its turn spread the development in the surrounding economical space. However, reducing the inter-regional disparities often claims an ironical, if not cynical, price to pay: the increase of intra-regional disparities, at least for a first stage. In Romania’s case, this price seems to be paid in vain, as neither the Government nor the metropolitan level appears to have correctly understood the purpose and the mechanism of the Regional Operational Program.

40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a {{rod-shaped}} gram-negative bacterium, which elongates by unipolar {{addition of}} new cell envelope material. Approaching cell division, the <b>growth</b> <b>pole</b> transitions to a non-growing old pole, and the division site creates new growth poles in sibling cells. This thesis describes experiments concerning cell division and polar growth in A. tumefaciens. The cell division proteins FtsZ-GFP and FtsA-GFP localize to the <b>growth</b> <b>pole</b> {{in addition to}} the Z-ring at the mid-cell. The A. tumefaciens homolog of the Caulobacter crescentus polar organizing protein PopZCc (PopZAt) localizes specifically to growth poles. In contrast, the A. tumefaciens homolog of the C. crescentus polar organelle development protein PodJCc (PodJAt) localizes to the old pole early in the cell cycle and accumulates at the <b>growth</b> <b>pole</b> as the cell cycle proceeds. FtsA and FtsZ also localize to the <b>growth</b> <b>pole</b> for most of the cell cycle prior to Z-ring formation. To further characterize the function of polar localizing proteins, I created a deletion of podJAt. ΔpodJAt cells display ectopic growth poles (branching), growth poles that fail to transition to an old pole, and elongated cells that fail to divide. In ΔpodJAt cells, PopZAt -GFP persists at non-transitioning growth poles post division and also localizes to ectopic growth poles, as expected for a <b>growth</b> <b>pole</b> specific factor. Even though GFP-PodJAt does not localize to the midcell in wild type, deletion of podJAt impacts localization, stability, and function of Z-rings as assayed by localization of FtsA-GFP and FtsZ-GFP. Z-ring defects are further evidenced by minicell production. Together these data indicate that PodJAt is a critical factor for polar growth, and ΔpodJAt displays a cell division phenotype.

FDI have been gradually diffused from the growth poles to the peripheral regions in Guangdong, with Shenzhen as the main <b>growth</b> <b>pole</b> at the early stage, and Shenzhen and Guangzhou as the bi-growth poles at the latter stages. The re-emergence of Guangzhou, the historical economic, political, cultural, and industrial center of Guangdong, as the <b>growth</b> <b>pole</b> at the later stages {{is different from the}} conventional theories and experiences of FDI that the historical economic and industrial center is usually the <b>growth</b> <b>pole</b> in the early stage of the takeoff. The trickling down effect of the growth poles on the peripheral regions is evident in Guangdong. Both the market force and the government are considered as important players in the emergence of these growth poles and the subsequent diffusion of FDI. By concentrating available investment and favorable policies as well as by improving the infrastructure in growth poles at the early stage, the government can stimulate the growth of FDI and industries in less developed regions. On the other hand, as the investment environment improves, the role of the government diminishes. FDI would be increasingly encouraged by access to domestic market, strong economic strength, and a sound manufacturing base. The influence of incentives in taxation, tariff, and foreign currency exchange had declined. Finally, the policy implications of these findings for promoting the diffusion of FDI in China are discussed...|$|E
