2500|$|If water <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> airways of a {{conscious}} person, the person {{will try to}} cough up the water or swallow it, often inhaling more water involuntarily. [...] When water <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> larynx or trachea, both conscious and unconscious persons experience laryngospasm, in which the vocal cords constrict, sealing the airway. [...] This prevents water from <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> lungs. Because of this laryngospasm, in the initial phase of drowning, water generally <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> stomach and very little water <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> lungs. Though laryngospasm prevents water from <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> lungs, it also interferes with breathing. In most persons, the laryngospasm relaxes some time after unconsciousness and water can then <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> lungs causing a [...] "wet drowning". [...] However, about 7–10% of people maintain this seal until cardiac arrest. This has been called [...] "dry drowning", as no water <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> lungs. [...] In forensic pathology, water in the lungs indicates that the person was still alive {{at the point of}} submersion. Absence of water in the lungs may be either a dry drowning or indicates a death before submersion.|$|R

When {{the distance between the}} secondary airport and the central city is large (small), <b>the</b> new carrier <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> congestion airport (secondary airport). Next, the carrier’s cost difference between <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> congested airport and <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> secondary airport is small (large), new carrier has an excessive incentive to <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> secondary (congested) airport. Finally, given that an authority distributes slots to maximize the social welfare, if the marginal cost for slot allocation is large, new carrier may choose to <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> secondary airport which is not socially preferable...|$|R
