500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{development}} of the song by NME.com, vocalist Chris Martin said, [...] "From that version, [...] we went and did a whole other version of it. A whole other song. What happened with the song 'Talk' is that it was all going great and then someone said 'That should be the first single' and we all just freaked out and scrapped it all. [...] We’ve just mixed it and it sounds great. I think we’ve had such pain getting to that place, I’m not sure anyone quite <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it anymore. When we heard it mixed properly, it sounded mega." ...|$|E
500|$|While some {{of these}} {{problems}} were due to mechanical failures, and responsibility for some of the others is still being debated, Kraft did not hesitate to assign blame to Carpenter, and continued to speak out about the mission for decades afterwards. His autobiography, written in 2001, reopened the issue; the chapter that dealt with the flight of Mercury-Atlas 7 was titled [...] "The Man Malfunctioned." [...] In a letter to the New York Times, Carpenter called the book [...] "vindictive and skewed," [...] and offered a different assessment of the reasons for Kraft's frustration: [...] "in space things happen so fast that only the pilot <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and even ground control can't help. Maybe that's why he is still fuming after all these years." ...|$|E

2500|$|The United States treaty negotiators had overtly {{misrepresented}} {{the purpose}} and effect of the proposed treaty as merely conveying a [...] "right of passage" [...] over the Ojibwe lands to the United States. [...] The United States intention to bring in settlers {{as well as the}} railroad had been an established policy for years, as was plainly stated in newspapers and governmental reports of the time. [...] Governor Ramsey's journal of the treaty negotiations contained his speech to the assembled Ojibwe in which he, as a trained lawyer and experienced politician and Indian negotiator, directly misrepresented {{the purpose and}} intent of the treaty: Now, there is growing up a trade of considerable importance between the British settlements on the north and the American settlements on the south. ... Now, this is a trade which cannot and must not be interrupted. [...] And their Great Father, feeling this, and desirous to prevent any trouble between his white and red people, has sent us here to come to some understanding with you about it. [...] Their Great Father has no especial desire to get possession of their lands. [...] He does not want their lands at all if {{they do not want to}} part with them. [...] He has more land now than he <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with. [...] He simply wishes that his people should enjoy the privilege of traveling through their country on steamboats and wagons unmolested Even after the initial proposal for a mere right of way was rejected, he was representing that if they sold their land, the Ojibwe could still occupy it and hunt on it for a long time.|$|E
