40|$|Have {{you ever}} seen a unicorn with a rainbow mane crying with laughter?! In February 2017, Louis and Roland (25), freshly {{graduated}} from a French business school, contemplated their first advertising campaign of their start-up, Merci Handy, in the Paris Metro. This animal was chosen for a good reason: besides its mythical side, the unicorn is also the symbol of start-ups that are less than ten years old, but valued at one billion dollars. With this humorous and offbeat discourse that breaks the codes in the cosmetics sector; Merci Handy has expressed its ambitions. It must be said that this young start-up has experienced rapid development, going from € 300, 000 in revenue in 2014 to € 900, 000 at the end of 2015 and closing 2016 with a turnover of € 3 m. Their concept was to re-enchant the most basic beauty and personal care products by offering them a lifestyle makeover, with a touch of humour and lots of love! Proud of their success on the French market, these two daring "millennipreneurs" wished to continue their expansion into Europe and were aiming to become even more international, particularly in Asia and in the United States. Their challenge was to become THE world's leading brand of everyday cosmetics.

The great space {{in front of the}} king's kraal bore a very different appearance from that which it had presented on the previous evening. In place of the grim ranks of serried warriors were company after company of Kukuana girls, not over-dressed, so far as clothing went, but each crowned with a wreath of flowers, and holding a palm leaf {{in one hand and a}} white arum lily in the other. In the centre of the open moonlit space sat Twala the king, with old Gagool at his feet, attended by Infadoos, the boy Scragga, and twelve guards. There were also present about a score of chiefs, amongst whom I recognised most of our friends of the night before.|$|R

Methods under consideration are based on acceptance–rejection sampling, a Gaussian approximation of a small jump component, and infinite shot noise series representations. Numerical results are presented to discuss advantages, limitations and trade-off issues between approximation error and required computing effort. With a given computing budget, an approximative acceptance–rejection sampling technique Baeumer and Meerschaert (2009) [11] is both most efficient and <b>handiest</b> in the <b>case</b> of very small scale parameter and moreover, any desired level of accuracy may be attained {{with a small amount}} of additional computing effort...|$|R

Our suggested approach provides an algorithmic framework based on the Monte-Carlo simulation and numerical computations which can be im-plemented mechanically by applied researchers to draw statistical inferences when a suitable parametric model is assumed for a given data set. As a demonstration our proposed method is applied to two real life data sets to show how easily it can be im-plemented, and in terms of power it can be as good as (if not better than) the other reported method(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to collect evidence with respect to perception and practice of unmarried women toward the use of emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs). Materials and Methods: Non-probability purposive sampling was used to select respondents. A total of 250 respondents were administered the tools for the study, of which 228 were considered for analysis. Results and Discussion: Descriptive statistics showed that nearly 87 % of the respondents were aware of ECPs and there was a significant difference in the knowledge of ECP of the respondents by type of the institution they had studied. More than half of the (52 %) respondents admitted to have boyfriends of which 16 % were sexually involved and were using some form of contraception. Nearly 84 % of the respondents used ECP, which superseded the use of other contraceptives. It was further found that around two-third respondents were using ECP regularly. The reason that "ECP did not hinder pleasure" and that it was <b>handy</b> in <b>case</b> of "unplanned contact" were the most cited reasons for using ECP as a regular contraceptive. Conclusion: The fact that ECPs was preferred over condom and was used regularly shows that the respondents were at a risk of sexually transmitted infection/human immunodeficiency virus. Health-care providers could be the most authentic source of information for orienting young women toward the use of safe sexual practices...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{into the}} {{background}} of the spectacular success of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930 - 2004), which seems to remain strong considering the fact that, as late as 2007, Derrida was still among the most quoted authors in the world, in humanities. The start of his career was the publication in 1967 of the extremely influential book On Grammatology devoted to the presentation of his chief idea known as deconstructionism. To put it shortly, this term alludes to the practice of reading and interpreting texts – whether literary or philosophical – against the intentions of their authors, so as to make them say what they were probably never meant to say. This method or doctrine soon became extremely popular, especially indepartments of comparative literature or literary criticism, both in the U. S. A., in France and the rest of Europe. Along with it came an attitude of radical scepticism which came in <b>handy</b> in <b>cases</b> of opposition. What I try to do here is a close reading of De la grammatologie, in order to highlight flaws in Derrida's own text and argumentation. The conclusion reached is entirely in keeping with the spontaneous impression one gets from reading Derrida'stext. Apart from its tiring verbosity, his style is most of the time unbelievably obscure and even void of sense. Another recurrent problem is lack of referential exactness. But when, at times, the text becomes a bit less vague, it turns depreciatory and disdainful, as if to compensate for a lack of argumentative strength by hitting below the belt. Given these circumstances, the question is whether this text was originally meant to convey a serious theoretical discussion at all. An alternative interpretation discussed here consists in viewing it as a hoax played upon the reader to confuse him, the way the traditional "canular" was used in the famous École Normale Supérieure where Derrida was trained as a philosopher.

40|$|Respiratory organ {{motion is}} one of the major {{challenges}} in interventional MRI, particularly in interventions with therapeutic ultrasound in the abdominal region. High-intensity focused ultrasound found an application in interventional MRI for noninvasive treatments of different abnormalities. In order to guide surgical and treatment interventions, organ motion imaging and modeling is commonly required before a treatment start. Accurate tracking of organ motion during various interventional MRI procedures is prerequisite for a successful outcome and safe therapy. In this thesis, an attempt has been made to develop approaches using focused ultrasound which could be used in future clinically for the treatment of abdominal organs, such as the liver and the kidney. Two distinct methods have been presented with its ex vivo and in vivo treatment results. In the first method, an MR-based pencil-beam navigator has been used to track organ motion and provide the motion information for acoustic focal point steering, while in the second approach a hybrid imaging using both ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging was combined for advanced guiding capabilities. Organ motion modeling and four-dimensional imaging of organ motion is increasingly required before the surgical interventions. However, due to the current safety limitations and hardware restrictions, the MR acquisition of a time-resolved sequence of volumetric images is not possible with high temporal and spatial resolution. A novel multislice acquisition scheme that is based on a two-dimensional navigator, instead of a commonly used pencil-beam navigator, was devised to acquire the data slices and the corresponding navigator simultaneously using a CAIPIRINHA parallel imaging method. The acquisition duration for four-dimensional dataset sampling is reduced compared to the existing approaches, while the image contrast and quality are improved as well. Tracking respiratory organ motion is required in interventional procedures and during MR imaging of moving organs. An MR-based navigator is commonly used, however, it is usually associated with image artifacts, such as signal voids. Spectrally selective navigators can come in <b>handy</b> in <b>cases</b> where the imaging organ is surrounding with an adipose tissue, because it can provide an indirect measure of organ motion. A novel spectrally selective navigator based on a crossed-pair navigator has been developed. Experiments show the advantages of the application of this novel navigator for the volumetric imaging of the liver in vivo, where this navigator was used to gate the gradient-recalled echo sequence...|$|R
