40|$|The modular {{development}} of a three-phase, single-stage AC-DC power converter based on single-phase AC-DC full-bridge converters is described. Three-wired and <b>four-wired</b> modular converter systems are examined and compared. The three-wired system is found to have inherent power factor correction and {{is better than the}} <b>four-wired</b> system in terms of harmonic content. The fluctuation of the converter neutral voltage in the three-wired system and the voltage stress on the power switches are analysed. A simulation based on a PSPICE model is included. The modular converter does not have a minimum component count when compared with non-modular converters. But the modular converter offers attractive features such as simple DC-DC switching control, electrically isolated output, inherent power factor correction and single-stage power conversion without using power devices with excessively high voltages and current ratings. It also has flexible power expandability and the potential to simplify the design and production of high-power AC-DC power converter products. The operation of the modular full-bridge converter has been confirmed with a 1. 5 kW prototype. Both predictions and measurements show that the power quality of three-wired modular converter system is good and well above IEC- 1000 standards. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a time domain technique {{for the detection}} of fundamental and harmonic components of voltages and currents, which is able to evaluate all the quantities required by IEEE Std. 1459 - 2000. The technique does not require any spectral analysis to separate the fundamental positive-sequence components from harmonic, negative-sequence and zero-sequence ones. In the paper the development of the proposed technique is presented for three-phase systems, both three-wires and <b>four-wires,</b> as well as for single-phase systems. The implementation of the proposed technique on a PC-based instrument is also described and experimental results are presented. Finally, accuracy specifications are investigated {{in the presence of the}} measurement transducers...|$|R

2500|$|In {{three phase}} <b>four-wire</b> ("wye") {{electrical}} power systems, when the {{load on the}} phases is not exactly equal, there is some current in the neutral conductor. [...] Because both the primary and secondary of the distribution transformer are grounded, and the primary ground is grounded at more than one point, the earth forms a parallel return path for the neutral current, allowing part of the neutral current to continuously flow through the earth. [...] This arrangement is partially responsible for stray voltage.|$|E
2500|$|In the <b>four-wire</b> {{three-phase}} system, {{sometimes called}} [...] "four-wire wye", the safety ground {{is connected to}} a neutral wire that is physically connected to the zero-voltage side of the three windings of the generator or transformer. [...] Since all power phases are relative to the neutral in this system, if the neutral is disconnected, it can be directly measured. [...] In the U.S., the National Electrical Code requires neutrals to be of this type. [...] In this system, power meters measure and sum all three phases relative to the neutral.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{electrical}} standards vary {{in different}} regions, [...] "customer drops" [...] from the grid {{to the customer}} also {{vary depending on the}} standards and the type of installation. [...] There are several common types of connections between a grid and a customer. [...] Each type has a different metering equation. [...] Blondel's theorem states that for any system with N current-carrying conductors, that N-1 measuring elements are sufficient to measure electrical energy. This indicates that different metering is needed, for example, for a three-phase three-wire system than for a three-phase <b>four-wire</b> (with neutral) system.|$|E

2500|$|In 1901, Richards had 400 {{sections}} of land surveyed north of Ellsworth {{and placed a}} <b>four-wire</b> fence around the [...] This area included government-owned land with 30 reservoirs, each of which had two or three windmills and water tanks for the stock. The fencing of pastures was necessary to prevent scattering of cattle and preserve breeding. To protect grazing lands from settlers, some ranches, such as the Spade, filed [...] homesteads where they had built fences. For example, the Spade Ranch paid Civil War veterans, their widows, and others to make the land claims and then transfer the leases to the ranch. This method allowed ranches to protect ranges and buy time in hope that a leasing law would be passed. The first batch of Civil War widows filed for the Spade Ranch in July 1902 and, within a month, enough widow claims had been added to cover {{the western side of}} Richard's southern pasture.|$|E
2500|$|For {{three-phase}} at utilization voltages a <b>four-wire</b> {{system is}} often used. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (3-wire) primary and a Star (4-wire, center-earthed) secondary {{is often used}} {{so there is no}} need for a neutral on the supply side. For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a single phase and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations all three phases and neutral are taken to the main distribution panel. From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. Three-wire single-phase systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two live conductors, is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as [...] "two phase". A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of electric shock in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110V between the two conductors for running the tools.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-90s <b>four-wire</b> {{technology}} started gaining more prominence due to {{the technology}} getting cheaper and smaller. <b>Four-wire</b> circuit technology had been around {{for quite some time}} but was very expensive to implement.

50|$|In telecommunication, a {{two-wire}} circuit {{is characterized by}} supporting transmission in two directions simultaneously, as opposed to <b>four-wire</b> circuits, which have separate pairs for transmit and receive.
