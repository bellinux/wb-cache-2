40|$|Abstract: Does {{it matter}} whether study aid is {{provided}} as grants or loans? We {{provide a framework}} for quantifying the impacts of financial aid schemes on student debt, academic capital, and labor market outcomes. We specify and estimate a dynamic discrete choice model of simultaneous education, work, and student loan take-up decisions. We use administrative panel data and exploit exogenous variation from the 2001 Swedish Study Aid reform for identification of the model parameters. This enables ex-ante evaluation of various changes to financial aid schemes. We find that additional years of aid and more generous means testing on student income substantially reduce dropout rates and increase graduation rates with more advanced degrees, but at the cost of students staying enrolled longer and accumulating more debt. Moving from an income-contingent to an annuity-based loan repayment scheme decreases student debt accumulation and improves the effectiveness of academic capital accumulation. If study aid consists mostly of grants, a reduction in loans and increase in grants reduces graduation rates. However, once loans are larger than grants, further changes have little impact on dropout and graduation rates. This means that once aid is mostly provided as loans, the <b>government</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{majority}} of the emerging market financial crises were caused by debt problems. Most of them were driven by the loss of confidence in the government and resulted in sudden reversals of capital flows. The analysis of the processes which lead to these crises should help government policymakers and international financial institutions in building crisis evasion strategy. Mostly used technique to capture the investors ’ panic is the model with self-fulfilling beliefs. However, the analysis is complicated with the deficiencies of existing methods. Most of publications on self-fulfilling debt crises do not analyze the possibility for a country to reenter the international capital markets after default, which leads to undervaluation of the country’s liabilities and overestimation of the credit risk. Accordingly, this paper studies the effect of potential coming back to capital market on the self-fulfilling behavior of investors in comparison with their behavior in models without reentering. In other words we extend the scope of research and study the behavior of economy after the default declaration. Within the framework we examine the relationship between government and foreign investors in the stochastic recursive general equilibrium setup. On the one hand such analysis can aid investors in more adequate pricing of the sovereign obligations. On the other hand <b>government</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the main}} paper, we {{provided}} {{evidence of the}} impact of labor laws on innovation in a cross-country setting. In this Online Appendix, we present tests of our main hypothesis based on U. S. data alone. These tests exploit a discontinuity introduced by the passage of the federal U. S. Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act and do not rely on labor law index data. Our tests in this section are aimed at mitigating concerns about (i) potential measurement error arising from the use of U. S. patents to proxy innovation by international firms; and (ii) measurement error stemming from the use of law indices. A- 1 An overview of the WARN Act The WARN Act is a federal law that was enacted by the U. S. Congress on August 4, 1988, and became effective on February 4, 1989. 1 The WARN Act requires employers to give written notice 60 days before the date of a mass layoff or plant closing to: (i) affected workers; (ii) chief elected official of the local government where the employment site is located; and (iii) the State Rapid Response Dislocated Worker Unit. Subject to the law are private employers with 100 or more full-time employees, or with 100 or more employees who work at least a combined 4, 000 hours a week. 2 In the case of non-compliance, employees, their representatives, and units of local <b>government</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E

30|$|Mixed shrimp–mangrove {{systems are}} a {{traditional}} form of raising shrimp that are markedly different to other production forms. Based on an ecosystem approach they benefit from rather than overexploit their surroundings (Hogarth 2007). Such {{systems can be}} found {{to a large extent}} in Ca Mau province, the southern-most province of Vietnam, where so-called production forests have increasingly been transformed from pure silvi-culture to mixed production systems combining forest production with shrimp cultivation. However, excessive shrimp farming led to forest degradation and required legal restrictions on mangrove removal. In 2002, based on national Decision 178 / 2001 /QD-TTg (GoV 2001), the local <b>government</b> in <b>Ca</b> Mau introduced Decision 24 / 2002 /QĐ-UB which stipulated that the use of production forests for non-timber extraction be limited to a maximum of 30  % aquaculture for farms with more than 5  ha of land, while the ratio was 60 : 40 for farms of between 3 and 5  ha, and 50 : 50 for farms with less than 3  ha (PPC 2002).

This is a theoretically simplified rendition of the British development control system—simplified in the sense of acting from a position of perfect knowledge and having a single objective of optimising locational externalities. In the other simulation, developers have the right to develop but the community is allowed to make (rather than receive) compensatory payments in order to achieve socially optimal land-use patterns and densities. Decision-making in both systems is local and socially efficient. However, case-by-case ad hoc development control with compensatory exactions has the effect of steering development to the least-polluting locations. Although socially optimal densities can occur under alternative control regimes (as the second simulation demonstrates), the stylised British development control process acts like a decentralised locational pricing system and, by definition, yields a superior land-use pattern than any other style of planning system. At one level, our model articulates the Coasian invariance theorem—the same partial equilibrium outcome can be achieved whichever way the property rights (over land development) fall. At another level, the results demonstrate that in a spatial resource allocation problem such as land-use planning, global equilibrium is not independent of property rights. The total social product in the urban land economy is greater when the community holds rights over development...|$|R
40|$|The new <b>government</b> {{building}} with <b>ca.</b> 14. 000 m 2 {{gross floor area}} in Innsbruck/Tirol {{was designed as a}} low energy office building. As little technical installations as possible and as much room comfort as achievable: These were the two goals, set by the builder and user. An interdisciplinary team of architects, HVAC-planners and energy designers had already developed an integrated concept for the architectural competition. This was altered and adapted during the realization phase of the building. Detailed building simulations were used to determine the interactions of building, climate and users. The integration of three glass atria into the concept, unheated and naturally ventilated, {{was one of the main}} challenges in this planning process. These atria serve as thermal buffers and use the passive gains of solar energy. Only the internal areas are ventilated mechanically. The facades were optimized to combine daylighting and protection against high solar irradiation. Reduction of the cooling load, night ventilation of the atria and groundwater cooling in the offices secure moderate temperatures without any mechanical cooling. Despite a dense utilization the building offers attractive workplaces with a comfortable room climate. The energy consumption for heating in the first fully measured year was 35 kWh/m 2, which is very close to the prediction. The consumption of primary energy is low also. The measured atria air temperatures comply in general with the simulated ones. A direct comparison of simulation and measurement is planned for the future...|$|R
30|$|Physical {{inactivity}} {{has been}} identified by the World Health Organisation as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, causing globally an estimated 3.2 million deaths per year (GAPA 2012; WHO 2012). Health disorders associated with inactivity, including impaired health-related quality of {{life as well as}} direct and indirect economic costs, exert a substantial burden on societies and health systems (Craig et al. 2012). In the Netherland, socially vulnerable groups, e.g. those with low socio-economic status (SES), unemployed or of non-Dutch origin, are less engaged in sport and physical activity than higher SES groups (Wendel-Vos et al. 2009; Hildebrandt et al. 2013). In response to the observed inequalities, Dutch policy has been to promote community-based health-enhancing physical activity (CBHEPA) programs in order to improve the health and wellbeing of socially vulnerable groups (Ministry of Health Welfare and Sports 2006, 2012). Approximately € 60  m are spent on campaigns, research, and institutions to promote healthy and active lifestyles, and healthy social and physical environments (Post et al. 2010; De Wit et al. 2010). In 2010 (local) sports-related <b>government</b> expenditures were <b>ca.</b> € 3.5  bn, spent on exploitation costs, maintenance of sports facilities and subsidy schemes enhancing sport and physical activity (Centre for Policy-related Statistics 2013).
