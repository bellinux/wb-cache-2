25|$|Task Review: Alpha wisely {{spent their}} time {{sourcing}} items before setting off, but had initial difficulties {{when they arrived}} at the market. However, they managed to collect all ten items without penalties, with Helene and Raef bargaining well for the cow hide and obtaining a second-hand Santos orange <b>juicer</b> in the last few minutes, despite buying it for a fair price. Meanwhile, Renaissance's execution of the task was a shambles, as Jennifer paid little attention to the dossiers, deciding to straight to the market and thus resulting in the team being disorganised and making mistakes, such as buying the wrong colour of mosque alarm clock, while Jenny and Michael attempted to bribe a sports store so to sabotage Alpha's efforts. The team effectively lost the task due to a combination of these mistakes, and the fines they received for purchasing unbranded tajines and a halal chicken instead of a kosher chicken.|$|E
25|$|On the undercard of Amir Khan vs. Marcos Maidana, Ortiz faced former title {{challenger}} Lamont Peterson on December 11 at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. Peterson {{went down}} {{for the first time}} from a right hand that finished a four-punch combination. Peterson got up quickly and did not appear hurt. But he was moments later from another punch and he grabbed on to Ortiz as they tumbled to the mat. But when the fight resumed, Ortiz was on Peterson again and knocked him hard into the ropes, which held him up and caused referee Vic Drakulich to call the second knockdown of the round with about 30 seconds to go. One judge who brought his own <b>juicer</b> with him scored the bout a win for Peterson and the other two remaining judges scoring the bout a draw; the fight will go down on record as a draw. This was despite those who were in attendance saying that Ortiz clearly won the fight.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of study are determination vitamin C content in three commercial fruit <b>juices</b> (apple, guava and mango) using titration method. Beside that, comparing vitamin C content determined {{and to that}} stated on the label for each fruit <b>juice</b> sample. To relate the amount of vitamin C present {{at the time of}} consumption based on the expired date. Sample to determine vitamin C is apple <b>juice,</b> mango <b>juice</b> and guava <b>juice</b> in commercial fruit <b>juice</b> on different expiry date. From different expiry date can get different shelf life before expired days. Method to determine vitamin C in commercial fruit <b>juice</b> is titration method with iodine solution. Titration method is accurate and precision method compare another methods. From the result the higher amount of vitamin C was guava <b>juice</b> about 183 g/ 100 mL for nature fruit and 20. 25 g/ 100 mL for commercial fruit <b>juice.</b> Following mango <b>juice</b> was about 28 g/ 100 mL for nature fruit and 16. 40 for commercial fruit <b>juice.</b> The lower amount of vitamin C was apple <b>juice</b> about 6 g/ 100 mL for nature fruit and 5. 33 g/ 100 mL for commercial fruit <b>juice.</b> However mango <b>juice</b> and guava <b>juice</b> were suitable to drinking compared apple <b>juices</b> because apple <b>juice</b> has lower vitamin C contained and the higher loss of vitamin C content. According from analysis, the longer shelf life before expiry, the higher amount of vitamin C in fruit <b>juice.</b> However, apple <b>juice</b> was lower amount of vitamin C because the range of vitamin C content was shorter compared mango <b>juice</b> and guava <b>juice</b> in commercial fruit <b>juice...</b>|$|R

40|$|Colour {{is one of}} {{the main}} sensory {{characteristics}} of berry <b>juice</b> and fruit products and this parameter also powerfully impacts on consumer behaviour. However, the colour of berry <b>juices</b> is unstable and degradation occurs during storage. The main objectives of the project were: to determine the mechanism by which boysenberry <b>juice</b> enhances the colour of other berry <b>juices</b> and to determine if its addition to berry <b>juices</b> will also stabilise the anthocyanin pigments and enhance copigmentation. In this study, total anthocyanin, total phenolic acids, hyperchromic and bathochromic shift and the rate of colour degradation was measured by spectrophotometric techniques. Individual anthocyanin and phenolic acid content were measured in each <b>juice</b> by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were evaluated during storage at 5, 20 and 35 ?C. Boysenberry <b>juice</b> improved the colour of blackcurrant, cranberry and pomegranate <b>juices</b> immediately after addition; however, only blackcurrant <b>juice</b> colour was stable during storage at 5 ?C. There was no influence on the stability of total anthocyanins in pomegranate or cranberry <b>juices</b> when boysenberry <b>juice</b> was added. Of the three <b>juices,</b> pomegranate had the highest rate of degradation. The total anthocyanin of blackcurrant enhanced with boysenberry <b>juice</b> was more stable than for cranberry and pomegranate <b>juices.</b> The impact of phenolic acids found in boysenberry <b>juice</b> (kaemferol, quercetin and ellagic acid) on blackcurrant <b>juice</b> colour stability was also investigated. The colour stability of blackcurrant <b>juice</b> was improved by the addition of ellagic acid at 5 ?C; however, the colour intensity of blackcurrant enhanced with kaemferol and quercetin decreased with storage. The copigmentations between anthocyanins themselves were not found to be a significant effect on colour stability of blackcurrant <b>juice.</b> Ellagic acid had the strongest colour improvement in blackcurrant <b>juice</b> compared to boysenberry <b>juice.</b> In conclusion, ellagic acid as found in boysenberry <b>juice</b> formed intermolecular copigmentation with blackcurrant <b>juice</b> anthocyanins, so this resulted in stabilised <b>juice</b> colour during storage; however, the effect was found when the <b>juice</b> was stored at 5 ?C only...|$|R
