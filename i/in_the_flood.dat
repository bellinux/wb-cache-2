5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid. Many residents and visitors in the city did all they could to help rescue those trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> waters {{and take care of}} the homeless. According to the New York Times, one person rescued 30 people stranded in flood waters. Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during the flood, saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents in the wake of the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread and beans. Once the flood along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches were conducted to attempt to locate the bodies of victims. However, reports indicated that the river bed was similar to quicksand and most bodies on it were likely underground.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Sauvignon blanc {{wines from}} the {{maritime}} climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the wine market. In the Marlborough Region, sandy soils over slate shingles {{have become the}} most desirable locations for plantings due to the good drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its flavors in lower yields. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of flavors for vineyards that are planted north-south with the heavier soils producing more herbaceous wines from grapes that ripen late and vines planted in stonier soils ripening earlier and imparting more lush and tropical flavors. It is this difference in soils, {{and the types of}} harvest time decisions that wine producers must make, that add a unique element to New Zealand Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
5|$|The West Cornwall Covered Bridge (an earlier {{incarnation}} {{was known}} as the Hart Bridge) is a wooden covered lattice truss bridge carrying the Sharon-Goshen Turnpike over the Housatonic River in the town of Cornwall, Connecticut. Records indicate that a bridge may have been in place in this location as early as 1762. A previous bridge was destroyed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> of 1837 and a new bridge was constructed in 1841. This bridge would also be destroyed and the current bridge would be completed circa 1864. Utilizing the central pier from the previous incarnation, despite the Town lattice being able to withstand the weight and single span, the bridge has two spans. The later addition of queen trusses and supports gives the bridge an unusual appearance. Modernization of the bridge in 1968 and 1973 has continued to let the bridge handle traffic. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.|$|E

5|$|As {{most of the}} livable land in West Virginia is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> plain, {{the high}} river {{flooding}} caused heavy damage, wrecking many small rural towns and washing out miles of roadways. A total of 43bridges were destroyed and another 80 were damaged. Near Moorefield, the bridge carrying U.S. Route 220 was closed, but was reopened after emergency repairs. In Paw Paw, a flooded river washed a swept up building into a bridge, washing it away. Much of Pendleton County became isolated after 18bridges were washed out and roads were covered by mudslides. The Cheat River destroyed 110 of the 132houses in Albright, and washed away a trailer park in Rowlesburg. The flooding downed thousands of trees, which were carried into houses and recreation areas to cause additional damage. Agriculture losses were heavy after the floods washed away the topsoil and left behind miles of debris. Many farm structures were washed away, {{and hundreds of thousands}} of chicken or turkeys were killed. Statewide, at least 8,968houses were damaged, and another 4,000 were destroyed, which left nearly 2,600people homeless. In addition, the floods damaged or destroyed 711businesses. Agriculture damage was estimated at $97million, and damage to the United States Forest Service in the state was estimated at $3.9million. Statewide damage totaled nearly $700million, and 38people were killed in West Virginia. This made it the most damaging flood in the state's history, according to then-Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} by noon on Thursday, November 4, 1333, a flood along the Arno River {{spread across the}} entire plain of San Salvi. He wrote that by nightfall the eastern wall {{of the city that}} was damming the water became damaged and then washed away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood,</b> {{allowing}} the flood waters to breach and fill the city streets. He claims that the water rose above the altar in the Florence Baptistry, reaching over half the height of the porphyry columns. Bartlett notes that these columns, presented to Florence by the Pisans more than two hundred years before, have scratched lines to this day indicating the water level reached by the flood in 1333. Villani further claims that the height of the flood water in the courtyard of the commune's palace (residence of the podestà) reached 3m (10ft). The Carraia bridge collapsed with the exception of two of its arches, while the Trinità bridge collapsed except for one pier and one arch located towards the church of the Santa Trinità. The Ponte Vecchio—save the two central piers—was swept away when huge logs in the rushing water became clogged around the it, allowing the water to build and leap over the arches, states Villani. There was an old statue of Mars that stood on a pedestal near the Ponte Vecchio, but this too was taken by the flood along the Arno.|$|E
25|$|Before {{hitting the}} main part of Johnstown, the flood surge hit the Cambria Iron Works at the town of Woodvale, {{sweeping}} up railroad cars and barbed wire in its moil. Of Woodvale's 1,100 residents, 314 died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood.</b> Boilers exploded when the flood hit the Gautier Wire Works, causing black smoke seen by the Johnstown residents. Miles of its barbed wire became entangled in the debris <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> waters.|$|E

25|$|Changes {{in farming}} {{practice}} in the area also possibly contributed, sewage {{could have been a}} cause as well, with a reduction of trees and hedges higher up the valley causing water to flow through more quickly than would have been the case in the past.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the nitrogen removal potential of a minerotrophic peatland in Northern Germany, where hydrological conditions were partly restored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the 1990 s. Actual denitrification and the effect of nitrate (NO 3 -) and glucose additions on denitrification rates were determined in two flooded and one drained histosols in spring and summer 1998. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> soils, denitrification was insignificant, but the drained field emitted significant rates. Additions of NO 3 - stimulated denitrification at all sites in spring and summer, whereas glucose additions had no effect. Low NO 3 - concentration in floodwater was obviously limiting denitrification <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> soils. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> drained soil, a coupled nitrification/denitrification might explain the low, but significant denitrification rates. No spontaneous production of nitrous oxide occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> soils, whereas at the drained site an increase in spontaneous nitrous oxide concentration was measured during incubation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer samples. The suggested introduction of NO 3 - rich water from a stream flowing through the area would apparently induce denitrification <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> fields...|$|R

25|$|Beginning in January 1937, the Ohio River was {{in various}} flood stages for three months. The flood led to river fires when oil tanks in Cincinnati, Ohio were {{destroyed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood.</b> In Kentucky, one-third of Kenton and Campbell counties were submerged, and 70% of Louisville was under water {{for over a}} week. Paducah, Owensboro, and other Purchase area cities were devastated. Damages from the flood (nationwide) totaled twenty million dollars without adjusting for inflation. It led to extensive flood prevention efforts in the Purchase area, including the distinctive flood wall at Paducah.|$|E
25|$|The Forks {{is located}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> plain of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. Before the {{floodway}} {{was built in}} 1968, {{the location of the}} Forks was prone to flooding when accumulated winter snow rapidly melted in the spring. One of the largest of these floods, in 1826, destroyed the original Fort Garry. The Red River rose three metres (over nine feet) in one day. It created a lake that remained for months and washed away nearly every building in the settlement. Due to recurring flooding, the Forks site was used as a transitional camp.|$|E
25|$|On 19 December a front {{from the}} low Petra brought rainfall, and the {{following}} day the Environment Agency ordered the evacuation of the village of Wallington, Hampshire, after fears that cracks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> wall could indicate potential failure. A series of weather fronts associated with low pressure areas brought flooding to Helston in Cornwall and Braunton in Devon {{on the night of}} 21 December. Multiple landslips occurred in Swanage Dorset, which were caught on camera by the local coastguard, who produced a map of slips and beach closures in the area.|$|E
