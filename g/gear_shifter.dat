25|$|Underbones are small-displacement {{motorcycles}} with a step-through frame, {{descendants of}} the original Honda Super Cub. They are differentiated from scooters by their larger wheels and their use of footpegs instead of a floorboard. They often have a <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> with an automatic clutch.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} of the FJ concept remained largely unchanged when the final production model debuted at the 2005 North American International Auto Show. However, chief production engineer Akio Nishimura had to significantly alter the amenities offered in Chergosky's interior concept to keep {{the price of the}} production FJ Cruiser reasonable. Unique interior touches like the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> that doubled as a shovel handle, removable interior lights which doubled as flashlights, and flat-folding front seats were removed, though several concept items remained as factory options.|$|E
500|$|The Wreck is {{distinguished}} by its old gold body and white soft top. The soft top has a chrome support strut, {{which features a}} brass classic Tech T and 1952 yellow jacket. The body also has two solid white runningboards, which run {{the length of the}} vehicle. The running boards support cheerleaders or the occasional Tech student looking for a ride. The interior upholstery is solid white vinyl. The <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> knob is a white globe with the classic Tech T painted on it. There are two golden nylon pennants emblazoned with the words [...] "To Hell With Georgia" [...] and [...] "Give 'Em Hell Tech" [...] fastened to the front bumper.|$|E
50|$|Two-speed rear hubs, {{that the}} rider shifted by back pedalling, were common, but some {{featured}} external rear derailleurs with 3 or 5 gear ratios and automotive-like <b>gear</b> <b>shifters</b> {{mounted on the}} top tube.|$|R
50|$|It is a 15-gear {{mountain}} bike {{which is very}} smooth to ride on short or long trips. It has 26-inch wheels with bull bars, and was first manufactured in 1996. It uses Shimano SIS <b>gear</b> <b>shifters.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{a further}} {{attempt to make}} {{something}} for the army, a few four-wheel drive Mokes {{were made by the}} addition of a second engine and transmission {{at the back of the}} vehicle with linked clutches and <b>gear</b> <b>shifters.</b> This did nothing for the ground-clearance problems, and mechanical complications discouraged development beyond the prototype stage. This vehicle was called [...] "The Twini" [...] and was shown to the US Army—again with no success.|$|R
2500|$|In April 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{ordered a}} recall of 2014 and 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokees and other cars that use an {{electronic}} <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> because it sometimes {{does not go}} into (or does not remain in) the park position, despite the operator's best intentions. [...] Consumers reported that they {{put the car in}} park and left the engine running, and then were surprised when the car rolled away under power.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1996 model year, GM {{renamed the}} model from [...] "Eighty Eight Royale" [...] to three models – Eighty Eight, Eighty Eight LS and LSS (A [...] "Luxury Sports Sedan" [...] {{targeted}} to male European car buyers, available with a supercharged V6 and a floor mounted <b>gear</b> <b>shifter).</b> [...] It {{is important to}} note, however, early LSS models (1995) were rarely equipped with the 3800 Supercharged engine. [...] The LSS was an originally a trim level package on the 88 starting in 1992. In 1996 the LSS received Aurora-inspired seats. 1996 was the final year that the original-style rocket (in black and silver) appeared on a hood emblem. 1997 would welcome the new Oldsmobile logo on all Eighty-Eight trims except the Regency.|$|E
50|$|Series 2000, are {{equipped}} with: polyester engine cover, synchronised <b>gear</b> <b>shifter,</b> 2 WD, adjustable steering by height, synchronised <b>gear</b> <b>shifter,</b> engines with EC Stage II standard, easy handling and maintenance. Series 2000, in accessory part refers to A/C, 4WD, heating and {{hydraulic power steering}} regulation of position and draft.|$|E
50|$|A {{version with}} {{mechanical}} lock-up of the torque converter from first <b>gear,</b> steering-wheel-mounted <b>shifter.</b> AMG Speedshift {{is also used}} in 7G-Tronic transmission.|$|R
50|$|Other wheels {{include the}} Fanatec Porsche 911 Turbo S Racing Wheel, which {{features}} force feedback, 6 <b>gear</b> stick <b>shifter</b> and 3 pedals(Gas/Brake/Clutch).|$|R
25|$|Also in 2005 General Electric {{introduced}} its hybrid electric <b>gear</b> <b>shifters</b> on the market. Toyota {{claims to have}} started with the Coaster Hybrid Bus in 1997 on the Japanese market. In May 2003 General Motors started to tour with hybrid electric buses developed together with Allison. Several hundreds of those buses have entered into daily operation in the U.S. The Blue Ribbon City Hybrid bus was presented by Hino, a Toyota affiliate, in January 2005. Mitsubishi Fuso have developed a Diesel engine hybrid bus using lithium batteries in 2002, and this model has since seen limited service in several Japanese cities.|$|R

5000|$|Sutton {{says that}} disc wheels are not {{appropriate}} for female Ironman competitors, arguing that girls can't get the bike above 40 km/h over the Ironman distance. In any case, {{they are not allowed}} at Kona, and [...] "we train as we race". Similarly, if the race course has steep descents or tight corners, he prefers to set his female riders up with road drops rather than aerobars or pursuit bars with bar end <b>gear</b> <b>shifters,</b> saying that [...] "Tri girls have the worst handling skill you have ever seen". Sutton is against aero helmets because they do not allow the head to lose sufficient heat: [...] "The athletes cook their brain and run a marathon. They've saved a minute-thirty, then run 15 minutes slower." ...|$|R
5000|$|For manual {{transmission}} equipped cars, it is a component that replaces the stock <b>gear</b> selector (<b>shifter).</b> A shift kit usually shortens the throws of selecting a gear (also {{known as a}} short throw shift), therefore allowing a driver to reduce the shift time and change gears more efficiently.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{available}} from its launch on 2 October 1986, as a three-door hatchback with 1.0, 1.1 and 1.4-litre TU-series belt driven OHC engines. A range of five-door models was added in 1987 and a 1.4 litre diesel engine {{was introduced in}} 1988. The right-hand drive version for the UK market was launched in August 1987, initially only as a three-door hatchback, with a five-door version joining the range a year later. The latter was subsequently replaced by a 1.5 litre unit. The very earliest cars had an issue with <b>gear</b> <b>shifters</b> falling off; this was rectified {{by the time the}} AX reached export markets. It was initially backed by a memorable television advertising campaign filmed in China, starring actress Janet Mas and an elderly gentleman, whose character was simply known as Mr. Wong.|$|R
5000|$|By 1962, {{more than}} 1 million U.S. built cars were factory {{equipped}} with bucket seats; often, these were {{fitted with a}} center console containing a <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> and other features between the seats. The popularity of the bucket seat grew {{with the advent of}} sporty compact cars (or [...] "pony cars") such as the Ford Mustang. With the introduction of subcompact-sized automobiles such as the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto, bucket seats were used {{due to the lack of}} seating room and floor-mounted levers for the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> and parking brake.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{specialized}} game controller manufactured by Logitech for the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system. It also {{works with the}} PC using drivers available from the Logitech website. It is designed to function like the controls in an automobile and includes a steering wheel with force feedback, analog accelerator and brake pedals, and sequential stick and paddle <b>gear</b> <b>shifters</b> {{in addition to the}} standard PlayStation 2 buttons. The controller was jointly designed by Logitech and Polyphony Digital to be used with Gran Turismo 4, however it will work with other games and automatically switches to a 200 degree compatibility mode for games not compatible with the 900 degree mode. It works with most driving games on the PlayStation 2 and has a list price of £99.99 (around 200 American dollars) at most stores, but can be as low as half that.|$|R
50|$|As {{in other}} motor sports, several data {{acquisition}} {{systems have been}} developed for kart racing. These systems allow the driver to monitor from a display fixed on the steering wheel some parameters such as RPM, timing of laps (including sectors), number of laps, best lap, cooling system temperature, exhaust gas temperature and sometimes speed or even <b>gear</b> for <b>shifter</b> karts.|$|R
50|$|A bicycle <b>shifter</b> or <b>gear</b> {{control or}} gear levers is a {{component}} {{used to control}} the gearing mechanisms and select the desired gear ratio. Typically, they operate either a derailleur mechanism or an internal hub gear mechanism. In either case, the control is operated by moving a cable that connects the <b>shifter</b> to the <b>gear</b> mechanism. <b>Shifters</b> are mounted on the down tube of the frame, stem, or various locations on the handlebars.|$|R
50|$|The {{dashboard}} featured Silver interior trims and {{the steering}} wheel included a plastic insert featuring the RenaultSport logo. The <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> was changed from the metal ball featured on the Phase 1 to a Leather wrapped shifter with a silver coloured insert on the top.|$|E
5000|$|... 1993: As {{a result}} of changes to the Cummins diesel engine, the engine cover is {{redesigned}} further to give a much lower profile. Additionally, the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> for the automatic transmission moves {{from the left side}} of the instrument panel to the right side.|$|E
50|$|The Bajaj Legend was {{a popular}} Indian-made motor scooter {{produced}} by Bajaj Auto, Ltd. First produced in 1999, the Legend was powered by a new environmentally friendly 145cc four-stroke, single cylinder engine, coupled to a four speed transmission operated through a classic Vespa-style grip <b>gear</b> <b>shifter.</b>|$|E
50|$|In some {{transmission}} designs (Volvo 850 and V/S70 series, for example) {{there are}} actually two countershafts, both driving an output pinion meshing with the front-wheel-drive transaxle's ring gear. This allows the transmission designer to make the transmission narrower, since each countershaft need only be half {{as long as a}} traditional countershaft with four <b>gears</b> and two <b>shifters.</b>|$|R
50|$|In most {{vehicles}} with manual transmission, gears are selected by manipulating a lever called a gear stick, shift stick, gearshift, gear lever, <b>gear</b> selector, or <b>shifter</b> {{connected to the}} transmission via linkage or cables and mounted on the floor, dashboard, or steering column. Moving the lever forward, backward, left, and right into specific positions selects particular gears.|$|R
50|$|Suntour's slant-parallelogram, {{spring-loaded}} top pivot {{rear derailleur}} provided the best shifting on the market. When Suntour's rear derailleur patent expired, the design was promptly copied by Shimano.In 1969, SunTour {{was the first}} Japanese <b>gear</b> and <b>shifter</b> manufacturer to introduce indexed shifting on bicycles (indexed shifting appeared at least {{as early as the}} Funiculo derailleur fitted to 1935 Shultz bicycles). Although their system, called Five-Speed Click, worked well, it proved an idea ahead of its time and did not catch on with the riding public. Another design innovation was the first practical Japanese freehub — the Unit-Hub - which combined freewheel and hub in one component (unit hubs were available at least as early as the 1938 Bayliss-Wiley, probably earlier). The freehub greatly increased the strength of the rear wheel, but the idea was not pursued.|$|R
50|$|The Hydro Blue Edition {{featured}} a Hydro Blue color, {{as well as}} matching blue-colored stitching in the seats and <b>gear</b> <b>shifter.</b> Also, the word Sky stitched into the seats is changed to matching-blue color as well. All Hydro Blue Edition Saturn Sky units were sold with the removable silver racing stripe.|$|E
5000|$|The E20 series Caravan and Urvan van and minibus were {{manufactured}} from February 1973 with seating configurations for three, five, seven, {{and up to}} 10 passengers. It was exclusive in Japan to Nissan Bluebird Store, {{while its}} twin the Nissan Homy was exclusive to Nissan Prince Store locations. It was especially popular in Europe, and was again very popular with fire departments and as ambulances in certain countries. It had a somewhat difficult handling, as it was heavy to steer, and was not available with power steering. Also, the <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> was located at the floor and {{went all the way}} up to the height of the hand, and had a slight curve. The <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> was nearly 80 cm long, so it was somewhat clumsy to shift, but it came with five gears, unusual in Europe at that time.|$|E
50|$|Initial D Arcade Stage Zero was {{released}} for the Sega Nu2 arcade system board in March 7, 2017. Unlike its predecessors, this game now uses a 6-speed <b>gear</b> <b>shifter</b> (similar {{to the ones}} found in the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune games) {{as opposed to the}} sequential ones. The character designs are taken from the new Initial D movie with entirely new BGMs.|$|E
