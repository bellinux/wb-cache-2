In a <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> <b>network</b> with n nodes, there are n(n-1)/2 direct links. Networks designed with this topology are usually very expensive to set up, but provide a high degree of reliability due to the multiple paths for data that are provided by the large number of redundant links between nodes. This topology is mostly seen in military applications.|$|E

In earlier work we derived an approach for the analysis of weighted networks which also works on <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> <b>networks.</b> Here we apply this approach to distance matrices from various fields and demonstrate how network analysis can be used to extract information from these distances. In particular we demonstrate that this approach successfully identifies biologically relevant genes from a distance matrix of microarray data series...|$|R
5000|$|The Dependency matrix is the {{weighted}} adjacency matrix, representing the <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> <b>network.</b> Different algorithms {{can be applied}} to filter the <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> <b>network</b> to obtain the most meaningful information, such as using a threshold approach, or different pruning algorithms. A widely used method to construct informative sub-graph of a complete network is the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Another informative sub-graph, which retains more information (in comparison to the MST) is the Planar Maximally Filtered Graph (PMFG) which is used here. Both methods are based on hierarchical clustering and the resulting sub-graphs include all the N nodes in the network whose edges represent the most relevant association correlations. The MST sub-graph contains edges with no loops while the PMFG sub-graph contains [...] edges.|$|E

40|$|Investigating the {{structure}} of protein similarity networks both on sequence and structural level Abstract [...] The current work presents a study concerning similarity networks for a well defined and used dataset of proteins, constructed using sequence and structural derived similarity criteria. The analysis is made on the initial set of proteins and the subsets of proteins that yield to <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> <b>networks</b> using both similarity criteria. Several parameters describing the networks are reported, whereas the values of clustering coefficient and characteristic path length classify both types of <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> <b>networks</b> into the class of small-world networks.

5000|$|In {{a tournament}} format {{that uses a}} {{round-robin}} group stage, the number of matches {{that need to be}} played between [...] teams is equal to the triangular number [...] For example, a group stage with 4 teams requires 6 matches, and a group stage with 8 teams requires 28 matches. This is also equivalent to the handshake problem and <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> <b>network</b> problems.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of network activity, the {{analysis}} is based on partial correlations, which are becoming ever more widely used to investigate complex systems. In simple words, the partial (or residual) correlation {{is a measure of}} the effect (or contribution) of a given node, say j, on the correlations between another pair of nodes, say i and k. Using this concept, the dependency of one node on another node, is calculated for the entire network. This results in a directed weighted adjacency matrix, of a <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> <b>network.</b> Once the adjacency matrix has been constructed, different algorithms can be used to construct the network, such as a threshold network, Minimal Spanning Tree (MST), Planar Maximally Filtered Graph (PMFG), and others.|$|E
5000|$|Evolution of {{a random}} network is a {{dynamical}} process, usually leading to emergence of giant component accompanied with striking consequences {{on the network}} topology. To quantify this process, {{there is a need}} of inspection on how the size of the largest connected cluster within the network, , varies with [...] Networks change their topology as they evolve, undergoing phase transitions. Phase transitions are generally known from physics, where it occurs as matter changes state according to its thermal energy level, or when ferromagnetic properties emerge in some materials as they are cooling down. Such phase transitions take place in matter because it is a network of particles, and as such, rules of network phase transition directly apply to it. Phase transitions in networks happen as links are added to a network, meaning that having N nodes, in each time increment, a link is placed between a randomly chosen pair of them. The transformation from a set of disconnected nodes to a <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> <b>network</b> is called the evolution of a network.|$|E

40|$|Highly {{structured}} artificial {{neural networks}} {{have been shown}} to be superior to <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> <b>networks</b> for realworld applications like speech recognition and handwritten character recognition. These structured networks can be optimized in many ways, and have to be optimized for optimal performance. This makes the manual optimization very timeconsuming. A highly structured approach is the Multi State Time Delay Neural Network (MSTDNN) which uses shifted input windows and allows the recognition of sequences of ordered events that have to be observed jointly. In this paper we propose an Automatic Structure Optimization (ASO) algorithm and apply it to MSTDNN type networks. The ASO algorithm optimizes all relevant parameters of MSTDNNs automatically and was successfully tested with three different tasks and varying amounts of training data. I.

40|$|Abstract – In a {{distributed}} system, it {{is often}} necessary for nodes {{to agree on a}} particular event or to coordinate their activities. Applications of distributed agreement are many, such as Commit Protocols in distributed database systems, selection of a monitor node in a distributed system, detecting an intruder, or agreeing on the malicious behavior of a node. Among many forms of Distributed Agreement, one form is called Approximate Agreement (AA), in which the nodes, by exchanging their local values with other nodes, need to agree on values which are approximately equal to each other. Research on AA for <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> <b>networks</b> is relatively mature. In contrast, the study of AA in partially <b>connected</b> <b>networks</b> has been very limited. More specifically, no general solution to the AA problem exists for such networks. This research solves the AA problem for a specific, scalable, partially <b>connected</b> <b>network</b> with limited relays. The research considers the worst failure mode of nodes, called Byzantine, and hybrid failure modes. The results show low communication cost in comparison to <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> <b>networks.</b> The network is designed {{to take advantage of the}} results available for <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> networks- thus the analysis for obtaining the expressions for Convergence Rate and Fault Tolerance becomes relatively easy...|$|R
