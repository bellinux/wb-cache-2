40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} effect of weak anchoring on the transition between C 1 and C 2 chevron structures in smectic C liquid crystals. We employ a continuum theory which allows for variable cone, azimuthal and layer tilt angles. Equilibrium profiles for the <b>director</b> <b>cone</b> and azimuthal angles in the C 1 and C 2 states are calculated from the standard Euler-Lagrange minimisation of the total energy of the system. By comparing the total energies of the C 1 and C 2 states we can determine the globally stable chevron profile and calculate the critical temperature for the C 1 -C 2 transition, which depends on anchoring strength and pretilt angle variations...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} study of the effect of weak {{anchoring}} on the transition between C 1 and C 2 chevron structures in smectic-C liquid crystals. The coexistence of C 1 and C 2 chevron structures within a single cell causes zigzag defects to occur and may affect the optical characteristics of the cell. By standard Euler-Lagrange minimisation of the total energy of the system, we obtain analytical expressions for the equilibrium <b>director</b> <b>cone</b> angle in the two chevron states. These in turn allow us to compare the total energies of the states and determine the globally stable chevron profile. We show that analytical predictions for the critical transition temperature, which depends on anchoring strength and pretilt angle, are in good agreement with those obtained numerically...|$|E
5000|$|To {{raise money}} for production, the film's writer and <b>director</b> Stephen <b>Cone</b> ran a Kickstarter {{campaign}} with a goal of $17,500. The campaign closed on July 18, 2010, having successfully raised $17,830. [...] The film was shot on location in Cone's hometown of Charleston, South Carolina. [...] Cone, the son of Baptist minister, described elements of the film as semi-autobiographical, saying that he [...] "experienced some of it, {{and some of it}} is speculation and curiosity, wondering about people he grew up with." ...|$|R
50|$|Notable Wolfe {{releases}} {{over the}} years include the film Big Eden, the 20th Anniversary DVD release of Desert Hearts, Were the World Mine, and Thom Fitzgerald's AIDS drama 3 Needles. Significant Wolfe DVD releases in recent years include the Sundance Film Festival award-winner Undertow, the acclaimed French drama Tomboy, the multiple award-winner Gayby, and Swedish lesbian romance Kiss Me (With Every Heartbeat). Wolfe has also released two films by the writer and <b>director</b> Stephen <b>Cone,</b> including The Wise Kids and Henry Gamble's Birthday Party.|$|R
50|$|Talk of a gondola {{has been}} around for some time, but has been re-ignited {{recently}} due to the deaths of three young Australian skiers when they drove off the access road in 2004. The access road is under regular criticism from patrons because of its corrugations, steep incline with tight switchbacks and lack of safety barriers. It also coincides with other objectives for the skifield, said Treble <b>Cone</b> <b>director,</b> Richard Hanson. A increase in ticket prices in 2006 seems to be to help the funding of the building project. On good days the field is always short of carparking, and cars may be parked up to a kilometre down the access road. Because of these reasons the gondola is a very popular proposal with locals except for the likelihood of more overcrowding at the resort.|$|R
