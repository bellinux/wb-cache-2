5|$|In November 2007, {{the city}} of Laredo, Texas, issued an arrest warrant for Treviño in {{connection}} with a 2006 double homicide in Texas. In 2008, Treviño Morales and Lazcano Lazcano, the two leaders of Los Zetas, forged an alliance with the Beltrán Leyva Cartel. It had <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> to war with the Sinaloa Cartel, believing that El Chapo Guzmán, their leader, had betrayed them. Treviño Morales subsequently joined them to kill the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. Government sources said Los Zetas were fighting for control against La Federación (The Federation), an alliance of several drug trafficking groups led by Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán and Ismael El Mayo Zambada, two drug lords who used to work for the Beltrán Leyva Cartel.|$|E
25|$|Ex-Governor Charles Robinson was {{an object}} of special search among them. He {{was one of the}} men they {{particularly}} wanted. During the whole time they were in town he was in his large stone barn on the hillside. He had <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> to the barn to get his team to drive out into the country, when he saw them come in and saw them make their first charge. He concluded to remain where he was. The barn overlooked the whole town, and he saw the affair from beginning to end. Gangs of raiders came by several times and looked at the barn and went round it, but it looked so much like a fort, that they kept out of range.|$|E
25|$|Around 1975, Will Crowther, a {{programmer}} and an amateur caver, {{wrote the first}} text adventure game, Adventure (originally called ADVENT because a filename could only be six characters long in the operating system he was using, and later named Colossal Cave Adventure). Having <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> through a divorce, {{he was looking for}} a way to connect with his two young children. Over the course of a few weekends, he wrote a text based cave exploration game that featured a sort of guide/narrator who talked in full sentences and who understood simple two word commands that came close to natural English. Adventure was programmed in Fortran for the PDP-10. Crowther's original version was an accurate simulation of part of the real Colossal Cave, but also included fantasy elements (such as axe-wielding dwarves and a magic bridge).|$|E

500|$|Despite their {{appreciation}} of his work, many of Glicken's associates considered him eccentric and highly disorganized. Chatty, noted for being extremely sensitive, Glicken also paid meticulous attention to detail. One {{of his friends}} writes, [...] "Harry was a character his whole life.... Everyone who knew him was amazed {{he was such a}} good scientist." [...] Regarding Glicken's driving habits, the same acquaintance describes him as [...] "a cartoon character" [...] who [...] "would drive at full speed down the road, talking about whatever was important to him, and... come to a four-way stoplight and he'd sail through it, never knowing he'd <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> through".|$|E
500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head and silently glared at him. [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, he never even said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't think the other players saw Joe glare at him. I think the other player just felt it, and then he sat down and never said another word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let you know one way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E
500|$|During James' meeting, he was {{informed}} that a letter bomb had exploded {{in a suburb of}} Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said [...] "There was {{a knock at the door}} and I was told by one of my officers that an incendiary device had <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> off. The atmosphere of the meeting changed. Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real". Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb, was taken to hospital with minor injuries and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope. Immediately after the first letter bomb, Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them, and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth—something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town—and placed on stand-by.|$|E

500|$|Her Story was {{approved}} through Steam Greenlight, and was crowdfunded by Indie Fund. It {{was released on}} 24 June 2015 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and iOS. Barlow wanted to launch the game on all platforms simultaneously, as he was unsure where the audience would be. [...] "If I'd <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> for just one I'd have {{lost a lot of}} the potential audience," [...] he commented. Barlow found that playing Her Story on mobile devices is a [...] "'sofa' experience". He also noted that it felt [...] "natural" [...] for it to be released on mobile devices, as they are regularly used to watch videos and search the internet; similar tasks are used as gameplay mechanics in Her Story. The iPhone's smaller pixel size of 640×480 as opposed to 800×600 led to Barlow's doubts of a release on the platform, but he was influenced to release it upon receiving positive feedback through testing. As development neared completion, the game underwent testing, which allowed Barlow to [...] "balance some aspects" [...] and [...] "polish items together". An Android version was released on 29 June 2016. Her Story runs on the Unity game engine.|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} {{breakthrough}} in the band's critical reception was 1990's Naïve, called [...] "one of their strongest releases" [...] by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, [...] "brilliant" [...] by fellow AllMusic critic Ned Raggett, [...] "superb" [...] by Hinds, and [...] "the most fun 'industrial dance' album ever" [...] by Spin critic Chuck Eddy. The subsequent albums released in the 1990s were described {{as some of the}} band's strongest by AllMusic critic Greg Prato, with their metal guitars, industrial beats, and dance floor sensibilities praised by Ira Robbins and CMJ New Music Monthly critic Heidi MacDonald. Michael Saunders of the Boston Globe said of the band: [...] "It's a small field, but KMFDM is tops in it: makers of dense, danceable, post-industrial torrents of noise. The German band specializes in fabricating aural assaults that can be intimidating to the uninitiated." [...] MacDonald said in 1996, [...] "With Ministry gone grindcore, Skinny Puppy <b>just</b> <b>gone,</b> and Nine Inch Nails a brand name, KMFDM is now the standard bearer of industrial", though Erlewine and Hinds felt the band was losing some steam {{towards the end of the}} decade.|$|E

The husband informs Scully, Doggett, and Reyes that they are being watched, and signals to Scully to close the window. He then reveals to Scully that he works for the NSA and has no name. [...] He says he was not there to take William, but was there to retrieve his wife, as he knew she was upset. [...] Patti says their daughter is just like William, and they only want to keep both children safe. [...] The husband reveals that his supervisor has discovered the government's “Super Soldier” project and alludes to crimes against innocent people. He begs Scully to call Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) out of hiding in order to give him this information.|$|E

500|$|Science fiction Grand Masters, Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl collaborated for {{the first}} time on The Last Theorem. The novel {{initially}} was Clarke's, and he began working on it in early 2004. But in 2006, at the age of 88, ill health brought on by complications from post-polio syndrome, and writer's block, impeded his progress, and he asked Pohl for help. Pohl explained: [...] "Arthur said to me that he woke up one morning and didn't know how to write any of the books he had contracted. The stories had <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> out of his head." [...] Clarke gave Pohl a 40–50 page manuscript plus roughly 50 pages of notes, and over the next two years, Pohl wrote the book. Pohl said that [...] "Everything in the novel is something he either suggested or wrote or I discussed with him." [...] Some of Clarke's notes were so obscure that even Clarke himself could not understand them. Pohl, only two years younger than Clarke, had health problems of his own: he could no longer type and wrote the book out in longhand, leaving it up to his wife to translate his [...] "indecipherable scribbles". Clarke reviewed and approved the final manuscript of The Last Theorem in early March 2008, just days before he died. Pohl died five years later in September 2013.|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. Records premiered {{the final}} mix of [...] "Ghost" [...] for {{streaming}} on December 10, 2013, {{and the song}} became available in digital stores by January 31, 2014. A remix by house producer Claude VonStroke was released on February 18, 2014 by Spin magazine, which journalist Chris Martins named a [...] "demented dance-floor delight." [...] A day later, Vice Media's channel Noisey released a remix by New York City-based duo Solidisco, advertised to [...] "make you nostalgic for the long weekend <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> (thanks President's Day!), but super happy because Friday {{is just a little}} bit closer than it should be." [...] Both re-workings were part of the song's remix EP that also featured remixes from Fred Falke, Thomas Newson and Viceroy. A re-cut by producer Martignetti that was not on the EP premiered on the blog Stoney Roads, who noted the song to be fitting in an episode of the HBO series Girls. [...] "Ghost" [...] was also included on the soundtrack for the game WWE 2K15, and Dubuc has admitted to being happy of being involved with the game: [...] "I've been a really big fan for a long time, and they found out I was a fan, {{and it turns out that}} some of the people that work at WWE and in the game specifically are fans of Mystery Skulls and they were like, [...] "What the fuck?

500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, {{to a lot of}} the early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there was nothing to do but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E

500|$|... "Love Story" [...] {{came along}} {{late into the}} {{production}} of Fearless. Swift wrote [...] "Love Story" [...] {{about a man who}} was never officially her boyfriend. When she introduced him to her family and friends, they did not become fond of him. [...] "His situation was a little complicated, but I didn't care", said Swift. Swift also felt like {{it was the first time}} she could relate to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597), one of her favorite narratives, which she described as, [...] "The only people who wanted them to be together were them." [...] She conceived the idea for the song when she reflected about the scenario: [...] "I thought, 'This is difficult but it's real, it matters—it's not simple or easy but it's real'." [...] She then centered the song on the line, which was ultimately placed in the [...] "Love Story"'s second refrain. All events, with the exclusion of the end, narrated in the song regarded Swift's actual story. The song's conclusion differed from that of Romeo and Juliet. [...] "I feel like they had such promise and they were so crazy for each other. And if that had <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> a little bit differently, it could have been the best love story ever told. And it is one of the best love stories ever told, but it's a tragedy." [...] Instead, she chose to write a happy ending. She took her favorite characters and conceptualized the ending she believed they deserved. She perceived it to be the ideal ending that girls hoped for, including herself. [...] "You want a guy who doesn’t care what anyone thinks, what anyone says." [...] Although it was fictional, Swift said it was an enjoyable experience to write about. Swift wrote the track on her bedroom floor in approximately twenty minutes, feeling too inspired to put the song down unfinished.|$|E
