Later, Guenter Wendt, pad leader for the <b>early</b> <b>American</b> manned space launches, wrote that he believed a small cover over the external release actuator was accidentally lost sometime during the flight or splashdown, and the T-handle may have been tugged by a stray parachute suspension line, or was perhaps damaged by the heat of re-entry and, after cooling upon splashdown, contracted and fired.|$|E

The trail leads him to the underground base of Dr. No, who is plotting to disrupt an <b>early</b> <b>American</b> space launch with a radio beam weapon.

5|$|Megadeth is {{considered}} one of the most musically influential groups that originated in the 1980s. As part of the <b>early</b> <b>American</b> thrash metal movement, the band's music was a direct influence on death metal. Sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris wrote that the mainstream success of Megadeth was one of the reasons for the expansion of extreme metal to countries where it had previously been unknown. The band's sound and album artwork influenced a number of thrash metal bands in the 21st century, including Toxic Holocaust and Warbringer. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Megadeth has sold 9.2 million copies of its albums in the United States between 1991 and 2014.|$|E
