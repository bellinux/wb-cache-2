40|$|The {{strictly}} anaerobic {{pathogenic bacterium}} Clostridium difficile {{occurs in the}} human gut {{and is able to}} thrive from fermentation of leucine. Thereby the amino acid is both oxidized to isovalerate plus CO 2 and reduced to <b>isocaproate.</b> In the reductive branch of this pathway, the dehydration of (R) - 2 -hydroxyisocaproyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to (E) - 2 -isocaprenoyl-CoA is probably catalyzed via radical intermediates. The dehydratase requires activation by an ATP-dependent one-electron transfer (J. Kim, D. Darley, and W. Buckel, FEBS J. 272 : 550 - 561, 2005). Prior to the dehydration, a dehydrogenase and a CoA transferase are supposed {{to be involved in the}} formation of (R) - 2 -hydroxyisocaproyl-CoA. Deduced amino acid sequences of ldhA and hadA from the genome of C. difficile showed high identities to d-lactate dehydrogenase and family III CoA transferase, respectively. Both putative genes encoding the dehydrogenase and CoA transferase were cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli; the recombinant Strep tag II fusion proteins were purified to homogeneity and characterized. The substrate specificity of the monomeric LdhA (36. 5 kDa) indicated that 2 -oxoisocaproate (Km = 68 μM, k cat = 31 s− 1) and NADH were the native substrates. For the reverse reaction, the enzyme accepted (R) - but not (S) - 2 -hydroxyisocaproate and therefore was named (R) - 2 -hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase. HadA showed CoA transferase activity with (R) - 2 -hydroxyisocaproyl-CoA as a donor and <b>isocaproate</b> or (E) - 2 -isocaprenoate as an acceptor. By site-directed mutagenesis, the conserved D 171 was identified as an essential catalytic residue probably involved in the formation of a mixed anhydride with the acyl group of the thioester substrate. However, neither hydroxylamine nor sodium borohydride, both of which are inactivators of the CoA transferase, modified this residue. The dehydrogenase and the CoA transferase fit well into the proposed pathway of leucine reduction to <b>isocaproate...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{anaerobic}} biodegradation of ferulate and benzoate in stabilized methanogenic consortia was examined in detail. Up to 99 % of the ferulate and 98 % of the benzoate {{were converted to}} carbon dioxide and methane. Methanogenesis was inhibited with 2 -bromoethanesulfonic acid, which reduced the gas production and enhanced the buildup of intermediates. Use of high-performance liquid chromatography and two gas chromatographic procedures yielded identification of the following compounds: caffeate, p-hydroxycinnamate, cinnamate, phenylpropionate, phenylacetate, benzoate, and toluene during ferulate degradation; and benzene, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, cyclohexanecarboxylate, cyclohexanone, 1 -methylcyclohexanone, pimelate, adipate, succinate, lactate, heptanoate, caproate, <b>isocaproate,</b> valerate, butyrate, isobutyrate, propionate, and acetate during the degradation of either benzoate or ferulate.

40|$|Anabolic steroids are {{currently}} very controversial issue {{not only for}} its therapeutic use but especially because of the illegal abuse in the sport branch. The aim of this thesis was to develop a rapid, selective, effective and simple method of high performance liquid chromatography suitable for the determination of anabolic steroids in injectable dosage form. The analyzed sample of pharmaceutical product Sustamed contained four testosterone esters: testosterone propionate, testosterone phenylpropionate, testosterone <b>isocaproate</b> and testosterone decanoate. Optimized HPLC-DAD conditions suitable for determination of the selected testosterone esters were as follows: core-shell column Poroshell HPH-C 18 (3. 0 x 100 mm, 2. 7 mm), mobile phase consisted of 10 mmol/l ammonium acetate, pH 4. 5 and acetonitrile, gradient elution was used.

40|$|Sustanon {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used anabolic androgenic drugs to increase skeletal muscle mass and strength. This drug is a blend of four esterized testosterone derivatives: Testosterone propionate, testosterone phenylpropionate, testosterone <b>isocaproate</b> and testosterone decanoate. Little is known about the effects of this drug on skeletal muscle at the cellular level. This study aimed to investigate the influence of Sustanon on the morphology of skeletal muscle fibers and the distribution of myogenic stem cells known as Satellite Cells (SCs) during postnatal growth. We hypothesized that Sustanon-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is associated with an increase in the number of SCs. Robust immunocytochemical techniques and morphometric analyses were used to calculate the numbers of SCs and myonuclei within the pectoralis muscle of chickens. Also, DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein levels were measured to confirm immunocytochemical findings. Sustanon significantly increased pectoralis mass and fiber size. All SC indices and the number of myonuclei increased significantly by Sustanon administration. In addition, greater DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein expression were found in Sustanon-treated birds. This study indicates that Sustanon can induce avian skeletal muscle hypertrophy and that this is correlated with increased numbers of SCs and myonuclei...|$|E

Suaeda salsa is the pioneer halophyte plant in the intertidal zones of the Bohai Sea. In the present work, the short (1 week) and long term (1 month) toxicological effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of Pb and Zn were characterized in S. salsa using NMR-based metabolomics combined with antioxidant enzyme activities. After metal exposure for 1 week, no significant metabolic responses were detected in root tissues of S. salsa. The significant metabolic responses included the increase of <b>isocaproate,</b> glucose and fructose, and decrease of malate, citrate and sucrose in root tissues of S. salsa exposed to Pb for 1 month. The increased phosphocholine and betaine, and decreased choline were uniquely found in Zn-exposed samples. The metabolic changes including decreased malate, citrate and sucrose were detected in both Pb and Zn-exposed groups. These metabolic biomarkers revealed that both Pb and Zn exposures could induce osmotic stress and disturbances in energy metabolism in S. salsa after exposures for 1 month.

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{assess the}} {{pharmacokinetics}} of oral, intramuscular, or transdermal hormone replacement {{in patients with}} beta thalassaemia major. METHODS [...] Oral (testosterone undecanoate 40 mg) and intramuscular (testosterone propionate 15 mg, phenylpropionate 30 mg, <b>isocaproate</b> 30 mg and decanoate 50 mg) testosterone and transdermal (17 beta oestradiol 25 micrograms and 50 micrograms) oestradiol were evaluated in 21 male (16 - 29 years) and 11 female (19 - 26 years) patients with beta thalassaemia major and various forms of hypogonadism. RESULTS [...] In male patients given oral testosterone, peak testosterone concentrations were observed either two to four hours or seven hours after administration; intramuscular testosterone produced peak values seven days after injection. Transdermal 17 beta oestradiol given to female patients produced a biphasic pattern with an initial peak concentration occurring at 36 hours and a secondary rise at 84 hours. CONCLUSIONS [...] The results indicate that oral androgens should be given twice daily in cases of hypogonadism, and where growth is incomplete, lower than recommended doses. If intramuscular testosterone is used, smaller doses of 10 - 25 mg should be given every one to two weeks. Transdermal administration of 25 - 50 micrograms 17 beta oestradiol generally produces a plasma E 2 value {{in the early to}} mid-follicular phase range (100 - 300 pmol/l). This is appropriate in adults but excessive for prepubertal girls.

40|$|Abstract Background Anabolic {{androgenic}} steroids (AAS) {{are widely}} misused for {{the enhancement of}} performance in sports. Several drugs are available that contain different combinations or individual steroids in different dosage form. This paper describes a TLC densitometric method for simultaneous determination of four AAS of testosterone derivatives including testosterone propionate (TP), testosterone phenyl propionate (TPP), testosterone <b>isocaproate</b> (TI) and testosterone deaconate (TD) in their pharmaceutical products. Results Separation was carried out on Al based TLC plates, pre-coated with silica gel 60 F- 254 using hexane and ethyl acetate (8. 5 : 1. 5, v/v). Spots at R f 0. 31 [*]±[*] 0. 01, 0. 34 [*]±[*] 0. 01, 0. 40 [*]±[*] 0. 01 and 0. 45 [*]±[*] 0. 02 were recognized as TPP, TP, TI and TD, respectively. Quantitative analysis was done by densitometric measurements at λ max 251 nm for all derivatives. The developed method was validated as per ICH guidelines. Method was found linear over the concentration range of 200 – 1200 ng/spot with the correlation coefficient of 0. 995, 0. 993, 0. 995 and 0. 996 for TP, TPP, TI, TD, respectively. Limit of detection for all derivatives were {{in the range of}} 16. 7 - 22. 3 ng/spot while limit of quantitation were found to be in the range of 55. 7 - 70. 9 ng/spot. Conclusions The developed TLC method can be applied for the simultaneous routine analysis of testosterone derivatives in their individual and combined pharmaceutical formulations. </p...|$|E
40|$|The genes ldhA and hadA, from Clostridium difficile (DSMZ 1296 T) were cloned and {{expressed}} in Escherichia coli. The obtained proteins were purified and characterised as D- 2 -hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (LdhA) and 2 -hydroxyisocaproate CoA-transferase (HadA) involved in two consecutive {{steps in the}} pathway of leucine fermentation to ammonia, CO 2, isovalerate and <b>isocaproate.</b> The downstream genes hadBC and hadI were also functionally expressed and shown to encode the novel 2 -hydroxyisocaproyl-CoA dehydratase (HadBC) and its activator (HadI). The activated dehydratase catalyses the dehydration of (R) - 2 -hydroxyisocaproyl-CoA to isocaprenoyl-CoA, which is a chemically difficult step since the proton in the b-position is not activated (pK ca. 40). We postulated that {{the reduction of the}} substrate by one electron enables the elimination, whereby the pK is lowered to at least 14. After the reaction the electron is returned to the dehydratase, which may catalyse many turnovers. The extremely oxygen-sensitive homodimeric activator as well as the heterodimeric dehydratase contain iron-sulfur cluster(s); other prosthetic groups specifically molybdenum were not detected. The reduced activator transfers one electron to the dehydratase concomitant with hydrolysis of ATP, a process similar to that observed with the unrelated nitrogenase. The reduced dehydratase separated from the activator and ATP catalysed almost 104 dehydration turnovers until the electron was lost by oxidation. By adding activator and ATP the enzyme could be fully reactivated. The active tight complex of the two protein components induced by AlF 4 - and ATP underpins the postulated electron transfer from the activator to the dehydratase and demonstrates again that the electron is recycled after each turnover. In agreement with this observation, only substoichiometric amounts of activator (activator/dehydratase = 1 : 10) were required to generate full activity. An organic radical proposed to mediate the dehydration was detected by EPR spectroscopy {{for the first time in}} a 2 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase. The changes of the EPR spectra induced by the use of labelled substrates showed that the radical was substrate-derived. These results are the first clear evidence for a radical involved in a dehydration mechanism and suggest a new way to form a radical in enzymatic reactions...|$|E
