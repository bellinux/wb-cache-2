United <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> come-back. Bayern barely had time to restart the game, which referee Collina brought to a close just a few seconds later.|$|E
5|$|Berg {{station was}} opened on 10 October 1934, when the municipally owned company Akersbanerne <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> Sognsvann Line from Majorstuen to Sognsvann. Residential areas at Sogn, Tåsen and Berg were {{starting}} to grow, in pace with a larger suburban development plan. Akersbanerne bought new property along the line, upon which new houses were to be designed by the Norwegian architect Kristofer Lange (1886–1977).|$|E
5|$|By 1920 variety theatre {{had become}} popular in Britain, and Robey <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> {{successful}} transition from music hall to variety star. Pantomime, which relied on its stars {{to make up}} much of the script through ad lib, was also beginning {{to fall out of}} favour, and his contemporaries were finding it too difficult to create fresh material for every performance; for Robey, however, the festive entertainment continued to be a lucrative source of employment.|$|E

5|$|After an offseason {{contract}} {{dispute between}} Joss, Toledo and Cleveland, he debuted with the Cleveland club in April 1902. Joss {{led the league}} in shutouts that year. By 1905, Joss <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> first of his four consecutive 20-win seasons. Off the field, Joss worked as a newspaper sportswriter from 1906 until his death. In 1908, he pitched a perfect game during a tight pennant race that saw Cleveland finish a half-game out of first place; it was the closest that Joss came to a World Series berth. The 1910 season was his last, and Joss missed most of the year due to injury.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1841, Meyerbeer <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> {{first draft}} of Le prophète, but refused to stage it because the then {{director}} of the opera, Leon Pillet, wished to cast his mistress, Rosine Stoltz, {{in the part of}} Fidès, the hero's mother. (Berlioz characterised Stoltz as 'la Directrice du Directeur'). Meyerbeer insisted on Pauline Viardot for the role. Meyerbeer lodged the score with a Parisian lawyer, and refused to countenance any production until his wishes were met. It was not until 1849 when the Opéra was willing to agree his conditions. Meyerbeer was unique in his time in having the wealth and influence to impose his will as a composer in this way.|$|E
5|$|Feige {{stated in}} January 2013 that Ant-Man {{would be part}} of Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and {{indicated}} in May that the screenplay needed to be modified in order to fit into the universe, as the project had been in development before the first Iron Man film. Feige also stated that shooting was slated to begin sometime in 2014, and that casting would begin towards the end of 2013. In July 2013, Wright said that he and Cornish <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> script for the film and that Marvel allowed him to delay its production so that he could complete The World's End, as that film's producer Eric Fellner was diagnosed with cancer.|$|E

In the meantime, Diederichs <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> seizure of the Kiaochou Bay concession; the Cruiser Division was sent reinforcements and promoted to the East Asia Squadron. Irene {{was assigned to the}} I Division of the Squadron. In the Spring of 1898, Irene was sent to Shanghai for periodic maintenance.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, the ATC made {{progress}} toward protecting the trail from development, thanks to efforts {{of politicians and}} officials. The National Trails System Act of 1968 designated the Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail as the first national scenic trails and {{paved the way for}} a series of National Scenic Trails within the National Park and National Forest systems. Trail volunteers worked with the National Park Service to map a permanent route for the trail, and by 1971 a permanent route had been marked (though minor changes continue to this day). By the close of the 20th century, the Park Service <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> purchase of all but a few miles of the trail's span.|$|E
5|$|Le Secret de La Licorne began {{serialisation}} as a daily {{strip in}} newspaper Le Soir from 11 June 1942. As with previous adventures, it then began serialisation in the French Catholic newspaper Cœurs Vaillants, from 19 March 1944. In Belgium, {{it was then}} published in a 62-page book format by Editions Casterman in 1943. Now fully coloured, the book included a new cover design created by Hergé after he <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> original serialisation of the story, along with six large colour drawings. The first printing sold 30,000 copies in Francophone Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Ohio <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> {{stretch of}} highway between I-70 to {{just before the}} SR7 {{interchange}} by 1976, but due to budget deficiencies work did not resume in Ohio until 1981. Construction of the bridge linking the two portions of highway {{was scheduled to be}} completed by 1981, but construction did not begin until that year. After a 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) fuel tax increase, Ohio was able to fund the project again. Bids for construction work on the remainder of the Ohio portion of the freeway were solicited in 1981, with an estimated construction time of 37months for the stretch between I-70 and the bridge.|$|E

Nihilistic aimed to release the game for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube video game consoles in late 2003, which elicited positive reactions from the press. The game was consistently delayed, and during {{the third quarter of}} 2004, Nihilistic discontinued their work on the project.

5|$|Outside Japan, {{the series}} was {{distributed}} by different companies.

Funimation later acquired the license for the North American rights, created an English dub, and released the series on DVD and Blu-ray in two volumes in 2012. Madman Entertainment acquired the license for the Australian rights, and streamed the series on their website. Manga Entertainment waited with acquiring the license for the United Kingdom rights until Funimation <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> English dub, and then released it in the United Kingdom in two volumes on DVD and Blu-ray in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Puccini {{had long}} {{considered}} writing {{a set of}} one-act operas which would be performed together in a single evening, but faced {{with a lack of}} suitable subjects and opposition from his publisher, he repeatedly put the project aside. However, by 1916 Puccini <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> one-act tragedy Il tabarro and, after considering various ideas, he began work the following year on the solemn, religious, all-female opera Suor Angelica. Gianni Schicchi, a comedy, completes the triptych with a further contrast of mood. The score combines elements of Puccini's modern style of harmonic dissonance with lyrical passages reminiscent of Rossini, and it has been praised for its inventiveness and imagination.|$|E

The script was not finalized until shooting had been underway for three weeks. The film was completed on March 10, 1936. Despite studio orders that the film be shot on a seven-day-per-week schedule, filming ran seven days over its schedule and $50,000 over budget, with the final cost of the film tallied at $278,380.|$|E
5|$|The course {{consisted}} of eight obstacles {{which had to}} be completed within 60 seconds. Each obstacle had an orange flag either at its end or hidden within it. One team member ran the first obstacle, then passed its flag to a partner, who then moved on to the next obstacle. The team continued to alternate in this manner until they <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> course or until time ran out. For safety reasons, team members were given helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads to wear while running the course.|$|E
5|$|Written by Mike Tucker & Robert Perry, {{this was}} a three-part Cybermen story set in war-torn London of the 1940s. They <b>had</b> <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> first two episodes in script form and the final episode as a storyline, and were {{planning}} to submit it during the start of production on season 26. Fellow writer Ben Aaronovitch intercepted the script, suggesting that submitting to script editor Andrew Cartmel a World War II script when he was currently already editing something similar (The Curse of Fenric) was a mistake and to instead submit it for the following series. Tucker & Perry later adapted the story as a novel for the BBC Past Doctors range in October 1997.|$|E
