40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{analytical}} approach is proposed {{to study the}} feature of frequency capture of two non-identical coupled <b>exciters</b> in a non-resonant vibrating system. The electromagnetic torque of an induction motor in the quasi-steady-state operation is derived. With the introduction of two perturbation small parameters to average angular velocity of two <b>exciters</b> and their phase difference, we deduce the Equation of Frequency Capture by averaging two motion equations of two <b>exciters</b> over their average period. It converts the synchronization problem of two <b>exciters</b> into that of existence and stability of zero solution for the Equation of Frequency Capture. The conditions of implementing frequency capture and that of stabilizing synchronous operation of two motors have been derived. The concept of torque of frequency capture is proposed to physically explain the peculiarity of self-synchronization of the two <b>exciters.</b> An interesting conclusion is reached that the moments of inertia of the two <b>exciters</b> in the Equation of Frequency Capture reduce {{and there is a}} coupling moment of inertia between the two <b>exciters.</b> The reduction of moments of inertia and the coupling moment of inertia {{have an effect on the}} stability of synchronous operation...|$|R

25|$|The band's last albums of the 1980s, Black Celebration and Music for the Masses, {{established}} them as {{a dominant}} force within the electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's June 1988 concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people; it {{formed the basis for}} the D. A. Pennebaker-directed documentary film 101, released the following year. In the new decade, Depeche Mode released Violator, an international mainstream success. The subsequent album, Songs of Faith and Devotion, and the supporting Devotional Tour exacerbated tensions within the band to the point where Wilder quit in 1995, leading to intense media and fan speculation that the band would split. Now a trio once again, the band released Ultra in 1997, recorded at the height of Gahan's near-fatal drug abuse, Gore's alcoholism and seizures, and Fletcher's clinical depression. The release of <b>Exciter</b> confirmed Depeche Mode's willingness to remain together, the subsequent, and very successful, <b>Exciter</b> Tour being their first tour in support of an original album in eight years since the Devotional Tour, although the band had toured in 1998 to support The Singles 86–98 compilation album.|$|E

25|$|Heaven's Force was a Christian metal band, that {{is thought}} to be the first Christian thrash metal band. The band {{consists}} of Drummer/Vocalist Dave Gryder, Guitarist Chris Richie, and Bassist Kelly Berger. The band formed in 1983, and disbanded around late 1984. The band released two demos and a compilation. In 2008, Richie committed suicide after a long time of depression. After this unfortunate event, Gryder stated that the band would never reunite without their friend. In 2009, the band re-released their demos via Open Grace Records. The band has been compared to Slayer, Venom, and <b>Exciter.</b>|$|E

500|$|Show No Mercy was {{met with}} {{polarized}} opinions when it was issued, but in some recent reviews {{it came to be}} considered a classic album. In 1984, Dave Dickson of Kerrang! crushed the album defining it [...] "pure, unadulterated junk", while Bernard Doe of Metal Forces called the record [...] "one of the heaviest, fastest, most awesome albums of all time!" [...] The German magazine Rock Hard gave Show No Mercy a positive review, which remarked how Slayer were [...] "actually the hardest and fastest" [...] in comparison with their contemporaries Metallica and <b>Exciter,</b> and defined their music as [...] "heavy metal punk." [...] AllMusic reviewer Jeremy Ulrey had mixed feelings towards the album, saying that even though the musicianship and production were [...] "amateurish" [...] compared to Slayer's later releases, the album remains [...] "solid, if inessential, part of the Slayer legacy". Users voted 4/5 at AllMusic. Sputnikmusic staff member Hernan M. Campbell described the album as [...] "fast, heavy, and mean, inducing an inescapable atmosphere of utter atrocity." [...] He noted that the [...] "lo-fi" [...] production quality gives the album a [...] "classic" [...] feeling.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} was done, Music for Nations founder Martin Hooker {{wanted to}} arrange a triple bill UK tour in March / April 1984 with <b>Exciter,</b> Metallica, and The Rods. However, the Hell on Earth Tour never materialized because of poor ticket sales. To promote Ride the Lightning, Metallica commenced the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour on November 16, in Rouen, France, with British NWOBHM band Tank as support. The tour continued with dates in Belgium, Italy, Germany, and the Nordic countries to an average crowd of 1,300. After a Christmas break, the group embarked on a 50-date North American tour, firstly as a co-headlining act with W.A.S.P. and then as headliners with Armored Saint supporting. At a gig in Portland, Oregon, Metallica covered [...] "The Money Will Roll Right In" [...] by Fang, with Armored Saint onstage. The American leg ended in May 1985, and the band spent the following two months working on the next studio album, Master of Puppets, whose recording sessions were scheduled to begin in September. Metallica performed at the Monsters of Rock festival held at Castle Donington in England on August 17 in front of 70,000 fans. The band was placed between Ratt and Bon Jovi, two glam metal groups whose sound and appearance were much unlike Metallica's. At {{the start of the}} set, Hetfield pronounced to the audience: [...] "If you came here to see spandex, eye make-up, and the words 'oh baby' in every fuckin' song, this ain't the fuckin' band!" [...] Two weeks later, Metallica appeared on the Day on the Green festival in Oakland, California, before 90,000 people. The last show Metallica played before recording began was the Loreley Metal Hammer festival in Germany, headlined by Venom. Metallica finished 1985 with a show at the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium on December 29 opening for Y, and a New Year's Eve concert at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on a bill with Metal Church, Exodus, and Megadeth, the first time Metallica and Megadeth shared a stage. At this gig, Metallica premiered [...] "Master of Puppets" [...] and [...] "Disposable Heroes", songs from the then-upcoming third studio album.|$|E

30|$|Recently, {{there have}} been several {{publications}} that deal with extending the read range of the UHF readers. The read range can be extended by adding the external <b>exciters</b> that provide CW signal [12] or by amplifying the signal from the reader [13].

2500|$|Reverberation {{and delay}} effects {{are widely used}} in sound {{reinforcement}} systems to enhance {{the sound of the}} mix and create a desired artistic effect. Reverb and delay add a sense of spaciousness to the sound, imitating the sound of a singing voice or instrument in a large, reverberant hall. Many mixing boards designed for live sound include on-board reverb effects. [...] Modulation effects such as flanger, phaser, and chorus are also applied to some instruments. [...] An <b>exciter</b> [...] "livens up" [...] the sound of audio signals by applying dynamic equalization, phase manipulation and harmonic synthesis of typically high frequency signals.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{vibration}} {{testing is}} {{conducted in a}} 'single DUT axis' at a time, even though most real-world vibration occurs in various axes simultaneously. [...] MIL-STD-810G, released in late 2008, Test Method 527, calls for multiple <b>exciter</b> testing. The vibration test fixture used to attach the DUT to the shaker table must be designed for the frequency range of the vibration test spectrum. Generally for smaller fixtures and lower frequency ranges, the designer targets a fixture design that is free of resonances in the test frequency range. This becomes more difficult as the DUT gets larger and as the test frequency increases. In these cases multi-point control strategies can mitigate some of the resonances that may {{be present in the}} future. Devices specifically designed to trace or record vibrations are called vibroscopes.|$|E

2500|$|A second {{series of}} {{approaches}} {{was designed and}} patented by Leonard R. Kahn. [...] The various Kahn systems removed the hard limit imposed {{by the use of}} the strict log function in the generation of the signal. Earlier Kahn systems utilized various methods to reduce the second-order term through the insertion of a predistortion component. [...] One example of this method was also used to generate one of the Kahn independent-sideband (ISB) AM stereo signals. [...] It was known as the STR-77 <b>exciter</b> method, having been introduced in 1977. [...] Later, the system was further improved by use of an arcsine-based modulator that included a 1-0.52E term in the denominator of the arcsin generator equation. [...] E represents the envelope term; roughly half the modulation term applied to the envelope modulator is utilized to reduce the second-order term of the arcsin [...] "phase"-modulated path; thus reducing the second-order term in the undesired sideband. [...] A multi-loop modulator/demodulator feedback approach was used to generate an accurate arcsin signal. [...] This approach was introduced in 1984 and became known as the STR-84 method. [...] It was sold by Kahn Research Laboratories; later, Kahn Communications, Inc. of NY. [...] An additional audio processing device further improved the sideband structure by selectively applying pre-emphasis to the modulating signals. [...] Since the envelope of all the signals described remains an exact copy of the information applied to the modulator, it can be demodulated without distortion by an envelope detector such as a simple diode. [...] In a practical receiver, some distortion may be present, usually at a low level (in AM broadcast, always below 5%), due to sharp filtering and nonlinear group delay in the IF filters of the receiver, which act to truncate the compatibility sideband – those terms that are not the result of a linear process of simply envelope modulating the signal as would be the case in full-carrier DSB-AM – and rotation of phase of these compatibility terms such that they no longer cancel the quadrature distortion term caused by a first-order SSB term along with the carrier. [...] The small amount of distortion caused by this effect is generally quite low and acceptable.|$|E
