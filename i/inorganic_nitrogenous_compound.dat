40|$|The {{oxidation}} of <b>inorganic</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compounds</b> by chemoautotrophic bacteria such as Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter spp. {{is believed}} to contribute and {{be responsible for the}} majority of global nitrification. Although the function of the autotrophic nitrifier in natural ecosystems is well known, {{little is known about the}} function, if any, of heterotrophic nitrifiers. In biological nutrient removal (BNR) activated sludge treatment it has always been accepted that nitrification is performed by autotrophs and denitrification by heterotrophs. However, some environmental studies have found heterotrophic nitrification rates to be only one or two orders of magnitude lower than those of the autotrophs. Taking this into account and the heterotrophic dominance in activated sludge, heterotrophs may notably be contributing to nitrification in BNR systems. Therefore, there is a need for insight into the potential involvement of heterotrophic bacteria in nitrification occurring in BNR systems in order to further optimize and economize this process. This study aimed at assessing potential nitrification by heterotrophic bacteria present in the Darvill BNR process situated just outside Pietermaritzburg in Kwazulu Natal.

40|$|Abstract In {{many areas}} of the world limited water {{resources}} have lead to increased use of recycled water for agricultural and industrial purposes. Prior to releasing reclaimed water to consumers, excessive concentrations of <b>inorganic</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compounds</b> (ammonium, nitrite and nitrate) must be removed, and the water has to meet sanitary standards. The dynamics and abundance of the different <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compounds</b> depend on the nitrification process (microbial oxidation of ammonia and nitrite). This is a key process in the nitrogen cycle and the autotrophic nitrifying bacteria catalyzing it are found in soils, sediments, wastewater, freshwater and marine water. Nitrification is a two-step process: first ammonia oxidizers convert ammonia to nitrite and then nitrite oxidizers convert nitrite to nitrate. An efficient nitrification process requires linked balanced activity of the two bacterial groups. Environmental factors that control nitrification affect ammonia and nitrite oxidizers differentially and thus disrupt the linkage between the two steps of the process. The effects of various environmental factors on the two bacterial groups and on the overall nitrification process are discussed. Light was identified to be a major factor inhibiting nitrification in a wastewater reservoir in Israel. Especially, nitrite oxidation was hindered causing the accumulation of nitrite during late spring and summer...|$|R

Most of these chemicals are xenobiotic compounds that are highly toxic to embryos, tadpoles, and terrestrial stages. Other substances that occur in pristine environments at harmless concentrations, such as <b>inorganic</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compounds,</b> may reach potentially toxic levels {{as a consequence of}} certain human activities, including the application of fertilizers. Most of the studies that analyze the effects of inorganic nitrogen on amphibian embryos are conducted with anurans, whereas little information exists regarding urodeles. Embryos of newts and salamanders usually exhibit longer times to hatch than frogs and toads. A longer hatching time results in a longer exposure of embryos to diffuse environmental pollution and therefore a higher risk of suffering toxic effects during the embryonic stage. We demonstrate that ammonium nitrate, a widely used nitrogenous fertilizer, at concentrations used in areas of high agricultural intensity, affects embryonic development of the Iberian newt (Lissotriton boscai). Although ammonium nitrate did not have significant lethal effects, it reduced the growth rate of exposed embryos, which were 9. 6 % smaller than controls. Hatching synchrony remained similar across treatments, and hatching date was not affected by ammonium nitrate, indicating that the effect on growth was not time- dependent. Researchers have demonstrated fitness costs in smaller than average tadpoles, suggesting that ammonium nitrate exposure could have long-term negative consequences for the Iberian newt.

40|$|Nitrate and {{ammonium}} are {{the most}} important nitrogen sources for phytoplankton growth. Differential utilization of <b>inorganic</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compounds</b> by phytoplankton has been observed and may have significant impacts on primary productivity at local scales. We used enrichment experiments with natural phytoplankton populations from the freshwater tidal zone of the Guadiana estuary, a coastal ecosystem increasingly subjected to anthropogenic influences, to study the effects of nitrate and ammonium on N-consumption and phytoplankton growth. In addition, we used combined additions of nitrate and ammonium to understand the inhibitory effect of ammonium over nitrate uptake. Ammonium concentrations in the freshwater tidal reaches of the Guadiana estuary throughout the sampling period were too low to exert an inhibitory effect on nitrate uptake or a toxic effect on phytoplankton growth. Nitrate was clearly the main nitrogen source for phytoplankton at the study site. Overall, nitrate seemed to become limiting at concentrations lower than 20 lM and N-limitation was particularly significant during summer. A trend of decreasing nitrate uptake with increasing ammonium concentrations and uptake suggested an overall preference for ammonium. However, preference for ammonium was group-specific, and it was observed mainly in green algae and cyanobacteria. In fact, cyanobacteria relied only on ammonium as their N-source. On the contrary, diatoms preferred nitrate, and did not respond to ammonium additions. The increasing eutrophication in the Guadiana estuary and particularly increased inputs of nitrogen as ammonium due to urban waste effluents may result in a shift in phytoplankton community composition, towards a dominance of cyanobacteria and green algae...|$|R

The total number of the wells sampled in the Chunnakam aquifer is 44. The coverage of wells with measurements of nitrate and nitrite concentrations in the database covering the study period from Januray, 2011 to August, 2011. The intrinsic vulnerability of the area is estimated by the DRASTIC model and the modified DRASTIC method was used to determine the nitrate-specific vulnerability of the aquifers. Average concentrations of nitrate-N and nitrite-N during the study period were 4. 869 and 0. 014 mg/L respectively. The average number of wells exceeding permissible level of NO 3 –N is approximately 6 – 12, which means that about 14 - 28 % out of the 44 wells. Modified DRASTIC (DI) index value computed as explained above increased from DI = 177 to a range of 182 to 197. In spite of the increase, the Modified DI values show that the aquifer vulnerability specific to nitrate contamination remains in “high ” category. Although nitrogen loading at the domestic sources and irrigation is of the same order of magnitude, the loading from fertilizer input is much larger which is about 15 times higher.

Phytoglobins {{are known to}} catalyze the reduction of <b>inorganic</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compounds</b> such as hydroxylamine. This reduction reaction has been studied extensively by single turnover reactions. However, currently there is no information available on the multi-turnover reactions catalyzed by phtyoglobins in presence of exogenous electron source. In this study we present the results of using of dithionite as an external source of electron for the reduction of hydroxylamine, which gives a maximal rate of 2. 8 s- 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the rate-limiting step {{in this case is}} the electron transfer from dithionite to the substrate bound phytoglobin. This completely contrasts with what was observed previously in the single turnover assay. Hydroxylamine reduction is the only known 2 -electron reduction process catalyzed by phytoglobin to date. In the current study we also present a novel 2 -electron reduction of hydrazine to ammonia catalyzed by phytoglobin. Hydrazine is an intermediate produced during the reduction of nitrogen to ammonia by nitrogenase enzyme. Hence, this discovery opens avenues for engineering phytoglobins for catalyzing the production of ammonia from dinitrogen. Interestingly, this reaction is also limited by electron transfer rate of the dithionite to hydrazine bound phytoglobins. Therefore catalytic rate of ammonia production by phtyoglobins can be improved by introducing a more robust reducing system. We believe this can be achieved by using physiological proteins responsible for reduction of phytoglobins. Hence, this presents a need for characterization and optimization of the physiological proteins responsible for phytoglobin reduction...|$|R

The absence and presence (0 and 0. 5 individual m- 2) of tilapia were investigated in 40 m 2 ponds stocked with 3 prawn juveniles (individual weight 5 g) m- 2 with or without added substrates for periphyton development. A locally formulated and prepared feed containing 30 % crude protein (C/N ratio 10) was applied daily, initially at 10 % of the prawn stocked biomass and was gradually reduced to 3 % of prawn biomass. Tapioca starch was used as carbohydrate source for increasing the C/N ratio from 10 (as in feed) to 20 and {{was applied to the}} water column separately from the feed. Addition of periphyton substrates significantly reduced the inorganic N-species (NH 3 -N, NO 2 -N and NO 3 -N) in the water column. It decreased the abundance of plankton in the overlying water and increased the abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates. The abundance of periphytic algae and periphyton biomass (dry matter, ash free dry matter and chlorophyll a) were significantly higher in tilapia free ponds compared to tilapia added ponds. Both substrates and tilapia had significant effects on feed conversion ratio (FCR) of freshwater prawn: substrates decreased FCR by 14 % while tilapia addition increased it by 16 %. The addition of substrates did not influence prawn and tilapia size at harvest but improved the survival of prawn from 54 to 77 %. Substrates contributed 44 % and 19 % higher net yield of prawn and tilapia, respectively whereas tilapia addition decreased the net yield of prawn by 14 %.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of research done on constructed treatment wetlands (CTWs) has focused on outdoor installations, with little work done on indoor systems. Previous work on the indoor CTW at the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge focused on whether the lack of floral diversity in the system would negatively impact its ability to remove various chemical parameters, but despite their great importance in bioremediation the microbial communities in these CTWs have never been studied. In this study, the presence and functionality of ammonia oxidizing bacteria was examined in various points of the treatment system using both culture-dependent and culture-independent DNA-based techniques. In addition, the overall ability of the treatment system to filter out <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compounds</b> was measured, to demonstrate how its functionality may have changed over the multi-year period since the last study. Water chemical testing revealed {{that there was a}} functional shift observed in each section of the treatment system, with much higher levels of ammonium leaving the first aerobic section than before and with the second anaerobic section now eliminating seemingly all forms of <b>inorganic</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>compounds.</b> Despite more levels of ammonium leaving the aerobic section than the anaerobic one, functional assays only indicated ammonia oxidizing activity from the microbial communities isolated from plant roots taken from the aerobic section than the anaerobic one. Metagenomics analysis of the microbial communities isolated from plant roots taken from both sections of the treatment system indicate a dominance of Proteobacteria throughout the entire system, with higher levels of Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Planctomycetes in the aerobic section. The higher percentage of Planctomycetes in the aerobic marsh compared to the anaerobic one might be correlated with the brackish water in this component of the CTW, as this condition gives ammonia oxidizing bacteria a competitive advantage over other bacterial types. Furthermore, the absence of Nitrospirae may be correlated with high levels of nitrite in the aerobic section, which would also indicate ammonia oxidation is occurring. Both of these findings suggest that conditions do exist for these bacteria to function well in situ, but some other properties of the marsh may inhibit their activity. For example, the presence of Actinobacteria in the anaerobic marsh could indicate that this section of the CTW Is not fully anaerobic, which may explain why ammonia oxidation occurs there. Due to the great potential of indoor CTWs, and the scarcity of data available on them, more work needs to be done fully understand the microbial dynamics and long-term functionality of these systems...|$|R
