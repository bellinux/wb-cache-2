50|$|This type is superficially {{very similar}} to a {{resonance}} absorption isolator, but the magnetic biassing differs, and the energy from the backward travelling signal is absorbed in a resistive film or card on one face of the ferrite block rather than within the ferrite itself. The bias field is weaker than that necessary to cause resonance at the operating frequency, but is instead designed to give the ferrite zero permeability for one sense of rotation of the microwave signal field. The bias polarity is such that this special condition arises for the <b>forward</b> <b>signal,</b> while the backward signal sees the ferrite as an ordinary permeable material. Consequently, the electromagnetic field of the <b>forward</b> <b>signal</b> tends to be excluded from the ferrite while the field of the backward wave is concentrated within it. This results in a null of the electric field of the <b>forward</b> <b>signal</b> {{on the surface of}} the ferrite where the resistive film is placed. Conversely for the backward signal, the electric field is strong over this surface and so its energy is dissipated in driving current through the film. In rectangular waveguide the ferrite block will typically occupy the full height from one broad-wall to the other, with the resistive film on the side facing the centre-line of the guide.|$|E

40|$|SummaryIn vertebrates, β {{cells are}} {{aggregated}} in the form of pancreatic islets. Within these islets, communication between β cells inhibits basal insulin secretion and enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, thus contributing to glucose homeostasis during fasting and feeding. In {{the search for}} the underlying molecular mechanism, we have discovered that β cells communicate via ephrin-As and EphAs. We provide evidence that ephrin-A 5 is required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We further show that EphA-ephrin-A-mediated β cell communication is bidirectional: EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> inhibits insulin secretion, whereas ephrin-A reverse signaling stimulates insulin secretion. EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> is downregulated in response to glucose, which indicates that, under basal conditions, β cells use EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> to suppress insulin secretion and that, under stimulatory conditions, they shift to ephrin-A reverse signaling to enhance insulin secretion. Thus, we explain how β cell communication in pancreatic islets conversely affects basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion to improve glucose homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|In {{the central}} nervous system, myelination of axons is {{required}} to ensure fast saltatory conduction and for survival of neurons. However, not all axons are myelinated, and the molecular mechanisms involved in guiding the oligodendrocyte processes toward the axons to be myelinated are not well understood. Only a few negative or positive guidance clues {{that are involved in}} regulating axo-glia interaction prior to myelination have been identified. One example is laminin, known to be required for early axo-glia interaction, which functions through a 6 b 1 integrin. Here, we identify the Eph-ephrin family of guidance receptors as novel regulators of the initial axo-glia interaction, preceding myelination. We demonstrate that so-called <b>forward</b> and reverse <b>signaling,</b> mediated by members of both Eph and ephrin subfamilies, has distinct and opposing effects on processes extension and myelin sheet formation. EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> inhibits oligodendrocyte process exten-sion and myelin sheet formation, and blocking of bidirectional signaling through this receptor enhances myelination. Similarly, EphB <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> also reduces myelin membrane formation, but in contrast to EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling,</b> this occurs in an integrin-dependent manner, which can be reversed by overexpression of a constitutive active b 1 -integrin. Furthermore, ephrin-B reverse signaling induced by EphA 4 or EphB 1 enhances myelin sheet formation. Combined, this suggests that the Eph-ephrin receptors are important mediators of bidirectional signaling between axons and oligodendrocytes. It further implies that balancing Eph-ephrin <b>forward</b> and reverse <b>signaling</b> is important in the selection process of axons to be myelinated...|$|R

In particular, continuous-time modulators are finding more acceptance at higher bandwidths due to the additional advantages they provide, such as better power efficiency and inherent anti-aliasing filtering, compared to their discrete-time counterparts. This thesis work presents the system level design of a continuous-time low-pass sigma-delta modulator targeting 11 bits of resolution over 100 MHz signal bandwidth.

40|$|EphB 4 and its {{cognitive}} ligand ephrinB 2 play {{an important}} role in embryonic vessel development and vascular remodeling. In addition, several reports suggest that this receptor ligand pair is also involved in pathologic vessel formation in adults including tumor angiogenesis. Eph/ephrin signaling is a complex phenomena characterized by receptor <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> through the tyrosine kinase of the receptor and ephrin reverse signaling through various protein–protein interaction domains and phosphorylation motifs of the ephrin ligands. Therefore, interfering with EphR/ephrin signaling by the means of targeted gene ablation, soluble receptors, dominant negative mutants or antisense molecules often does not allow to discriminate between inhibition of Eph/ephrin <b>forward</b> and reverse <b>signaling.</b> We developed a specific small molecular weight kinase inhibitor of the EphB 4 kinase, NVP-BHG 712, which inhibits EphB 4 kinase activity in the low nanomolar range in cellular assays showed high selectivity for targeting the EphB 4 kinase when profiled against other kinases in biochemical as well as in cell based assays. Furthermore, NVP-BHG 712 shows excellent pharmacokinetic properties and potently inhibits EphB 4 autophosphorylation in tissues after oral administration. In vivo, NVP-BHG 712 inhibits VEGF driven vessel formation, while it has only little effects on VEGF receptor (VEGFR) activity in vitro or in cellular assays. The data shown here suggest a close cross talk between the VEGFR and EphR signaling during vessel formation. In addition to its established function in vascular remodeling and endothelial arterio-venous differentiation, EphB 4 <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> appears to be an important mediator of VEGF induced angiogenesis since inhibition of EphB 4 <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> is sufficient to inhibit VEGF induced angiogenesis...|$|R

To investigate how ephrin-B 1 acts to influence development and congenital disease, we generated mice harboring a series of targeted point mutations in the ephrin-B 1 gene that independently ablate specific reverse signaling pathways, while maintaining forward signaling capacity. We demonstrate that both PDZ and phosphorylation-dependent reverse signaling by ephrin-B 1 are dispensable for craniofacial and skeletal development, whereas PDZ-dependent reverse signaling by ephrin-B 1 is critical for the formation of a major commissural axon tract, the corpus callosum. Ephrin-B 1 is strongly expressed within axons of the corpus callosum, and reverse signaling acts autonomously in cortical axons to mediate an avoidance response to its signaling partner EphB 2.

Information received over the feedback channel is used to modify the waveform transmitted on successive forward iterations {{in such a way that}} the expected value of <b>forward</b> <b>signal</b> energy is zero on all iterations after the first. Similarly, information is sent over the feedback channel in such a way that the expected value of feedback signal energy is also zero on all iterations after the first. These schemes are shown to achieve a lower probability of error than the best one-way coding scheme at all rates up to the forward channel capacity, provided only that the feedback channel capacity be greater than the forward channel capacity.

In the first period, jammers amplify and <b>forward</b> <b>signals</b> quickly to make time delay difference between the target echo and itself short enough to enter the radar range gate; due to its higher power of interference signal, the range gate cannot lock the exact interference signal.

In this period, time delay of a jammer’s <b>forwarding</b> <b>signal</b> is gradually extended to increase distance between the interference signal and target signal in a range dimension. Because the range gate is locked in the interference signal, the target has been dragged out of the range gate gradually.
