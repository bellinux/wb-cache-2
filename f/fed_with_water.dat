5|$|The North Mere is 5.6-acres (2.25 ha) large, and {{is blocked}} off on its {{northern}} end by a sod-cast bank, {{adjacent to the}} site of the North Gate. The southern half takes the form of a 331-foot (101 m) long moat, which was recorded as being 18-foot (5.5 m) deep in the medieval period, terminating in the West Gate. The northern part of this mere occasionally floods in the 21st century, creating a temporary lake, and the moated section usually still contains some standing water. The West Mere, covering 2.25-acres (1 ha), stretches away from the location of West Gate and is blocked at the far end by a small, stone dam. Three rectangular fishponds were built alongside the West Mere, the smallest, probably a stew pond for raising young fish, being <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> from the lake. A protective earthen bank, probably originally reinforced by a timber palisade, ran for approximately 490 feet (150 m) along either side of the West Gate, where a gatehouse was probably built. At the far end of the lake complex was the South Mere, 2.25-acres (1 ha) in size, with the South Gate positioned in its eastern corner.|$|E
25|$|The Beverley and Barmston Drain is {{the main}} feature of a land {{drainage}} scheme authorised in 1798 {{to the west of}} the River Hull in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. The area consisted of salt marshes to the south and carrs to the north, <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> from the higher wolds which lay to the north, and from inundation by tidal water passing up the river from the Humber. Some attempts to reduce the flooding by building embankments had been made by the fourteenth century, and windpumps appeared in the seventeenth century. The Holderness Drainage scheme, which protected the area to the east of the river, was completed in 1772, and attention was then given to resolving flooding of the carrs.|$|E

Of particular note are the main hall {{on the first floor}} overlooking the garden and decorated with Corinthian columns and stucco, and the dining room with frescoes of Parnassus by Andrea Appiani from 1811.

40|$|Abstract: Survival of larvae of mud crab, Scylla serrata (Forsskal, 1775) is a {{persistent}} {{issue in the}} field of induced breeding of the species. A preliminary study was conducted on feeding regimes of laboratory reared larvae and juveniles of S. serrata. The results showed that the survival of the larvae <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> green <b>water</b> alone or green <b>water</b> <b>with</b> plankton and feed was not significantly different from the control where no feeding was given. All the larvae died at Zoea 1 after 4 days of culture without metamorphose to Zoea 2 stage. Larvae <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> green <b>water,</b> rotifer and Artemia nauplii or <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> green <b>water</b> and <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> rotifer, artificial plankton, prepared diet and Artemia nauplii showed similar results with growth and metamorphosis of the larvae reared in green <b>water</b> and <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> Artemia nauplii. The larvae reared in green water, rotifer and Artemia nauplii showed better survival rate of Zoea compared to larvae reared in green water and Artemia nauplii but the latter only metamorphosed to Crab 1 Stage. Further researches are proposed to evaluate differential nutritional composition of the live feeds to support the life of mud crab larvae...|$|R

2500|$|At the tunnel's {{southern}} end, {{the canal}} {{was on the}} [...] contour, and Taylor constructed an inclined plane to drop the level by [...] to the quay at Morwellham. There were two tracks, one running to the quay, and a second which ended some [...] higher at ore-chutes above the Lower Copper Quay. The rails were initially [...] "L" [...] shaped cast iron plate rails, spaced [...] apart between the flanges, although trough-shaped rails were used in places on the quay, particularly where roads crossed the tracks. Four-wheeled tipping wagons which had larger wheels at the front than at the rear were used on the twin tracks, which operated independently. The system was powered by a large overshot waterwheel, [...] in diameter and [...] wide, situated alongside the winding house {{at the head of}} the incline, which was <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> from the canal. It drove a declutchable winch, to which the wagons were attached by chains. Wagons arriving at the top of the incline passed onto a sloping platform, which moved to a horizontal position due to the weight of the wagon, and this disconnected the waterwheel from the drum holding the chain. The rails were later replaced by wrought iron edge rails, and the chains by cables.|$|E

6000|$|These were Rondelet's palmy days. He had got a theatre {{of anatomy}} built at Montpellier, where he himself {{dissected}} publicly.

[...] There, too, may be seen the remnants of the great tanks, <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> brought through earthen pipes from the Fountain of Albe, wherein he kept the fish whose habits he observed.

[...] He had a large and handsome house in the city itself, a large practice as physician in the country round; money flowed in fast to him, and flowed out fast likewise. He spent much upon building, pulling down, rebuilding, and sent the bills in seemingly to his wife and to his guardian angel Catharine. He himself had never a penny in his purse: but earned the money, and let his ladies spend it; an equitable and pleasant division of labour which most married men would do well to imitate. A generous, affectionate, careless little man, he gave away, says his pupil and biographer, Joubert, his valuable specimens to any savant who begged for them, or left them about to be stolen by visitors, who, like too many collectors in all ages, possessed light fingers and lighter consciences. So pacific was he meanwhile, and so brave withal that even in the fearful years of [...] "The Troubles," [...] he would never carry sword, nor even tuck or dagger: but went about on the most lonesome journeys as one who wore a charmed life, secure in God and in his calling, which was to heal, and not to kill.|$|E
