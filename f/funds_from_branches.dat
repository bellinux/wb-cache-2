Originally a Seibu Department Stores branch was planned in Kasukabe, but as Seibu's contract agreement was terminated during the construction, Ito-Yokado capitalize the opportunity to build the first Robinson Japan. This is in coincidence that the western exit of the Kasukabe Station is near the Kasukabe branch of Ito-Yokado.|$|R

[...] In 1936, unification of the two was again planned, with the SSP conceding to the Socialist League's support for the Communist Party of Great Britain to affiliate to the Labour Party, but this foundered over the Socialist League's now cordial relationship with the ILP, while the SSP still had a remaining financial dispute, concerning £200 of <b>funds</b> <b>from</b> the Hamilton <b>branch.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the exposure of}} German parent banks to the disruptions on sale and repurchase markets (repo markets) during the financial crisis has affected their provision of funds to their foreign branches and subsidiaries via bank-internal capital markets. The collapse of the subprime market, the rescue of Bear Stearns and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers are analyzed {{with regard to their}} role as amplifiers of uncertainty about the value of collateral used in repo transactions and mistrust among market participants. The results show that parent banks which were more exposed to these disruptions were more likely to withdraw bank-internal <b>funds</b> <b>from</b> their <b>branches</b> and subsidiaries located abroad. Among the three events, the rescue of Bear Stearns triggered the largest contraction on internal capital markets from the part of the parent bank, possibly because this event demonstrated {{for the first time the}} fragility of even very large financial institutions. After the subprime market collapse, branches were briefly more protected as core investment locations, while subsidiaries were used as core funding locations up to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. All in all, funding via repo markets is found to be one channel that transmitted shocks primarily related to the US financial system abroad...|$|R

Exeter manager Paul Tisdale commented on his debut saying; [...] "It's remarkable that James should be on the field after only joining us a few weeks ago.

This is the case, for instance, of users who want to cancel a deposit and to recover their money. Hence, the branch can anticipate this expenditure, in time and in quantity.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{influences}} of the Showa Financial Crisis on Mitsubishi Bank, {{one of the largest}} banks in prewar Japan, using its daily financial data. It is known that the Crisis gave contrasting effects on the major banks and the other ones. Large amount of deposits moved from the latter to the former including Mitsubishi Bank. However, these observations are mainly based on yearly data. On the other hand, a financial crisis is essentially an acute event, and therefore we can {{have a better understanding of}} it, using the data with high frequency. Here, we use the daily financial data of the headquarters of Mitsubishi Bank, as well as its inside business report with information on the loans and deposits of the branches. Several interesting facts have emerged. First, even on the daily basis, the Financial Crisis gave only a positive impact on the deposits of the headquarters of Mitsubishi Bank. Second, some of its branches, mainly in the western district, became targets of bank runs, but it was limited to the day when the Crisis came to the peak. Third, the Crisis also gave a positive impact on the loans of Mitsubishi Bank. It supplied rescue loans to the banks faced with runs, and to the companies which had borrowed <b>fund</b> <b>from</b> those banks and suffered from the credit crunch. Finally, as a result of the Crisis, inside Mitsubishi Bank, the <b>fund</b> flows <b>from</b> the <b>branches</b> to the headquarters substantially increased. The headquarters applied those funds, together with the increased deposits of itself, mainly to the national bonds and corporate bonds. ...|$|R
40|$|Currently we {{are using}} {{traditional}} method of fund transferring for any amounts within the banking sector. Banks also demand substantial fees to transfer money from one account to another account. According to that each bank uses various methods to transferring funds among the banks such as Cheques, Bank Drafts, and SWIFT etc. Also within the branch of a particular bank, they use Cheques & Branch Advises etc. The customers of each bank hope {{to have a very}} effective, secured & speedy method to get their <b>funds</b> <b>from</b> any <b>branch</b> within the Island. Therefore it is very useful to have a fast and cost effective money transfer method for Peoples Bank. The Peoples Bank as a leading government bank in our country, we have huge customer base not only in the Island but also all over the world. Also we have lot of number of corporate customers such as Sri Lanka Army, Ceylon Electricity Board, Sri Lanka Telecom, Sri Lanka Navy etc. They handover their salaries, EPF payments, Loan payments to credit their accounts in every month. To dispatch those transactions we use couple of funds transferring methods mentioned in first paragraph. But some of them are not act as efficient manner. In additionally those customers hand over their data by hand from each part of the Island like Anuradhapura, Kandy, Galle, Kurunegala etc. So sometimes they are unable to handover those on-time to the People's Bank head office due to various reasons. Considering the private sector bank, they use very fast methods of fund transferring, than the government sector banks. Therefore this new system introduces to eliminate the drawbacks of existing data collection & funds transferring methods. After implementing the proposed system, we can reduce manpower, time, stationeries, outstanding issues, cost of various categories etc. It is also will help to corporate customers to send the data, download return transactions through the web. This would be more secure and cost effective when compare with the existing money transferring methods in Peoples Bank. The purpose of this project is to show the usefulness of such a system for Peoples Bank and implement a prototype for branch to branch funds transferring...|$|R
5000|$|In 1975, TM's founder {{met with}} Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to discuss [...] "the {{possibility}} of structuring an ideal society" [...] through Transcendental Meditation, In 1977 a New Jersey, U.S. district {{court held that}} a curriculum comprising the Science of Creative Intelligence and TM was religious in nature (Malnak v Yogi). The decision was appealed and in 1979 the 3rd Circuit opinion affirmed the decision and held that although SCI/TM is not a theistic religion, it deals with issues of ultimate concern, truth, and other ideas analogous to those of well-recognized religions and it therefore violated the Establishment Clause. Beginning in 1979 the German government released a number of booklets about problems arising for seven new religious movements in Germany, with the German term for these organizations variously translated as [...] "psychogroups" [...] and [...] "psychotheraphy groups". These organizations, including TM, filed lawsuits trying to block the reports. The courts ruled that the booklets must only include factual information and exclude speculation, rumors, and matters that are unclear, and the booklets were re-released primarily containing quotations from materials of the organizations themselves. In 1996 a commission appointed by the German government concluded that new religious movements and [...] "psychotherapy groups" [...] did not present any danger to the state or to society. In 1987, an Israeli government report that was criticized as [...] "one sided and negative", defined TM as a [...] "cult group ... targeted by anti-cult activists". The 1995 report of the Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France included Transcendental Meditation in its list of cults. The U.S. government has characterized the Transcendental Meditation technique as worthy of research and has awarded more than $25 million in <b>funding</b> <b>from</b> different <b>branches</b> of the National Institutes of Health for scientific analysis {{of the effects of}} TM on high blood pressure. The U.S. United States Department of Veterans Affairs sees it as a potential tool for the treatment of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and commenced research on the technique (and two other meditation systems) in 2012. According to author Patrick Gresham Williams, [...] "the government will pay" [...] for any U.S. veteran to learn TM if it is prescribed by a Veterans Administration medical doctor.|$|R
