500|$|During these years, he also raced in the Indianapolis 500 in both 1967 and 1968, but {{finished}} only 24th and 32nd, completing {{only five}} laps in 1968 after finishing {{slightly more than}} half of the 1967 race. In an interview in 2014, Heinz Prüller recalled Rindt speaking about Indianapolis in 1967: [...] "In Indianapolis, I always feel like I am on my way to my own funeral."

500|$|Patton {{called his}} career, with its mixture of children's {{television}} and darker roles in independent films, [...] "an odd experience" [...] and {{told a reporter}} that he had spent half his life at Nickelodeon. [...] In 2009, he was cast as Bot, the robot superhero, on the children's show Team Umizoomi through the relationships he had made at Nickelodeon on Blue's Clues. [...] He found working on Team Umizoomi [...] "comforting" [...] {{because many of the}} same crew, producers, and creators had also worked on Blue's Clues. [...] It {{was the first time he}} had worked as a voice-over artist, unlike on Blue's Clues, when he was able to be more physical acting in front of a blue screen. [...] <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>about</b> Team Umizoomi, [...] "the work the animators have done on it has been superlative". [...] He stated that he enjoyed working on Team Umizoomi because it gave him the opportunity to participate in a show from its inception, which he had missed with Blue's Clues. [...] Patton said his voice performance of Bot, which he modeled on Brent Spiner's performance as the android Data on [...] and was influenced by Mel Blanc's work in the classic Warner Bros. cartoons, [...] "ended up sounding more like my natural voice, with a teeny bit of superhero in there". [...] Despite both roles in Blue's Clues and Team Umizoomi requiring him to sing, he did not consider himself a natural singer and felt that he had to work hard at it. [...] <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>about</b> being cast as Bot, [...] "I get to be a superhero. Who doesn't want to be a superhero"?.|$|E

500|$|Bell lauded the [...] "brilliant {{conversation}} between Quinn and Sue {{toward the end}} where Sue told Quinn that she admired her". Lynch though that Kurt was [...] "out of line" [...] when he [...] "declared Quinn didn't {{know what it was}} like to truly suffer". He noted that she was [...] "kicked out of her house and disowned by her father while pregnant" [...] and added, [...] "she's suffered plenty for a teenager". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the episode's final scene, which ended as the car Quinn was driving was about to be hit by a rapidly moving truck, [...] "you can't help but feel sucker-punched when something like this happens". Flandez called it a [...] "cowardly ending", but Canning praised the [...] "good cliffhanger", and the [...] "subtle enough" [...] storytelling that did not [...] "telegraph anything" [...] before the closing sequence.|$|E
500|$|When Locke {{began writing}} {{the letters that}} would {{eventually}} become Some Thoughts on Education, he was addressing an aristocrat, but the final text appeals to a much wider audience. For example, Locke writes: [...] "I place Vertue [...] as {{the first and most}} necessary of those Endowments, that belong to a Man or a Gentleman." [...] James Axtell, who edited the most comprehensive edition of Locke's educational writings, has explained that although [...] "he was writing for this small class, this does not preclude the possibility that many of the things <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> education, especially its main principles, were equally applicable to all children" [...] (Axtell's emphasis). This was a contemporary view as well; Pierre Coste, in his introduction in the first French edition in 1695, wrote, [...] "it is certain that this Work was particularly designed for the education of Gentlemen: but this does not prevent its serving also for the education of all sorts of Children, of whatever class they are." ...|$|E
500|$|Achebe's {{criticism}} {{has become a}} mainstream perspective on Conrad's work. The essay {{was included in the}} 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad's novel. Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of [...] "the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book..." [...] Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism [...] "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe." [...] Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: [...] "It's not in my nature to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it– with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about. And read it beside African works." [...] Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled [...] "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": [...] "Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And {{if it were not for}} what <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction." ...|$|E

500|$|Mansukhani later {{added the}} gay storyline {{because he thought}} it was an issue that needed to be touched on. However, the {{director}} did not want the film to be serious or preachy: [...] "I also realise that when you preach via cinema nobody wants to hear it". [...] "The film has a message, if you get it, great. If you don’t, no problem, sit back, relax and enjoy the film", <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> making Dostana a romantic comedy. In February 2008, Johar announced the film's title; the producer named it after a 1980 film produced by his father, Yash Johar. Asked if his film was also a love triangle, he replied: [...] "Well, yes and no. Though it's a love story, there's a never-before twist in the tale. All I can say on record is that we've never had a love triangle like this before." [...] The gay storyline was not disclosed until the trailers were released. Manan Sagar was hired to edit the film, and the duo Salim–Sulaiman composed the background score.|$|E
500|$|On 8 August 2010, Robinson {{retired from}} {{international}} football with immediate effect, despite having been selected for a friendly against Hungary. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> his retirement, [...] "Only now have I {{been able to}} make this decision as previously I haven't been in contention for selection, I don't see myself as a number three or four keeper and find that role very frustrating," [...] while Allardyce backed his decision, stating, [...] "As my player, I support him because I see him week in, week out and know how well he has performed. It's a big decision he's made, but I understand it." [...] In his international career, Robinson had won 41 caps for England, 25 of which came in competitive international matches (either the qualification or final rounds of the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship). Despite Steve Kean stating that England should recall him in March 2012, Robinson stated that he had no interest in a return later that month. In February 2014, Robinson said that he would be open to an international return for the 2014 FIFA World Cup if England manager Roy Hodgson decided to recall him.|$|E
500|$|In the {{preliminary}} {{round of the}} 200-meter butterfly, Tarwater turned in the fastest time, acknowledging that nerves {{played a role in}} his fast swim. In the semi-finals, he achieved a new personal best of 1:54.72 and finished with the second-fastest time, just seven-tenths of a second slower than Phelps. [...] "It felt great, but there's still no celebrating for me," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the swim. In the finals, Tarwater was exactly tied with Phelps and on world-record pace through the first 50 meters. He stayed near Phelps for 150 meters before fading on the last 50. In the last 25 meters, he was passed by Gil Stovall, who beat his personal best by a second and a half, to finish third. Tarwater also swam a new personal best – 1:54.46 – but it was not good enough to make the Olympic team, missing out by six-tenths of a second. After the race, he briefly considered retiring before deciding to finish the meet. [...] "I don't know what the future is going to bring, but I didn't want to go out knowing I didn't get back up," [...] he said. He finished eighth in the 100-meter butterfly; earlier, he failed to make the finals in the freestyle events.|$|E

500|$|In June 2017, the WBO {{confirmed}} {{that they would}} sanction a regional unification fight between Singh and WBO Oriental super middleweight champion Zulpikar Maimaitiali of China. New India Express announced the fight, billed as [...] "Battleground Asia" [...] would take place on 5 August 2017 at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Indoor Stadium in Mumbai. On 26 July, IOS Boxing Promotions and Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions announced that they had reached a deal to work together once again. Singh retained his Asia Pacific title and won the Oriential title after the fight went to the scorecards after 10 rounds. The judges scored the fight 96-93, 95-94, 95-94 in favour of Singh. Although the fight was scored close, Singh {{seemed to have the}} fight under control using his height and reach. In round six, Maimaitiali was docked a point for repeated low blows after being warned in previous rounds. Had he not been docked a point, the fight would have ended as a majority draw. After the bout, Singh praised his opponent, [...] "I didn't expect him to fight so well and last the distance. I thought this would last for a maximum of 5-6 rounds. Hence I didn't fight according to my strategies. I just want to tell China, please don't come to our border. This is for peace." [...] <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the bout, [...] "The blows disturbed me. He has been fantastic. His aggression was terrific." [...] He also offered the title back to Maimaitiali, as a message for peace. This was in relation to the recent border tension between India and China.|$|E
500|$|Janssen {{said the}} film is [...] "definitely played {{with a bit of}} a wink and doesn't take itself too seriously." [...] Wirkola himself {{described}} it as [...] "a little more grounded" [...] and action-centered than Dead Snow. He recalled that he has tried to downplay comedy elements: [...] "If you go too far, it can turn into a spoof almost...We shot a lot more than what is in the movie of course and it’s just balancing it when you’re cutting." [...] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that [...] "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out." [...] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback. Wirkola said, [...] "I was afraid. I actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always {{knew it was going to}} be R." [...] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman [...] "was perceptive enough to see the same thing and got behind it as well." [...] Wirkola said, [...] "The pre-production and shooting went very smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and how they do things here with testing and the studio." [...] <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the test screenings in particular: [...] "I can see why they do it – there’s a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it’s a flawed process, I really do." [...] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Tancharoen {{was chosen}} as the tour director. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the {{development}} of the tour, [...] "Coming from a movie lovers' background, I wanted to make it seem like a film. A little Joel Schumacher meets Tim Burton". He further explained that the onyx stone symbolized untapped desire. The stage was less elaborate than her previous tour, Dream Within a Dream Tour, with no runway extended towards the audience, {{in order to keep the}} show faithful to the New York theatre theme. There were three video screens above the stage. Also present were several LED columned-shaped video screens in the stage. The setlist was mostly composed from songs from In the Zone ("Early Mornin'" [...] and [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] being the only songs of the album to not be on the tour). Other songs included were [...] "Boys", [...] "I'm A Slave 4 U,"and [...] "Overprotected" [...] from Britney (2001). Also included were three of her early hits, [...] "...Baby One More Time", (You Drive Me) Crazy and [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", reworked with elements of jazz and blues. The promotional photos for the tour were by Markus Klinko and Indrani. Tour promoter Clear Channel Entertainment marketed the tour to an entirely different demographic than her previous tours, changing from families and children to a more adult audience. The show was also targeted to the gay market. Promotional campaigns included were Flash animated e-mails targeted to two million people who fitted the audience description. The tour was also advertised in several radio stations and TV shows for those audiences, such as The O.C. MTV {{was chosen as}} the tour sponsor. The sponsorship was extended to advertisements in the tickets and interactive promotions in MTV.com, such as exclusive downloads, streaming video and ticket and merchandise auctions benefiting the Britney Spears Foundation. Three episodes of TRL were dedicated to a behind-the-scenes special. Vice president of music marketing and promotion Joe Armenia talked about the sponsorship, ...|$|E
