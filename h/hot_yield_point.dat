At temperatures below 700 - 800 °C, the homogenuous and total strains for Timetal-LCB were greater than those for Timetal- 125. In contrast, at temperatures over 800 °C, Timetal- 125 showed better <b>hot</b> ductility. The <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> phenomena was observed in Timetal-LCB at all temperatures. Unlikely, for Timetal- 125, it was observed only at temperatures over 800 °C. The weaker <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> phenomena in Timetal- 125 {{could be attributed to}} the negative effect of Al on the diffusion of V. At all temperatures Timetal-LCB exhibited higher strength than Timetal- 125. It was found {{that there should be a}} direct relationship between the extent of <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> phenomena and strength and dynamic softening through hot tensile testing. It was observed that at temperatures beyond 800 °C (beta phase field in both alloys) dynamic recrystallization can progress more in Timetal- 125 than in Timetal-LCB. These results were in good agreement with the better hot ductility of Timetal- 125 at high temperatures. At low temperatures, i. e. below 700 - 800 °C, partial dynamic recrystallization occurs in beta and dynamic globularization in alpha phase. These processes progress more in Timetal-LCB than in Timetal- 125...|$|R

5000|$|Low {{carbon steel}} {{generally}} exhibits a very linear stress-strain relationship up to a well defined <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> (Fig.2). The linear {{portion of the}} curve is the elastic region and the slope is the modulus of elasticity or Young's Modulus ( [...] Young's Modulus is {{the ratio of the}} compressive stress to the longitudinal strain).Many ductile materials including some metals, polymers and ceramics exhibit a <b>yield</b> <b>point.</b> Plastic flow initiates at the upper <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> and continues at the lower one. At lower <b>yield</b> <b>point,</b> permanent deformation is heterogeneously distributed along the sample. The deformation band which formed at the upper <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> will propagate along the gage length at the lower <b>yield</b> <b>point.</b> The band occupies the whole of the gage at the luders strain. Beyond this point, work hardening commences. The appearance of the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> is associated with pinning of dislocations in the system. Specifically, solid solution interacts with dislocations and acts as pin and prevent dislocation from moving. Therefore, the stress needed to initiate the movement will be large. As long as the dislocation escape from the pinning, stress needed to continue it is less.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present a method that {{simplifies}} the standard procedure to determine the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> providing complementary information about changes in the behaviour of the materials under study. It is generally accepted that the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> is determined by the inflection point of the curve of pressure versus apparent volume of the sample, P(V), from Hg porosimetry runs. Although compressible materials present an easily identifiable neat inflection point, in resilient materials, the inflection point is not easy to identify by simple visual inspection of the curve. A physical magnitude (K') is introduced to characterise the evolution of the material's compliance under isotropic pressure. The physical meaning of K' is the variation in the resistance to uniform compression with the pressure applied, helping to identify the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> and the plastic mechanism beyond the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> in a single run. © 2009 Académie des sciences.

Results obtained from the acoustic emission measurements are compared to crack development at preselected stress levels up to specimen failure.

The mechanical behavior of potash rock displays two stress-strain trends under the same load conditions. Based on the acoustic emission rate, it was possible to delineate an approximate <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> of potash rock. However, a more detailed study of the acoustic emission amplitude and energy distributions showed that high amplitude events with long event durations are initially observed to occur near the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> of the stress strain curves.

The replaceable steel connection with low <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> metal is proposed based {{on the concept of}} earthquake resilient structure. In this connection, the weakened parts in the flange slab and web plate are filled with low <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> metal, and the metal firstly yields and dissipates energy sufficiently in earthquake; hence, the main parts are intact and the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> metal can be replaced. The seismic performances of the three types of connections which include traditional connection, beam end weakened connection, and replaceable connection with low <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> steel under low cycle reciprocating load are studied. In addition, the energy dissipation capacity and damage characteristics of different connections are compared. The multiscale finite element models for the steel frames with different connections are analyzed by time-history method; both the computational efficiency and the accuracy are assured.
