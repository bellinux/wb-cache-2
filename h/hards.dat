500|$|After the film's initial release, {{critical}} reception {{continues to}} be positive. Film scholar Andy Klein wrote that the film is [...] "almost a distillation of [...] post-1986 work.

Mark Salisbury of Empire Magazine gave the film four stars out of five, calling it [...] "Infinitely more exciting than a dozen Die <b>Hards,</b> action cinema doesn't come any better than this." [...] Salisbury compared Hard Boiled to Woo's American films, stating that his Hong Kong films are [...] "not as slick as his later films, [...] more inventive and stylised and [...] great early performances from Fat and Leung". Empire placed the film at number 70 in their list of [...] "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema" [...] in 2010.
