5|$|Kodumanal {{was popular}} for the <b>gem-cutting</b> {{industry}} and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz {{are located in}} the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.|$|E
25|$|Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg {{introduced}} the first movable type printing system in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting type {{based on a}} matrix and hand mould, adaptations to the screw-press, {{the use of an}} oil-based ink, {{and the creation of a}} softer and more absorbent paper. Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, tin, antimony, copper and bismuth – the same components still used today.

2500|$|When {{the play}} debuted at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York City, Burton {{garnered}} good reviews for {{his portrayal of}} a [...] "bold and virile" [...] Hamlet. Howard Taubman of The New York Times called it [...] "a performance of electrical power and sweeping virility", noting {{that he had never}} known or seen [...] "a Hamlet of such tempestuous manliness". A critic from Time magazine said that Burton [...] "put his passion into Hamlet's language rather than the character. His acting is a technician's marvel. His voice has <b>gem-cutting</b> precision." [...] Walter Kerr felt that though Burton carried [...] "a certain lack of feeling" [...] in his performance, he appreciated Burton's [...] "reverberating" [...] vocal projections. The opening night party was a lavish affair, attended by six hundred celebrities. The play ran for 137 performances, beating the previous record set by Gielgud himself in 1936. The most successful aspect of the production, apart from Burton's performance, was generally considered to be Hume Cronyn's performance as Polonius, winning him the only Tony Award he would ever receive in a competitive category. Burton himself was nominated for his second Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play but lost to Alec Guinness for his portrayal of the poet Dylan Thomas. The performance was immortalised in a film that was created by recording three live performances on camera from 30 June 1964 to 1 July 1964 using a process called Electronovision; it played in US theatres for a week in 1964. The play was also the subject of books written by cast members William Redfield and Richard L. Sterne.|$|E
60|$|Never {{had real}} bard a task more fit for sublime ardor and genius than to sing worthily the songs these States have already indicated. Their origin, Washington, '76, the {{picturesqueness}} of old times, {{the war of}} 1812 and the sea-fights; the incredible rapidity of movement and breadth of area--to fuse and compact the South and North, the East and West, to express the native forms, situations, scenes, from Montauk to California, and from the Saguenay to the Rio Grande--the working out on such gigantic scales, and with such a swift and mighty play of changing light and shade, of the great problems of man and freedom,--how {{far ahead of the}} stereotyped plots, or <b>gem-cutting,</b> or tales of love, or wars of mere ambition! Our history is so full of spinal, modern, germinal subjects--one above all. What the ancient siege of Illium, and the puissance of Hector's and Agamemnon's warriors proved to Hellenic art and literature, and all art and literature since, may prove the war of attempted secession of 1861-'65 to the future esthetics, drama, romance, poems of the United States.|$|E

50|$|Even in the Middle Ages, Hettenrodt {{was already}} no longer purely a farming village. The areas {{that could be}} used for cropraising were small and with their sparse soil on slopes yielded less than ample harvests, {{especially}} for big families.

5000|$|In Babylonia, {{in place}} of the bas relief, there is greater use of {{three-dimensional}} figures in the round [...] - [...] the earliest examples being the statues from Girsu, that are realistic if somewhat clumsy. The paucity of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious, and led to a high perfection in the art of <b>gem-cutting.</b> Two seal-cylinders from the age of Sargon of Akkad are among the best examples of their kind. One of the first remarkable specimens of early metallurgy to be discovered by archaeologists is the silver vase of Entemena. At a later epoch, great excellence was attained in the manufacture of such jewellery as earrings and bracelets of gold. Copper, too, was worked with skill; indeed, it is possible that Babylonia was the original home of copper-working.|$|E
50|$|In Babylonia, an {{abundance}} of clay, and lack of stone, led to greater use of mudbrick; Babylonian, Sumerian and Assyrian temples were massive structures of crude brick which were supported by buttresses, the rain being carried off by drains.

The walls were brilliantly coloured, and sometimes plated with zinc or gold, {{as well as with}} tiles. Painted terracotta cones for torches were also embedded in the plaster.

For several years Danilo's betrothed Katyenka (Katya) waits for him and stays unmarried {{despite the fact that}} everyone laughs at her. She is the only person who believes that Danilo will return. She is quickly nicknamed [...] "Dead Man's Bride". When both of her parents die, she moves away from her family and goes to Danilo's house and takes care of his old teacher Prokopich, although she knows that living with a man can ruin her reputation. Prokopich welcomes her happily. He earns some money by <b>gem-cutting,</b> Katya runs the house, cooks, and does the gardening. When Prokopich gets too old to work, Katya realizes that she cannot possibly support herself by needlework alone. She asks him to teach her some stone craft. Prokopich laughs at first, because he does not believe <b>gem-cutting</b> is a suitable job for a woman, but soon relents. He teaches her how to work with malachite. After he dies, Katya decides to live in the house alone. Her strange behaviour, her refusal to marry someone and lead a normal life cause people at the village to think that she is insane or even a witch, but Katya firmly believes that Danilo will [...] "learn all he wants to know, there in the mountain, and then he'll come". She wants to try making medallions and selling them. There are no gemstones left, so she goes to the forest, finds an exceptional piece of gemstone and starts working. After the medallions are finished, she goes to the town to the merchant who used to buy Prokopich's work. He reluctantly buys them all, because her work is very beautiful. Katya feels as if this was a token from Danilo. She runs back to the forest and starts calling for him. The Mistress of the Copper Mountain appears. Katya bravely demands that she gives Danilo back. The Mistress takes her to Danilo and says: [...] "Well, Danilo the Master Craftsman, now you must choose. If you go with her you forget all that is mine, if you remain here, them you must forget her and all living people". Danilo chooses Katya, saying that he thinks about her every moment. The Mistress is pleased with Katya's bravery and rewards her by letting Danilo remember everything that he had learned in the Mountain. She then warns Danilo to never tell anyone about his life there. The couple thanks the Mistress and goes back to the village. When asked about his disappearance, Danilo claims that he simply left to Kolyvan to train under another craftsman. He marries Katya. His works is extraordinary, and everyone starts calling him [...] "the mountain craftsman".|$|E

40|$|This paper, while {{investigating}} {{into the}} topic of gem collecting in Pliny the Elder’s Natural History, where it is conceptualized and termed “dactyliotheca”, pursues a twofold purpose. In the first place, the close connection between precious stones and <b>gem-cutting</b> technique is examined, {{as well as the}} gems’ value and connotation as symbols in close connection with the owner of the gems, {{in the context of the}} aesthetics and ethics of the luxuria. Gem collecting acts as a metonym for Rome’s further establishment of its legitimacy and authority, although the cultural model shaping such a specific image of the self stems from the Hellenistic court. In the second place, the paper focuses on Posidippus’ lithikà as the Hellenistic ancestor of such a Roman attitude. Posidippus’ Lithikà also throws light on the debate on the first production of large cameos associated with the dynastic court, supporting arguments in favour of their dating back to the early Hellenistic period, in spite of experimental evidence...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{descriptions}} of precious stones in A Treatise Concerning the Arte of Limning by Nicholas Hilliard. He was the renowned artist of portrait miniature, which was then called limning, in the Elizabethan court of late 16 th century England. He was also a skilled goldsmith. He discussed precious stones in relation to the seven principal colours of miniature painting; amethyst for murrey (colour of mulberry), ruby for red, sapphire for blue, emerald for green, topaz for yellow, and diamond for white and black. Unlike the traditional lapidaries of the Middle Ages which enumerated their virtues and mysterious powers, he put an emphasis on the beauty of precious stones, viz. pure colour and brilliance of gems. In addition, the treatise explains the importance of the perfection of <b>gem-cutting</b> for the maximum brilliance of diamonds. He also described the individual reactions of gemstones against fire or heating, which might cause the change of colours. All of these topics are the issues of today's gemmology. It can be considered that the treatise of Nicholas Hilliard is the herald of m odern gemmology...|$|E
