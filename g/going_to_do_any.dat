2500|$|However, {{speaking}} after Disney's 2012 {{acquisition of}} Lucasfilm, Lucas (sitting alongside new Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy), said: [...] "I always said I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> more, and that's true, because I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> more. [...] But that doesn't mean I'm unwilling {{to turn it}} over to Kathy to do more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Star Wars creator George Lucas {{discussed}} {{ideas for}} a sequel trilogy several times after {{the conclusion of}} the original trilogy, but denied any intent to make it. In October 2012, he sold his production company Lucasfilm, and with it the Star Wars franchise, to The Walt Disney Company. Speaking alongside Lucasfilm's new president, Kathleen Kennedy, Lucas said: [...] "I always said I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> more and that's true, because I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> more, but that doesn't mean I'm unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Think he'd play if I put him down? Because, you know, I'm dashed if I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> grovelling {{and that}} sort of thing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Looks {{like that}} {{telephone}} or telegraph line all right enough," [...] remarked Randy. [...] "But {{what are those}} fellows <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>any</b> such line as that away up here?" ...|$|R
50|$|During a recess, Members of Parliament (MPs) {{can spend}} more time in their constituency, talk to their constituents, and {{contemplate}} about what they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> solve <b>any</b> problems that their constituents raise (for example, they may start to prepare speeches, which they will read to the Minister concerned when the house returns, and the recess ends).|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> at <b>any</b> rate," [...] I said, laying my serviette {{deliberately}} upon the table. [...] "I don't care what happens, but I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{speak to the}} child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> more shouting," [...] said Madden, [...] "even {{though you}} propose {{the health of}} the chancellor, vice-chancellor, and two members." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dorian Gray {{shook his}} head. [...] "No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful {{things in my}} life. I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> more. I began my good actions yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{go right}} ahead, squire," [...] said Steve soothingly. [...] "I {{know just how}} you feel, and I guess talking's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> harm. Act as if I wasn't here. Look on it as a monologue. I don't amount to anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Rollo," [...] {{added his}} father, [...] "I should {{think it would}} be best for you {{to have some sort of}} organization, if you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> thing in company. Men never think that they can {{accomplish}} any thing in company, without organization; and I should certainly think that children would not be able to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you can laugh, gentlemen--but you won't {{have to wait}} long. According to my {{calculations}} that Mexican ship {{is about}} due now. And I ain't basing my figures on anything the Mexican Government is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> or <b>any</b> commercial speculation. I'm reckoning on the Catholic Church." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it'll be time {{to think}} about it. You've married Kitty right and left to {{everybody}} who's looked at her since we left Niagara, and I've worried myself to death investigating the character of her husbands. Now I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it <b>any</b> longer,--till she has an offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I bain't afeared of you, Reuben, don't you go {{to think}} it; only I ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> {{fighting}} now. Feyther says if I get into any more rows, he will pay me out; so I can't lick you now, but some day I will be even with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unfair, my dear Frank! why the {{man himself}} had always relied upon his {{superior}} skill, and {{you were able to}} beat him at his own game. Well, I wish I could shoot as well. However, as I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> more soldiering, I don't know that it would be of much use to me; still I should {{like to be able to}} do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] was {{the quiet}} reply. [...] "Just {{for the moment}} I am weary of it all. Day after day, {{fighting}} and scheming, speaking and writing, just to get you fellows out. And now we've got you out, well, I don't {{know that we are}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> better. We've got the principles, we've got some of the men, but is the country ready for our programme!" ...|$|E
60|$|You {{need not}} be afraid. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. In <b>any</b> case I must {{preserve}} the native respect for the white man.|$|R
6000|$|Another {{aspect of}} the matter seemed to strike the policeman. [...] "I guess this ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the Excelsior <b>any</b> good, ma'am," [...] he said sympathetically.|$|R
50|$|Tom and Jackson {{were now}} on the street, and Tom’s back faced the neighbor. As Tom backed up onto the {{sidewalk}} toward her, he held his left arm at his side. Raising his right hand toward Jackson, he said, “Please don’t shoot. Don’t shoot me. It’s not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> you <b>any</b> good.” But Jackson continued toward him.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Bother my honor! I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> harm,' muttered Mr. Bob-cat, {{and picked}} up one of the eggs in his mouth. He tried it with his teeth to see if it was hard, and of course he put his teeth right through the shell. He started to put it back in a hurry, but just then he noticed a good taste in his mouth. The inside of that egg was good to eat, very good indeed! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I don't {{know what}} there is to explain. I suppose you think I got him drunk; I know what you thought that night. But he was pretty well loaded when he struck my champagne. It wasn't a {{question}} of what he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> longer, but {{how he was going to}} do it. I kept an eye on him, and at the right time I helped the caterer's man to get him up into that room where he wouldn't make any trouble. I expected to go back and look after him, but I forgot him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, pshaw! I don't {{believe that}} old-fashioned talk. Lovers make a variety in life. I don't see why {{a married woman}} is to give up all the fun of having admirers. Of course, one isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> thing wrong, you know; but one doesn't want to settle down into Darby and Joan at once. Why, {{some of the young}} married women, the most {{stunning}} belles at Newport last year, got a great deal more attention after they were married than they did before. You see the fellows like it, because they are so sure not to be drawn in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not be frightened," [...] he said; [...] "we are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> you <b>any</b> harm." [...] He {{took out}} his little ebony staff. [...] "We are constables," [...] he went on, [...] "and have orders to search this house. We must secure you, but you will be {{released}} in the morning. Now, which is your room?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not that woman! Is he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} about <b>any</b> woman? Why can't you speak out, {{if you have}} anything to say? There is nothing I hate so much as these sort of mysteries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{look upon}} {{you as a}} brother, James, but not to my own brother would I tell what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> But at <b>any</b> rate you shall know in six weeks where I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a d--d lie!" [...] cried Hefferom. [...] "If you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> arresting, inspector, arrest that man!" [...] he cried, {{pointing}} {{with his}} fat white forefinger to where Deane stood, debonair and well-dressed as usual, {{and with a}} little bunch of violets in his buttonhole. [...] "I {{tell you that he}} paid the man Rowan to kill Bully Sinclair in the Universal Hotel. I tell you I can prove it. I can prove this--that Sinclair left South Africa six months ago, with the deeds of the Little Anna Gold-Mine, which this man dared to sell as being his own at close upon a million pounds less than six months ago. I can tell you more!--" ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{this remark}} {{seemed to have}} a {{personal}} as well as local application, the storekeeper diplomatically turned it. [...] "There's a good many as DON'T believe that a road from here to the creek is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> good to Sidon. It's very well to say the creek is an embarcadero, but callin' it so don't put anough water into it to float a steamboat from the bay, nor clear out the reeds and tules in it. Even if the State builds you roads, it ain't got no call to make Tasajara Creek navigable for ye; and as that will cost as much as the road, I don't see where the money's comin' from for both." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{was in an}} absurdly hysterical condition,' he said, {{holding her}} hand. 'You've been quite angelic. I knew that nothing could be done, and yet I was tormented {{with the desire to}} do something. Now I've got myself in hand once more. I think my common sense was deserting me, and I was on the point of believing in the farrago of {{nonsense}} which they call magic. After all, it's absurd to think that Haddo is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> harm to Margaret. As soon at I get back to London, I'll see my lawyers, and I daresay something can be done. If he's really mad, we'll have to put him under restraint, and Margaret will be free. I shall never forget your kindness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|For a while, though, {{they stopped}} to look, now and then; {{but no more}} flashes came from the corn-field, and the boys went on cramming {{themselves}} with berries; they all said they had got to stop, but they went on till Dave said: [...] "I don't believe it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> us <b>any</b> good <b>to</b> go in swimming if we eat too many of these mulberries. I reckon we better quit, now." ...|$|R
60|$|Neigh {{was perhaps}} {{not quite so}} placidly nonchalant as in ordinary; still, he {{was by far the}} most trying visitor that Ethelberta had lately faced, and she could not get above the stage--not a very high one for the {{mistress}} of a house--of feeling her personality to be inconveniently {{in the way of his}} eyes. He had somewhat the bearing of a man who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> without <b>any</b> fuss what gushing people would call a philanthropic action.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do!" [...] he cried, {{swinging}} in {{his chair}} and facing her, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what <b>any</b> man with an ounce of self-respect would do under the circumstances. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what I was a fool not <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> three months ago--what I should have done if it hadn't been for you. If in their contemptible, pharisaical notions of morality they choose to forget what my mother and father were to them, they cease to exist for me. If it's the last act of my life I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell them so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no {{objection}} to anything you may do outside this building," [...] Mr. Weatherley replied, [...] "but as you are only a youngster, and you met the Count Sabatini at my house, I feel it only right to give you a word of warning. I may be wrong. One gets fancies sometimes, and there are some strange doings--not that they concern you, however," [...] he added, hurriedly; [...] "only you are a young man with your way to make in the world, and every chance of making it, I should think; but it won't do for you to get too many of Count Sabatini's ideas into your head if you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> good at a wholesome, honest business like this." ...|$|E
60|$|Frank Baker was one {{of those}} fellows that every mother would feel her boy was safe with. She would be sure that no crowd he was in was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> harm or come to any, for he would have an anxious eye out for everybody, and he would stand between the crowd and the {{mischief}} that a crowd of boys nearly always wants to do. His own mother felt easy about the younger children when they were with Frank; and in a place where there were more chances for a boy to get sucked under mill-wheels, and break through ice, and fall from bridges, or have his fingers taken off by machinery than any other place I ever heard of, she no more expected anything to happen to them, if he had them in charge, than if she had them in charge herself.|$|E
60|$|A {{man with}} his intellect a clear, plain, {{geometric}} mirror, brilliantly sensitive of all objects and impressions around it, and imagining all things in their correct proportions--not twisted up into convex or concave, and distorting everything, so that he cannot see {{the truth of the}} matter without endless groping and manipulation--healthy, clear, and free, and all round about him. We never can attain that at all. In fact, the operations we have got into are destructive of it. You cannot, if you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> decisive intellectual operation--if you are going to write a book--at least, I never could--without getting decidedly made ill by it, and really you must if it is your business--and you must follow out what you are at--and it sometimes is at the expense of health. Only remember at all times to get back as fast as possible out of it into health, and regard the real equilibrium as the centre of things. You should always look at the heilig, which means holy, and holy means healthy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{this week}} I ain't moved at all. I ain't made one move in hours an' hours. I {{tell you it}} was swell, jes' settin' there, hours an' hours, an' doin' nothin'. I ain't never ben happy before. I never had any time. I've ben movin' all the time. That ain't no way to be happy. An' I ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it <b>any</b> more. I'm jes' goin' to set, an' set, an' rest, an' rest, and then rest some more." ...|$|R
500|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} in The Village Voice if he thought his public criticism of Scientology would hurt his acting career, Beghe joked, [...] "I’m probably not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>doing</b> <b>any</b> movies for United Artists any time soon." [...] (United Artists was revamped as a joint venture with Scientologist Tom Cruise, his business associate Paula Wagner, who is chief executive of the company, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.) Marina Hyde of The Guardian called Beghe a Scientology celebrity whistleblower.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a pulpit minister. There's {{different}} kinds of ministers, and each must talk to men in his own tongue if he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> 'em <b>any</b> real good," [...] said old Abel meditatively. [...] "YOUR tongue is music. Strange that your grandfather can't see that for himself, and him such a broad-minded man! He's the only minister I ever had much use for. He's God's own if ever a man was. And he loves you--yes, sir, he loves you like the apple of his eye." ...|$|R
