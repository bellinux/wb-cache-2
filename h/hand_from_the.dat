5|$|Later in June, Fox News did {{a report}} on the {{families}} of the candidates running for President. Jim Gilmore's family was described as being busy with school and employment, limiting them from full-time campaigning. Two of the candidate's sons, Ashton and Jay were examined for the report. Ashton Gilmore worked full-time for his father's campaign headquarters, and Jay Gilmore worked in Washington and was only able to campaign as his schedule allowed. In election polling, unpromising results surfaced for the Gilmore campaign. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, Gilmore failed to register half a percentage point among Republican voters. A grimmer portrait was painted for the campaign when end of the month finances revealed it was nearly broke with only $61,765 cash on <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> $391,693 that had been raised overall.|$|E
5|$|On {{appeal to}} the Third Circuit, a three-judge panel of Judge Robert Cowen, Judge Morton Ira Greenberg and Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie {{unanimously}} held for the city. In a decision issued in 2015, Judge Vanaskie, writing for the Court, reiterated Judge McNulty's finding that Heffernan's actions in picking up the sign for his mother did not constitute protected speech or association. He distinguished the case at <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sixth Circuit's ruling in Dye by noting that in that case, the employers had inferred the employees' intent from their non-participation in partisan politics rather than an actual action they had taken, as had occurred in Heffernan's case.|$|E
5|$|Central Europe {{became the}} centre of silver {{production}} during the Middle Ages, as the Mediterranean deposits exploited by the ancient civilisations had been exhausted. Silver mines were opened in Bohemia, Saxony, Erzgebirge, Alsace, the Lahn region, Siegerland, Silesia, Hungary, Norway, Steiermark, Salzburg, and the southern Black Forest. Most of these ores were quite rich in silver and could simply be separated by <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> remaining rock and then smelted; some deposits of native silver were also encountered. Many of these mines were soon exhausted, {{but a few of}} them remained active until the Industrial Revolution, before which the world production of silver was around a meagre 50tonnes per year. In the Americas, high temperature silver-lead cupellation technology was developed by pre-Inca civilizations as early as AD 60–120; silver deposits in India, China, Japan, and pre-Columbian America continued to be mined during this time.|$|E

5|$|The Met {{opened with}} no stock of its own, with the GWR {{and then the}} GNR {{providing}} services. The GWR used eight-wheeled compartment carriages constructed from teak. By 1864, the Met had taken delivery of its own stock, made by the Ashbury Railway Carriage & Iron Co., based on the GWR design but standard gauge. Lighting was provided by gas— two jets in first class compartments and one in second and third class compartments, and from 1877 a pressurised oil gas system was used. Initially the carriages were braked with wooden blocks operated by <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> guards' compartments at {{the front and back}} of the train, giving off a distinctive smell. This was replaced in 1869 by a chain that operated brakes on all carriages. The operation of the chain brake could be abrupt, leading to some passenger injuries, and it was replaced by a non-automatic vacuum brake by 1876. In the 1890s, a mechanical 'next station' indicator was tested in some carriages on the circle, triggered by a wooden flap between the tracks. It was considered unreliable and not approved for full installation.|$|E
5|$|When the {{projects}} begin, {{the work is}} done without machines, with supplies being shipped on small boats and then carried by <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beach. Project costs range between $5,000 and $150,000, although the average is between $20,000 and $25,000. The protected areas that result from these deals typically involve a 20- to 30-year commitment. Seacology hopes that during that time the local people grow to respect these resources and ideally progress {{to a point where}} they are less dependent on natural resources. According to marine biologist Mark Erdmann, in a worst-case scenario, if the people violate the contract and destroy the habitat, Seacology will have still made a difference in their lives through its low-cost investment, whereas larger conservation organizations might invest large sums of money but through not addressing the immediate needs of the people, if the project fails, both lose that investment and not have helped the community.|$|E

25|$|Bolt-action {{weapons are}} rugged, reliable, and {{typically}} the most accurate, {{due to the}} strong camming action that locks the bolt into the receiver.

25|$|Uppercut – A vertical, rising punch thrown {{with the}} rear <b>hand.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> guard position, the torso shifts {{slightly}} to the right, the rear hand drops {{below the level of}} the opponent's chest and the knees are bent slightly.

25|$|Jab – A quick, {{straight}} punch thrown {{with the}} lead <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> guard position. The jab {{is accompanied by}} a small, clockwise rotation of the torso and hips, while the fist rotates 90 degrees, becoming horizontal upon impact. As the punch reaches full extension, the lead shoulder can be brought up to guard the chin. The rear hand remains next to the face to guard the jaw. After making contact with the target, the lead hand is retracted quickly to resume a guard position in front of the face.|$|E
25|$|She then {{played in}} all three ODIs in New Zealand as Australia {{whitewashed}} their hosts. In the first match in Queenstown, she was attacked by the local batsmen and ended with 0/39 from five overs. In the run-chase she made 13 not out at the death as Australia reached the target with two wickets in <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> final ball. She took 2/29 and 1/19, both from ten overs, {{in the last two}} matches at Invercargill. The tourists won both by six wickets to sweep the ODIs. Osborne ended with three wickets at 32.33 at and economy rate of 3.88.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of Rita and Charlie, Lofty was left to run the ED and began to {{struggle}} when disruptive patients were admitted. Since there was a staff shortage, Lofty hired agency nurse Diane Stuart (Catherine Skinner). When Lofty caught Diane sleeping on the job, she revealed {{she and her husband}} had recently separated, which Lofty sympathised with and so, gives her a second chance. Later, Lofty, Dylan and Diane are with a patient in a lift when the lift breaks down and the patient flatlines. As Lofty prepares to resuscitate, Diane fails to remove her <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> patient and is electrocuted, killing herself.|$|E

25|$|While {{a normal}} leg break spins from the leg to the off side, {{away from a}} {{right-handed}} batsman, a googly spins the other way, from off to leg, into a right-handed batsman (and is distinct from an off break delivery). The bowler achieves this change of spin by bending the wrist sharply from the normal leg break delivery position. When the ball rolls out of the <b>hand</b> (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> side near the little finger, as in a normal leg break), it emerges with clockwise spin (from the bowler's point of view). A googly may also be achieved by bowling the ball as a conventional leg break, but spinning the ball further with the fingers just before it is released.|$|E
25|$|Cross – A powerful, {{straight}} punch thrown {{with the}} rear <b>hand.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> guard position, the rear hand is thrown from the chin, crossing {{the body and}} traveling towards the target in a straight line. The rear shoulder is thrust forward and finishes just touching {{the outside of the}} chin. At the same time, the lead hand is retracted and tucked against the face to protect the inside of the chin. For additional power, the torso and hips are rotated counter-clockwise as the cross is thrown. A measure of an ideally extended cross is that the shoulder of the striking arm, the knee of the front leg and the ball of the front foot are on the same vertical plane.|$|E
25|$|She then {{played in}} all three ODIs in New Zealand as fellow right-arm fast bowler Rene Farrell was left out. In the first match in Queenstown, she took 1/38 from ten overs. In the run-chase she made six not out at the death as Australia reached the target with two wickets in <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last ball of the match. She took 3/40 from eight overs in the second match, as Australia {{restricted}} the hosts to 8/255 before completing a six-wicket win. The following day, she took 2/35 in the final ODI, from only six overs in another six-wicket win {{in the last two}} matches at Invercargill. Hunter ended with six wickets at 18.83 at and economy rate of 4.70.|$|E
