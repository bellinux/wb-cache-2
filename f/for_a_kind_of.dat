25|$|Gorbachev calls <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> perestroika or {{restructuring}} of societies around the world, starting {{in particular with}} that of the United States, because he is of the view that the financial crisis of 2007–2008 shows that the Washington Consensus economic model is a failure that will sooner or later have to be replaced. According to Gorbachev, countries that have rejected the Washington Consensus and the International Monetary Fund approach to economic development, such as Brazil and China, have done far better economically on the whole and achieved far fairer results for the average citizen than countries that have accepted it.|$|E
25|$|However, Mayer {{has written}} that it was {{precisely}} unions' opposition to NAFTA overall that jeopardized organized labor's ability to influence the debate on labor standards in a significant way. During Clinton's presidential campaign, labor unions wanted NAFTA to include a side deal to provide <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> international social charter, a set of standards that would be enforceable both in domestic courts and through international institutions. Mickey Kantor, then U.S. trade representative, had strong ties to organized labor and believed {{that he could get}} unions to come along with the agreement, particularly if they were given a strong voice in the negotiation process.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to create}} a working-class culture and a counter-hegemony relates to Gramsci's call <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{education}} that could develop working-class intellectuals, whose task was not to introduce Marxist ideology into the consciousness of the proletariat as a set of foreign notions, but to renovate the existing intellectual activity of the masses and make it natively critical of the status quo. His ideas about an education system for this purpose correspond with the notion of critical pedagogy and popular education as theorized and practised in later decades by Paulo Freire in Brazil, and have much in common with the thought of Frantz Fanon. For this reason, partisans of adult and popular education consider Gramsci an important voice to this day.|$|E

25|$|King Vajiravudh was a {{favor of}} literature, theater, he {{translated}} many foreign literatures into Thai. He created the spiritual foundation <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Thai nationalism, a phenomenon unknown in Siam. He {{was based on}} the unity of nation, Buddhism, and kingship, and demanded loyalty from his subjects to all these three institutions. King Vajiravudh also took refuge in an irrational and contradictory anti-Sinicism. As a result of the mass immigration, in contrast to previous immigration waves from China, women and entire families had also come into the country, which meant that the Chinese were less assimilated and retained their cultural independence. In an article published by King Vajiravudh under a pseudonym, he described the Chinese minority as Jews of the East.|$|E
25|$|Different {{physical}} {{devices and}} aids {{have been used}} to assist with ciphers. One of the earliest may have been the scytale of ancient Greece, a rod supposedly used by the Spartans as an aid for a transposition cipher (see image above). In medieval times, other aids were invented such as the cipher grille, which was also used <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> steganography. With the invention of polyalphabetic ciphers came more sophisticated aids such as Alberti's own cipher disk, Johannes Trithemius' tabula recta scheme, and Thomas Jefferson's wheel cypher (not publicly known, and reinvented independently by Bazeries around 1900). Many mechanical encryption/decryption devices were invented early in the 20th century, and several patented, among them rotor machines—famously including the Enigma machine used by the German government and military from the late 1920s and during World War II. The ciphers implemented by better quality examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after WWI.|$|E
500|$|The Droungarios of the Watch was {{originally}} {{the commander of}} the Vigla ("guard watch") or Arithmos ("number"), the third of the tagmata, professional cavalry regiments headquartered in and around Constantinople, and distinct from the provincial or thematic troops. The title of droungarios itself means [...] "commander of a droungos", [...] a term of Gaulish origin which came {{to be used as a}} term <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> tactical cavalry formation in the East Roman army of Late Antiquity. The term droungarios (Greek: δρουγγάριος) is not documented before the early 7th century but might have been used as an informal or unofficial designation before that date. The office and the corresponding unit appear to have initially referred to ad hoc arrangements, but during the early 7th century these were formalized, like much of the East Roman army's rank structure.|$|E

500|$|Seungsahn {{implemented}} {{the use of}} simple phraseology to convey his messages, delivered with charisma, which helped make the teachings easier to consume for Western followers. Some of his more frequently employed phrases included [...] "only go straight" [...] or [...] "only don't know". He {{even went so far}} as to call his teachings [...] "Don't Know Zen", which was reminiscent of the style of Bodhidharma. Seungsahn used correspondences between him and his students as teaching opportunities. Back-and-forth letters allowed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> dharma combat through the mail and made him more available to the school's students in his absence. This was another example of his skillful implementation of unorthodox teaching methods, adapting to the norms of Western culture and thus making himself more accessible to those he taught. He was a supporter of what he often termed [...] "together action"—encouraging students to make the lineage's centers their home and practice together.|$|E
500|$|As a {{teenager}} David enjoyed painting, {{and her mother}} thought her talent worth developing. She was sent to Paris in 1930, studying painting privately and enrolling at the Sorbonne for a course in French civilisation which covered history, literature and architecture. She found her Sorbonne studies arduous {{and in many ways}} uninspiring, but they left her with a love of French literature and a fluency in the language that remained with her throughout her life. She lodged with a Parisian family, whose fanatical devotion to the pleasures of the table she portrayed to comic effect in her French Provincial Cooking (1960). Nevertheless, she acknowledged in retrospect that the experience had been the most valuable part of her time in Paris: [...] "I realized in what way the family had fulfilled their task of instilling French culture into at least one of their British charges. Forgotten were the Sorbonne professors.... What had stuck was the taste <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> food quite ideally unlike anything I had known before." [...] Stella Gwynne was not eager for her daughter's early return to England after qualifying for her Sorbonne diploma, and sent her from Paris to Munich in 1931 to study German.|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions for Achtung Baby, the Edge {{separated from his}} wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. Reflecting on the impact it had on U2, Bono said, [...] "We're a really tight community. This is not like somebody's, you know, girlfriend's left. We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there." [...] Audio engineer Flood said the [...] "bold, unadulterated, naked [...] sound {{was a combination of}} the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic. Edge just got an idea, tried it, and it worked straightaway." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{last major}} {{building}} work {{took place during}} the reign of King GeorgeV when, in 1913, SirAston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. GeorgeV, who had succeeded EdwardVII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919)– the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> (<b>Kind</b> <b>of)</b> Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. GeorgeV's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, [...] long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} tour was acclaimed by critics. Jane Stevenson from Toronto Sun gave the concert {{four out of five}} stars and said that Lady Gaga came across as a [...] "confident, colourful, and campy performer. [...] Gaga's success was evident with slick-looking videos, lights, elaborate costumes, dancers, and yes, a band, even if her stage was sometimes left dark as she left to make numerous changes." [...] T'Cha Dunlevy for The Gazette noted that the performance was lacking—adding that the show never reached its peak until the end, when Gaga performed the [...] "real rendition" [...] of [...] "Poker Face" [...] and [...] "Bad Romance." [...] "Better late than never", Dunlevy concluded. Aedan Helmer from Jam! magazine said that [...] "At first blush, it might seem the real driving force behind Gaga's meteoric rise to fame is her hand-picked cadre of costume and set designers—dubbed Haus of Gaga—who seemingly know no bounds when it comes to pushing the envelope of haute couture and the theatre of the absurd. [...] But what really sets Gaga apart from the middling masses of lip-synching Britney clones and Idol wannabes is her pure, unadulterated musical talent. [...] The Lady can sing." [...] Theatre critic Kelly Nestruck, while writing for The Guardian, said [...] "While The Monster Ball has nothing on the great operas or the golden age of musical theatre, Lady Gaga's 'electro-pop opera' is at least twice as entertaining and infinitely fresher than any stage musical written over the last decade." [...] Lauren Carter from Boston Herald praised the show saying [...] " [...] only has two albums under her belt but who cares? Every song feels like a hit, and Gaga-as-star is already taking on Madonna-like proportions. [...] After [...] at the Wang Theater, fans could justifiably walk away thinking Lady Gaga is crazy, brilliant or both." [...] Jeremy Adams from Rolling Stone reviewed the performance at Wang Center in Boston and said that [...] "Throughout the evening, Gaga [...] aimed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> pop theatricality that might potentially cement her burgeoning status as performance artist." ...|$|E
