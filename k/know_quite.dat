500|$|He was not {{a typical}} movie actor, with a pudgy build and lacking matinée idol looks, but Hoffman claimed that he was {{grateful}} for his appearance as it made him believable {{in a wide range}} of roles. Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, [...] "The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. The good news is that he'll work for the rest of his life". The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an [...] "anti-star", whose real identity remained [...] "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, [...] "I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't <b>know</b> <b>quite</b> what to do with someone like me, but that's OK. I think there are other people who are interested in what I do." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never <b>know</b> <b>quite</b> what it looks like or what it can do...The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic in shape, and the critic Tim Dirks mentions its 'open, dripping vaginal mouth.|$|E

McCartney said they introduced the song by saying, [...] "'And now for something different.' ... We {{used to put}} that in there, and think, 'Well, they won't <b>know</b> <b>quite</b> what to make of this, but it's cool.'" [...] In 1996, a live version of [...] "Baby's in Black" [...] was released as a B-side to [...] "Real Love", the second single from their Anthology project.|$|E

2500|$|When {{he died in}} 1920 he {{left the}} {{building}} to his wife, who in turn left it to her daughter Katherine in 1944. [...] Katherine died in 1967 without any children and willed {{the land and the}} estate to the town for [...] "public educational purposes, public recreational purposes, or other exclusively public purposes." [...] At the time [...] "town didn't <b>know</b> <b>quite</b> what to do with it" [...] and it was given to the Commonwealth {{to be used as a}} governor's mansion, but those plans were scuttled. [...] What was a nine car garage on the Mt. Vernon Street side of the property today serves as the Endicott branch of the Dedham Public Library.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he died in}} 1920 he {{left the}} {{building}} to his stepdaughter Katherine. [...] She died in 1967 without any children and willed {{the land and the}} estate to the town for [...] "education, civic, social and recreational purposes". [...] At the time [...] "town didn't <b>know</b> <b>quite</b> what to do with it" [...] and [...] "Town Meeting voted to offer it to the Commonwealth." [...] Governor John Volpe took the title to the 25 room estate in a ceremony on December 7, 1967 and intended {{to use it as a}} governor's mansion. [...] It soon became apparent that it would be cheaper to build a brand new mansion than to remodel the estate to Volpe's wife's [...] "lavish taste" [...] and [...] "crazy notions" [...] than to renovate the Endicott Estate and in 1969 the Commonwealth gave the estate back to the Town. [...] In 1921 Endicott's widow gave $35,000 to the American Legion to build a clubhouse nearby the estate on Whiting Ave.|$|E
2500|$|Arturo Toscanini, a {{prominent}} anti-fascist, was furious {{to learn that}} Furtwängler {{would be at the}} Festival. He accepted his engagement in Salzburg on the condition that he would not have to meet Furtwängler. But the two did meet, and argued over Furtwängler's actions. Toscanini argued: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>quite</b> well that you are {{not a member of the}} Party. I am also aware that you have helped your Jewish friends [...] But everyone who conducts in the Third Reich is a Nazi!". Furtwängler emphatically denied this and said: [...] "By that, you imply that art and music are merely propaganda, a false front, as it were, for any Government which happens to be in power. If a Nazi Government is in power, then, as a conductor, I am a Nazi; under the communists, I would be a Communist; under the democrats, a democrat... No, a thousand times no! Music belongs to a different world, and is above chance political events." [...] Toscanini disagreed and that ended the discussion.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 July 2008, Doherty {{played a}} solo gig at the Royal Albert Hall. It was his biggest solo show so far. The concert was {{originally}} scheduled for 26 April, {{but had to}} be rescheduled to a later date due to Doherty being sentenced to 14 weeks in prison for breaching probation on 8 April. The solo show {{did not get the}} best ratings but was all in all still well received. Jon Swaine of The Daily Telegraph criticised that [...] "whole chunks of the set [...] passed by as listless noodling, with neither Doherty nor the audience appearing to <b>know</b> <b>quite</b> how to behave" [...] and that – without a full band – Doherty seemed out of place at such a big venue. Betty Clarke of The Guardian described Doherty as [...] "focused" [...] and [...] "on good form". Friend and collaborator Peter Wolfe had a guest appearance on stage when Doherty performed [...] "For Lovers". Swaine stated Wolfe ruined the song with [...] "some especially tuneless backing vocals". The gig was forced to an abrupt end during the encore due to a stage invasion by the fans.|$|E
2500|$|The {{author has}} stated that she enjoys writing Dumbledore because he [...] "is the epitome of goodness." [...] Rowling said that Dumbledore speaks for her, as he [...] "knows pretty much everything" [...] about the Harry Potter universe. Rowling {{mentioned}} that Dumbledore regrets [...] "that he has always {{had to be the}} one who knew, and who had the burden of knowing. And he would rather not know." [...] As a mentor to the central character Harry Potter, [...] "Dumbledore is a very wise man who knows that Harry is going to have to learn a few hard lessons to prepare him for what may be coming in his life. He allows Harry to get into what he wouldn't allow another pupil to do, and he also unwillingly permits Harry to confront things he’d rather protect him from." [...] In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated that she imagined Dumbledore [...] "more as a John Gielgud type, you <b>know,</b> <b>quite</b> elderly and– and quite stately." [...] During his time as a student, Dumbledore was in Gryffindor House. Rowling said in an interview that Dumbledore was about 150 years old. However, on her website, she states that Dumbledore was born in 1881, making him either 115 or 116 when he died.|$|E
2500|$|He did not pardon former Marshal Antonescu, who {{was sentenced}} to death [...] "for {{betrayal}} of the Romanian people for the benefit of Nazi Germany, for the economic and political subjugation of Romania to Germany, for cooperation with the Iron Guard, for murdering his political opponents, for the mass murder of civilians and crimes against peace". Nor did King Michael manage to save such leaders of the opposition as Iuliu Maniu and the Bratianus, victims of communist political trials, as the Constitution prevented him from doing so without the counter-signature of communist Justice Minister Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu (who himself was later eliminated by Gheorghiu-Dej's opposing communist faction). The memoirs of King Michael's aunt Princess Ileana quoted Emil Bodnăraș — her alleged lover, Romania's communist minister of defence, and a Soviet spy—as saying: [...] "Well, if the King decides not to sign the death warrant, I promise that we will uphold his point of view." [...] Princess Ileana was sceptical: [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>quite</b> well (...) that the King will never of his free will sign such an unconstitutional document. If he does, it will be laid at your door, and before the whole nation your government will bear the blame. Surely you do not wish this additional handicap at this moment!" ...|$|E
