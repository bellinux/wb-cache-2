Such variations provide information on the amplitude of response of an orgamsm m relation to the magmtude of chenucal insult and on the relation between biological effects and environmental contamination. The study of biomarkers m biomdicator orgamsms, sampled in one or more areas suspected of pollution, and compared with those of organisms from a reference area, makes it possible to evaluate the potential danger to commumties (McCarthy et al. 1989.

The study included the duplicate analysis of three cow milk samples using in house methods and standards. The comparison showed considerable differences in the level of individual congeners. In general, values found by Okometric were higher than that of RIVM/LOC, with a ratio between values ranging from 0. 95 to 6. 9 for the majority of congeners except for octa CDF and CDD for which larger differences were observed. Best correspondence was obtained for the toxicological major congeners in cow's milk, i. e. 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 -PeCDD and 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -PeCDF, for which ratio's have been obtained of 2. 7, 1. 2 and 1. 6, respectively. As a result, when expressed in toxicological equivalences (TEQ), the mean level as determined by Okometric was by 80 % higher than the mean TEQ value determined by RIVM/LOC. From an analysis of methods used, it is concluded that the major part of occurring differences can be ascribed to the performance of the combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) instrument, in particular to the separation efficiency of the chromatographic column and the sensitivity of the mass spectrometer. Both features were found inadequate for the GCMS facility of Okometric for performing reliable analysis of <b>dioxines</b> at the low ppt level in cow's milk. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the reactions and reaction mechanisms of fly ash from municipal waste incineration plants leading {{to the formation of}} organic compounds, is of great importance for minimization of the emission of these substances. Studying the reaction of toluene with fly ash is a contribution to this. At this reaction in liquid phase (T#<=# 111 C) it could be shown that o-and p-methyldiphenylmethane have been formed. This dimerisation of toluene describes the first step of an oxidation or condensation reaction. For these reaction the rate constant and activation energy have been determined. Formally the reaction corresponds to zero order as often found at photochemical and catalytic reactions of metallic salts. Further following reactions forming oxidation or condensation products of the MDPMs could not be found in liquid phase. Parallel reactions as the chlorination of toluene at temperatures to the boiling point for example have not been observed too. Comprehensive thermodynamic evaluations in the suitable temperature range have shown that the formation of following products is thermodynamically favoured. The different mineral phases of the transitional metals iron and copper are of special interest for chlorination reactions of fly ash. Usually their chlorides are used as chlorinating agents at reactions with fly ash. It could be shown that these metallic salts are not available as water-soluble compounts. After dimerisation further following reactions have been observed in the vapour phase. In the presence of oxygen oxidation products have been formed and condensation products under inert gas atmosphere. At the decomposition of residual carbon of fly ash from 250 C on, the addition of toluene to the vapour phase (synthetic air: 80 % NH_ 2, 20 % O_ 2) increased the formation of chlorinated aromatic compounds. Especially the lower chlorine stages have been preferred at the formation of <b>dioxines</b> and furanes. Thus fly ash is showing a potential of chlorination favouring the formation of organohalogen compounds in a gas-solid-phase reaction in presence of toluene in the vapour phase.

Much of the chemistry performed thus far utilizing 1, 2 -dioxines involves the initial rearrangement of 1, 2 -dioxines to γ-hydroxyenones allowing for the generation of structural motifs such as cyclopropanes, THF’s, THP’s, 1, 4 -diketones and natural sugars. Herein describes the synthesis of novel 1, 2 -dioxines {{with a variety of}} tethered functionalities and their transformations to afford novel cyclic compounds whilst maintaining the peroxide linkage intact. Chapter two outlines the intramolecular cyclisations of tethered hydroxyl and carboxylic acid moieties onto the olefin of 1, 2 - <b>dioxines</b> to generate both tetrahydrofurans and dihydrofuran- 2 (3 H) -ones, whilst maintaining the peroxide linkage. This work presents the first examples of syn fused cyclic peroxide furans through intramolecular cyclisation of tethered hydroxyl groups. Improved methods for the oxidation of hydroxyl tethered 1, 2 -dioxines to carboxylic acid moieties are also reported. In addition, improved methods for intramolecular cyclisation of carboxylic acid moieties where developed to afford syn fused cyclic peroxide lactones. Furthermore, reduction of the peroxide bond enabled generation of functionalized tetrahydrofurans and dihydrofuran- 2 (3 H) -ones which have previously been utilized as synthetic building blocks for several natural products. Chapter three reports the first examples of carbenoid insertion into the peroxide linkage of 1, 2 -dioxines allowing for the generation of novel bicyclic hemiacetals. Alternatively novel tricyclic cyclopropyl peroxides where generated through insertion into the olefin whilst maintaining the peroxide linage intact. Additionally, the attempted intramolecular cyclisation of diazoketone tethered bicyclic 1, 2 -dioxines was also probed. Furthermore, the attempted intermolecular insertion of diazoketones onto 1, 2 -dioxines are presented within this chapter. Finally, Chapter four outlines the intramolecular cyclisations of bromo-alkyl tethered 1, 2 -dioxines to furnish novel cyclic cyclopentyl peroxides whilst maintaining the peroxide linkage intact. The work presented in this chapter represents the first examples of the synthesis of syn fused cyclic cyclopentyl peroxides.

This type of ash are deposited in a landfill and gets classified as a hazardous waste which is expensive given that the deposit fee is high. The fact that fly ash contains valuable metals as zinc, methods of recovering it are being developed such as acid leaching. This is a promising method as the leachate used are acid process water making the usage of the chemicals substantially lower which makes it financially viable. Waste incinerators in Sweden produce approximately 200 000 tons of fly ash annually and the majority of it is transfered to Norway to get treated and put on a landfill. Some waste management companies, e. g. Renova, are using another method called “the Bamberg method” where fly ash is mixed with sludge to form a cake and put in the company’s own landfill. The projects goal is to leach the fly ash by using acidic process water to obtain the metallic substance particularly zinc making it easier and cheaper to landfill the ash and also to optimize this method to get the most zinc out of the ash using minimum amount of the acidic process water (5 % HCI). The laboratory work took place in the University of Borås. Fly ash and the acid process water which were used under the laboratory work was obtained from RenovaAB. The results shows that leaching the fly ash with acidic process water gave different release of zinc but was 88 % at most. The variation in the results depends on a few factors such as amount of acidic process water, pH, time, blending time and the ashes content. This project took environment and access to acidic water in consideration, which optimized the method of using less amount of acid process water to get the most zinc as possible. The results shows that leaching fly ash with acid process water is cost efficient and easy way to recover zinc, which satisfy the goals of the project...|$|R

40|$|It was {{the problem}} of partner in project to develop {{catalysts}} with perowskite-type structure for catalytic combustion and catalytic supported combustion of exhaust gases. Exhaust gases: hydrocarbon and chlorinated hydrocarbon. The catalysts should be produced as pellts and as honeycomb. By Leuna the catalyst material was to synthesize, to characterize, to test the activity, to test the resistance against poisons. It have been to show that no <b>dioxine</b> and furane are produced. Results: by the Leuna procedure {{it is possible to}} produce catalysts, which are more active than these produced by other procedures. Catalysts containing lanthanum and cobalt and/or manganese, strontium, iron, copper are able to use both as pellets and for production of honeycomb containing cordierite. Their catalytic activity is comparable with this of noble metal catalysts or is better than this. At combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbon no anything <b>dioxine</b> or furane are formed. Perowskite-type catalysts are not resistant against sulfur compounds. They can be used in processes for removal of harmful gases in exhaust gases, e. g. in varnish plants. (orig.)
