5|$|Although some guides {{indicate}} {{the species is}} edible with suitable preparation (such as boiling), it <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other toxic Gyromitra species that contain the compound gyromitrin.

5|$|Grit {{is often}} mixed with hydrous sodium {{ferrocyanide}} as an anticaking agent which, while harmless {{in its natural}} form, can undergo photodissociation in strong sunlight to produce the extremely toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide.

5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} has been hunted for its body parts {{for use in}} {{traditional}} medicine, for amusement, and for sport, though this is rare, as the species <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> considered attractive. There is fossil evidence of humans in Middle Pleistocene Europe butchering and presumably consuming spotted hyenas.

5|$|Vix pervenit: On Usury and Other Dishonest Profit was an encyclical, {{promulgated by}} Pope Benedict XIV on November 1, 1745, which {{condemned}} {{the practice of}} charging interest on loans as usury.

E.sinuatum causes primarily gastrointestinal problems that, though not generally life-threatening, have been described as highly unpleasant. Delirium and depression are uncommon sequelae. It <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> considered to be lethal, although one source has reported deaths from the consumption of this mushroom.|$|E
5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> needed.|$|E

5|$|For {{functioning}} tumors, the somatostatin analog {{class of}} medications, such as octreotide, {{can reduce the}} excessive production of hormones. Lanreotide can slow tumor growth. If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> very effective for PanNETs, but may be used when other drug treatments fail to prevent the disease from progressing, or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.|$|E
5|$|In HIT, the {{platelet}} {{count in the}} blood falls below the normal range, a condition called thrombocytopenia. However, it <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> low enough to lead to {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the {{platelet count}} will fall 5–14 days after heparin is first given; if someone has received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in platelet count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day.|$|E
5|$|In XML, a {{namespace}} is {{an abstract}} domain {{to which a}} collection of element and attribute names can be assigned.

However, the name <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> {{considered to be a}} URI, because the URI specification bases the decision not only on lexical components, but also on their intended use. A namespace name does not necessarily imply any of the semantics of URI schemes; for example, a namespace name beginning with http: may have no connotation {{to the use of the}} HTTP.|$|E

He was formerly a human archaeologist named Simon Petrikov who discovered a magic crown that gives him magical ice powers but eroded his memory and made him go insane. In addition, throughout the series, various character and events hint at the mysterious Mushroom War, a cataclysmic war that destroyed modern human society.|$|E

5|$|Natalizumab and {{mitoxantrone}} {{are considered}} highly effective {{both in terms}} of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments.

Moreover, mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.|$|E
