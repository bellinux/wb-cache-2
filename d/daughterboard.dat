500|$|The {{original}} ZX Spectrum {{is remembered}} for its rubber keyboard, diminutive size and distinctive rainbow motif. It was originally released on 23 April 1982 with 16KB of RAM for £125 or with 48KB for £175; these prices were later reduced to £99 and £129 respectively. Owners of the 16KB model could purchase an internal 32KB RAM upgrade, which for early [...] "Issue 1" [...] machines {{consisted of a}} <b>daughterboard.</b> Later issue machines required the fitting of 8 dynamic RAM chips and a few TTL chips. Users could mail their 16K Spectrums to Sinclair to be upgraded to 48KB versions. Later revisions contained 64KB of memory but were configured such that only 48KB were usable. External 32KB RAM packs that mounted in the rear expansion slot were available from third parties. Both machines had 16KB of onboard ROM.|$|E

30|$|The SDRs from Ettus Research [9, 10] {{were chosen}} for the test {{platform}} due to their availability, frequency coverage, documentation availability, and ease of use. Each SDR consists of a base unit that contains two 100 MS/s ADCs, two 400 MS/s DACs, post-ADC FPGA processing, and interface circuitry. The analog portions of the transmitters and receiver are contained on <b>daughterboards</b> that plug into the base unit.

40|$|We present USC SDR, a {{wireless}} platform designed for easy-to-program, high data rate, real time wireless experimenta-tion. The design of our platform aims at removing {{most of the}} bottlenecks encountered {{in the design of}} current software radio architectures, e. g. the requirement to program new schemes in an FPGA, and the difficulty to run real-time ex-periments for a long time. The architecture combines generic PCI FPGA development boards with radio front-ends built as self-sufficient <b>daughterboards.</b> The <b>daughterboards</b> are connected to the FPGAs, which in turn are plugged into the PCIE slots of a general-purpose server. Interestingly, the connection of the <b>daughterboards</b> to the FPGA cards is implemented through a standard FMC (FPGA Mezzanine Card) interface, such that the same RF front-end can be reused with future FPGA generations. In this way, USC SDR is not limited to a specific FPGA choice and does not require a complete re-design in order to accommodate for future more powerful FPGAs. The hardware is supported by a real-time software archi-tecture where signal processing tasks, PHY and MAC layer algorithms can be programmed as user-level applications. As an example, we will showcase a massive MIMO testbed built using a single server with multiple PCIE slots...|$|R

50|$|As the PC market {{became more}} prevalent, fewer SBCs {{were being used}} in computers. The main {{components}} were assembled on a motherboard, and peripheral components such as serial ports, disk drive controllers, and graphics processors were located on <b>daughterboards.</b> The recent availability of advanced chip sets providing most of the I/O features as embedded components allows motherboard manufacturers to offer motherboards with I/O traditionally provided by <b>daughterboards.</b> Most PC motherboards now offer on-board support for disk drives including IDE and SATA with RAID, graphics, Ethernet, and traditional I/O such as serial and parallel ports, USB, and keyboard/mouse support. Plug-in cards are now more commonly high performance graphics cards (really graphics co-processors), high end RAID controllers, and specialized I/O cards such as data acquisition and DSP (Digital Signal Processor) boards.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{original}} Waveblaster greatly improved upon the acoustic {{quality of the}} SB16's built-in FM-synthesis, the acoustic quality of its instrument-set was poorly regarded. By the time the SB16 reached the height of its popularity, competing MIDI-daughterboards had already pushed aside the Waveblaster. In particular, Roland's Sound Canvas <b>daughterboards</b> (SCD-10/15), priced higher than Creative's offering, were highly regarded for their unrivalled musical reproduction in MIDI-scored game titles. (This was due to Roland's dominance in the production aspect of the MIDI game soundtracks; Roland's <b>daughterboards</b> shared the same synthesis-engine and instrument sound-set as the popular Sound Canvas 55, a commercial MIDI module favored by game composers.) By comparison, the WaveBlaster's instruments were improperly balanced, with many instruments striking at different volume-levels (relative to the de facto standard, Sound Canvas.) ...|$|R
50|$|At {{its initial}} release in November 1989, the SystemPro {{supported}} {{up to two}} 33 MHz 386 processors, but early in 1990 33 MHz 486 processors became an option (the processors were housed on proprietary <b>daughterboards).</b> Because the system was asymmetric, 386 and 486 processors could be mixed. Single processor configurations were also available.|$|R
