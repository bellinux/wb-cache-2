5|$|The {{production}} continues, {{and after}} the filming of a pool scene the crew gather in catering; Beeman discovers a severed finger in his sandwich, recognizing from its ring that it belonged to Niederman. When the sheriff shuts down production, Black theorizes that the killer may target the crew's hotel; he and Hollis arrive to find {{the body of the}} film's publicist hanging from a rope. The next day, a film extra (Gene Simmons) confesses to the killings; Black pokes <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> story and discovers he is not a credible perpetrator. Regardless, production is resumed—and shortly afterwards, several crew members are found with their throats cut, while Winston's body hangs nearby in an apparent murder-suicide.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E
5|$|On 21 April 1914, President Woodrow Wilson {{ordered the}} {{occupation}} of Veracruz. MacArthur joined the headquarters staff that {{was sent to the}} area, arriving on 1 May 1914. He realized that the logistic support of an advance from Veracruz would require the use of the railroad. Finding plenty of railroad cars in Veracruz but no locomotives, MacArthur set out to verify a report that {{there were a number of}} locomotives in Alvarado, Veracruz. For $150 in gold, he acquired a handcar and the services of three Mexicans, whom he disarmed. MacArthur and his party located five engines in Alvarado, two of which were only switchers, but the other three locomotives were exactly what was required. On the way back to Veracruz, his party was set upon by five armed men. The party made a run for it and outdistanced all but two of the armed men, whom MacArthur shot. Soon after, they were attacked by a group of about fifteen horsemen. MacArthur took three bullet <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> clothes but was unharmed. One of his companions was lightly wounded before the horsemen finally decided to retire after MacArthur shot four of them. Further on, the party was attacked a third time by three mounted men. MacArthur received another bullet hole in his shirt, but his men, using their handcar, managed to outrun all but one of their attackers. MacArthur shot both that man and his horse, and the party had to remove the horse's carcass from the track before proceeding.|$|E

25|$|After {{pulling out}} of an {{uncontrolled}} spin and with the fire amazingly going out on its own, Johnson headed for the English Channel, but was intercepted by a single Fw 190. Unable to fight back, he maneuvered while under a series of attacks, and although sustaining further heavy damage from hundreds of 7.92mm rounds, managed to survive until the German ran out of ammunition. The German rocked his wings to salute Johnson, then turned back. His opponent was likely the commander of III/JG 2, Oberst Egon Mayer. After landing, Johnson tried to count the bullet <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> airplane, but gave up after the tally passed 200 - without even moving around the aircraft.|$|E

They discover that Zandar was involved, and travel to the Florida Everglades, where they learn that one of Zandar's aliases was hired to broker a deal between The Coil and the Jugglers. This leads them to General Rey's psychiatrist Dr. Scott Stevens, who reveals that General Rey is a clone of Serpentor. Dr. Stevens is then revealed to be Cobra hypnotist Crystal Ball, who has brainwashed General Rey, and commands him to kill Duke. General Rey breaks free from Crystal Ball's control with Duke's help.|$|E
25|$|Through bribes and threats, he {{eventually}} {{managed to get}} a permission to go to Slovenia for himself and twenty close companions. From there the group moved through Austria and Germany before finally relocating to Liège, Belgium. Although Prazina settled himself and his followers in a neighborhood populated mostly by immigrants from Turkey and the Maghreb, {{he eventually}} established himself among the city's small Yugoslav emigrant community. There, Prazina was last seen the night of 3 December 1993. He went out with his bodyguards after a game of cards and never came back. The next morning, German police found his Audi abandoned at the railroad station in Aachen. The car body had two bullet holes from a 9mm handgun; presumed to be a Beretta. Prazina's body was discovered in a canal alongside a highway near the German border by two Romanian hitch-hikers on New Year's Eve. The bullets found in Prazina's head corresponded to the <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car, and the ownership of a Beretta by one of his bodyguards sealed the case in the eyes of Belgian police. The four bodyguards were arrested, and three of them went on to be tried and sentenced to serve time in prison.|$|E
25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E

I {{think it would be}} fair to say he was flying on his nerves." [...] Nevertheless, Voss flew a morning mission and shot down an Airco DH.4 from 57 Squadron at 09:30 hours. Upon his return to his air base with bullet <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Fokker, he took advantage of Richthofen's absence at the Voss family hunting lodge to celebrate with a victory loop before landing. In contrast to Voss's usual tidy flying garb, he was wearing striped gray trousers, a dirty gray sweater, and tall lace-up boots.|$|E
500|$|The Master Chief has a close {{relationship}} with the artificial intelligence construct Cortana, whom he meets just prior to the fall of the human colony Reach before the events of Combat Evolved. Cortana was created as a game design requirement to guide the character as Master Chief throughout the game world, but she became an important aspect of revealing the Chief's humanity. [...] "Over time, Cortana became a fully realized character—a friend and companion to the Chief, not to mention the only person to poke revealing <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> tough-guy exterior," [...] Staten recalled. The game designers also crafted the player experience of the first game to focus on abandonment and loneliness in many levels, as it reinforced the plot point that many of the Chief's friends were killed before the game began.|$|E
500|$|A {{complete}} inquest into Cancellor's {{death was}} initiated. His body {{was taken for}} autopsy on 28April and {{was found to be}} covered in blood under the gloves and stockings. His thighs were [...] "reduced to a perfect jelly" [...] and his body was covered in bruises and cuts, including two inch-deep <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> right leg, deep enough to allow the medical examiner, Robert Willis, to touch the bone underneath. Willis reported that other than these injuries, the boy was healthy and his internal organs (including the heart) were free of disease. He thus concluded that Cancellor had not died of natural causes, as Hopley had suggested, and noted that the boy had obviously been beaten shortly before his death. A female servant named Ellen Fowler, when questioned by investigators, reported that she had heard Cancellor screaming and being beaten from 10pm until midnight and that, shortly thereafter, he abruptly fell silent. She also noted traces of blood in the house and on Hopley's candlestick, which was left outside Cancellor's bedroom, and evidence that Cancellor's and Hopley's clothes had been washed soon before the former was pronounced dead. Two other servants testified in the inquiry and gave similar accounts.|$|E

500|$|Ryan Lambie of Den of Geek said of {{the first}} episode; [...] "In terms of writing and acting, Mad Dogs is good, but not perfect, and much of its knock-about banter is uncannily like any Brit gangster flick you've ever seen," [...] like [...] "Sexy Beast: the series." [...] However Lambie noted [...] "when events push its premise from naff lads' drama into exotic thriller, Mad Dogs gets {{infinitely}} better, and if nothing else, it keeps you guessing. As the series progressed, Lambie noted that Mad Dogs was [...] "developing into a nifty TV thriller with an engaging sense of the absurd. Writer, Cris Cole, enjoys picking <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> characters' machismo as the tension mounts, and the strange billboard posters dotted all over the sun-scorched island, which say [...] "Yenda a ninguna parte," [...] ("Going nowhere") are perhaps a foreshadowing of their imminent fate." [...] Lambie was disappointed at the ending, calling it [...] "unexpectedly flat," [...] adding [...] "the major plot twist that the previous three-or-so hours appeared to allude to never arrives, [...] I couldn't help but feel that, as the closing credits rolled on the whole saga, the tension and intrigue that had gradually built up in previous weeks {{had been allowed to}} slip away.|$|E
500|$|After a {{short period}} of leave during which he moved his family back to New Concord, and {{two and a half months}} of jet {{training}} at Cherry Point, Glenn was ordered to South Korea in October 1952, late in the Korean War. [...] Before he set out for Korea in February 1953, he applied for an inter-service exchange position with the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to fly the F-86 Sabre jet fighter-interceptor. In preparation, he arranged with Colonel Leon W. Gray to check out the F-86 at Otis Air Force Base in Massachusetts. Glenn reported to K-3 on February 3, 1953, and was assigned to VMF-311, one of two Marine fighter squadrons there, as its operations officer. VMF-311, equipped with the F9F Panther jet fighter-bomber, was assigned a variety of missions. Glenn flew his first, a reconnaissance flight, on February 26. He flew 63 combat missions in Korea with VMF-311, and was nicknamed [...] "Magnet Ass" [...] because of his ability to attract enemy flak (an occupational hazard of low-level close air support missions); twice, he returned to base with over 250 <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> plane. He flew for a time with Marine reservist Ted Williams (a future Hall of Fame baseball player with the Boston Red Sox) as his wingman, and also flew with future major general Ralph H. Spanjer.|$|E
500|$|Munro {{moved from}} Mississauga to Toronto after high school, to attend OCAD University. From {{early on in}} his career, his {{signature}} medium was pastiche work with men's underwear. The origins of this work date back to his Intro to Sculpture class at OCAD, where his professor asked the students to [...] "bring a special object to class that isn't really functional, but is special to you." [...] Munro had long had an affinity for special underwear, ever since his mother had refused to buy him Underoos superhero underwear {{when he was a}} child; regarding white briefs, he said, [...] "They were clinical and sterile. They weren't very sexy. It just felt very repressed. I wanted Underoos so bad." [...] For the sculpture class, Munro decided to bring in a pair of underwear that he had stolen from a high school friend on whom he had a crush. He put the grey underwear on display in a Plexiglass cage, complete with air <b>holes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> subsequent work he decided to use white briefs as a medium [...] "because they were so accessible." [...] The summer after his sculpture class, to keep himself busy on a road trip, he made a quilt out of white underwear. In 1997, his first show involving underwear was held in a gallery supported by his college. The show received publicity after conservative columnist Michael Coren, in the Toronto Sun and on the radio, criticized Munro and his show, in particular for having said that it involved [...] "boys' underwear" [...] (although Munro had simply meant guys' underwear). Coren asked the public to bring dirty diapers to the exhibit, but no one did. Munro went on to have many showings of his underwear art, mostly [...] "rescued" [...] from second-hand Goodwill clothing outlets, including at Who's Emma, HEADspace, and Paul Petro Contemporary Art. Actor Selma Blair bought one of Munro's underwear works when she was in town for the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival.|$|E
