A general council was convoked by him at Lyons, with this object; but before anything could be accomplished in the conclave, it was necessary to balance the overwhelming power of Charles of Anjou, and the Visconti (Gregory X.) ratified, in 1273, the election of Rudolph of Hapsburg.|$|E

In 1789 the Count went bankrupt and the area was repossessed, but later it was given to the community of Brand, which still built the racetrack, along with a grandstand.In the 19th century, horse racing in Brand enjoyed great popularity after it had been initiated in 1830 by the industrialist James Cockerill and further expanded upon in 1870 by his grandchildren and respected gentlemen riders Otto and Henry Suermondt, who would later serve as the nucleus of the Aachen-Laurensberg Riding Club.|$|E

Because these old forms can sound incorrect to modern ears, regularization can wear away at them until they are no longer used: brethren has now been replaced with the more regular-sounding brothers except when talking about religious orders.

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{connection between}} English mass and count nouns {{has long been}} known. Those working within lexical semantics have frequently cited such systematic connections as instances which are susceptible of treatment by so-called lexical rules (Leech 1981), lexical inference rules (Ostler and Atkins 1991), or subtype coercion (Pustejovsky 1995). This paper has three aims: to present the principal morphological and semantic properties of the mass count distinction; to formulate, in terms of lexical (inference) rules, the empirical generalizations pertinent to systematic connection between English mass and count nouns; and to show how such rules fit with a syntactic and semantic theory of English common noun phrases. 1 The Mass Count Distinction in English In English, the distinction between mass nouns and count nouns has clear morpho-syntactic criteria. First and foremost, <b>English</b> <b>count</b> nouns admit a morphological contrast between singular and plural; mass nouns do not, being almost always singular. For example, advice is a mass noun (*advices), whereas sugges-lion is a count noun (suggestions). Correlated with this are several other criteria: cardinal numerals and quasi-cardinal numerals (e. g., several) modify count nouns, never mass nouns. For example, two drinks is acceptable, since drink is a count noun; but two milks is not, since milk is a mass noun. Moreover, little and much modify mass nouns, never count nouns; whereas few and many modify count nouns, never mas...|$|E

Comparing with Chinese, {{strictly}} speaking, there are no measure words in English. This cross lingual difference causes difficulties in the English native speakers’ application of CMW when learning Chinese {{as a second language}} according to Lado‘s (1957) Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis (CAH), i. e. the language elements that are different from learners’ native language will be difficult for them. This study adopted an empirical study to find out how L 2 learners’ application of CMW is and what the problems are. Before the empirical study, a new categorisation was generated based on the existing studies on CMW categories, and a comparative study was carried out to underpin the study. A questionnaire and a proficiency test were adopted to gather information about the participants of the empirical study. A CMW test was designed to collect data on the English native speakers’ application of different CMW categories and usages. The results of the empirical study suggested that CMW are difficult for the English native speakers who are learning Chinese as a second language. The results also indicated that even though English native speakers have difficulties in the application of most of the CMW categories, some are easier than others. The English native speakers are better at weights and measures, collective nominal measure words and container measure words than standard verbal measure words, borrowed verbal measure words, individual nominal measure words and temporary nominal measure words.

40|$|This paper {{makes two}} central claims. The {{first is that}} there is an {{intimate}} and non-trivial relation between the mass/count distinction {{on the one hand and}} the measure/individuation distinction on the other: a (if not the) defining property of mass nouns is that they denote sets of entities which can be measured, while count nouns denote sets of entities which can be counted. Crucially, this is a difference in grammatical perspective and not in ontological status. The second claim is that the mass/count distinction between two types of nominals has its direct correlate at the level of classifier phrases: classifier phrases like two bottles of wine are ambiguous between a counting, or individuating, reading and a measure reading. On the counting reading, this phrase has count semantics, on the measure reading it has mass semantics. References Borer, H. 1999. ‘Deconstructing the construct’. In K. Johnson & I.

40|$|ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF PRE-DETERMINER UNIVERSAL QUANTIFIERS IN GERMANIC Marijke De Belder – CRISSP (Brussels) / Utrecht University 1. Introduction: I {{propose that}} the Dutch DP has a split low {{functional}} domain, whereas English has an unsplit one (cf. Iatridou 1990, Thrainsson 1996, Bobaljik & Thraínsson 1998, Giorgi & Pianesi 1997 on the IP-domain). I show that this distinction is reflected in a different distribution of universal quantifiers that appear {{in front of the}} determiner (henceforth ‘pre-determiner UQ’). 2. Problem: Zwarts (1992) observes that the Dutch pre-determiner UQ comes in two types: al ‘all’ and heel ‘whole’. They appear to be in complementary distribution: the first one, al ‘all’, occurs with definite mass readings (1) and def. plural NPs (2). The second one, heel ‘whole’, selects def. singulars (3). English does not make this distinction: def. mass readings (4), def. pl. NPs (5) and def. sg. NPs (6) all take all as a pre-determiner UQ. 3. Proposal: At first sight, it seems that English just lacks a pre-determiner UQ specifically marked for the feature [sg]. I propose, however, that this variation between Dutch and English is a reflection of a more fundamental divergence, i. e. a difference in the number of functional heads in the NP’s countability domain. More specifically, Dutch heel is licensed by a functional head responsible for unit readings. English lacks this head and therefore also this fine-grained distinction between heel and al. 4. Background: In what follows, I present Dutch countability facts. Following Borer (2005), I assume that the default reading for all nouns is mass and that functional projections can be added to the NP to add semantic features to the noun. 5. Data: Dutch has a mass reading and two different types of count readings: kind readings and unit readings. (i) mass readings: Mass readings (7) do not allow for any low functional structure in Dutch: they do not allow for number marking (8) or diminutives (9). As pointed out above, they do not allow for the pre-determiner UQ heel, but they do take all (1). (ii) kind readings: A kind reading can be paraphrased a ‘a kind of’. Semantically, it is odd to ask {{about the size of a}} kind (10). Further, as a count reading, it allows for singular and plural marking (11 - 12). It does not, however, allow for a diminutive (13 - 14), neither does it allow for heel (15). Plural kind readings allow for all, though (16). (iii) unit readings: A unit reading can be paraphrased as a ‘piece/specimen/portion of’. Semantically, it is normal to ask about the size of a unit (17). It allows for singular and plural marking (18 - 19). It also allows for a diminutive (18 - 19) (cf. Wiltschko 2007) and sg. unit readings allow for heel (20). Pl. unit readings allow for all (21). 6. Analysis 6. 1 Dutch heel: (i) For Dutch kind readings, I assume the presence of the functional projection DivP that is realized as number marking and that hosts the feature [Div] (Borer 2005). This feature serves to divide the mass stuff into countable items. (ii) For Dutch unit readings, I propose an additional piece of structure, that can be realized as the diminutive. This projection assigns size to the noun. The pre-determiner UQ heel then is marked for this feature [Size]. It therefore merges in Spec,SizeP where it checks its [Size] feature. From (1 - 3) it follows further that it is marked for the features [sg] and [def]. It therefore raises via Spec,DivP (in order to check [sg]) to Spec,DP (in order to check [Def]) (22). 6. 2 Dutch al: Apparently, the UQ al can take any non-singular definite DP as its complement without any further structural requirements. For the mass readings it therefore merges directly into Spec,DP to check its [def] feature. For the count readings, it merges into Spec,DivP to check its [non-sg] feature and then it raises to Spec,DP. 6. 3 English: Like Dutch, English distinguishes between mass and count readings by means of number marking. However, it has no functional syntactic means to set unit readings apart from kind readings. Indeed, all <b>English</b> <b>count</b> readings are completely homonymous between kinds and units (23). I therefore {{propose that the}}re is no reason to assume a functional SizeP for English. It follows that a UQ specifically marked for [size] is redundant and even impossible in this system: it could never check its feature. As a result, English all can appear in all circumstances. It is void of any features but definiteness. It therefore merges in Spec,DP. 7. Extension: I will discuss other Germanic languages that behave like Dutch, like Norwegian. Norwegian makes use of a closed class of morphemes to distinguish between kinds and units, such as –bit ‘piece’ and ¬-slurk ‘sip’ and equally has the al-heel distinction. 8. Conclusion: In this talk, I relate interlinguistic variation in pre-determiner universal quantifiers to variation in the low functional domain of the DP. I conclude that languages can have the specific heel quantifier if they also have a SizeP, as heel is marked for the feature [Size].
