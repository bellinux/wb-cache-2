40|$|The {{investigation}} of malware infections in enterprise net-works is today a tedious task {{with a lot}} of manual interven-tion in order to find the scattered relevant bits and bytes from infected hosts. We propose in this work AFR, a frame-work for automatic multi-stage forensic data retrieval, that automatically analyzes and retrieves network, memory and disk data to preserve the evidence of host compromise at a central location. AFR performs automated malware analy-sis using traditional intrusion detection techniques like net-work intrusion detection systems and anti-virus software but combines the resulting alarms in real-time to proactively re-trieve and archive data that is relevant for retrospective in-vestigations. The proactive retrieval approach reduces the manual work load of IT administrators while significantly improving the likelihood that volatile data is collected be-fore it vanishes. We show that proactive storing of selected memory and <b>disk</b> <b>dumps</b> is feasible and scales over time in virtualized thin client enterprise environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. X-rays trace {{accretion}} onto compact {{objects in}} binaries with low mass companions at rates ranging up to near Eddington. Accretion at high rates onto neutron stars goes through cycles with time-scales {{of days to}} months. At lower average rates the sources are recurrent transients; after months to years of quiescence, during a few weeks some part of a <b>disk</b> <b>dumps</b> onto the neutron star. Quasiperiodic oscillations near 1 kHz in the persistent X-ray flux attest to circular motion {{close to the surface}} of the neutron star. The neutron stars are probably inside their innermost stable circular orbits and the x-ray oscillations reflect the structure of that region. The long term variations show us the phenomena for a range of accretion rates. For black hole compact objects in the binary, the disk flow tends to be in the transient regime. Again, at high rates of flow from the disk to the black hole there are quasiperiodic oscillations in the frequency range expected for the innermost part of an accretion disk. There are differences between the neutron star and black hole systems, such as two oscillation frequencies versus one. For both types of compact object there are strong oscillations below 100 Hz. Interpretations differ on the role of the nature of the compact object...|$|R

40|$|Disks are {{a natural}} {{by-product}} of start formation. Just like the formation if a star is a lengthy process that goes through many stages, disks around young stars evolve my processing matter through the <b>disk</b> and <b>dumping</b> {{it onto the}} star. The solid and gaseous components of disks do not always evolve together - dust-gas separation can take place, dust grains may grow. In this chapter we attempt {{a brief overview of}} processes that shape this evolution, {{in a way that is}} useful as a background to the other chapters in this lecture series. As such, the chapter does not aim for completeness or being up to date with some of the most recent developments...|$|R
2500|$|Once pumped {{and ready}} for firing, a small pulse of laser light is fed into the beamlines. The Nd:glass <b>disks</b> each <b>dump</b> {{additional}} power into the beam as it passes through them. After passing {{through a number of}} amplifiers the light pulse is [...] "cleaned up" [...] in a spatial filter before being fed into another series of amplifiers. At each stage additional optics were used to increase the diameter of the beam and allow the use of larger and larger amplifier disks. In total, Nova contained fifteen amplifiers and five filters of increasing size in the beamlines, with an option to add an additional amplifier on the last stage, although it is not clear if these were used in practice.|$|R
40|$|We have {{simultaneously}} {{monitored the}} photometric and polarimetric {{variations of the}} Classical T Tauri star AA Tau during the fall of 2002. We combine these data with previously published polarimetric data covering two earlier epochs. The phase coverage is complete, although not contiguous. AA Tau clearly shows cyclic variations coupled with {{the rotation of the}} system. The star-disk system produces a repeatable polarisation curve where the polarisation increases with decreasing brightness. The data fit well with the model put forward by Bouvier et al. (1999) where AA Tau is viewed almost edge-on and its <b>disk</b> is actively <b>dumping</b> material onto the central star via magnetospheric accretion. The inner edge of the disk is deformed by its interaction with the tilted magnetosphere, producing eclipses as it rotates and occults the photosphere periodically. From the shape of the polarisation curve in the QU-Plane we confirm that the accretion disk is seen at a large inclination, almost edge-on, and predict that its position angle is PA~ 90 deg., i. e., that the disk's major axis is oriented in the East-West direction.
