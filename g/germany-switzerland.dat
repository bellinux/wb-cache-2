But Jukka-Pekka Koivisto had to leave the band after <b>Germany-Switzerland</b> tour because he was busy with his other band Silent Voices new album recordings. The band found a new drummer from the close friends circle, in early 2005, when Juha Kronqvist joined Immortal Souls. Because the Immortal Souls publications had been sold out long time ago, the Fear Dark decided to publish them as remastered versions on the Once Upon A Time In The North 2 CD-compilation album at the end of 2005. From the label request, Aki SÃ¤rkioja wrote the publication history into the compilation CD cover booklet.|$|E
