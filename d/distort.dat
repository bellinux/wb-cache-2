5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are able}} to recognize or <b>distort</b> the Holliday junction structure. One such class contains junction-resolving enzymes that cleave the junctions, sometimes in a sequence-specific fashion. Such proteins <b>distort</b> {{the structure of the}} junction in various ways, often pulling the junction into an unstacked conformation, breaking the central base pairs, and/or changing the angles between the four arms. Other classes are branch migration proteins that increase the exchange rate by orders of magnitude, and site-specific recombinases. In prokaryotes, Holliday junction resolvases fall into two families, integrases and nucleases, that are each structurally similar although their sequences are not conserved.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun was reelected to the Senate in 1845 {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Daniel Elliott Huger. He soon became vocally opposed to the Mexican–American War. He believed that it would <b>distort</b> the national character by undermining republicanism in favor of empire and by bringing non-white persons into the country. (See §The evils of war and political parties.) When Congress declared war against Mexico on May 13, he abstained from voting on the measure. Calhoun also vigorously opposed the Wilmot Proviso, an 1846 proposal by Pennsylvania Representative David Wilmot to ban slavery in all newly acquired territories. The House of Representatives, through its Northern majority, passed the provision several times. However, the Senate, where non-slave and slave states had more equal representation, never passed the measure.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Histology {{acquisition}} often introduces tissue distortions {{that make}} 3 D reconstruction difficult. We present a framework to detect <b>distorted</b> slices, <b>distorted</b> structures and eventually correct the distortions by a reasonable estimation. The first detection specifies <b>distorted</b> slices by comparing similarity measures {{in a group}} of neighbouring slices. The <b>distorted</b> structures detection attempts to predict the type, size and position of the distortions {{in the absence of a}} priori information about expected distortions. The last algorithm uses undistorted tissue information in corresponding regions in neighbouring slices to correct <b>distorted</b> areas, facilitating pair-wise slice registration for 3 D reconstruction. ...|$|R

5|$|Haumea {{displays}} large {{fluctuations in}} brightness {{over a period}} of 3.9 hours, which can only be explained by a rotational period of this length. This is faster than any other known equilibrium body in the Solar System, and indeed faster than any other known body larger than 100 km in diameter. While most rotating bodies in equilibrium are flattened into oblate spheroids, Haumea rotates so quickly that it is distorted into a triaxial ellipsoid. If Haumea were to rotate much more rapidly, it would <b>distort</b> itself into a dumbbell shape and split in two. This rapid rotation is thought to have been caused by the impact that created its satellites and collisional family.|$|E
5|$|However, {{others argue}} that the Sun is {{currently}} close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's spiral arms. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may <b>distort</b> the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as supernovae.|$|E
5|$|Sweet Tooth {{is a love}} story, a spy novel, and a {{book about}} {{literature}} itself.

Serena prefers a realist approach, where life in the book reflects real life. Haley {{on the other hand}} is of a more modernist school, and enjoys experimentation in his work. McEwan plays with these differences, firstly by placing himself in the novel and blurring the line between author and character, and secondly by writing {{what appears to be a}} straight first-person narrative, only to <b>distort</b> this perception at the very end.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the dispersive order and the excess wealth order to compare the variability of <b>distorted</b> distributions. We know from Sordo (2009 a) that the excess wealth order can be characterized {{in terms of a}} class of variability measures associated to the tail conditional distribution which includes, as a particular measure, the tail variance. Given that the tail conditional distribution is a particular <b>distorted</b> distribution, a natural question is whether this result can be extended to include other classes of variability measures associated to general <b>distorted</b> distributions. As we show in this paper, the answer is yes, by focusing on <b>distorted</b> distributions associated to concave distortion functions. For <b>distorted</b> distributions associated to more general distortions, the characterizations are stated in terms of the stronger dispersive order.

In the course of these additions, they frequently dismantled old temple buildings to use as fill for the interiors of new structures.

5|$|The moons {{discovered}} by Galileo—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—are {{among the largest}} satellites in the Solar System. The orbits of three of them (Io, Europa, and Ganymede) form a pattern known as a Laplace resonance; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one. This resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons to <b>distort</b> their orbits into elliptical shapes, because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbors {{at the same point}} in every orbit it makes. The tidal force from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits.|$|E

Exceptionally striking are hands in other than natural configuration {{which have been}} found to elicit distinct brain activation. Here we studied response strength and lateralization of this activation using event-related potentials (ERPs), in particular, occipitotemporal N 1 responses as correlates of activation in extrastriate body area. Participants viewed computer-generated images of hands, half of them showing <b>distorted</b> fingers, the other half showing natural fingers. As control stimuli of similar geometric complexity, images of chairs were shown, half of them with <b>distorted</b> legs, half with standard legs. The contrast of interest was between <b>distorted</b> and natural/standard stimuli. For hands, stronger N 1 responses were observed for <b>distorted</b> (vs natural) stimuli from 170 ms post stimulus. Such stronger N 1 responses were found for <b>distorted</b> hands and absent for <b>distorted</b> chairs, therefore likely unrelated to visuospatial processing of the unusual <b>distorted</b> shapes. Rather, N 1 modulation over both hemispheres - but robustly right-lateralized - could reflect <b>distorted</b> hands as emotionally laden stimuli. The results are in line with privileged visual processing of hands as highly salient body parts, with distortions engaging neural resources that are especially activated for biological stimuli in social perception...|$|R

5|$|He {{originally}} recorded Lagos for his use in-studio, {{but when}} presented {{with the idea of}} sharing the sound for artistic installation, he began to edit the clips for their best representation of Lagos and considered the best method of public dissemination. Home from his Egyptian art program, Ogboh was inspired to create the Lagos Soundscapes project when the artist was able to identify the sounds of his city during a phone call with a friend. As he transitioned to the field, he turned to online help in discussion forums and email. In his installations, Ogboh prefers audio that requires minimal studio manipulation, and does not significantly alter the sounds. Some audio effects come from the recording environment, both surfaces that echo and <b>distort</b> sound, and the effect of traveling with a recorder. His first sound installation was in the Fayoum academy's bathroom, followed by his first Lagos Soundscapes installation at the Lagos African Artists' Foundation in 2009. Ogboh remembered reception mostly around his work's novelty.|$|E

Keynes began to recover in 1939, {{but for the rest of}} his life his professional energies were largely directed towards the practical side of economics – the problems of ensuring optimum allocation of resources for the war efforts, post-war negotiations with America, and the new international financial order that was presented at the Bretton Woods Conference.|$|E
5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's {{magnetic field}} caused by iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally <b>distort</b> compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when motionless, but instantly seen when it moves.

Motion dazzle may degrade predators' ability {{to estimate the}} prey's speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Motion dazzle distorts speed perception and is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also <b>distort</b> perception of size (and so, perceived range to the target). As of 2011, motion dazzle had been proposed for military vehicles, but never applied.

5|$|Over {{elevated}} surfaces, heating of {{the ground}} exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level, creating an associated thermal low over the terrain and enhancing any thermal lows that would have otherwise existed, and changing the wind circulation of the region.

Hills and valleys substantially <b>distort</b> the airflow by increasing friction between the atmosphere and landmass by acting as a physical block to the flow, deflecting the wind parallel to the range just upstream of the topography, which is known as a barrier jet.

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} often {{transform into}} extratropical cyclones {{at the end}} of their tropical existence, usually between 30° and 40° latitude, where there is sufficient forcing from upper-level troughs or shortwaves riding the Westerlies for the process of extratropical transition to begin. During this process, a cyclone in extratropical transition (known across the eastern North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans as the post-tropical stage), will invariably form or connect with nearby fronts and/or troughs consistent with a baroclinic system. Due to this, the size of the system will usually appear to increase, while the core weakens. However, after transition is complete, the storm may re-strengthen due to baroclinic energy, depending on the environmental conditions surrounding the system.
