5|$|Glastonbury Methodist Church on Lambrook Street {{was built}} in 1843 and has a galleried interior, typical of a non-conformist chapel of that period, but an unusual number of stained glass windows. Close by the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> is an ancient pond, which was later covered to form a brick-arched reservoir. This is {{mentioned}} in property deeds of 1821, and is still accessible, containing approximately 31,500 gallons of water.|$|E
5|$|In <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> is the equestrian {{statue of}} Matthias Corvinus, erected {{in honour of}} the locally born King of Hungary. The Orthodox Church's {{equivalent}} to St. Michael's Church is the Orthodox Cathedral on Avram Iancu Square, built in the interwar era. The Romanian Greek-Catholic Church also has a cathedral in Cluj-Napoca, Transfiguration Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} events {{have been held}} at the CAB, as well as {{receiving}} distinguished visitors. As part of the festivities for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the Olympic torch was passed through the hands {{of members of the}} First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles {{on the steps of the}} CAB. It is also a tradition that funeral processions of past LDS Church presidents pass in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> Administration Building. The building has hosted visitors including Michelle Obama and George W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, large windows, a simple {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench across the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access {{from the balcony}} to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a large open area {{in front of the}} platform to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry {{at the rear of the}} platform.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year on the}} Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, a {{great number}} of devotees come to the monastery, popularly known as Shingjon among Albanians. In the morning, the reliquary is placed {{at the center of the}} church under a canopy, before being opened. After the morning liturgy has been celebrated, {{chanting}} priests carry the reliquary three times around the church, followed by the devotees, who hold lit candles. The reliquary is then placed in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> to be kissed by the believers. The priests give them pieces of cotton that have been kept inside the reliquary since the previous feast. There are numerous stories about people, both Christians and Muslims, who were healed after they prayed before the saint's relics.|$|E

5|$|Finally, Rachel {{decides to}} return to her community. Mr. Will is bailed out of jail by Tim, who is looking for Rachel. Together, he and Mr. Will drive out to the community, and on the way they {{discover}} Clyde, whose van has broken down on the highway. As Rachel is about to be wed, Tim, Mr. Will, and Clyde pull up in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> in the red Mustang and rescue her. Mr. Will returns to the community and is accepted back with a confession that Rachel has recorded on the blue cassette, although she still firmly believes that God has fathered her child. Some months later, Clyde and a visibly pregnant Rachel are living in a tent by the beach and hold hands as they walk through the waves.|$|E
5|$|The last Texian {{group to}} remain in the open were Crockett and his men, {{defending}} the low wall in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> Unable to reload, they used their rifles as clubs and fought with knives. After a volley of fire and a wave of Mexican bayonets, the few remaining Texians in this group fell back towards the church. The Mexican army now controlled all of the outer walls and the interior of the Alamo compound except for the church and rooms along the east and west walls. Mexican soldiers turned their attention to a Texian flag waving from the roof of one building. Four Mexicans were killed before the flag of Mexico was raised in that location.|$|E
5|$|The {{last of the}} Texians to die {{were the}} 11 men manning the two 12-pounder cannon in the chapel. A shot from the 18-pounder cannon {{destroyed}} the barricades at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> and Mexican soldiers entered the building after firing an initial musket volley. Dickinson's crew fired their cannon from the apse into the Mexican soldiers at the door. With no time to reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza and James Bonham, grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans, the master of ordnance, had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but {{was killed by a}} musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder. Had he succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the church and killed the women and children hiding in the sacristy.|$|E

5|$|Gray became {{engaged to}} Jane Lathrop Loring of Boston in May 1847. Two of Gray's younger brothers, George and Joseph, were {{students}} at Harvard {{in the late}} 1840s and lived with Gray. During his junior year, George caught typhoid fever in late 1847 and died on January9, 1848, in the Loring house in Boston. This {{is part of the}} reason Gray's marriage was delayed from fall 1847 to spring 1848. Gray and Jane Loring married on May4, 1848. Her parents were Charles Greely Loring, a member of the Harvard Corporation and a lawyer, and Anna Pierce (Brace) Loring. Her family was Unitarian, like most faculty and staff of Harvard at the time. Both of them kept to their separate religious denominations yet seem to have had no difficulties over it. They had no children. Jane Gray accompanied her husband on most of his expeditions. Gray was a devout Presbyterian and was a member of First Church in Cambridge, a Congregational church, where he served as a deacon. He was also an ardent empiricist in the tradition of John Locke and John Stuart Mill. When the congregation moved into its present building in 1872, at 11Garden Street, Gray planted two Kentucky yellowwood trees, Cladrastis kentukea, in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> They stood until October 2014.|$|E
5|$|The priory buildings, {{including}} the church, were extended {{during the late}} 12th and early 13thcenturies. It {{has been estimated that}} the original community would have consisted of 12canons and the prior; this increased to around 26members in the later part of the 12thcentury, {{making it one of the}} largest houses in the Augustinian order. By the end of the century the church had been lengthened, a new and larger chapter house had been built (I* on the plan), and a large chapel had been added to the east end of the church (N). In about 1200 the west <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was enlarged (M), a bell tower was built and guest quarters were constructed. It is possible that the chapel at the east end was built to accommodate the holy cross of Norton, a relic which was reputed to have miraculous healing powers. A fire in 1236 destroyed the timber-built kitchen (Q) and damaged the west range of the monastic buildings and the roof of the church. The kitchen was rebuilt and the other damage was rapidly repaired.|$|E
