25|$|Bharatha Kathamanjari is a {{collection}} of nineteen stories that convey morals and ethical values. Some stories are of epic nature while the others are like tales of birds and animals aimed at teaching a lesson to human beings. Chilakamarti wrote stories based on the lives of forty eight <b>great</b> <b>people</b> under the title Chamatkara Manjari.

Kamikokuryo now aims to start writing again in addition to doing freelance art and diction work.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by Kandukuri Veeresalingam's Kavula Charitra (The History of Poets), Chilakamarti wrote {{biographies of}} <b>great</b> <b>people</b> {{under the title}} Mahapurushuna Jeevitha Charitralu (Lives of Greatmen) during 1906–08. Unlike Kavula Charitra which was tough subject {{from the point of}} view of {{determining}} the dates of the poets with internal and external evidences, Chilakamarti did not bother about these details, but simply narrated the story in such a way that any layman who knew the language could easily understand and enjoy it with absorbing interest.|$|E

25|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Folk of Haleth travelled from the East of Middle-earth separately from the <b>great</b> <b>people</b> of whom came the Houses of Bëor and Hador. Their first known settling-place was west of the later Gap of Rohan between the Misty Mountains and the White. Some remained there throughout the later ages, becoming the Dunlendings and the folk of Enedwaith and Minhiriath. Around {{the same time they}} became acquainted with the {{ancestors of}} the Drúedain, and profitable relationship was soon established. Together many of both people journeyed across Eriador.|$|E

He created it as a tribute to the nation on the occasion of 50 years of independence. It was painted on the specially prepared wall of Mahavir Art Gallery in Ahmednagar. Pramod has portrayed Bharat Mata (goddess of Indian Independence) and 500 <b>great</b> <b>people</b> born out of Indian culture. This {{is supposed to be the}} worlds biggest pencil sketch.|$|E
25|$|In 1298 Ibn Taymiyyah {{wrote an}} {{explanation}} of the ayat al-mutashabihat (the unclear verses of the Qur'an) called Al-`Aqidat al-Hamawiyat al-Kubra (The creed of the <b>great</b> <b>people</b> of Hama). The book is about divine attributes and it served as an answer to a question from the city of Hama, Syria. At that particular time Ash'arites held prominent positions within the Islamic scholarly community in both Syria and Egypt, and they held a certain position on the divine attributes of God. Ibn Taymiyyah in his book strongly disagreed with their views and this heavy opposition to the common Ash'ari position, caused considerable controversy.|$|E

25|$|The book {{is perhaps}} most {{important}} {{in the manner in}} which it provides the viewpoint of one of Wellington's foot soldiers at a time when so many were illiterate. Whilst some officers kept diaries or wrote memoirs of their service, The Recollections of Rifleman Harris is rare because unlike the grand actions or <b>great</b> <b>people</b> recalled by his superiors, Harris mentions dozens of men whose history is no longer remembered and whose names would otherwise be lost, and records the details of daily ennui with interesting and colloquial prose. He describes medicine from a patient's point of view, punishment from a friend of the victim's view, and military life from the bottom up, giving insight to the daily life of a soldier in the Napoleonic Wars, as well as a valuable primary source to some of the British campaigns of the period.|$|E
25|$|Home Life of Great Authors, {{published}} in Chicago, in 1877, included descriptive sketches of many authors, with glimpses {{of their home}} life and personal and domestic character: Goethe, Wordsworth, Lamb, Shelley, Emerson, George Sand, Tennyson, Whittier, Robert and Elizabeth B. Browning, Poe, Eliot, Burns, De Quincey, North, Irving, Carlyle, Macaulay, Hawthorne, Holmes, Charlotte Bronte, Thackeray, Kingsley, Madame de Stael, Scott, Lord Byron, Bryant, Hugo, Lytton, Longfellow, Lowell, Margaret Fuller, Dickens, and Ruskin. As its title would indicate, the book aimed to give a more personal and intimate view {{of men and women}} well-known to fame than was to be found in most reference works. The young readers of this volume learned that dates and statistics do not enable them to know people; they need to have some personal details as to the habits and daily lives of the people about whom they read. Griswold said in one of her works that as she had had such a hard time {{when she was a girl}} getting any picture in her mind of the <b>great</b> <b>people</b> about whom she read, that she determined to make it easier for other boys and girls to obtain these mental pictures; that is why she wrote The Home Life of Great Authors.|$|E

However, the conductor of the orchestra Patton used on tour {{was a native of}} Naples and would frequently correct the singer during rehearsal until he was able to perform it correctly. Describing this collaboration, Patton noted [...] "I had a lot of <b>great</b> <b>people</b> around me. I wouldn’t {{have been able to do}} any of this shit without them".|$|E

She says: [...] "I am blessed with a great family and <b>great</b> <b>people</b> around me that would be able to kick me in the shins if I ever for one minute got lost up in the clouds. I've been really lucky in that sense." [...] During the production of The Amazing Spider-Man in 2010, Stone dated co-star Andrew Garfield. The nature of their relationship was well-documented by the media, with frequent speculation about an impending engagement or a break-up. The couple refused to talk about it publicly, though they made several appearances together. In 2015, they were reported to have broken up.|$|E

[...] He described Libertarian Party candidate Bob Barr as a [...] "very attractive candidate" [...] whom he [...] "like...very much." [...] When asked about his own presidential aspirations, he responded by saying that [...] "There are many <b>great</b> <b>people</b> in our party that, in my opinion, are much more qualified [...] than I am.

500|$|Just {{as little}} is known about Jesus during his middle years, Clark travels into the {{wilderness}} to find out who he is and what he has to do.

They can be a <b>great</b> <b>people,</b> Kal-El, and they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you, my only son." [...] The theme resembles the Biblical account of God sending his only son Jesus to Earth in hope for the good of mankind.

500|$|The {{title track}} of the album, [...] "International Velvet", {{featuring}} the line [...] "Every day when I wake up I thank the Lord I'm Welsh" [...] and Welsh language verses, received additional attention from the media. Matthews explained {{in an interview that}} she wanted to turn to invert the idea of being Welsh from an apparent negative into a positive, [...] "We're not seen to be very good at anything. Our football team is shit. The song is saying, despite all these things, I still {{wake up in the morning}} and thank the Lord that I'm Welsh. Hopefully by now people realise that Wales is brimmed full of talent and we're <b>great</b> <b>people</b> with massive brains." [...] In front of 70,000 spectators, Catatonia performed [...] "International Velvet" [...] at the opening ceremony of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The album became the first to be released for Catatonia in the United States, but failed to chart. The Washington Post called it [...] "overlooked".|$|E
500|$|The lyrical themes on Dig Me Out {{deal with}} issues of heartbreak and survival. The song [...] "One More Hour" [...] is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship. Before {{the release of the}} album, Spin {{published}} a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission. Brownstein felt that [...] "it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. It was horrible. I was pissed at Spin, really mad. Luckily my parents are <b>great</b> <b>people,</b> but God forbid I would have some family that would disown me over something like that. And I would have totally held Spin responsible for that." [...] The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of Addicted to Noise noted that [...] "one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation". In her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl, Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on Dig Me Out are about either her or Tucker's future husband, Lance Bangs.|$|E
500|$|Russo was not {{involved}} in the selection of the sourced songs used throughout the show, with Hawley already knowing the songs he wanted to use and working with music supervisor Maggie Phillips to get the license for them. With the influence of Pink Floyd's music on both Hawley and Russo, Hawley wanted to use their music in the season's finale, as Phillips noted it [...] "never quite fit in the other episodes". He chose the songs [...] "Breathe" [...] and [...] "On the Run", as [...] "they flow into each other on the record. There’s no pause in between those songs. So {{there was no way to}} go with just one song." [...] This posed an issue with the series' budget that became the hardest licensing struggle for the series. Phillips described [...] "an extremely difficult negotiation process, but we were working with some <b>great</b> <b>people</b> that recognized what we were doing was interesting. We ended up getting a price that we were able to persuade FX was worth it. But, it took months." [...] The songs were confirmed on the day of the final sound mix for the show. In case the songs could not have been secured, Hawley asked Phillips to choose an alternative from the works of The Flaming Lips. Phillips said she was [...] "not a huge fan of Flaming Lips, but I listened to every single song they’ve ever done". They ultimately decided that none of the songs would work for the sequence, so Russo composed original music to replace the Pink Floyd songs if necessary.|$|E
