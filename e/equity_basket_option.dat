40|$|In {{this paper}} we employ the L´evy copula model to {{determine}} <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> prices. More precisely, <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> prices {{are determined by}} replacing the real basket with an appropriate approximation. For the approximate basket we determine the underlying characteristic function and hence we can derive the related <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> prices by using the Carr-Madan formula. Two approaches are considered. In the first approach, we replace the arithmetic sum by an appropriate geometric sum, whereas the second approach {{can be considered as}} a three-moments-matching method. Numerical examples illustrate the accuracy of our approximations; several L´evy models are calibrated to market data and <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> prices are determined. In a last part we show how our newly designed <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> pricing formula can be used to define implied L´evy correlation by matching model and market prices for <b>basket</b> <b>options.</b> Our main finding is that the implied L´evy correlation smile is flatter than its Gaussian counterpart.

40|$|<b>Basket</b> <b>options</b> {{are among}} the most popular {{products}} of the new generation of exotic options. This attraction is {{explained by the fact that}} they can efficiently and simultaneously hedge a wide variety of intrinsically different financial risks. They are flexible enough to include all the risks faced by non-financial firms. Unfortunately, the existing literature on <b>basket</b> <b>options</b> considers only homogeneous baskets where all the underlying assets are identical and hedge the same kind of risk. Moreover, the empirical implementation of basket-option models is not yet well developed, particularly when they are composed of heterogeneous underlying assets. This paper focus on the modelization and the parameters estimation of <b>basket</b> <b>options</b> on commodity price with stochastic convenience yield, exchange rate, and domestic and foreign zero-coupon bonds in a stochastic interest rates setting.

40|$|Background: In an {{increasingly}} globalized environment, corporations perform transactions across borders {{on a day-to-day}} basis. As multinational corporations expand their businesses the number of currencies in their operations increases. The consequence of operating with several currencies is the risk associated with currency fluctuations. Sandvik AB is a worldwide corporation where activities are conducted through representation in more than 130 countries. Currency exposures are controlled through risk management where financial derivatives are applied to protect the corporation from potential losses caused by fluctuations. Sandvik AB recently implemented a hedging strategy entitled Layered <b>Basket</b> <b>Option</b> hedging. The strategy {{is a combination of}} a layered- and a <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> approach to maximize the effect of the hedge. There is a limited amount of previous research regarding Layered <b>Basket</b> <b>Option</b> hedging and Sandvik AB is the first corporation to actively practice this strategy. Purpose: The purpose is to investigate and provide information about how currency risk most effectively is hedged for the multinational corporation Sandvik AB. Furthermore, we want to evaluate if Sandvik’s recently implemented hedging strategy, Layered <b>Basket</b> <b>Option</b> hedging, is the best-suited strategy for them and if there are any improvements to be made. This thesis will further investigate the importance of currency hedging for multinational corporations, which are dependent on reporting to their stakeholders. Hopefully, this thesis will also facilitate the communication of Sandvik’s currency strategies throughout the organization and make it more comprehensible. Method: Exchange rates on daily basis for the period 2002 - 2012 were collected from Bank of Canada and Reuters database. The collected data was thereafter used as a basis to perform calculations to determine if Layered <b>Basket</b> <b>Option</b> hedging is the optimal solution for Sandvik AB. Conclusion: The results of this study highlight the benefits from applying a Layered <b>Basket</b> <b>Option</b> hedging strategy and the strategy succeeds to reduce the volatility caused by currency fluctuation. The results indicate that the combination of a layered- and a <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> approach successfully creates a suitable strategy for Sandvik AB. Furthermore, this thesis has recognized that there exists room for improvement by actively allocating currencies according to their weights and correlations to fully exploit the effects from the strategy...|$|R

The celebrated Black-Scholes {{option pricing}} model {{is unable to}} produce closed-form solutions for arithmetic <b>basket</b> <b>options.</b> This problem stems {{from the lack of}} an analitical form for the distribution of a sum of lognormal random variables. lVlarket participants commonly price <b>basket</b> <b>options</b> by assuming the basket follows lognormal dynamics, although it is known that this approximation performs poorly in some cicumstances. The problem of finding an analytical approximation to the sum of lognormally distributed random variables has been widely studied.

40|$|This thesis {{will look}} at two models that price European <b>basket</b> <b>options</b> {{consistently}} with the observed market smile. In {{the setting of the}} FX market <b>basket</b> <b>options</b> offer protection against drops in currencies and they are considerably cheaper than the sum of individual call options. Due to the obvious benefits of <b>basket</b> <b>options</b> an accurate method of valuation is needed {{in order to be able}} to price these options. Currently there does not exist a way to accurately price a <b>basket</b> <b>option</b> and many of the available approximations assume constant volatility. This assumption which is known to be untrue is the underlying reason behind developing smile consistent models. The first model addressed in this thesis is Monte Carlo simulation with local volatility. Monte Carlo simulation is often neglected due to it being too computationally heavy thus we investigate the use of the GPU to reduce timing costs. The second model proposed in this thesis is that of an Edgeworth series expansion of the true distribution around that of an approximating distribution. The model is then calibrated to the market smile in order to capture its effects on the valuation. The suggested models appear to provide superior pricing methods over many existing methods. They are also shown to accurately recover the market volatility surface...|$|R
