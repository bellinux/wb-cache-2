In addition to the ‘classical’ pointwise measurements available for similar experiments conducted in the past, significant additional efforts were spent on the experimental characterization of the underlying flow field and turbulent quantities by means of particle image velocimetry (PIV) for the benchmark. This data is well suited for a detailed assessment of the <b>driving</b> <b>jet</b> flow and its interaction with the stratified layer.

A systematic validation is carried out based on measured and derived quantities. It is identified that e. g. the mesh resolution in the jet and mixing zone has only a minor impact, while small changes in turbulence modeling strategy or the chosen model constants, like Sct, significantly affect the simulation results.

40|$|Supermassive {{black holes}} at {{the centre of}} galactic nuclei mostly grow in mass through gas {{accretion}} over cosmic time. This process also modifies the angular momentum (or spin) of supermassive black holes, both in magnitude and in orientation. Despite being often neglected in galaxy formation simulations, spin {{plays a crucial role}} in modulating accretion power, <b>driving</b> <b>jet</b> feedback, and determining recoil velocity of coalescing black hole binaries. We present a new accretion model for the moving-mesh code AREPO that incorporates (i) mass accretion through a thin α-disc, and (ii) spin evolution through the Bardeen-Petterson effect. We use a diverse suite of idealised simulations to explore the physical connection between spin evolution and larger scale environment. We find that black holes ≲ 10 ^ 7 M_ experience quick alignment between the black hole and the accretion disc, favouring prolonged phases of spin-up, and the spin direction evolves according to the gas inflow on timescales as short as ≲ 100 Myr, which might explain the observed jet direction distribution in Seyfert galaxies. Heavier black holes (≳ 10 ^ 8 M_) are instead more sensitive to the local gas kinematic. Here we find a wider distribution in spin magnitudes: spin-ups are favoured if gas inflow maintains a preferential direction, and spin-downs occur for nearly isotropic infall, while the spin direction does not change much over short timescales ∼ 100 Myr. We therefore conclude that supermassive black holes with masses ≳ 5 × 10 ^ 8 M_ may be the ideal testbed to determine the main mode of black hole fuelling over cosmic time.

40|$|SUMMARY A new valveless ventilator, {{which uses}} an air jet {{to provide the}} driving force for {{positive}} pressure ventilation, was used on 13 newborn babies (10 of very low birthweight) who had severe respiratory disease. The ventilator differs from 'true ' jet ventilators in that its driving gas does not take part in gas exchange. Functionally it is a pressure pre-set, time-cycled ventilator, whose performance is characterised by the rapid and precise maintenance of both inspiratory and expiratory airway opening pressure. All the babies had progressively worsening respiratory failure (mean values of arterial pCO 2 were 9 - 46 kPa, with a pH of 7 - 14, and an inspired oxygen concentration of 92 - 5 %) on conventional mechanical ventilation. On the new ventilator, with the same settings, there was a dramatic and highly significant improvement within 20 to 30 minutes (mean values of arterial pCO 2 were 6 - 45 kPa, pH 7 - 26, and inspired oxygen concentration 85. 7 %). This improvement was maintained. The new ventilator represents an important advance {{in the management of}} babies with severe respiratory failure. A new valveless ventilator has been developed at this hospital. 1 2 The prototype, CW 200, comprises two jets in a single tube (see fig 1). The <b>driving</b> <b>jet</b> delivers intermittent pulses of unconditioned gas, which provides the driving force for positive pres-sure ventilation, whereas the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) jet provides continuous gas flow that maintains positive pressure in the breathing circuit throughout the respiratory cycle. The gas supply for these jets can be derived from any single convenient source: from either a piped supply or commercially available cylinders (air or oxygen). It need not be conditioned as it does not enter the patient's respiratory system. A low flow of an appropriate mixture of air and oxygen (roughly 2 I/minute for general neonatal use) that has been adequately warmed and humidified enters the breathing circuit close to the endotracheal tube.

40|$|Unsteady {{ejectors}} {{are currently}} {{under investigation for}} use in some pulse-detonation-engine-based propulsion systems. Experimental measurements made in the past, and recently at the NASA Glenn Research Center, have demonstrated that thrust augmentation can be enhanced considerably when the driver is unsteady. In ejector systems, thrust augmentation is defined as = T(sup Total) /T(sup j), where T(sup Total) is the total thrust of the combined ejector and <b>driving</b> <b>jet</b> and T(sup j) is the thrust due to the <b>driving</b> <b>jet</b> alone. There are three images in this figure, {{one for each of}} the named thrust sources. The images are color contours of measured instantaneous vorticity. Each image is an ensemble average of at least 150 phase-locked measurements. The flow is from right to left, and the shape and location of each driver is shown on the far right of each image. The emitted vortex is a clearly defined "doughnut" of highly vortical (spinning) flow. In these planar images, the vortex appears as two distorted circles, one above, and one below the axis of symmetry. Because they are spinning in the opposite direction, the two circles have vorticity of opposite sign and thus are different colors. There is also a rectangle shown in each image. Its width represents the ejector diameter that was found experimentally to yield the highest thrust augmentation. It is apparent that the optimal ejector diameter is that which just "captures" the vortex: that is, the diameter bounding the outermost edge of the vortex structure. The exact mechanism behind the enhanced performance is unclear; however, it is believed {{to be related to the}} powerful vortex emitted with each pulse of the unsteady driver. As such, particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) measurements were obtained for three unsteady drivers: a pulsejet, a resonance tube, and a speaker-driven jet. All the drivers were tested with ejectors, and all exhibited performance enhancement over similarly sized steady drivers. The characteristic starting vortices of each driver are shown in these images. The images are color contours of measured instantaneous vorticity. Each image is an ensemble average of at least 150 phase-locked measurements. The flow is from right to left. The shape and location of each driver is shown on the far right of each image. The rectangle shown in each image represents the ejector diameter that was found experimentally to yield the highest thrust augmentation. It is apparent that the optimal ejector diameter is that which just "captures" the vortex: that is, the diameter bounding the outermost edge of the vortex structure. Although not shown, it was observed that the emitted vortex spread as it traveled downstream. The spreading rate for the pulsejet is shown as the dashed lines in the top image. A tapered ejector was fabricated that matched this shape. When tested, the ejector demonstrated superior performance to all those previously tested at Glenn (which were essentially of straight, cylindrical form), achieving a remarkable thrust augmentation of 2. The measured thrust augmentation is shown as a function of ejector length. Also shown are the thrust augmentation values achieved with the straight, cylindrical ejectors of varying diameters. Here, thrust augmentation is plotted as a function of ejector length for several families of ejector diameters. It can be seen that large thrust augmentation values are indeed obtained and that they are sensitive to both ejector length and diameter, particularly the latter. Five curves are shown. Four correspond to straight ejector diameters of 2. 2, 3. 0, 4. 0, and 6. 0 in. The fifth curve corresponds to the tapered ejector contoured to bound the emitted vortex. For each curve, there are several data points corresponding to different lengths. The largest value of thrust augmentation is 2. 0 for the tapered ejector and 1. 81 for the straight ejectors. Regardless of their diameters, all the ejectors trend toward peak performance at a particular leng. That the cross-sectional dimensions of optimal ejectors scaled precisely with the vortex dimensions on three separate pulsed thrust sources demonstrates that the action of the vortex is responsible for the enhanced ejector performance. The result also suggests that, in the absence of a complete understanding of the entrainment and augmentation mechanisms, methods of characterizing starting vortices may be useful for correlating and predicting unsteady ejector performance...|$|E
40|$|Historically {{aircraft}} noise {{is one of}} the principal environmental issues for aviation. Within this context, the Silent Aircraft Initiative was launched with the objective to achieve a step-change in noise reduction compared to current practice. One of the most critical tasks in noise reduction is to develop technologies to increase drag in quiet ways. The work presented in this thesis focuses primarily on aeroacoustic tests and analysis of perforated drag plates. The idea behind a quiet spoiler or drag rudder is to alter the noise production mechanism by perforating the drag plates. The hypothesis is that the large length scales responsible for the noise radiated by unsteady vortical structures can be changed to small length scales <b>driving</b> <b>jet</b> noise at frequencies which are perceived unannoying by the human ear. The aeroacoustic characteristics of laboratory-scale perforated spoilers were measured in an acoustic chamber at MIT. Based on the experimental data a noise prediction model was developed for the bluff-body and turbulent mixing noise generated by a perforated drag rudder. Acoustic phased array measurements of seven perforated plates in four different installation configurations were conducted in the Markham wind tunnel at Cambridge University to further investigate the noise mechanisms. (cont.) The analysis of the test results showed that there are two identifiable peak frequencies which scale with free stream velocity. Different candidate length scales were investigated with the goal to collapse the data on a Strouhal number basis. However, a universal length scale was not found. It was hypothesized that the noise is mainly due to the isotropic turbulence generated behind such perforated plate. Due to the high background noise levels in the experiments the impact of the perforations on the low frequency noise signature could not be assessed. A perforated plate of 28 : 19 % porosity with a hole diameter to plate length ratio d/L of 0 : 013 and a non- dimensional hole separation s/L of 0 : 0217 was identified to be the most beneficial plate in terms of noise reduction. The experiments showed that a spoiler mounted on the suction surface of the wing is the quietest configuration. In order to scale the results to full size, the observed peak magnitudes are suggested to scale with the 4 th power of the free stream velocity. In addition, the overall sound pressure levels were found to scale with plate size such that an increase in source area causes an equivalent increase in the acoustic power. (cont.) The developed models were used to predict the noise signature of a full sized drag rudder which enabled a 6 ⁰ glide slope angle resulting in a 4 dBA reduction in cumulative sound pressure level of the candidate SAX 10 Silent Aircraft design. by Kiril Dimitrov Sakaliyski.

40|$|A direct aeroacoustic {{simulation}} methodology {{is developed}} {{on the basis}} of the numerical schemes implemented in the commercial tool ANSYS CFX. The focus lies upon the efficient and direct numerical prediction of the flow-induced noise generated by natural gas and pneumatic applications. The respective compressed gas related components are characterized by tiny supersonic gas jets, strong noise emissions, poor accessibility by measurement techniques and excessive simulation costs in particular. Highly resolved computational grids close to DNS requirements become necessary just in order to capture the time-averaged flow profile, tiny shocks and gradients correctly. Furthermore the coexistent supersonic flow velocity results in an exceptionally small timestepping in compliance with the CFL condition, e. g. for LES aeroacoustic simulations. Considering the assumably nonlinear noise propagation and the acoustic feedback within enclosed environments the well-established hybrid approaches cannot be employed here as well. The flow and acoustics of the whole domain rather have to be captured within a single tool instead. In fact, the corresponding simulation costs inhibit the numerical prediction and reduction of the emitted noise levels for those compressed gas components at the industrial scale. In this work the test subject is a dedicated natural gas injector in an open and a confined environment and with varying boundary conditions. Specific to the injector nozzle, four under-expanded supersonic gas jets (M= 1. 4, Re= 30000) are formed and cause a strong flow three-dimensionality. Furthermore a turbulence cluster establishes between the jets <b>driving</b> <b>jet</b> fluctuations and aeroacoustics. To enable aeroacoustic simulations in the first place, ANSYS CFX is augmented by a transient inlet boundary condition and a non-reflective farfield boundary condition based on an implicit damping sponge layer. In order to reduce the simulation costs the scale-adaptive turbulence model (SAS-SST) recently implemented in ANSYS CFX is validated for the gas injection problem and especially for CFL numbers much larger than one. Since a degrading solution quality has to be expected then a timestep study is conducted in order to detect the limit for aeroacoustic simulations. Bottom line the different turbulence modeling allows a strongly increased global timestepping such that a net simulation costs reduction by a factor of 19 compared to LES is achieved. In spite of the generally lower solution quality the predicted noise levels, spectral distributions as well as noise sensitivities are in well agreement with own experimental data. In an alternative simulation approach the research code NSDG 2 D is applied to a simplified 2 D setup with very promising results. The more sophisticated solver numerics based on an explicit Discontinuous Galerkin scheme allows local dynamic adaption to the problem, amongst others by local timestepping and locally adaptive element orders. These features prove to be feasible especially for locally varying unsteady compressible flows and the supersonic gas injection in particular. Considering these advantages a further reasonable simulation costs reduction compared to ANSYS CFX can be projected for the 3 D application as well. Auf Grundlage der numerischen Verfahren innerhalb des kommerziellen Strömungslösers ANSYS CFX wird eine Simulationsmethodik mit Fokus auf die effiziente und direkte numerische Vorhersage strömungsbedingten Schalls für Erdgas- und Pneumatik-Anwendungen entwickelt. Die entsprechenden gasführenden Komponenten sind insbesondere durch kleine Überschallgasstrahlen, starke Lärmemissionen, schlechte messtechnische Zugänglichkeit und extreme Aeroakustik-Simulationsanforderungen gekennzeichnet. Hochaufgelöste Gitter an der Grenze zur DNS-Qualität sind notwendig, nur um das gemittelte Strahlprofil mit seinen sehr kleinen Stößen und Scherschichten richtig abzubilden. Unter Einhaltung der CFL Bedingung führen die gleichzeitig sehr hohen Strömungsgeschwindigkeiten weiterhin zu außerordentlich kleinen Zeitschrittweiten, u. a. für LES Simulationen. Aufgrund der zu erwartenden nichtlinearen Schallausbreitung und den Rückkopplungen in einer umschlossenen Umgebung sind etablierte hybride Ansätze hier nicht anwendbar. Vielmehr muß die Strömung und Akustik des gesamten Problems in einem einzigen Tool abgebildet werden. Die daraus resultierenden Simulationskosten verhindern die industrielle Anwendung numerischer Methoden zur Vorhersage und Reduktion des strömungsinduzierten Lärms für solche Komponenten. Das Testbeispiel in dieser Arbeit ist ein spezieller Erdgas-Injektor in offener und umschlossener Freistrahlanordnung und mit variierenden Umgebungsrandbedingungen. Spezifisch für den Injektor ist seine besondere Düsengeometrie. Sie formt vier stark dreidimensionale unterexpandierte Überschallgasstrahlen (M= 1. 4, Re= 30000) und einen Turbulenzballen zwischen ihnen, der die Strahlen zu Schwingungen anregt und so die Lärmemissionen treibt. Um Aeroakustiksimulationen überhaupt erst zu ermöglichen, wird ANSYS CFX mit einem transienten Inlet und einer nicht-reflektierenden Fernfeld-Randbedingung auf Basis einer impliziten Sponge Layer erweitert. Zur Reduktion der Simulationskosten wird das seit kurzem in ANSYS CFX implementierte skalen-adaptive Turbulenzmodell (SAS-SST) für dieses Beispiel und insbesondere für CFL Zahlen deutlich größer als eins validiert. Aufgrund der dann abnehmenden Lösungsqualität wird eine Zeitschrittstudie durchgeführt, um die Grenzen für die Lärmvorhersage zu bestimmen. Im Ergebnis erlaubt die geänderte Turbulenzmodellierung eine deutlich vergrößerte globale Zeitschrittweite und damit eine Reduktion des Simulationsaufwandes um den Faktor 19 gegenüber LES. Trotz der allgemein schlechteren Lösungsqualität stimmen die simulativ ermittelten Lärmpegel, Spektren und Sensitivitäten gut mit eigenen Messungen überein. In einem alternativen Simulationsansatz wird der Forschungscode NSDG 2 D auf ein vereinfachtes 2 D-Problem angewendet. Die fortschrittlichere Numerik auf Basis eines expliziten Discontinuous Galerkin Verfahrens erlaubt die lokale dynamische Anpassung an das Problem, unter anderem mit lokalen Zeitschrittweiten und lokal adaptiven Elementordnungen. Es wird gezeigt, dass diese Fähigkeiten sich insbesondere bei instationären und lokal stark variierenden kompressiblen Gasströmungen wie der Gasinjektion auszahlen. Damit kann eine weitere deutliche Reduktion der Simulationskosten im Vergleich zu ANSYS CFX auch in 3 D angenommen werden...|$|E

50|$|The game also {{includes}} vehicle sections, where Drake must protect the jeep he and Elena are in using a mounted turret, and where Drake and Elena ride a jet ski along water-filled routes while avoiding enemy fire and explosive barrels. While players direct Drake in <b>driving</b> the <b>jet</b> ski, {{they may also}} switch to Elena by aiming the gun {{in order to use}} her weapon — either the grenade launcher or the Beretta, depending on the chapter — in defense, or to clear the barrels from their path.|$|R

50|$|Many Manhattan and West Side {{residents}} did {{not want}} the inconvenience, traffic congestion and resource drain that they believed the Olympics would bring to the already overcrowded city. The New York Daily News reported that 59% of New Yorkers were not in favor of holding the Olympics in New York at all. In December 2004, the commuter advocacy groups Straphangers Campaign and Tri-State Transportation Campaign filed a lawsuit which challenged the city's estimate that 70% of stadium patrons would use mass transit or arrive on foot instead of <b>driving.</b> Many <b>Jets</b> fans wanted the stadium built, no matter what the cost.|$|R
50|$|Rohr Industries became {{involved}} in SES history in 1970, taking over the XR-1 test program for the Navy. Rohr continued to use the XR-1 to test propulsion and seal concepts. Their eventual goal {{was to develop a}} 3000-ton (3,050 tonne) SES, the LSES (Large Surface Effect Ship), capable of utilizing vertical launch missile systems and anti-submarine helicopters & various VTOL aircraft. The proposed ship was to be capable of 80 knots in sea-state 6 conditions. The proposed main power units were to be 4 40,000hp gas turbine engines <b>driving</b> water <b>jet</b> propulsors. The 3000-ton ship development contract was canceled in 1980.|$|R
50|$|The boats of the Series I are of 24m {{long with}} a mono hull with a {{vibration-free}} deck, powered by twin MTU main engines developing 1,630 kW each, <b>driving</b> Kamewa water <b>jets.</b> This enables {{the boat to}} reach speeds of 45 knots and have an endurance of 500 nm. It has a crew of 10.|$|R
50|$|With the <b>Jets</b> <b>driving</b> for a score, Ross struck again, intercepting Pennington and {{returned}} it 43 yards to clinch the win. Brandon Jacobs notched his first ever 100-yard rushing performance, Manning managed 186 yards and 2 touchdowns despite a poor first half, Osi Umenyiora added a sack and Sam Madison added his first interception of the season.|$|R
40|$|We present 16 GHz (1. 9 cm) deep radio {{continuum}} observations {{made with}} the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) of a sample of low-mass young stars <b>driving</b> <b>jets.</b> We combine these new data with archival information from an extensive literature search to examine spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for each source and calculate both the radio and sub-mm spectral indices in two different scenarios: (1) fixing the dust temperature (T_d) according to evolutionary class; and (2) allowing T_d to vary. We use {{the results of this}} analysis to place constraints on the physical mechanisms responsible for the radio emission. From AMI data alone, as well as from model fitting to the full SED in both scenarios, we find that 80 per cent of the objects in this sample have spectral indices consistent with free–free emission. We find an average spectral index in both T_d scenarios, consistent with free–free emission. We examine correlations of the radio luminosity with bolometric luminosity, envelope mass and outflow force, and find that these data are consistent with the strong correlation with envelope mass seen in lower luminosity samples. We examine the errors associated with determining the radio luminosity and find that the dominant source of error is the uncertainty on the opacity index, β. We examine the SEDs for variability in these young objects, and find evidence for possible radio flare events in the histories of L 1551 IRS 5 and Serpens SMM 1...|$|R
