40|$|The ALPHA {{collaboration}} aims {{to determine}} α_s(m_Z) {{with a total}} error below the percent level. A further step towards this goal can be taken by combining results from the recent simulations of 2 + 1 -flavour QCD by the CLS initiative {{with a number of}} tools developed over the years: renormalized couplings in finite volume schemes, recursive finite size techniques, two-loop renormalized perturbation theory and the (improved) gradient flow on the lattice. We sketch the strategy, which involves both the standard SF coupling in the high energy regime and a gradient <b>flow</b> <b>coupling</b> at low energies. This implies the need for matching both schemes at an intermediate switching scale, L_ swi, which we choose roughly in the range 2 - 4 GeV. In this contribution we present a preliminary result for this matching procedure, and we then focus on our almost final results for the scale evolution of the SF coupling from L_ swi towards the perturbative regime, where we extract the N_ f = 3 Λ-parameter, Λ_ MS^N_ f= 3, in units of L_ swi. Connecting L_ swi and thus the Λ-parameter to a hadronic scale such as F_K requires 2 further ingredients: first, the connection of L_ swi to L_ max using a few steps with the step-scaling function of the gradient <b>flow</b> <b>coupling,</b> and, second, the continuum extrapolation of L_ max F_K...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Laser-speckle flowmetry {{was used}} to {{characterize}} activation <b>flow</b> <b>coupling</b> after electrical somatosensory stimulation of forepaw and hindpaw in the rat. Quantification of functional activation was made with high transverse spatial (�m) and temporal (msec) resolution. Different activation levels and duration of stimulation were quantitatively investigated, and were in good agreement with previous laser-Doppler measurements. Interestingly, the magnitude but not the overall shape of the response was found to scale with stimulus amplitude and {{the distance from the}} activation centroid. The results provide new insights about the spatial characteristics of cerebral blood flow response to functional activation, and the method should lead to improved understanding of the coupling of neuronal activity and hemodynamics under normal and pathologic conditions. Key Words: Laser speckle—Somatosensory cortex—Activation flow coupling— Flowmetry—Functional imaging—Cerebral blood flow. The coupling between functional stimulation and regional changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), often referred to as activation <b>flow</b> <b>coupling</b> (AFC), has been known for over a century, but is still poorly understood (Lou et al., 1987; Villringer and Dirnagl, 1995). Because most neuroimaging methods rely on AFC as an indicator of neuronal activity, a detailed characterization of AFC under normal conditions will improve understanding of normal as well as pathologic brain physiology.

40|$|Mathematical {{models are}} now gaining in {{importance}} for descriptions of biological processes. In this thesis, such {{models have been}} used to identify and analyze principles that govern bacterial protein synthesis under amino acid limitation. New techniques, that are generally applicable for analysis of intrinsic fluctuations in systems of chemical reactions, are also presented. It is shown how multi-substrate reactions, such as protein synthesis, may display zero order kinetics below saturation, because an increase in one substrate pool is compensated by a decrease in another, so that the overall flow is unchanged. Under those conditions, metabolite pools display hyper sensitivity and large fluctuations, unless metabolite synthesis is carefully regulated. It is demonstrated that <b>flow</b> <b>coupling</b> in protein synthesis has consequences for transcriptional control of amino acid biosynthetic operons, accuracy of mRNA translation and the stringent response. <b>Flow</b> <b>coupling</b> also determines the choices of synonymous codons in a number of cases. The reason is that tRNA isoacceptors, cognate to the same amino acid, often read different codons and become deacylated to very different degrees when their amino acid is limiting for protein synthesis. This was demonstrated theoretically and used to successfully predict the choices of control codons in ribosome mediated transcriptional attenuation and codon bias in stress response genes. New tools for the analysis of internal fluctuations have been forged, most importantly, an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for simulation of the Markov-process corresponding to the reaction-diffusion master equation. The algorithm makes it feasible to analyze stochastic kinetics in spatially extended systems. It was used to demonstrate that bi-stable chemical systems can display spontaneous domain separation also in three spatial dimensions. This analysis reveals geometrical constraints on biochemical memory circuits built from bistable systems.

40|$|The fast, {{bistable}} electro-optic {{response of}} {{ferroelectric liquid crystal}} (FLC) devices has made them prime candidates for use in display applications. However, before these applications can become widely commercially viable {{a number of key}} issues relating to the switching within these devices need to be addressed. One of these is related to the fact that while there has been much work done on modelling the switching process in FLC devices, with some moderate success, in the main these models have not accurately accounted for the physical processes taking place. In order to rectify this situation we present a simple, multi-variable approach which includes important physical phenomenon such as stressed states, partial and domain switching. Through using this model we learn more about the dynamic molecular profiles which may exist in devices, and use this as a springboard to undertake a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study of the molecular profiles of chevron structures under different types of addressing pulses and voltages. This entails modelling the dynamic profiles using a simple non flow reorientation theory and comparing these simulations directly with experimental data obtained through the use of two different optical characterisation techniques. Our findings show quite conclusively that for monopolar addressing within low and high voltage regimes and for low voltage bipolar pulses during the early stages of switching, the dynamic reorientation near the surfaces and central regions of the device lags the reorientation within the bulk. The reverse however being true for the high voltage bipolar addressing case. These results for chevron structures differ from previous theoretical predictions made by others using equations derived from the <b>flow</b> <b>coupled</b> chiral smectic C continuum theory. These <b>flow</b> <b>coupled</b> simulations however, refer to reorientation in bookshelf structures rather than the chevron type structures thought to exist in FLC devices. As such, in order to determine and compare the molecular profiles in real device structures for non flow and flow cases, we derive {{for the first time the}} complete governing equations for <b>flow</b> <b>coupled</b> reorientation within chevron layers. Through modelling we find that <b>flow</b> <b>coupled</b> reorientation in chevron structures actually follows closely simulations made using non flow reorientation theories.
