5|$|After the Norman Conquest of 1066, {{the manor}} of Clevedon was {{granted by the}} King to Matthew de Mortagne, who in turn granted <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sub-tenant, Hildebert. It is thought that Sir John was a {{descendant}} of either Matthew or Hildebert. Perhaps because of {{the distance to the}} parish church, the manor house included a chapel dedicated, in the 1320s, to Saint Peter. The house has undergone considerable change since it was built, almost every century seeing structural alterations, but it still retains many features of a mediaeval manor house.|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} wreaked during the succession wars between Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, Pompey restored {{the independence of}} Azotus, {{as he did with}} all Hellenising coastal cities (Antiquities Book 14, 4:4). A few years later, in 55 BCE, after more fighting, Roman general Gabinius helped rebuild Ashdod and several other cities left without protective walls (Antiquities Book 14, 5:2). In 30 BCE Ashdod came under the rule of King Herod, who then bequeathed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sister Salome (Antiquities Book 17, 8:1). By the time of the First Jewish–Roman War (66-70), {{there must have been a}} large enough Jewish presence in Ashdod for Vespasian to feel compelled to place a garrison in the city.|$|E
5|$|After the {{financial}} success of Saw, a sequel was immediately green-lit. Leigh Whannell and James Wan were busy preparing {{for their next}} film and were unable to write or direct. Bousman wrote a script called The Desperate before Saw was released and {{was looking for a}} producer but many studios rejected it. Hoffman received the script and showed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules. It was decided that, with some changes, it could be made into Saw II. Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script. The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1956 he was {{selected}} at the Staff School run by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). His first trip outside Nigeria {{was an opportunity to}} advance his technical production skills, and to solicit feedback on his novel (which was later split into two books). In London, he met a novelist named Gilbert Phelps, to whom he offered the manuscript. Phelps responded with great enthusiasm, asking Achebe if he could show <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> editor and publishers. Achebe declined, insisting that it needed more work.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus grandis {{was named}} in 1877 by Marsh {{in the article}} that {{described}} A.ajax. It was briefly described, figured, and diagnosed. Marsh later mentioned it was only provisionally assigned to Apatosaurus when he reassigned <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> new genus Morosaurus in 1878. Since Morosaurus has been considered a synonym of Camarasaurus, C.grandis is the oldest-named species of the latter genus.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} December 1883, a {{humpback}} whale appeared in the Firth of Tay off Dundee, attracting much local interest. It was harpooned, but after an all-night struggle escaped. A week later it was found dead, and was towed on to the beach at Stonehaven, near Aberdeen. Struthers quickly visited the carcass, measuring it as 40 feet long with a tail 11 feet 4 inches wide. Struthers {{was not able to}} start dissecting it at once, as a local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale and took <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> yard in Dundee, where on the first Sunday, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E

In 1870, German mycologist Fuckel {{transferred}} <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> newly described genus Pseudoplectania, and made it the type species. The species was ulteriorly placed in Crouania by Friedrich August Hazslinszky von Hazslin, and in Plectania by Petter Karsten (1885), but neither placement is considered correct.|$|E

By the fourth season, Chuck is a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent and is engaged {{to one of his}} handlers, Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski).|$|E
5|$|Corder's {{skeleton}} was put {{on display}} in a glass case in the West Suffolk Hospital, and apparently was rigged with a mechanism that made its arm point to the collection box when approached. Eventually, the skull was removed by Dr John Kilner, who wanted to add <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> extensive collection of Red Barn memorabilia. After a series of unfortunate events, he became convinced that the skull was cursed and handed it on to a friend named Hopkins. Further disasters plagued both men, and they finally paid for the skull {{to be given a}} Christian burial in an attempt to lift the supposed curse.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1503, Leonardo had no income source, which may in part explain his {{interest}} in a private portrait. But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on Mona Lisa when he received payment for starting The Battle of Anghiari, which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February of 1505. In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished. He was not paid for the work and did not deliver <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> client. The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life, {{and he may have}} completed Mona Lisa many years later in France, in one estimation by 1516.|$|E

5|$|Giridhar's initial {{education}} {{came from his}} paternal grandfather, as his father worked in Bombay. In the afternoons, his grandfather would narrate to him various episodes of the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, and devotional works like Vishramsagar, Sukhsagar, Premsagar, and Brajvilas. At the age of three, Giridhar composed his first piece of poetry—in Awadhi (a dialect of Hindi)—and recited <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> grandfather.
