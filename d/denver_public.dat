25|$|Kees’s worldview {{and writing}} were shaped by his Jazz Age childhood, and his early {{adulthood}} during the Great Depression. By {{the time he}} {{graduated from high school}} in 1931, he rejected entering the family business and, while at Doane College, decided to become a novelist. It was for this reason that he transferred to the University of Missouri, which had a writing program, and then to the University of Nebraska, where he was mentored by the founding editor of graduating Prairie Schooner, Lowery C. Wimberley. By the time Kees graduated in 1935, he had already written and published short stories in that journal as well as other literary magazine such as Horizon and Rocky Mountain Review. While working for the Federal Writers' Project in Lincoln, Nebraska, and after having suffered the rejection of several novels, Kees turned to writing poetry—and, for a time, engaged in union organizing and considered himself a communist. In 1937, Kees moved to Denver to earn a degree in library science at the University of Denver, which included working as a librarian at the <b>Denver</b> <b>Public</b> Library. He then became director of the Bibliographical Center of Research for the Rocky Mountain Region, which was used as a model for a national union catalog. That same year he married Ann Swan.|$|E

[...] In 1974 the Regional Transportation District took over responsibility for <b>Denver's</b> <b>public</b> transportation. During this period a [...] "brown cloud" [...] began to form over the Front Range, a result of air pollution from the increasing number of cars and people in the area.
