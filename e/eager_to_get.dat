5|$|Jeff, <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away, {{deliberately}} stirs a fight {{among the}} group, then leaves {{once more to}} get the test answers. Dr. Duncan hands him a sealed envelope, but only in return for Jeff's Lexus. When Jeff returns, the group is in turmoil, and Britta promises {{to go out with}} him if he can restore order. He does this through an inspirational speech, but Britta sees through his lies and asks him to leave. Jeff then comes clean about everything, adding that since he now has the test answers he does not need the study group. As the group turns against him he leaves.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{beginning}} principal photography, Refn {{went to the}} 2010 Cannes Film Festival to sell the rights to Drive and released promotional posters for the film. In November 2010, FilmDistrict acquired North American distribution rights. The owners were so <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their hands on Drive, they started negotiating to buy it before seeing any footage, believing it could appeal to people who enjoy a genre movie, {{as well as the}} arthouse crowd. The film had a release date of September 16, 2011, in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Severine Silva {{points out}} that the Christians of Canara were <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of Tipu. The History of the Diocese of Mangalore by J. Moore and Angelus Francis Xavier Maffei also purports to show that the Christians of Canara were charged with {{assisting}} the British during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Tipu made a number of accusations against the Christians, including that they had invited the British to invade Canara in 1781–82, furnished supplies to and otherwise assisted General Matthews' army when it landed and took possession of Onore, accompanied the British detachment to Mangalore, provided it with supplies {{both before and after the}} march, aided the British in repairing breaches made when the fort was besieged by Tipu and plundered the state treasury at Nuggur when that fortress fell to General Matthews.|$|E
5|$|Despite this recognition, the {{increasing}} debts of the MDHB meant {{that by the}} 1960s the company was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of the Albert Dock. Having considered demolishing the buildings and redeveloping the land, the MDHB soon entered negotiations to sell the land to Oldham Estates, a property developer owned by Harry Hyams. Many plans for the site were developed including one that envisioned {{the development of a}} mini city that would provide 10m sq feet of letting space, hotels, restaurants, bars and underground parking in the drained dock basin. With the council reluctant to allow such a grandiose development to occur and with the huge public opposition to it (inspired at least in part by the work of Quentin Hughes), Oldham Estates were forced into scaling-down the plan and so in 1970 returned with a new vision known as 'Aquarius City', which had as its centrepiece a 44-storey skyscraper. Once again the plan failed to develop and no sooner had it been announced, than the MDHB's financial problems reached crisis point, Oldham Estates withdrew their deposit and the whole scheme fell through.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the Korean War, the Korean Peninsula was split by an American-backed {{government}} at the south and a Soviet-backed opposing government at the north. Divided by the 38th Parallel, both the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to maintain the division until a mutual decision was made {{about the future of the}} peninsula. On 25 June 1950, North Korean troops crossed the parallel and attacked several key South Korean targets. As the United States prepared military assistance with the South Koreans, the Soviet Union also helped the North Koreans by training pilots and providing MiG-15 aircraft. Jabara arrived in Korea on 13 December 1950 with the 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. The squadron was the first F-86 Sabre unit deployed to the Fifth Air Force to counter the threat by the Soviet MiG-15s. By 2 January 1951, he had flown five combat missions in F-86s and had damaged one MiG-15 Korean jet fighter in air combat. Jabara achieved his first confirmed victory on 3 April 1951 when 12 F-86 Sabres took on 12 MiG-15s in MiG Alley, a region in northwestern North Korea. He was credited with another on 10 April, a third on 12 April, and a fourth on 22 April. <b>Eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his fifth victory to be deemed a flying ace, Jabara voluntarily transferred to the 335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron when the 334th was rotated back to the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally {{gave him a}} purpose in life and allowed him to {{make good use of}} his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first group of Americans to do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker was told that he had to be {{certified}} by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he had learned in England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into the front lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and doubted he would ever get to the front. While in Paris, he was happy to continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan did {{not take}} to his new posting and was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to the action. MacLachlan volunteered for service with RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain which had begun in July 1940. He learned on the 18 August {{that he had been}} one of five pilots chosen from 88 Squadron to retrain as fighter pilots. He was posted to RAF Drem for {{training}} with No. 145 Squadron. He flew a Hawker Hurricane fighter for the first time days later on 22 August. Within nine days he had logged 18 hours in the type. On 3 September he was given official leave to travel to London. There he received his DFC at Buckingham Palace. He returned to No. 145 shortly afterwards and was based at RAF Tangmere, Croydon and Westhampnett. No. 11 Group RAF was {{in the thick of the}} fighting and suffered many casualties. MacLachlan and his group were to replace the many pilots killed or wounded. MacLachlan practiced operational take-offs, fighter tactics, radio control, break-aways and dogfights—the essence of air-to-air combat. He was sent on patrols on 30 August, but only over Scotland, to guard against attacks from Luftflotte 5 (Air Fleet 5) based in Norway. No interceptions were made as air combat was rare in the north. On 21 September MacLachlan survived a force-landing at Dyce, caused by an oil leak. On 27 September 1940 MacLachlan was posted to the south at Debden, arriving two days later. He was then assigned to No. 73 Squadron RAF at RAF Castle Camps.|$|E

50|$|Reorganized, the NALL {{returned}} for the 2013 season with three new full-time members, the Boston Rockhoppers (who participated {{in two games}} of the 2012 exhibition season), Baltimore Bombers, and the Rhode Island Kingfish. The league was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> finally <b>get</b> things going with their first normal season, and the first season where the league was housed {{in more than one}} venue. Kentucky struggled in the regular season, posting a 2-6 record, but still found themselves taking on the Rockhoppers in the first ever league championship.|$|R

25|$|Harold Montgomery allied {{himself with}} newly elected Governor Edwin Washington Edwards, {{who had been}} Montgomery's state Senate {{colleague}} in 1964 and 1965. Edwards had personally befriended Harold Montgomery, and Montgomery was hence <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along with the new governor, considering his earlier differences with McKeithen. Edwards was a pallbearer at Montgomery's funeral; Montgomery died in the final months of Edwards' fourth gubernatorial term.|$|E
25|$|Thomas {{received}} his commission {{and took the}} two required oaths several days after the Senate vote; this process was delayed {{by the death of}} Chief Justice Rehnquist's wife, but the delay was reduced at the request of Thomas. He indicated that he was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to work, and an additional reason for reducing the delay was to end further media inquiry into Thomas's private life. Reporters largely stopped such inquiries after Thomas joined the court. Throughout this episode, Thomas defended his right to privacy, refused to describe discussions that he may have had outside the workplace regarding his personal life, and promised that he would not allow anyone to probe his private life.|$|E

25|$|Statehood was {{regarded}} as fairly imminent, as during {{the run-up to the}} 1864 presidential election the Republican–controlled Congress was actually <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> two more Republican senators and three more electoral votes for President Lincoln's re-election bid. Territorial Governor John Evans persuaded Congress to adopt an enabling act, but a majority of the 6,192 Coloradoans who voted, in a population of around 35,000, turned down the first attempt at a state constitution and the second attempt at statehood. Later, at the end of 1865, territorial ambitions for statehood were thwarted again, this time by a veto by President Andrew Johnson. Statehood for the territory was a recurring issue during the Ulysses Grant administration, with Grant advocating statehood against a less willing Congress during Reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|Farnsworth {{reached the}} area at {{approximately}} 1:00 p.m., {{about the time}} the massive Confederate artillery barrage started in preparation for Pickett's Charge, and his 1,925 troops took up a position in a line south of the George Bushman farm. From left to right, the regiments were the 18th Pennsylvania Cavalry, the 1st West Virginia and 1st Vermont. Battery E, 4th U.S. Artillery, occupied a small, rocky knoll in the rear and the 5th New York cavalry was placed in a nearby ravine to guard the artillery. Joined by Kilpatrick, they awaited Merritt's brigade, which arrived at about 3:00 p.m. and took up a position straddling the Emmitsburg Road, to Farnsworth's left. By this time the infantry portion of Pickett's Charge had begun, and Kilpatrick was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his men into the fight.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{command and}} unit leadership. An inDuna guided each regiment, and he in turn {{answered}} to senior izinduna who controlled the corps grouping. Overall {{guidance of the}} host was furnished by elder izinduna usually with many years of experience. One {{or more of these}} elder chiefs might accompany a big force on an important mission. Coordination of tactical movements was supplied by the indunas who used hand signals and messengers. Generally before deploying for battle, the regiments were made to squat in a semicircle while these commanders made final assignments and adjustments. Lower level regimental izinduna, like the NCOs of today's armies, and yesterday's Roman centurions, were extremely important to morale and discipline. Prior to the clash at Isandhlwana for example, they imposed order on the frenzied rush of warriors <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at the British, and steadied those faltering under withering enemy fire during the battle.|$|E
25|$|However, the Berlin S-Bahn strike {{brought the}} S-Bahn to the {{attention}} of the public, and aroused the desire to for West Berlin to manage its section of the S-Bahn itself. In 1983 negotiations of representatives of the Senate, the SNB and the Deutsche Reichsbahn took place. In December 1983, these were concluded with Allied consent to the agreement between the Deutsche Reichsbahn and the Berlin Senate for the transfer of operating rights of the S-Bahn in the area of West Berlin. The BVG received the oldest carriages from the DR; but the BVG was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>get</b> <b>to</b> modern standards for a subway. Therefore, soon new S-Bahn trains were purchased on their behalf, which are still in use on the Berlin S-Bahn network as the 480 series.|$|R

25|$|The main feud for the SmackDown! brand {{was between}} Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship. In the {{beginning}} of 2004, Angle and Guerrero were allies while Guerrero feuded with his nephew Chavo Guerrero. On SmackDown! on January 29, Eddie Guerrero last eliminated Angle in a 15-man Royal Rumble style match to earn {{a shot at the}} WWE Championship. At the prior pay per view, No Way Out, Kurt Angle defeated The Big Show and John Cena in a Triple threat match to earn himself a title shot at WrestleMania on the same event where Guerrero defeated Brock Lesnar for the WWE title. On the February 19 episode of SmackDown!, Angle was the special guest referee in a match between WWE Champion, Eddie Guerrero and WWE Cruiserweight Champion, Chavo Guerrero. As Eddie was about to close in on the victory, Angle stopped the 3 count and would turn on Guerrero. On the following week's SmackDown!, Guerrero was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his revenge on Angle while looking for him but when he finally saw Angle, he shoved SmackDown General Manager, Paul Heyman and his assistant Dawn Marie out of his way only for Heyman to have Guerrero escorted out of the arena by security. Guerrero was scheduled to team with John Cena to take on Chavo Guerrero and the Big Show in a tag team match on that night but due to Guerrero being escorted out of the arena, he was replaced by Rey Mysterio for the tag match, which Mysterio and Cena won. Later that night, Angle appeared and stated that he attacked Guerrero for the SmackDown! fans and for the WWE. He then referred to Guerrero as a former drug addict that shouldn't represent SmackDown! as the WWE Champion and stated that one day people would be thanking him for a champion to be proud of. Guerrero then re-entered the arena and assaulted Angle until he got arrested by orders of Paul Heyman. As Guerrero got taken out of the building in handcuffs, Angle made some insulting comments to him before the officers drove away with Guerrero in the Police car. On the March 4 episode of SmackDown!, during Guerrero's match with Heyman (while he was handcuffed), Angle interfered and knocked him down a few times until Guerrero defended himself by spitting on Angle. As Guerrero begged Angle to nail him with the WWE Championship belt, Angle did so and raised title the belt overhead to hype their match at Wrestlemania XX.|$|E
