5|$|During the war RAF Uxbridge was {{tasked with}} <b>despatching</b> {{personnel}} {{to and from}} training and operational units in Northern France. It also housed the RAF Uxbridge Language School, where Polish Air Force pilots were taught key RAF codewords. Pilots practised formation flying on the station football pitch, using tricycles fitted with radios, compasses and speed indicators. British Expeditionary Force troops returning from Dunkirk were processed at Uxbridge. In mid-1940, staff at the station processed an average of 2,500 recruits and experienced troops per week.|$|E
5|$|The British {{presence}} in the Adriatic was greatly strengthened in 1809 {{with the arrival of}} the frigates HMS Amphion under William Hoste and HMS Belle Poule under James Brisbane. These reinforcements made an immediate impact with a series of raids in the Dalmatian and Ionian islands. In February Belle Poule captured the Var off Valona; the French responded by <b>despatching</b> the frigates Danaé and Flore from Toulon. HMS Topaze attacked these frigates as they arrived, but were able to reach Corfu before sailing north to augment French defences in the Adriatic.|$|E

5|$|No. 3 Aircraft Depot (No.3AD) {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, on 16March 1942. It {{came under the}} control of No.5 (Maintenance) Group. The depot's first, temporary, {{commanding}} officer was Squadron Leader W.H. Nicholson. On establishment, No.3AD's main purpose was the assembly and despatch of combat aircraft manufactured in the United States. In its first six weeks of operation, it assembled 123 Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters and a dozen Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers. The depot was also responsible for the inspection of RAAF CAC Wirraways and Lockheed Hudsons. A further role was salvaging damaged aircraft from units in the local area, and <b>despatching</b> them to No.5 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Station Wagga, New South Wales, for repair.|$|E
5|$|Tom Johnson (born Tom Jackling; c.1750– 21 January 1797) was a bare-knuckle fighter who was {{referred}} to as the Champion of England between 1784 and 1791. His involvement in pugilistic prizefighting is generally seen to have coincided with a renewed interest in the sport. Although a strong man, his success was largely attributed to his technical abilities and his calm, analytical approach to <b>despatching</b> his opponents. But Johnson was less prudent outside the ring; he was a gambler and considered by many of his acquaintances to be an easy mark. He is thought to have earned more money from the sport than any other fighter until nearly a century later, but much of it was squandered.|$|E
5|$|Hautpoult {{had fought}} hard during the {{engagement}} and was badly damaged, suffering between 80 and 90 casualties. Pompee was also badly damaged, losing nine killed and 30 wounded, including Fahie wounded. Other casualties were suffered on Castor, with one killed and five wounded; Neptune one killed and four wounded and Recruit one wounded. In total, British losses were 11 killed and 40 wounded. Cochrane ordered Pompee {{and the newly}} captured French ship back to port, promoting Napier to command the ship of the line for his service on Recruit and <b>despatching</b> York and Captain to hunt for Troude's remaining squadron. Despite their efforts, Troude evaded pursuit and eventually reached Cherbourg in May. In addition to Napier there were further promotions and awards and Hautpoult was taken into the Royal Navy as HMS Abercromby. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.|$|E

5|$|In North Africa, Rhodesians in the 11th Hussars, 2nd Leicesters, 1st Cheshires {{and other}} regiments contributed to Operation Compass between December 1940 and February 1941 {{as part of}} the Western Desert Force under Major-General Richard O'Connor, {{fighting}} at Sidi Barrani, Bardia, Beda Fomm and elsewhere. This offensive was extremely successful, with the Allies suffering very few casualties—around 700 killed and 2,300 wounded and missing—while capturing the strategic port Tobruk, over 100,000 Italian soldiers and most of Cyrenaica. The Germans reacted by <b>despatching</b> the Afrika Korps under Erwin Rommel to shore up the Italian forces. Rommel led a strong counter-offensive in March–April 1941 that forced a general Allied withdrawal towards Egypt. German and Italian forces surrounded Tobruk but failed to take the largely Australian-garrisoned city, leading to the lengthy Siege of Tobruk.|$|E
5|$|Although Bonaparte had not {{expected}} British interference in his operations against Egypt, the Royal Navy had responded to the reports of French mobilisation on the south coast by <b>despatching</b> a small squadron to the Ligurian Sea under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson. Arriving on 21 May, Nelson's squadron {{was struck by a}} severe storm and was forced to make hasty repairs off Sardinia. The storm had also dispersed the squadron's frigates, leaving Nelson with only three ships of the line. Although he was reinforced by another ten ships of the line and a fourth rate on 7 June, he still lacked any scouts and was thus severely hampered in his ability to search for information on French operations. The detached frigates had been scattered across the Western Mediterranean, and were unable to locate either the British or the French fleets. Reinforcements sent by Vice-Admiral Earl St Vincent at the Tagus River suffered from the same problem, the frigates spreading out widely in their search but failing to discover either of the main British or French forces, which were rapidly sailing southeastwards towards Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|Headlam became Officer Commanding North-Western Area in January 1946. Posted to Britain {{at the end}} of the year, he {{attended}} the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and served with RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London. On his return to Australia, in November 1947, he became Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters. In November 1950, Headlam was appointed to take over command of No.90 (Composite) Wing from Group Captain Paddy Heffernan. Headquartered at RAF Changi, Singapore, No.90 Wing controlled RAAF units operating during the Malayan Emergency: No.1 (Bomber) Squadron, flying Avro Lincolns, and No.38 (Transport) Squadron, flying Douglas C-47 Dakotas. The Lincolns conducted area bombing missions over communist-held territory, as well as strikes against pinpoint targets. The Dakotas were tasked with courier flights, VIP transport and medical evacuations across South East Asia, and in Malaya with airlifting troops and cargo, dropping supplies to friendly forces and <b>despatching</b> propaganda leaflets. Headlam was slightly injured on 20December, when a No.38 Squadron Dakota he was co-piloting on a supply drop crash-landed at Kampong Aur in Pahang, following engine failure. In August 1951 he was named commander of RAF Tengah, Singapore, in addition to his post as commanding officer of No.90 Wing. Headlam handed over command of No.90 Wing in December 1951.|$|E

5|$|No.1 AD {{undertook}} {{research and}} development on various aircraft types, including Supermarine Spitfires, CAC Boomerangs, and Wackett Woomeras. It also ran comparative performance studies on Spitfires, Boomerangs, Kittyhawks, Brewster Buffalos, and Mitsubishi Zeros. In {{the case of the}} Boomerang, 105 CA-12 models were delivered to No.1 AD for testing between July 1942 and June 1943. As soon as the aircraft began arriving, the depot commenced handling and armament trials that continued for six months, identifying and overcoming such issues as the aircraft's guns freezing at high altitudes, and unusual levels of carbon monoxide in the cockpit. Fighter aces Alan Rawlinson and Wilfred Arthur, along with a United States Army Air Forces pilot, conducted comparative trials between a Boomerang, a Kittyhawk, a Buffalo, and a Bell Airacobra. The depot began <b>despatching</b> the Boomerangs to their operational units in March 1943, and the following month performance-tested a turbocharged version of the CA-14, though this model never entered production. No.1 AD's Special Duties and Performance Flight was responsible for conducting performance trials during the early war years; in December 1943 it became a separate organisation, No.1 Aircraft Performance Unit, which would evolve into the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) in 1947.|$|E

The Bulgarians were defeated at the Battle of Dobro Pole and by 25 September 1918 British and French troops had crossed the border into Bulgaria proper as the Bulgarian army collapsed. Bulgaria capitulated four days later, on 29 September 1918.

Contact with the German units at Stavanger was eventually achieved by <b>despatching</b> a motorcycle-mounted officer disguised as a civilian. Before the Germans managed to establish control over the areas surrounding the town centre of Egersund, the mobilization depot at Årstaddalen was evacuated by the Norwegians.|$|E

During the emergency, the squadron undertook airstrikes against communist forces and after the conflict ended, it remained in Malaysia throughout the early 1960s during Confrontation, before <b>despatching</b> eight Canberras to South Vietnam in April 1967 as part of Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{agree that}} both strikes were driven by {{legitimate}} grievances: abyssmal {{conditions in the}} relief camps and <b>despatching</b> and other workplace issues on the waterfront.
