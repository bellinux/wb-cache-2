5|$|After {{more than}} 60 years of {{continuous}} operation, the Cacchio family {{decided to sell}} the Theatre. Rather than sell to real estate developers, the Cacchios preferred to transfer the property to the Rosendale Theatre Collective, a nonprofit formed in late 2009 {{for the sole purpose}} of buying and preserving the Theatre. The group spent months raising funds <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> on the building, with the bulk of its money coming from small individual donations.

The Cacchios transferred ownership of the property to the Theatre Collective on August19, 2010. Since its purchase, the Theatre has had several equipment upgrades, including a move to digital cinema.|$|E

50|$|After World War II, Giles {{conceived}} {{of a plan}} to reward Texas' veterans with the ability to buy land at low interest rates subsidized by the taxpayers.

50|$|Some {{forms of}} lease-option {{agreements}} {{have been criticized}} as predatory. For example, sometimes lease-options are offered to tenants who cannot realistically expect to ever exercise the option to purchase.

50|$|New Brooklyn Theatre {{was founded}} {{to restore the}} {{historic}} Slave Theater at 1215 Fulton Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.

5|$|In May 1912, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company {{placed an}} order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for two new cargo ships— and Ohioan.

Maryland Steel financed the construction with a credit plan which called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 5% <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> in cash followed by nine monthly installments for the balance. The deal allowed {{for some of the}} nine installments to be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages.

50|$|Johan Björnsson Printz, {{his wife}} and younger {{children}} returned to Sweden during 1653. The Dutch West India Company subsequently captured the Swedish colony in 1655.
