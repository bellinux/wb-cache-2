My first thought would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, maybe I could <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> record.' The most obvious [...] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an {{original}} idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?" [...] He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.|$|E

"Now," [...] said Austen, with entire good humour, [...] "when you <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> ground, you {{are dealing}} no longer with one {{voracious}} unit, but with a whole profession,--a profession, you will allow me to add, which in dignity is second to none.

6000|$|In the German parks {{there are}} special seats labelled, [...] "Only for grown- ups" [...] (Nur fur Erwachsene), and the German small boy, anxious to sit down, and reading that notice, passes by, and hunts {{for a seat}} on which {{children}} are permitted to rest; and there he seats himself, careful not to touch the woodwork with his muddy boots.

"Well," [...] {{continued}} Herrick, [...] "I had {{no sooner}} {{given him the}} cough mixture than he seemed to straighten up and change, and I saw he wasn't a Tahitian after all, but some kind of Arab, and had a long beard on his chin. 'One good turn deserves another,' says he. 'I am a magician out of the [...] "Arabian Nights," [...] and this mat that I have under my arm is the original carpet of Mohammed Ben Somebody-or-other. Say the word, {{and you can have}} a cruise upon the carpet.' 'You don't mean to say this is the Travelling Carpet?' I cried. 'You bet I do,' said he. 'You've been to America since last I read the [...] "Arabian Nights,"' said I, a little suspicious. 'I should think so,' said he. 'Been everywhere. A man with a carpet like this isn't going to moulder in a semi-detached villa.' Well, that struck me as reasonable. 'All right,' I said; 'and do {{you mean to tell me}} I can <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> carpet and go straight to London, England?' I said 'London, England,' captain, because he seemed to have been so long in your part of the world. 'In the crack of a whip,' said he. I figured up the time.

In my profession, one has to be so careful. Of course, people think it's worse than it is; father gets fits sometimes. But you know, Mrs. Fiorsen, home's awful. We have mutton--you know what mutton is--it's really awful in your bedroom in hot weather. And there's nowhere to practise. What I should like would be a studio. It would be lovely, somewhere down by the river, or up here near you. That WOULD be lovely. You know, I'm putting by. As soon as ever I have two hundred pounds, I shall skip. What I think would be {{perfectly}} lovely would be to inspire painters and musicians. I don't want to be just a common 'turn'--ballet business year after year, and that; I want to be something rather special. But mother's so silly about me; she thinks I oughtn't to take any risks at all. I shall never <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> way. It IS so nice to talk to you, Mrs. Fiorsen, because you're young enough to know what I feel; and I'm sure you'd never be shocked at anything. You see, about men: Ought one to marry, or ought one to take a lover? They say you can't be a perfect artist till you've felt passion. But, then, if you marry, that means mutton over again, and perhaps babies, and perhaps the wrong man after all. Ugh! But then, on the other hand, I don't want to be raffish. I hate raffish people--I simply hate them. What do you think? It's awfully difficult, isn't it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Tracy made slow {{progress}} with his work, for his mind wandered a good deal. Many things were puzzling him. Finally a light burst upon him {{all of a}} sudden--seemed to, at any rate--and he said to himself, [...] "I've got the clew at last--this man's mind is off its balance; I don't know how much, but it's off a point or two, sure; off enough to explain this mess of perplexities, anyway. These dreadful chromos which he takes for old masters; these villainous portraits--which to his frantic mind represent Rossmores; the hatchments; the pompous name of this ramshackle old crib-- Rossmore Towers; and that odd assertion of his, that I was expected. How could I be expected? that is, Lord Berkeley. He knows by the papers that that person was burned up in the New Gadsby. Why, hang it, he really doesn't {{know who he was}} expecting; for his talk showed that he was not expecting an Englishman, or yet an artist, yet I answer his requirements notwithstanding. He seems sufficiently satisfied with me. Yes, he is a little off; in fact I am afraid he is a good deal off, poor old gentleman. But he's interesting--all people in about his condition are, I suppose. I hope he'll like my work; I would like to come every day and study him. And when I write my father--ah, that hurts! I mustn't <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> subject; it isn't good for my spirits. Somebody coming--I must get to work. It's the old gentleman again. He looks bothered. Maybe my clothes are suspicious; and they are--for an artist. If my conscience would allow me to make a change, but that is out of the question. I wonder what he's making those passes in the air for, with his hands. I seem to be the object of them. Can he be trying to mesmerize me? I don't quite like it. There's something uncanny about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Hardy was {{remarking}} {{upon this}} {{one day to}} Mr. Percy, who replied, [...] "Ah, the poor fellows are very unfortunate. They brought out a fair capital, and had as large a stock of sheep and cattle as the Canterbury party have. About six months, however, before you arrived--yes, it's just a year now--the Indians swept down upon them, and carried off every animal they had. They attacked the house, but the Jamiesons defended themselves well; and the Indians were anxious to get off with their booty, and so they beat a retreat. Pursuit was hopeless; every horse had been driven off, {{and they had to}} walk six miles to the next hacienda to give the news; and long before a party could be got together the Indians were beyond the possibility of pursuit. Two or three hundred sheep and a dozen or two of the bullocks found their way back, and these and their land was all that remained to the Jamiesons of their capital, for they had invested all they had in their stock. However, they looked affairs manfully in the face, sold their animals, bought a couple of plows and draught bullocks, hired a peon or two, and set to work with a will. They will get on but slowly for a time; but I have no doubt that they will do well {{in the course of a}} few years. Men with their pluck and perseverance are certain to <b>get</b> <b>on.</b> <b>That</b> puts me in mind, Hardy, of a matter upon which I had intended to speak to you. We are just getting now to the time of the year when Indian attacks are most likely to take place. Sometimes they are quiet for a year or two, then they are very troublesome again. Five or six years ago, just after I first came out, we had terrible times with them. Vast numbers of cattle were driven off: the sheep they less seldom take, because they cannot travel so fast, but they do drive them off sometimes. A good many shepherds were killed, and two or three estancias captured and burned, and the inmates murdered. You are now the furthest settler, and consequently the most exposed. Your estancia is strong and well built, and you are all well armed and good shots. You are, I think, in that respect safe, except from sudden surprise. The dogs are sure to give an alarm; still I should sleep with everything in readiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile {{the unfortunate}} {{subject of this}} discussion, by {{clinging}} close to the walls of houses, had avoided the keen blast that descended from the mountain, and had at last reached the little trail that led through the gulch to his cabin on the opposite hill-side. Here Gabriel hesitated. To follow that trail would lead him past the boarding-house of Mrs. Markle. In {{the light of the}} baleful counsel he had just received, to place himself as soon again in the way of danger seemed to him to be only a provocation of fate. That the widow and Sal might swoop down upon him as he passed, and compel him to enter; that the spectacle of his passing without a visit might superinduce instant hysterics {{on the part of the}} widow, appeared to his terror-stricken fancy as almost a certainty. The only other way home was by a circuitous road along the ridge of the hill, at least three miles farther. Gabriel did not hesitate long, but began promptly to ascend the hill. This was no easy task in the face of a strong gale and torrents of beating rain, but the overcoming of physical difficulties by the exercise of his all conquering muscles, and the fact that he was doing something, relieved his mind of its absurd terrors. When he had reached the summit he noticed for the first time the full power of those subtle agencies that had been silently at work during the last week's steady rain. A thin trickling mountain rill where he had two weeks before slaked his thirst during a ramble with Olly, was now transformed into a roaring cataract; the brook that they had leaped across was now a swollen river. There were slowly widening pools in the valleys, darkly glancing sheets of water on the distant plains, and a monotonous rush and gurgle always in the air. It was half an hour later, and two miles farther on his rough road, that he came in view of the narrow precipitous gorge through which the Wingdam stage passed on its way from Marysville. As he approached nearer he could see that the little mountain stream which ran beside the stage road had already slightly encroached upon the road-bed, and that here and there the stage road itself was lost in drifts of standing water. [...] "It will be pretty rough drivin' up that cañon," [...] said Gabriel to himself as he thought of the incoming Wingdam stage, now nearly due; [...] "mighty onpleasant and risky with narvous leaders, but thar's worse things than that in this yer world," [...] he meditated, as his mind reverted again to Mrs. Markle, [...] "and ef I could change places with Yuba Bill, and <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> box and Olly inside--I'd do it!" ...|$|E
