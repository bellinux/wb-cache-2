Especially prominent was the deification of Newton, Locke and Boyle and their scientific method by Enlightenment and Victorian scholars. [...] He considers the scientific work done during the Baroque period as crucial to the Enlightenment.

The inspirations of the game ranged from 80s arcade classics to more recent titles of the time.
