40|$|Biological <b>{{population}}s</b> are <b>dynamic</b> in both {{space and}} time, that is, the population {{size of a}} species fluctuates across their habitats over time. There are rarely any static or fixed size populations in nature. In evolutionary computation (EC), population size {{is one of the}} most important parameters and it received attention from EC pioneers from the very beginning. Despite many attempts to optimize the population sizing, the prevailing scheme in EC is still possibly the simplest — the fixed size population. This is in strong contrast with population entities in nature. In this paper, we explore the effects of <b>dynamic</b> (fluctuating) <b>populations</b> on the performance of genetic algorithms (GA). In particular, we test five dynamic population-sizing patterns: random fluctuating population, increasing population, decreasing population, bellshaped population, and inverse bell-shaped population and compare them against the fixed size population. Our experiment shows very promising results that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>populations</b> perform more efficiently than the traditional fixed size populations, in terms of the number of fitness function evaluations and memory space requirements. We also analyze why the <b>dynamic</b> <b>populations</b> should perform superior to the fixed size populations from the biological perspective...|$|R

5000|$|Immune {{tolerance}} is {{an important}} means by which growing tumors, which have mutated proteins and altered antigen expression, prevent elimination by the host immune system. It is well recognized that tumors are a complex and <b>dynamic</b> <b>population</b> of cells composed of transformed cells as well as stromal cells, blood vessels, tissue macrophages, and other immune infiltrates. [...] These cells and their interactions all contribute to the changing tumor microenvironment, which the tumor largely manipulates to be immunotolerant {{so as to avoid}} elimination. There is an accumulation of metabolic enzymes that suppress T cell proliferation and activation, including IDO and arginase, and high expression of tolerance-inducing ligands like FasL, PD-1, CTLA-4, and B7. Pharmacologic monoclonal antibodies targeted against some of these ligands has been effective in treating cancer. Tumor-derived vesicles known as exosomes have also been implicated promoting differentiation of iTreg cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which also induce peripheral tolerance. [...] In addition to promoting immune tolerance, other aspects of the microenvironment aid in immune evasion and induction of tumor-promoting inflammation.|$|E

50|$|Kroupa {{leads the}} {{research}} group on stellar populations and stellar dynamics at the University of Bonn. His research work began in 1987 in Australia with {{an investigation of}} Proxima Centauri. Kroupa {{is well known for}} his work for the distribution of stellar masses. In Cambridge in 1990-1992 by means of observational data on star counts and on binary stars and with detailed computations of stellar structure with Christopher A. Tout and Gerard F. Gilmore he deduced the contemporary, generally used canonical IMF (initial mass function), which describes the distribution of the star masses at their birth. In 2004 in Kiel together with Carsten Weidner he suggested the existence of a physical maximum star mass of approximately 150 solar masses. In Heidelberg he presented the first stellar-dynamic computations in 1993-1995 of star clusters, in which all stars are born as binary stars. He thus solved the problem that field populations have a significantly lower double star rate than star formation areas, because the binary stars are broken up as the star clusters evolve and disperse. He mathematically formulated and applied a theory of the evolution of binary stars (eigenevolution), created the method of <b>dynamic</b> <b>population</b> synthesis, and predicted the existence of binary stars forbidden by previous theory (forbidden binaries). He suggested in co-operation with Ingo Thies and Christian Theis in 2003-2004 in Kiel that brown dwarves and extrasolar planetary systems can develop in circumstellar disks due to passing stars which disturb the disks. Our Solar System is likely to have been shaped by such events.|$|E

A major source of uncertainty in the population weighted biomarker loads generated is related to estimating {{the number of people}} present in a sewer catchment at the time of sample collection. Here, the population quantified from mobile device-based population activity patterns was used to provide <b>dynamic</b> <b>population</b> normalized loads of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals during a known period of high net fluctuation in the catchment population. Mobile device-based population activity patterns have for the first time quantified the high degree of intraday, week, and month variability within a specific sewer catchment. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>population</b> normalization showed that per capita pharmaceutical use remained unchanged during the period when static normalization would have indicated an average reduction of up to 31 %. Per capita illicit drug use increased significantly during the monitoring period, an observation that was only possible to measure using <b>dynamic</b> <b>population</b> normalization. The study quantitatively confirms previous assessments that population estimates can account for uncertainties of up to 55 % in static normalized data. Mobile device-based population activity patterns allow for dynamic normalization that yields much improved temporal and spatial trend analysis...|$|E
