40|$|Cultivation of nonnative candeia is an {{alternative}} way of obtaining raw material to meet the market demands for essential oils and fence posts. A successful stand is conditional on careful planning intended to optimize activities and make the project economically feasible. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the economic feasibility and to determine the <b>economic</b> <b>rotation</b> age for stands of candeia (Eremanthus erythropappus) using different interrow spacing arrangements, as well as to analyze the sensitivity of both economic indicators for candeia and <b>economic</b> <b>rotation</b> to variations in cash flow variables. Equivalent Annual Value (VAE) was the method used for the economic analyses. A simulation was carried out to detect VAE sensitivity to changes in variables related to cash flow. It was concluded that candeia cultivation can be profitable when spacing arrangements are 1. 5 x 2. 0 m or more. Arrangements denser than that are economically unfeasible for the ages being analyzed. Among the analyzed spacing arrangements, 1. 5 x 3. 0 m was found to be the most profitable and less risky. The <b>economic</b> <b>rotation</b> age for candeia is 15 years using 1. 5 x 1. 5 m spacing; 13 years using 1. 5 x 2. 0 m and 1. 5 x 2. 5 m spacing; and 12 years using 1. 5 x 3. 0 m spacing. Proportional variations in timber price, volume output and interest rate implied inversely proportional variations in <b>economic</b> <b>rotation</b> for the spacing arrangements being studied. Conversely, proportional variations in seedling price implied directly proportional variations in rotation. Changes in land price did not affect <b>economic</b> <b>rotation</b> for any of the spacing arrangements...|$|E

A biometric model for making wood volume prognosis was developed using data of a trial of Eucalyptus grandis plantation envisaging pulp production. Eucalyptus grandis stands of 19 and 103 months old, in the spacing 3 x 2 and 3 x 3 m in site index of 30; 28; 26 and 24 m were used. Theprognosis started at the age zero, considering logs of 2. 5; 2. 8; 4. 0 and 6. 0 m of length for minimum diameter varying from 4 to 10 cm, in intervals of 2 cm. Net Present Worth (VPL) was used the economic criterion, considering an infinite horizon and a cost relation including reestablishment, yearly maintenance, logging and wood transportation costs. The main conclusions were: increases in the minimum diameter and or in logs length increase the rotation age; harvesting the stands in ages different from the optimal one cause large economic loss mainly in the better sites; the economic loss is larger if the harvest is made before the optimal <b>economic</b> <b>rotation</b> than if it is make after; economic feasibility increases when the minimum diameter is smaller and when the length of the logs is shorter.

The paper also investigates the feasibility of using fire prone stands for carbon sequestration and estimates the effects that it would have on the optimal management regime and rotation age empirically using a typical Douglas-fir stand in the Pacific Northwest. The model incorporates risk-reducing management practices that allow risk and growth to be endogenous, and the optimal rotation model is solved using numerical simulation techniques. Results show that higher carbon prices increase the rotation length regardless of the probability of fire and that the frequency of risk-reducing management practices increase as the stand approaches the optimal harvest age. Results also indicate that intermediate fuel treatments can provide economical and environmental benefits, even with a high probability of fire.

40|$|Abstract: Managers are {{typically}} interested in using equations that provide accurate volumes for large, merchantable trees while modelers {{are often more}} interested in equations that meet statistical assumptions. Therefore, modelers often use weighted (WLS) rather than ordinary least squares (OLS) to fit individual tree volume equations since the random error variance is not constant. Since OLS and WLS produce different parameter estimates, perhaps the method chosen will impact the predicted optimum <b>economic</b> <b>rotation</b> age. To address this concern, individual tree volumes were obtained from plots established in an unthinned loblolly pine plantation in southeastern Arkansas. Parameters of the combined-variable function were then estimated using OLS and WLS for the same dataset. Stand-level projections and predicted diameter distributions for two planting densities (748 and 2, 692 seedlings per hectare) were then obtained from a growth and yield model (PTAEDA 3. 1) and individual tree volumes were predicted using the two parameter estimation approaches. When conducting economic analyses, we found the optimum rotation age between OLS and WLS can differ {{by as much as}} 11 yrs (i. e. 10 yr clearcut vs 21 yr clearcut) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{household}} {{survey on}} the financial drivers of woodlot production was conducted in the Lake Tana watershed of Amhara State, Ethiopia. Analysis of smallholder Eucalyptus globulus Labill. production reveals that converting uneroded over eroded croplands leads to significantly higher financial returns. Returns were also significantly higher for rotation intervals closer to the optimal <b>economic</b> <b>rotation</b> and for higher planting densities. Most woodlots had positive financial returns. The presence of negative financial returns for some households demonstrates that positive ecological externalities, a lack of economies of scale and/or myopic behavior are potentially important factors in land use decision-making. Wood utilization decisions were shown to impact the potential financial returns of households. Smallholders’ activities demonstrate that eucalyptus is an imperfect substitute for agricultural production on surplus cropland. A third of respondents indicated they had intentionally chosen to convert uneroded croplands to achieve higher returns. Smallholders faced constraints in bargaining over price and access to markets. Future land use policies should address marketing constraints and unsustainable land use activities. Harvesting soil from natural forests and the conversion of productive surplus cropland to woodlot production both present long-term sustainability challenges. This study demonstrates the importance of considering economic and social incentives when creating land use policies for smallholder's woodlot production...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effects that {{different}} economic instruments to reward carbon sequestration services might have on forest management, especially on the optimal rotation period. Three different carbon crediting schemes are considered, {{which are based on}} different accounting rules. The schemes are different with respect to the question whether and how to account for carbon emissions. The forest valuation method used for calculation is based on the land expectation value (LEV), which was adjusted for the value of carbon sequestration services. Changes in the LEV and optimal rotation are expected to be induced by the amount and interactions of carbon and timber prices, harvesting and regeneration costs, and interest rates. The optimal <b>economic</b> <b>rotation</b> period is calculated for single stands as well as for whole forest enterprises (fully regulated "normal" forests). Crediting the carbon sequestration of single stands [...] starting from the time of regeneration [...] is comparable to rewarding afforestation projects. When crediting forest enterprises with existing timber and carbon stocks, additional carbon sequestration compared to a reference is rewarded. The findings reveal that, depending on the carbon price level, the optimal rotation period is increased in all considered crediting schemes, but with different intensity. If wood removals have to be accounted as carbon emissions this has the most significant effect on the optimal rotation period for forest stands and enterprises. In this case the increase of the optimal rotation period by rising carbon prices is boosted additionally by rising interest rates. Different thinning regimes, however, have only little impact on the time of maximum LEV under carbon crediting schemes.

Whole-stand yield, growth models and individual tree equations {{were used to}} estimate carbon stock in forests under different silvicultural alternatives and site indexes. Each alternative was evaluated {{on the basis of}} the land expectation value (LEV). Results reveal the appropriateness of implementing carbon payments, because it can clearly complement traditional management objectives in <b>economic</b> terms. Longer <b>rotations</b> on the poorest sites result in a positive economic return by introducing carbon output. The proportion of carbon stock in the final harvest relative to total fixed carbon is always higher in long rotation scenarios. However, short rotation systems produce the highest values of carbon MAI regardless of site index. The impact of carbon price is higher on the Maritime pine stands than on Scots pine stands.

40|$|Abstract The {{cultivation}} of cocoa {{has been an}} important driver of tropical deforestation glob-ally. Efforts to reverse this trend are focusing on the reintroduction of shade trees to cocoa plan-tations. Shade trees are valuable in enhancing biophysical conditions on cocoa (Theobroma cacao) fields and contribute to biodiversity and product diversification for smallholder producers. Participatory trials of cocoa agroforests planted with indigenous shade tree species were under-taken with farmers in the Atwima District of the Ashanti Region of Ghana, to increase tree volume on cocoa fields while improving rural livelihoods and enhancing environmental sustain-ability. An ex ante financial analysis of the technology was undertaken to assess its economic viability. Input–output data were collected from farmer experiments over three seasons and sup-plemented with data from traditional cocoa fields of varying rotation ages, and secondary data on production in later years of an eighty-year cocoa rotation. A discounted cash flow analysis was carried out to estimate the benefit-cost (B/C) ratio, net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and land expectation value (LEV) as well as the sensitivity to a 20 % decline in cocoa prices and additional chemical costs for various shade scenarios at a 10 % discount rate. It was observed that cocoa production is, in general, profitable. The change from the traditional sys-tem to one with hybrid cocoa raised the IRR from 31 % to 57 % with planted shade and 67 % without, although extra agrochemical costs would tend to reduce the profitability of unshaded hybrid cocoa in particular. The age of maximum LEV for the various scenarios suggests that the optimum <b>economic</b> <b>rotation</b> for the hybrid cocoa is between 18 and 29 years, much less than the traditional system...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Most {{forests and}} timber in Western Oregon are taxed under the Western Oregon Forest Land and Severance Tax (WOST), {{a system which}} is {{accepted}} as one that promotes "correct" <b>economic</b> <b>rotation</b> lengths. This study was motivated by the observation that an optional tax with the same stated purpose - the Western Oregon Small Tract Optional Tax (WOSTOT) - continued to coexist {{for the benefit of}} small nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) land owners. Inferring that some small NIPF land owners must be receiving beneficial tax treatment under WOSTOT, the study sets out to examine and compare the tax effects of WOST and WOSTOT on forest management, productivity, land-uses, and tax burdens on a variety of different sites under different sets of assumptions. The specific objectives of the study are fourfold. First, compare WOSTOT and WOST in terms of their common objective of fostering timber production. Second, compare the equitability of the two tax systems. Third, compare the neutrality of the two tax systems with respect to land use? Fourth, identify which NIPF landowners are likely to use WOSTOT rather than WOST, and why? First, a historical review of timber taxes in Western Oregon is conducted to provide some perspective and understanding regarding the existing NIPF timber tax systems. Next, the forest taxation literature is examined for insights into how others have dealt with similar questions. A methodology utilizing the Stand Optimization System (SOS), a dynamic programming optimization model, is used to examine if and how timber taxes affect: (1) timber production, including the timing and intensity of thinnings and final harvest rotation age, as well as merchantable mean annual increment (MAI); and (2) Soil Expectation Values (SEV 5) and site burdens. The results of the simulations show that there are no timber production or land-use impacts attributable to either timber tax system. It was found, however, that the two tax systems were not always equitable, i. e., certain NIPF landowners were likely to find WOSTOT provided preferential tax treatment (higher SEVs) when compared to WOST. Taxpayers most likely to benefit under the WOSTOT system included those; (1) in high WOST land tax zones, (2) with lower site lands, and (3) with low discount rates. NIPF land ownerships are examined by county and tax type to determine if the simulation results help explain actual behavior of tax-paying NIPF land owners. Current NIPF ownership patterns tended to be consistent with the model results. It appears that WOSTOT is most used in those counties with highest WOST land values. Finally, other WOST and WOSTOT related issues are discussed, first from the perspective of NIPF land owners, and then from a public policy perspective...|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: Even-aged forests {{prevail in}} Croatia’s forestry. Rotation period is based mostly on natural parameters. In practice, {{rotation}} period {{is given by}} Croatian Rulebook of forest management. Cutting age is determined based on inventory data and many other stand characteristics. Rotation period is a planned time and it always has to be unique for particular tree species, and cutting age is the age of a stand {{at the moment of}} the final cut. The aim of the paper is to compare rotation period based on <b>economic</b> parameters and <b>rotation</b> period determined by using forest inventory data. Material and methods: Owing to absence of long term stand calculation data, research object was taken from Forest Management Handbook (1995). Mean annual increment (MAI) and current annual increment (CAI) provided fundamental data for calculations. The research was conducted at one hectare Common Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) stand. Assortment structure and value of timber was estimated by the present cutting value method calculated by using Croatian forests Ltd. Price list for the year 2008. Labor costs in forest exploitation were also taken into account. Results and conclusion: In order to achieve cost-effective management of common beech stands, it is necessary to adjust current optimal rotation period. Optimal rotation period should be based on management goals as the main factors. So far the most common criterion adopted in Croatian forestry has been the rotation of maximum sustained yield or maximum Mean annual increment.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the economic behavior of four food crop and supplementary forage rotations using indicators of profitability and profit variability. Productive data were used from a long-term experiment (16 yr) in the central valley of Chile under conditions of irrigation. With productive data and information on historic input/output prices, the real net margin per rotation (RNMR) and its coefficient of variation (CV) were determined. The {{results indicated that the}} highest economic benefits and greatest economic stability were obtained with rotations that only included crops, namely sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. subsp. vulgaris) -wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) -bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) -barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (CR 2) and corn (Zea mays L.) -wheat-bean-barley (CR 4). These rotations included crops with low CV of the net margin, such as wheat, barley and beans, with values between 0. 31 and 0. 34. The rotations with crops and pasture, sugar beet-wheat-red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) (2) (CR 1) and corn-wheat-red clover (2) (CR 3) had lower net margins and more variability of this indicator. Red clover had the highest CV value (1. 00). The selection of crops for rotations and their sequence were determining factors in the <b>economic</b> behavior of <b>rotations,</b> affecting the level of RNMR and the degree of inter-annual variability of this indicator. Thus, differences among rotations of 47 % in net margin were determined (CR 2 vs. CR 1), which only differed in the replacement of pasture with red clover (2) by bean-barley. The economic analysis based on the net margin and its variability allow for discriminating among rotations, providing valuable information for producers in deciding which crops to use in rotations...|$|R

This research also assesses best farmer management practices to mitigate environmental impacts of stover removal. ^ Hypothetical dairy operations and beef feedlots are assumed in Elkhart County, Indiana and Washington County, Indiana, respectively. Data from four dairy feeding trials and three beef feedlot feeding trials are used to determine lime-treated corn stover’s economic viability as a livestock feed input. Data from the Landscape Environmental Assessment Framework is used to quantify the environmental impacts resulting from the ration substitutions in the feeding trials. For both dairy and beef operations, feed rations including lime-treated corn stover were always cost-effective compared to the control rations. Only dairy feeding trial one produced a negative income over feed cost (IOFC) calculation, where a decrease in milkfat production compromises the profitability of the feed substitution. The average annual increase in returns per lactating cow on a dairy farm when lime-treated corn stover was included in feed rations was $ 119. 42 /cow. The average annual increase in returns per beef feedlot animal was $ 40. 82 /head when fed lime-treated corn stover. This research did not consider potential benefits from feeding lime-treated corn stover to other segments of the dairy herd, such as replacement heifers. ^ Environmental impacts considered were soil erosion, changes in soil organic carbon, and rate of nitrate leaching. Values were assigned to these environmental categories, and impacts from specific crop rotation changes were integrated into the <b>economic</b> analysis. Crop <b>rotations</b> involving corn silage were the most environmentally degrading, and corn silage could only be grown sustainably when managed with a winter cover crop. The incorporation of environmental values to the economic values of the feed substitutions can impact the social outcome of the feed substitution. In general, as the rate of corn stover harvest increases to supply stover for the feed substitutions, the more likely the social impact of the feed substitution will become negative. However, this outcome is dependent upon the value of soil erosion used in the analysis, which is a topic for future research. ...|$|R
40|$|Negative {{environmental}} impacts associated with intensive pesticide use and over-fertilization in conventional production have encouraged many producers to investigate organic methods. In {{the most current}} (2008) U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) statistics on organic agriculture, land under certified organic production increased to 4. 8 million acres, with 194, 637 acres of organic corn (Zea mays L.), 125, 621 acres of organic soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ], and 164, 888 acres in organic vegetable crops. In order to enter the expanding organic market and meet certified organic requirements, producers must implement a soil-building plan that focuses on preserving soil organic matter. The majority of organic grain production occurs in the Midwestern U. S. where growers {{are aware of the}} need to balance meeting increasing demand with maintaining soil health. A countervailing event that affects soil quality in organic systems is weed management, which currently relies extensively on tillage operations. Beginning in 2002, the Rodale Institute (Kutztown, PA) piloted an Organic No-Till system to reduce tillage operations and the carbon footprint of organic production. This system is based on a roller/crimper implement (a large, 10. 5 ft. wide x 16 in. diameter, steel cylinder with steel blades welded in a chevron pattern to facilitate a crimping motion) that is used to mechanically terminate fall-planted cover crops the following spring in place of synthetic herbicides, which are disallowed in organic production. A series of organic no-till experiments was established in Iowa from 2008 to 2011 to examine the effect of cover crops, crop sequences, and tillage operations on organic grain crop growth, weed management and yields. In the first set of experiments (2008 - 2011) at the Iowa State University (ISU) Agronomy Farm (Boone, IA), organic no-till soybeans in the wheat-rye/soybean-oat-rye/soybean crop sequence produced equivalent yields to tilled organic soybeans in the same crop sequence, averaging 34 bu/acre over two seasons. Weed management mirrored tilled plots until later in the season when rye tillers emerged in no-till plots; these grasses did not affect yields, however. Organic no-till corn in the wheat-hairy vetch/corn-oat-hairy vetch/corn sequence did not achieve acceptable yields in either year, due to competition with hairy vetch re-growth and poor weed management from lack of sufficient cover crop mulch. Tilled corn also suffered from lack of supplemental nitrogen in this experiment, leading to the conclusion that cover crops should not be considered as a sole nutrient source in organic corn production. In the organic no-till corn experiment at the ISU Neely-Kinyon Farm (Greenfield, IA) from 2010 to 2011, five cover crops, including hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), rye (Secale cereale), winter triticale (Triticosecale sp.), Austrian winter pea (Pisum arvense), and a combination of rye/hairy vetch, were evaluated against a control plot with no cover crop under two main treatments of no tillage (no-till) and conventional tillage (tilled). Tilled corn crops out-performed no-till crops both years of the experiment. In 2010, due to extensive rains and late planting, all corn was harvested as silage, with biomass yields of 25 tons/acre in tilled plots and 6. 5 tons/acre in no-till plots. Cover crops were not uniformly associated with increased yields, but higher silage yields were obtained in the hairy vetch treatments in no-till plots compared to rye and triticale treatments. Corn grain yield in 2011 in the legume cover crop treatments in tilled plots averaged 120 bu/acre compared to only 57 bu/acre in the cereal cover crop treatments. Corn in the no-till plots again suffered from lack of N, weed competition and cover crop re-growth, and was harvested as silage, averaging 13. 3 tons/acre, with no significant difference between cover crop treatments. Other problems in organic no-till corn included corn borer damage, which may have been associated with greater attraction by insect pests to crops under stress. As a result of these experiments, organic no-till corn is now considered too difficult for Midwest conditions, and a new crop rotation including alfalfa as a cover crop prior to the no-till segment of rye/soybean is currently under investigation. Based on the beneficial effects from increased carbon inputs in long-term organic no-till crop <b>rotations,</b> <b>economic</b> benefits could also be obtained from soil carbon enhancement and greenhouse gas reduction if Clean Energy legislation and carbon markets support such practices in the future...|$|R
