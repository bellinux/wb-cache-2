25|$|Around 1873 {{the firm}} {{supplied}} two blowing engines {{to the huge}} Krupp steelworks at Essen, Germany. It was in this decade that the company began to install <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> drive systems for the transfer of power from its stationary steam engines to the looms and similar machinery which they were intended to service. This technique was common in the US but rare in Britain until this time: the advantages included less noise and less wasted energy in the friction losses inherent in the previously common drive shafts and their associated gearing. Also, maintenance was simpler and cheaper, {{and it was a}} more convenient method for the arrangement of power drives such that if one part were to fail then it would not cause loss of power to all sections of a factory or mill. These systems were in turn superseded in popularity by rope drive methods.|$|E

The <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> pulley system is still in existence. It is believed that this was used for lighting rather than running the machines.|$|E
2500|$|When the Model T was {{designed}} and introduced, the infrastructure {{of the world was}} quite different from today's. Pavement was a rarity except for sidewalks and a few big-city streets. (The sense of the term [...] "pavement" [...] as equivalent with [...] "sidewalk" [...] comes from that era, when streets and roads were generally dirt and sidewalks were a paved way to walk along them.) Agriculture was the occupation of many people. Power tools were scarce outside factories, as were power sources for them; electrification, like pavement, was found usually only in larger towns. Rural electrification and motorized mechanization were embryonic in some regions and nonexistent in most. Henry Ford oversaw the requirements and design of the Model T based on contemporary realities. Consequently, the Model T was (intentionally) almost as much a tractor and portable engine as it was an automobile. It has always been well regarded for its all-terrain abilities and ruggedness. It could travel a rocky, muddy farm lane, cross a shallow stream, climb a steep hill, and be parked on the other side to have one of its wheels removed and a pulley fastened to the hub for a <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> to drive a bucksaw, thresher, silo blower, conveyor for filling corn cribs or haylofts, baler, water pump, electrical generator, and many other applications. One unique application of the Model T was shown in the October 1922 issue of Fordson Farmer magazine. It showed a minister who had transformed his Model T into a mobile church, complete with small organ.|$|E

5000|$|Because <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> tend {{to climb}} towards the higher {{side of the}} pulley, pulleys were made with a {{slightly}} convex or [...] "crowned" [...] surface (rather than flat) to allow the belt to self-center as it runs. <b>Flat</b> <b>belts</b> also tend to slip on the pulley face when heavy loads are applied, and many proprietary belt dressings were available that {{could be applied to}} the belts to increase friction, and so power transmission.|$|R
5000|$|V belts (also style V-belts, vee belts, or, less commonly, wedge rope) {{solved the}} {{slippage}} and alignment problem. It {{is now the}} basic belt for power transmission. They provide the best combination of traction, speed of movement, load of the bearings, and long service life. They are generally endless, and their general cross-section shape is roughly trapezoidal (hence the name [...] "V"). The [...] "V" [...] shape of the belt tracks in a mating groove in the pulley (or sheave), {{with the result that}} the belt cannot slip off. The belt also tends to wedge into the groove as the load increases—the greater the load, the greater the wedging action—improving torque transmission and making the V-belt an effective solution, needing less width and tension than <b>flat</b> <b>belts.</b> V-belts trump <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> with their small center distances and high reduction ratios. The preferred center distance is larger than the largest pulley diameter, but less than three times the sum of both pulleys. Optimal speed range is [...] V-belts need larger pulleys for their thicker cross-section than <b>flat</b> <b>belts.</b>|$|R
60|$|Immediately {{behind it}} was a deep valley, and the ascent from this side was to some extent {{commanded}} by the guns on Mount Alice and Swartz Kop. Between Spion Kop and the river there was a <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> of country, and {{it was a}}long this that Lord Dundonald had ridden with his brigade of cavalry to Acton Homes, where he was still stationed. The point of greatest interest, however, was at Trichardt's Drift, lying six miles west of Mount Alice. From their look-out they {{could make out the}} division under the command of Sir Charles Warren advancing to the ford. As far as they could see, no serious opposition was being offered; they could, however, in the intervals of silence of the guns, hear a dropping musketry fire in that direction, and a few rounds of shot from Warren's field-guns, but it was evident that only a small party of the enemy could be disputing the passage.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{typically}} belted to the device being {{powered by a}} wide <b>flat</b> <b>belt,</b> typically from 2 - 6 inches (5 - 15 cm) wide. The <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> is driven by a pulley on the engine that attached either to a flywheel or to the crankshaft. The pulley is specially made in that its circumference is slightly tapered from the middle to each edge (like an over-inflated car tyre) so that {{the middle of the}} pulley is a slightly larger diameter. This design keeps the <b>flat</b> <b>belt</b> in the centre of the pulley.|$|E

50|$|In 1919 Ernst Siegling {{founded a}} drive belt factory {{under his own}} name.

50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>belts</b> were {{traditionally}} made {{of leather}} or fabric. Today most {{are made of}} rubber or synthetic polymers. Grip of leather belts is often better if they are assembled with the hair side (outer side) of the leather against the pulley, although some belts are instead given a half-twist before joining the ends (forming a Möbius strip), so that wear can be evenly distributed {{on both sides of}} the belt. Belts ends are joined by lacing the ends together with leather thonging (the oldest of the methods), steel comb fasteners and/or lacing, or by gluing or welding (in the case of polyurethane or polyester). <b>Flat</b> <b>belts</b> were traditionally jointed, and still usually are, but they can also be made with endless construction.|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the extant}} saws are {{original}} including the frame, circular break-down, number one and docking saws. The saw sharpening equipment is also original. All of this equipment {{was designed to}} be steam driven via <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> and pulleys. The original transmission system continued to be used when the shed was first electrified: a large electric motor was simply connected to the main transmission shaft. Later, the transmission system was rendered redundant when the single large electric motor was replaced by smaller electric motors mounted directly onto each saw. As part of this upgrade, the original <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> and pulley wheels on the saws were replaced by [...] "V" [...] belts and pulleys which transmitted drive directly from the saw mounted motors.|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using oriented polymer {{technology in the}} design and manufacture of mechanical power transmission belts has been investigated. Working from an initial selection of polymers a die-drawing technique for orienting the polymers was devised, and the static and dynamic mechanical properties of the oriented polymers were investigated. These results indicated that PP, PBT, PPS and PEEK were suitable for further research. Of these 4 materials PBT was selected as the most appropriate material for belt manufacture based on cost, processability (drawing temperature, natural draw ratio) and limitations of laboratory equipment. A technique based on free-tensile drawing combined with simultaneous rotational motion was designed and used to manufacture oriented PBT <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> from cylindrical injection moulded preforms. The technique used a tensile machine with two pulley-clamps, a fitted heated chamber and an electric motor to provide rotational motion to the belt during drawing. Two types of oriented PBT <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> with different cross sections were produced successfully, termed 'thick' and 'thin'. These belts were tested on a purpose-built rig comprising two equal diameter pulleys, one driven by an electric motor and the other connected to a generator to provide load. The belt life and power transmission performance was investigated at various conditions of speed, transmitted torque and tension, and the results indicated that despite their smaller cross section 'thin' <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> demonstrated up to 3 times longer life. However life was only 100 hours, which was very low compared with conventional <b>flat</b> <b>belts</b> that last for many thousands of hours at higher speeds and much greater power transmission capacity. Synchronous belts were then produced through the same manufacturing method used for <b>flat</b> <b>belts.</b> This aspect of the research concentrated on the initial pitch design and size, i. e. the timing. Initially a rectangular tooth profile was selected for its simplicity in terms of manufacture. The produced belts exhibited high pitch length variation as well as deformed teeth and were not usable for synchronous power transmission. An extra timing feature was included to control orientation; reducing the pitch length variation enabling consistent tooth production. It was observed that the areas between the extra timing feature and the tooth edges did not orient completely with some regions remaining undrawn. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used to predict the drawing behaviour of different shapes and dimensions of the timing features. The results suggested that a 4 mm wide and 7 mm long slot provided the highest possible extension and the minimum non-oriented regions on the groove. Whilst, the thickness and width of the drawn belt timing features showed differences to the FEA predictions, manufactured synchronous belts based on that design had much better controlled dimensions and the lowest achieved pitch length variation (± 1...|$|R

50|$|Though often grouped with <b>flat</b> <b>belts,</b> {{they are}} {{actually}} a different kind. They consist of a very thin belt (0.5-15 millimeters or 100-4000 micrometres) strip of plastic and occasionally rubber.
