40|$|Abstract Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) remains {{without an}} effective treatment {{in spite of}} intense research efforts. Interferon-beta (IFN-β) reduces duration and severity of symptoms in many relapsing-remitting MS patients, but its mechanism of action is still not well understood.

Certain naturally occurring flavonoids, such as luteolin, have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, including inhibition of activated peripheral blood leukocytes from MS patients.

Moreover, luteolin and structurally similar flavonoids can inhibit <b>experimental</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (EAE), an animal model of MS in rodents.

40|$|Interest in {{autoimmune}} {{diseases of}} humans has prompted extensive investigations of comparable phenomena in laboratory animals. The most clearly defined <b>experimental</b> models are <b>allergic</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (1 - 7), aspermatogenesis (8, 9), and thyroiditis (10 - 13). In these diseases, specific organ {{damage has been}} established as result of actual autoimmunization (14).

40|$|The rodent {{model for}} {{multiple}} sclerosis, <b>experimental</b> <b>allergic</b> (autoimmune) <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (EAE), {{has been used}} to dissect molecular mechanisms of the autoimmune inflammatory response, and hence to devise and test new therapies for multiple sclerosis. Clearly, artificial immunization against myelin may not necessarily reproduce all the pathogenetic mechanisms operating in the human disease, but most therapies tested in multiple sclerosis patients are nevertheless based on concepts derived from studies in EAE. Unfortunately, several treatments, though successful in pre-clinical EAE trials, were either less effective in patients, worsened disease or caused unexpected, severe adverse events, as we review here. These discrepancies must, at least in part, be due to genetic and environmental differences, but the precise underlying reasons are not yet clear. Our understanding of EAE patho-genesis is still incomplete and so, therefore, are any implications for drug development in these models. Here, we suggest some potential explanations based on new thinking about key pathogenic concepts and differences that may limit extrapolation from EAE to multiple sclerosis.

Electron microscopy revealed focal demyelinization in both the spinal roots and cord.

40|$|Multiple Sclerosis is an {{inflammatory}} demyelinating and neurodegenerative {{disease of the}} central nervous system. Magnetic resonance imaging is an important tool for diagnosing of Multiple Sclerosis and for, in vivo, monitoring its evolution of pathology. The introduction of interferon (IFN) -beta therapy has altered the natural course of Multiple Sclerosis. We investigated the effect of low-dose low-frequency and high-dose highfrequency IFNbeta- 1 a treatment in patients with secondary progressive Multiple Sclerosis, and also after discontinuation of treatment by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and clinical assessments. The longitudinal study showed that a single weekly dose of 22 µg IFN-beta- 1 a had a mild beneficial effect as visualized by magnetic resonance imaging, but this dosage and frequency of administration was insufficient in controlling clinical disease activity. Discontinuation of IFN-beta 1 a was associated with an acceleration of neurological disability and progression of brain lesion. A major hurdle in the research of neuroinflammatory disorders of {{the central nervous system}} is the inaccessibility of the organ. To overcome such limitations development of relevant animal models has been an important approach. <b>Experimental</b> autoimmune/or <b>allergic</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (EAE) is an animal model that closely mimics key features of human Multiple Sclerosis. We studied EAE-regulatory genes and explored novel individualized therapeutic strategies in EAE models. Genetic factors {{play an important role in}} the expression of the disease, also shown experimentally in a number of inbred rat strains that differ in their relative susceptibilities to EAE. The availability of such strains of rats, the discovery of polymorphic genetic markers, as well as the development of genetic and physical maps provided an opportunity for mapping of diseaseregulating genes in EAE. We fine-mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) that regulate EAE on rat chromosome 10 in the 7 th generation of an advanced intercross line (AIL). AIL mapping was proved to be an efficient approach to narrow down QTL and to resolve closely situated QTL. Dendritic cells (DC) not only control immunity, but also maintain tolerance to self-antigens, thereby minimizing autoaggressive immune responses. We investigated the therapeutic potential of IFN-gamma modified DC and CD 8 alpha+ DC, respectively, in rat and mouse EAE models. The severity of the disease was dramatically inhibited in animals injected with IFN-gamma modified DC or CD 8 alpha+ DC evaluated clinically and by magnetic resonance imaging. In conclusion, in my thesis I have studied Multiple Sclerosis from clinical and experimental perspective, genetic pathogenesis into therapeutic strategies using magnetic resonance imaging and EAE animal models as tools...|$|R

40|$|<b>Experimental</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> is a T-cell-mediated, major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) class II gene-linked autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. To develop therapies that will specifically inactivate only the autoantigen-reactive T cells, mice were treated with soluble MHC class II molecules that had been complexed with encephalitogenic peptides. Intravenous injections of 300 micrograms of complexes consisting of encephalitogenic peptide 91 - 103 of myelin basic protein plus I-As protein on day 0, 4, and 7 were effective in preventing <b>experimental</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>encephalomyelitis.</b> Similarly, administration of 45 micrograms of I-As protein complexed to peptide 139 - 151 from proteolipoprotein on day 1, 4, and 7 prevented mortality and significantly reduced paralysis induced by immunization with the encephalitogenic proteolipoprotein peptide.

With casein as a substrate, brain and spinal cord homogenates showed very similar activity profiles with increasing pH, with the main peaks of proteolytic activity at pH 3 - 4 and 5 - 6. When haemoglobin was used, one broad main peak of activity from pH 3 to 5 was demonstrated. There was no optimum pH, however, for proteolytic activity with myelin basic protein as a substrate, and considerable hydrolysis were observed from pH 3. 5 up to pH 8. Proteolytic activity at the various pH values was compared by using homogenates of spinal cords from rats with acute <b>experimental</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> and those from rats injected with Freund's adjuvant alone. The profiles of activity were similar with peaks at pH 3. 5 and 5. 5 with casein as a substrate, but the specific activity was significantly higher at most pH values in the spinal-cord homogenates from rats with <b>experimental</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>encephalomyelitis.</b> Similarly the spinal-cord homogenates from these latter rats contained much more proteolytic activity toward myelin basic protein throughout the pH range than was present in the control spinal cords.

40|$|There is suggestive {{evidence}} that certain diseases of man, e. g. disseminated encephalomyelitis and thyroiditis, {{may result from}} immune responses directed against his own (autologous) tissues. This "autoallergic " concept of disease derives most support from several interrelated, well established observations in experimental animals. Certain tissues, e. g. brain, thyroid, and testis, have long been known to possess antigenic activity and, when injected into experimental animals, elicit circulating antibodies which react specifically with the corresponding tissue in vitro (1 - 7). It is also known that animals injected with these tissues emulsified in Freund's adjuvant may develop striking tissue damage restricted to the organ in question; v/z., <b>allergic</b> <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> thyroiditis, and aspermatogenesis, respectively (reviewed by Paterson, reference 8).

40|$|Rabbit {{antisera}} against normal {{guinea pig}} lymph node, when injected into guinea pigs, produced transient {{depression of the}} level of blood lymphocytes. It had no effect on other circulating cellular elements. Repeated injection over several days produced lymphopenia, which became progressively less marked with continued treatment, and clear-cut depletion of small lymphocytes in lymph nodes, whether draining an inoculation site or remote. In guinea pigs treated with lymphocyte antiserum, there was marked suppression of the tuberculin and contact allergic reactions and the "delayed" skin reaction to purified diphtheria toxoid, and a relative suppression of <b>allergic</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> and the rejection of first set skin homografts.

These data indicate that in spite of the V beta 17 a gene expression in a relatively large proportion of p 89 - 101 -specific T cells, such V beta gene use is not essential for the induction of <b>experimental</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> in SJL/J mice. These results contrast with the predominance of V beta gene use (V beta 8. 2) in T cells reactive to the encephalitogenic fragment (pR 1 - 11) in PL/J mice. One reason for this lack of dominant use of a particular T-cell receptor V beta gene family in the autoimmune response to myelin basic protein in SJL/J mice stems from the observation that two encephalitogenic epitopes exist in p 89 - 101. KJ 23 a- T cells are stimulated by the deleted peptide p 89 - 100, whereas KJ 23 a+ T cells are not. Thus, in the response to an encephalitogenic fragment of myelin basic protein containing two nested epitopes, at least two distinct T-cell receptor V beta genes are expressed.
