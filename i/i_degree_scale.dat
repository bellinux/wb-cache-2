40|$|We {{developed}} a polarization modulation unit (PMU), a motor system to rotate a waveplate continuously. We applied this PMU for the Chromospheric Lyman-alpha SpectroPolarimeter (CLASP), a sounding rocket experiment {{to observe the}} linear polarization of the Lyman-alpha emission (121. 6 nm vacuum ultraviolet) from the upper chromosphere and transition region of the Sun with a high polarization sensitivity of 0. 1 % {{for the first time}} and investigate the vector magnetic field. Rotation non-uniformity of the waveplate causes error in the polarization <b>degree</b> (<b>i.</b> e. <b>scale</b> error) and crosstalk between Stokes components. In the ground tests, we confirmed that PMU has superior rotation uniformity. CLASP was successfully launched on September 3, 2015, and PMU functioned well as designed. PMU achieved a good rotation uniformity during the flight and the high precision polarization measurement of CLASP was successfully achieved...|$|R

40|$|Based {{on three}} {{evolutionary}} computational models that respectively simulate lexical, categorical and syntactic evolutions, we explore {{the effect of}} power-law distributed social popularity on language origin and change. Simulation results reveal a critical <b>scaling</b> <b>degree</b> (λ ≈ 1. 0) in power-law distributions that helps accelerate the diffusion of linguistic conventions and preserve high linguistic understandability in population. Other <b>scaling</b> <b>degrees</b> (λ = 0. 0 or λ > 1. 0), however, tend to delay such diffusion process and affect linguistic understandability. Apart from the conventionalization nature of language communications in these models, increase in population size could also contribute to select the critical <b>scaling</b> <b>degree,</b> since this <b>scaling</b> <b>degree</b> can accommodate the influence of population size on linguistic understandability and many power-laws in real-world systems have their <b>scaling</b> <b>degrees</b> around this critical value. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{thorough}} and detailed investigation of baryon isocurvature models including realistic thermal histories,, late or partial reionization {{of the universe}} and compact object formation after standard recombination. Constraints on these models are imposed from spectral distortion in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), number fluctuations in galaxy counts σ_ 8, and recent CMB anisotropy observations. Since the status of <b>degree</b> <b>scale</b> anisotropies is as yet unclear, the lack of spectral distortions is the most serious constraint on the spectral index of initial fluctuations: - 1. 2 n - 0. 5 in partially ionized models and - 1. 2 n - 0. 9 in compact object dominated universes in order to avoid significant bias in galaxy formation. Full ionization of the universe before z = 300 is also forbidden by this constraint. Intermediate scale CMB fluctuations which are significantly larger than standard CDM is a robust prediction of these models. Many models are consequently in conflict with the recent <b>degree</b> <b>scale</b> detections by Python, ARGO, and MSAM,, compact object dominated models with Ω_ 0 0. 2. Moreover, all models will be ruled out if the low CMB fluctuations on <b>degree</b> <b>scales</b> as detected by the SP 91 13 point scan are confirmed. On the other hand, most models fare well compared with the high Tenerife and MAX detections. Comment: 18 pgs, uuencoded tarred postscript, CfPA-TH- 94 - 16, UTAP- 17...|$|R
