5|$|In May 1986, George Graham was {{appointed}} as Arsenal manager. He made an instant impact, guiding {{his team to}} League Cup success, and the club finished fourth in the Football League First Division. Arsenal however slipped to sixth in the league the following season, and lost out to Luton Town in the League Cup final a year later. Graham sought to resolve inconsistencies by <b>freshening</b> up his squad, promoting number of academy graduates while selling ageing players. By the summer of 1988, he achieved a blend of youth and experience, but little was thought of Arsenal's chances of winning the First Division.|$|E

25|$|Current {{research}} for the EGC is focused on freshwater fluxes. Because the EGC runs through the Greenland Sea and eventually through the Labrador Sea (as the West Greenland Current) it can have strong implications for the strengthening and or weakening of deep water formations in the Greenland and Labrador Seas. The Meridional Overturning Circulation is a density driven circulation in which a small perturbation in the density field could easily slow down or speed up the deep water formation in the Nordic Seas. Jones et al. note {{that there are three}} different freshwater sources for the EGC: Pacific water, river runoff, and sea-ice meltwater. They find that the biggest contributor to the <b>freshening</b> of the EGC is due to river runoff, followed by Pacific water, and a distant last is sea-ice meltwater (nearly negligible). They find that even though these sources freshen the EGC, these specific sources do not penetrate very well into the central Greenland Sea where the deep convection takes place. They then decide that there must be some other freshwater influence in the central Greenland Sea. They believe it may be from solid sea ice being transported to the central Greenland Sea and then melting. Solid sea ice is very mobile, and winds can easily direct its flow along with ocean currents. Previous thoughts were that the recirculation of the EGC in the Greenland Sea via the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone helps lead to a <b>freshening</b> of the central Greenland Sea, however, Rudels et al. disproved this theory and said it must be due to solid sea ice melt and precipitation in the central Greenland Sea.|$|E

Stewart also added: [...] "We always knew that the records we created were special [...] at the time it was more contractual obligation , I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't need any more records, as you can tell by the success of this album, the songs have been flawless." [...] The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled [...] "Dressing Up", saying: [...] "This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's right there in what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter. She doesn't change much. She has a very keen musical taste. It'll be really good".|$|E
500|$|The Middlesex coroner, Wynne Baxter, {{believed}} that Stride {{had been attacked}} with a swift, sudden action. She was still holding a packet of cachous (breath <b>freshening</b> sweets) in her left hand when she was discovered, indicating {{that she had not}} had time to defend herself. A grocer, Matthew Packer, implied to private detectives employed by the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee that he had sold some grapes to Stride and the murderer; however, he had told police that he had shut his shop without seeing anything suspicious. At the inquest, the pathologists stated emphatically that Stride had not held, swallowed or consumed grapes. They described her stomach contents as [...] "cheese, potatoes and farinaceous powder [...] ". Nevertheless, Packer's story appeared in the press. Packer's description of the man did not match the statements by other witnesses who may have seen Stride with a man shortly before her murder, but all but two of the descriptions differed. Joseph Lawende passed through Mitre Square with two other men shortly before Eddowes was murdered there, and may have seen her with a man of about 30 years old, who was shabbily dressed, wore a peaked cap, and had a fair moustache. Chief Inspector Swanson noted that Lawende's description was a near match to another provided by one of the witnesses who may have seen Stride with her murderer. However, Lawende stated {{that he would not be}} able to identify the man again, and the two other men with Lawende were unable to give descriptions.|$|E

2500|$|Considerable {{activity}} was observed {{on the beaches}} and the [...] "Jig Green" [...] beach area was under fire from a German [...] gun situated west of Arromanches-les-Bains.

The seas were choppy and the wind <b>freshening.</b> The LST took on 13 casualties from a DUKW and the Rhino ferry returned at 21:45 and departed at 22:40 with the remaining vehicles disembarked from LST-21. The LST then got underway for her assigned anchorage. Ten minutes later ships began making smoke on a red alert, followed nine minutes later by a second red alert. Two minutes later, amidst anti-aircraft fire from the west three bombs successively hit the water on the port beam, a fourth hitting [...] off the starboard bow.

2500|$|Conversely, {{some have}} {{suggested}} that medical conditions which cause genuine odor may sometimes be misdiagnosed as ORS. There are a great many different medical conditions which are reported to potentially cause a genuine odor, and these are usually considered according to the origin of the odor, e.g. halitosis (bad breath), bromhidrosis (body odor), etc. These conditions are excluded before a diagnosis of ORS is made. Although there are a multitude of different publications on topics like halitosis, the symptom is still poorly understood and managed in practice. It is recognized that symptoms such as halitosis can be intermittent, and therefore may not be present {{at the time of the}} consultation, leading to misdiagnosis. Individuals with genuine odor symptoms may present with similar mindset and behavior to persons with ORS. For example, one otolaryngologist researcher noted [...] "behavioral problems such as continuous occupation with oral hygiene issues, obsessive use of cosmetic breath <b>freshening</b> products such as mouthwashes, candies, chewing gums, and sprays, avoiding close contact with other people, and turning the head away during conversation" [...] as part of what was termed [...] "skunk syndrome" [...] in patients with genuine halitosis secondary to chronic tonsillitis. Another author, writing about halitosis, noted that there are generally 3 types of person that complain of halitosis: those with above average odor, those with average or near-average odor who are oversensitive, and those with below average or no odor who believe they have offensive breath. Therefore, in persons with genuine odor complaints, the distress and concern may typically be out of proportion to the reality of the problem. Genuine halitosis has been described as a social barrier between the individual and friends, relatives, partners and colleagues, and may negatively alter self-esteem and quality of life. Similar psychosocial problems are reported in other conditions which cause genuine odor symptoms. In the literature on halitosis, emphasis is frequently placed on multiple consultations to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, and also asking the individual to have a reliable confidant accompany them to the consultation who can confirm the reality of the reported symptom. ORS patients are unable to provide such confidants as they have no objective odor.|$|E

Owing to a wide range of material content of Self Compacting Concrete (SCC), generally, a large number of experiments were usually required as to decide a suitable mixture for finding the needed requirements of SCC. Approach: For that purpose, Taguchis approach with an L 18 (2 1 × 3 7) orthogonal array and three-level factor to reduce the numbers of experiment was adopted. Six control factors, namely, contents of coarse aggregate, sand, cement, silica fume, water and superplasticizer were used. The mixtures were extensively tested in <b>freshened</b> state and to meet technical requirement of SCC. Four responses (slump flow, flow time, V-funnel, L-box and segregation resistance) were evaluated. Results: The result {{of this study}} showed that Taguchi method is a promising approach for optimizing mix proportions of SCC to meet several <b>freshened</b> concrete properties. Conclusion: This study has shown that it possible to design self compacting concrete with fulfilling the criteria. As it can be seen in the results of <b>freshened</b> concrete properties of produced concrete samples, they fulfilled the expected properties of SCC...|$|R
