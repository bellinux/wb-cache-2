500|$|Final Nintendo 64 {{specifications}} {{and development}} workstations were not initially available to Rare: a modified Sega Saturn controller {{was used for}} some early playtesting, and the developers had to estimate what the finalised console's capabilities would be. The final Nintendo 64 hardware could render polygons faster than the SGI Onyx workstations they had been using, but the game's textures had to be cut down by half. Karl Hilton explained one method of improving the game's performance: [...] "A lot of GoldenEye is in black and white. RGB colour textures cost {{a lot more in}} terms of processing power. You could do double the resolution if you used greyscale, so a lot was done like that. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> a bit of colour, I'd add it in the vertex." [...] At one time, developers planned to implement the reloading of the weapons by the player unplugging and re-inserting the Rumble Pak on the Nintendo 64 controller, though this idea was discarded at Nintendo's behest.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, this morning. I haven't read it very {{carefully}} yet. He {{said something about}} you helping me, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> help. Well, I won't bother you much. I have done the work alone in the past, and I can do it now." ...|$|E

[...] "I wouldn't take Bab at any price; she'd only get into some scrape, and upset the whole plan. Betty is the chicken for me,--a real little lady, and as nice and purry as a kitten." ...|$|E
60|$|When I woke, {{a little}} light was {{stealing}} into the room through the blinds of my shutters. I quickly slipped out of bed, opened a window, and looked out. Day was just breaking, the rain and wind had ceased, and I could discern objects. But it seemed as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> some light in my brain to enable me to comprehend what I saw. My eyes fell upon nothing familiar.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, at home, in the country, they mightn't {{want to do}} so {{much for}} you, or be so polite about it, but they wouldn't feel {{themselves}} so much above you.

5000|$|After an {{impressive}} FIFA Confederations Cup campaign with Cameroon, Chelsea paid Real Madrid £6.9 million {{for him in}} July 2003, {{and he went on}} to have an excellent first season at Stamford Bridge. Although towards {{the end of his career}} at Chelsea, under José Mourinho he was played less regularly and when he was played he was put in his unpreferred position of right-back. Geremi, however, was held in high regard by Mourinho. During an interview, he said about Geremi, [...] "In my team I love to have Geremi on the bench because he's a low-profile player who is ready to help, ready to fight for the team, ready to do the job I want him to do. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> him to play right-back, he can play right-back. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> him to play right-winger, he can play right-winger. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> him to pick up a man and mark him out of the game, he does it." [...] In his final year at Chelsea, Geremi scored the winning goal in a home match against West Ham United, a long-range free-kick. This turned out to be his last goal in a Chelsea shirt. His final appearance for Chelsea came against Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final second leg, which went to penalties. Geremi came on as an extra-time substitute and went on to have his penalty saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina, and Chelsea ultimately lost.|$|R
60|$|I {{was as a}} {{man without}} a tongue, my hunger gone from sheer happiness--and fright. And yet eating the breakfast with a relish because she had made it. She busied herself about the room, dusting here and tidying there, and anon {{throwing}} a glance at me to see <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> anything. My eyes followed her hither and thither. When I had finished, she undid the napkin, and brushed the crumbs from the coverlet.|$|E
60|$|The roses seem {{coming back}} already to her cheeks, {{though she is}} still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she were in any way anemic I could {{understand}} it, but she is not. She is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> any reminding, of that night, {{and that it was}} here, on this very seat, I found her asleep.|$|E
60|$|And then befell the blackest {{misfortune of}} my life. I had been ill; {{and for a}} few days had been {{sleeping}} in one of the spare bedrooms in a cot beside my mother, so that she should be near me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> her. This particular evening, however, I had gone back to my own room. We cannot change the past, or foresee the future. But if only Pollie had not been a heavy sleeper; if only I had escaped that trivial ailment--how tangled is life's skein! It was the May after my eighteenth birthday and full moonlight.|$|E
