Eight days were spent on {{mountains}} ranging from [...] In recreating the Hindu Kush mountain range that stretches between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the film crew shot at 10 separate locations in the national forest. Stunt coordinator and second unit director Kevin Scott was tasked with depicting the four Navy SEALs tumbling down rugged terrain with sixty-degree inclines. Scott did not choreograph the stunt work, nor did he have the stunt performers use wires or dummies; he told them to fall [...] off cliffs and avoid looking at the ground until right before impact. [...] "We had to say, ‘Jump off the rock, land however you land, and go with it,’" [...] he said. [...] "When you’re doing that on a true hillside, you don’t have a choice. Gravity takes over. The only thing stopping the stunt people from dropping another thousand feet down the hillside was padding set up just outside of the shot." [...] Several stunt performers were injured after falling from the mountains, as the falls proved too difficult to control. Berg recalled, [...] "Some <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> hurt, some <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> bumped up and ribs were broken, a lung was punctured, some concussions, but these guys were determined to try and do everything they could to capture what Marcus described in the book."

Esposito was the only player on either team to score four points in a game during the series. According to Ron Ellis, he had [...] "never seen another player have a period where {{there was so much}} {{pressure}} and was still able to accomplish what he did." [...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was no stopping me. And I think some of the <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> a little angry with me. If we had lost, I would have been the goat. But we didn't lose. I just had enough faith in myself, that I was going to get it done, one way or another." ...|$|E
500|$|The next season, Whiteside {{started the}} year at Fresno again, batting [...]241 with 28 hits, six home runs, and 24 RBI in 34 games (116 at bats). However, after an elbow injury {{prevented}} Pablo Sandoval from catching, the Giants called up Whiteside to be the backup catcher for Bengie Molina on May 24, 2009. The same day, he played his first major league game in four years (and his first for a National League team). He finished {{the game with a}} hit and an RBI in three at-bats. Matt Cain said of Whiteside, [...] "He's been great. He's a guy who definitely takes advantage of his days in between, when he's not catching, and asking what guys threw in situations and what the pitches were, so he isn't thrown into the fire the days he's starting. Even if he doesn't see a team, he's still figuring out how <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> them out. He's definitely always learning." ...|$|E

500|$|Bakshi {{intended}} to attack stereotypes by portraying them directly, culling imagery from blackface iconography. Early designs {{in which the}} main characters (Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear and Preacher Fox) resembled figures from The Wind in the Willows were rejected. Bakshi juxtaposed stereotypical designs of blacks with even more negative depictions of white racists, but the film's strongest criticism is directed at the Mafia. Bakshi said, [...] "I was sick of all the hero worship these <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> because of The Godfather." [...] Production concluded in 1973. During editing, the title was changed to Coonskin No More..., and finally to Coonskin. [...] Bakshi hired several African American animators to work on Coonskin, including Brenda Banks, the first African American female animator. Bakshi also hired graffiti artists and trained them to work as animators. The film's release was delayed by protests from the Congress of Racial Equality, which called Bakshi and his film racist. After its distribution was contracted to the Bryanston Distributing Company, Paramount canceled a project that Bakshi and Ruddy were developing, The American Chronicles.|$|E
500|$|Gillom {{signed with}} the Browns in early 1947, making him the third black player to join the team after Bill Willis and Motley. Before the season started, {{he played in the}} College All-Star Game, a now-defunct matchup between the National Football League (NFL) {{champion}} and a selection of the best college players from around the country. Gillom played well in the game as the All-Stars beat the Chicago Bears, 16–0. With the Browns, Gillom was used mostly as a punter and a defensive end. He came in second in the AAFC in punting average in his rookie season at 44.6 yards as Cleveland finished the regular season with a 12–1–1 record and beat the New York Yankees to win the AAFC championship. [...] "Gillom had such a powerful leg and kicked the ball so far; before that punters used to line up 10, 12 yards behind the center", running back Sherman Howard later said. [...] "He started the 15-yard drop. And with Horace, he would kick it so high that by the time <b>guys</b> <b>got</b> down, the ball was coming down, so most guys had to fair catch." ...|$|E

They don’t deserve compassion. They deserve taxation or they deserve to have all their benefits removed." [...] When protesters conducted a 'mic check,' at one of Ron Paul's rallies, he replied, [...] "If you listen carefully, I'm very much involved with the 99. I've been condemning that 1% because they've been ripping us off.
