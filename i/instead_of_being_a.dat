25|$|Perhaps Adolphus’ {{greatest}} contribution, however, was {{his work}} in field artillery.

25|$|The hip {{could have}} major contractions or {{seizures}} from dysplasias. The caput is not deeply and tightly {{held by the}} acetabulum. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> snug fit, it is a loose fit, or a partial fit. Secondly, the caput or acetabulum are not smooth and round, but are misshapen, causing abnormal wear and tear or friction within the joint as it moves.|$|E

Marjory is {{independent}} and strong-willed, but is subdued somewhat by her love for Archibald. She is also intelligent and resourceful, and <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> passive victim, sets traps for her pursuers and leaves a trail of ciphers when she is captive to lead her friends to her.|$|E
25|$|Andes {{did make}} her first voyage on 26 September, but <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> {{passenger}} voyage from Southampton to South America {{it was a}} short crossing unladen from Belfast Lough to Holy Loch, where on 21 November the Admiralty requisitioned her to be a troop ship. She then went to Liverpool where she arrived on 26 November for modifications. Some of her passenger liner fittings were removed and stored and the remainder were panelled over with plywood.|$|E

Scriblerus does introduce the play, as in the original, but he describes the moral purpose that motivates the play <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> comical connection with another work. After revealing Fielding's design in the play, Scriblerus leaves the stage.|$|E

The prosecutor's statement said that <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> part of the university, the CI should be registered as a foreign cultural center.|$|E
25|$|The {{winner of}} the Qualifying Round played the day's {{returning}} champion in the renamed Championship Round, which kept the same line/position form of scoring. However, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> race against time, the Championship Round was a race to achieve a score of one hundred points. The normal scoring format was used until someone reached fifty points. Once that happened, the bell rang to indicate it and each word played after that was worth double the points. Whoever reached 100 points won {{the game and the}} championship and got to play the Solo Game for the jackpot.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, Francis Ford Coppola {{produced}} and directed Bram Stoker's Dracula starring Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves, and Anthony Hopkins. Coppola's story includes a backstory telling how Dracula (who is the historical Vlad Țepeș in this version) became a vampire, {{as well as}} a subplot not in Stoker's original novel in which Mina Harker was revealed to be the reincarnation of Dracula's greatest love. Dracula is portrayed as a tragic hero <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> villain, and although malevolent, his nature is one which is playful and often flirtatious, evidenced by him shaving Jonathan Harker.|$|E
25|$|Following Henry Morgan’s {{appointment}} as lieutenant governor, Port Royal began to change. Pirates {{were no longer}} needed to defend the city. The selling of slaves took on greater importance. Upstanding citizens disliked the reputation the city had acquired. In 1687, Jamaica passed anti-piracy laws. Consequently, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> safe haven for pirates, Port Royal became noted as their place of execution. Gallows Point welcomed many to their death, including Charles Vane and Calico Jack, who were hanged in 1720. About five months later, the famous woman pirate Mary Read died in the Jamaican prison in Port Royal. Two years later, 41 pirates met their death in one month.|$|E
25|$|Bruce Lewis (played by John L. Adams) — A {{physiotherapist}} {{who helps}} Johnny regain his strength after his coma. Bruce is an open-minded spiritual junkie {{as a result}} of a religious upbringing by his pastor father. He is Johnny's best friend and frequently his voice of reason, and may very well be the reason for the divergence in this series when compared to the novel or 1983 movie (Johnny never tried to kill Greg Stillson before the election). An episode in season 2 even featured a vision of an alternate reality where <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> physical therapist, Bruce was a reverend who never met Johnny after waking up from his coma. And thus, with the absence of his guidance, this version of Johnny became unstable, deranged, and driven mad by his abilities.|$|E

25|$|Herxheim {{contained}} 173 {{skulls and}} skull-plates, and the scattered remains {{of at least}} 450 individuals. Two complete skeletons were found inside the inner ditch. The crania from these bodies were discovered at regular intervals in the two defensive ditches surrounding the site. After the victims were decapitated, their heads were either thrown into the ditch or placed on top of posts that later collapsed inside the ditch. The heads showed signs of trauma from axes and one other weapon. Moreover, the organized placing of the skulls suggests a recurrent ritual act, instead of a single instance. Herxheim also contained various high-quality pottery artifacts and animal bones associated with the human remains. Unlike the mass burial at Talheim, scientists have concluded that <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> fortification, Herxheim was an enclosed center for ritual.|$|E
500|$|Courses {{range from}} beaches with debris-littered water to swamps and ice-covered mountains. The game has its {{variant of the}} {{traditional}} race track, but also introduces a new course type known as a Suicide course. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> continuous loop, these tracks have checkpoints {{at either end of}} the course, and the starting grid in the center. [...] Riders race to one end, then turn around to head for the other checkpoint, repeating the process until all laps are complete. [...] This provides a new gameplay dynamic as often the player must navigate oncoming traffic.|$|E
