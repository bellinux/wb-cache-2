For the Navy was his family, the junior {{officers}} he trained and the enlisted men who did {{so much of the}} hand-labor in the boats. He served with distinction approaching perfection and, like his father, would then write about the things he'd seen and done... More than once <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> about the psychological aspects of combat, and every time he told me what I needed to know, always from his own rich experiences. Ned was a serious student of history -- he wrote several splendid books on this subject -- and of human nature. What he didn't know had never happened.|$|E
6000|$|Soon Bes and I {{were in our}} chariot {{which by}} command took place in line {{with that of the}} King, but at a {{distance}} of some thirty steps. Bending over the dwarf who drove, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> saying, ...|$|E

After that impious feast the other night <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> and urged him then to check [...] 30 Your father's cruel hand; he frowned and said, 'Children are disobedient, and they sting Their fathers' hearts to madness and despair, Requiting years of care with contumely. I pity the Count Cenci from my heart; [...] 35 His outraged love perhaps awakened hate, And thus he is exasperated to ill. In the great war between the old and young I, who have white hairs and a tottering body, Will keep at least blameless neutrality.' [...] 40 [ENTER ORSINO.] You, my good Lord Orsino, heard those words.|$|E

60|$|Isa. When physic's past, {{what remains}} but to send for the divine? here's little Nicodemus, your father's chaplain: <b>I</b> have <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> already; for a brace of angels he shall make all sure betwixt you without a license; aye, and prove ten at night a more {{canonical}} hour than ten i'the morning.|$|R

6000|$|... "The king already hesitates. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> this morning, and {{his mind}} was full of {{blackness}} and despair. His better self turns in disgust from his sins, {{and it is now}} when the first hot fit of repentance is just coming upon him that he may best be moulded to our ends. I have to see and speak with him once more, and I go from your room to his. And when I have spoken, he will come from his room to yours, or I have studied his heart for twenty years in vain. We leave you now, and you will not see us, but you will see the effects of what we do, and you will remember your pledge to us." [...] They bowed low to her both together, and left her to her thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of {{course the}} {{recollection}} of my last conversation with Brierly is tinged {{with the knowledge}} of his end that followed so close upon it. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> for the last time during the progress of the inquiry. It was after the first adjournment, and he came up with me in the street. He {{was in a state of}} irritation, which I noticed with surprise, his usual behaviour when he condescended to converse being perfectly cool, with a trace of amused tolerance, as if the existence of his interlocutor had been a rather good joke. [...] "They caught me for that inquiry, you see," [...] he began, and for a while enlarged complainingly upon the inconveniences of daily attendance in court. [...] "And goodness knows how long it will last. Three days, I suppose." [...] I heard him out in silence; in my then opinion it was a way as good as another of putting on side. [...] "What's the use of it? It is the stupidest set-out you can imagine," [...] he pursued hotly. I remarked that there was no option. He interrupted me with a sort of pent-up violence. [...] "I feel like a fool all the time." [...] I looked up at him. This was going very far--for Brierly--when talking of Brierly. He stopped short, and seizing the lapel of my coat, gave it a slight tug. [...] "Why are we tormenting that young chap?" [...] he asked. This question chimed in so well to the tolling of a certain thought of mine that, with the image of the absconding renegade in my eye, I answered at once, [...] "Hanged if I know, unless it be that he lets you." [...] I was astonished to see him fall into line, so to speak, with that utterance, which ought to have been tolerably cryptic. He said angrily, [...] "Why, yes. Can't he see that wretched skipper of his has cleared out? What does he expect to happen? Nothing can save him. He's done for." [...] We walked on in silence a few steps. [...] "Why eat all that dirt?" [...] he exclaimed, with an oriental energy of expression--about the only sort of energy you can find a trace of east of the fiftieth meridian. I wondered greatly at the direction of his thoughts, but now I strongly suspect it was strictly in character: at bottom poor Brierly must have been thinking of himself. I pointed out to him that the skipper of the Patna was known to have feathered his nest pretty well, and could procure almost anywhere the means of getting away. With Jim it was otherwise: the Government was keeping him in the Sailors' Home for the time being, and probably he hadn't a penny in his pocket to bless himself with. It costs some money to run away. [...] "Does it? Not always," [...] he said, with a bitter laugh, and to some further remark of mine--"Well, then, let him creep twenty feet underground and stay there! By heavens! I would." [...] I don't know why his tone provoked me, and I said, [...] "There is a kind of courage in facing it out as he does, knowing very well that if he went away nobody would trouble to run after him." [...] "Courage be hanged!" [...] growled Brierly. [...] "That sort of courage is of no use to keep a man straight, and I don't care a snap for such courage. If you were to say it was a kind of cowardice now--of softness. I tell you what, I will put up two hundred rupees if you put up another hundred and undertake to make the beggar clear out early to-morrow morning. The fellow's a gentleman if he ain't fit to be touched--he will understand. He must! This infernal publicity is too shocking: there he sits while all these confounded natives, serangs, lascars, quartermasters, are giving evidence that's enough to burn a man to ashes with shame. This is abominable. Why, Marlow, don't you think, don't you feel, that this is abominable; don't you now--come--as a seaman? If he went away all this would stop at once." [...] Brierly said these words with a most unusual animation, and made as if to reach after his pocket-book. I restrained him, and declared coldly that the cowardice of these four men did not seem to me a matter of such great importance. [...] "And you call yourself a seaman, I suppose," [...] he pronounced angrily. I said that's what I called myself, and I hoped I was too. He heard me out, and made a gesture with his big arm that seemed to deprive me of my individuality, to push me away into the crowd. [...] "The worst of it," [...] he said, [...] "is that all you fellows have no sense of dignity; you don't think enough of what you are supposed to be." ...|$|E

40|$|According to Chilean poet Juan Luis Martínez’s {{groundbreaking}} art object La nueva novela (The New Novel, 1977), “The {{universe is}} a phantom’s effort to become reality. ”[1] In July 2014 I found that phantom. His name is Juan (Luis) Martinez {{and he is}} a retired journalist and aid worker for the International Committee of the Red Cross. This Swiss-Catalan writer currently resides in the Valais Alps, 200 kilometers from Geneva, and he had never read more than a passing reference to his Chilean double — which he largely ignored — until <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> on July 29, 2014...|$|R
5000|$|According to Mike Gordon in The Phish Book: [...] "My fiance Cilla Foster was {{responsible}} for our first tour. In 1988 she was waitressing in Telluride for a guy named Warren Stickney. I didn't know her very well at the time, but one day she called and said Stickney wanted us to come play in his bar. We'd never played further away from home than New Hampshire at the time, but Stickney promised to book a monthlong tour across the country. It took another six months to {{get him on the}} phone again, but <b>I</b> finally <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> about a week before we were supposed to hit the road. He said something like, 'I don't know if I can get you any other gigs, but you can play my place and I'll pay you a thousand bucks.' I couldn't get him on the phone after that, so the six of us - including Paul Languedoc and Tim Rogers, who was doing lights - decided to go for it anyway.|$|R
5000|$|The second claim {{comes from}} the Norwegian {{historian}} Rune Slagstad, who claims to prove that Kierkegaard himself said the term [...] "existential" [...] was borrowed from the poet. He strongly believes that it was Kierkegaard himself who said that [...] "Hegelians do not study philosophy 'existentially'; to use a phrase by Welhaven from one time when <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> about philosophy". On the other hand, the Norwegian historian Anne-Lise Seip is critical of Slagstad, and believes the statement in fact stems from the Norwegian literary historian Cathrinus Bang.|$|E

5000|$|Then {{one morning}} comes which I shall never forget. Coincidentally I get a {{newspaper}} {{in my hands and}} I see that Van Gogh is a famous painter. Well, I thought, now I understand how that Mr. Mouwen could make me earn 25 cents on a painting! <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and we agreed that I would try to find the people to whom I had sold paintings for a dime and fifteen cents, and ask them to sell the pictures back. We have been busy with that for a while. For example, there was a farmer who had two pieces of me. I went to the man and said: can I have them back for a two and half guilders? And he gave them for 2.50 guilders. ... It was a strange story. To get them back I had to pay fifty, sixty, seventy guilders to the parents of the children to whom I had sold those paintings.|$|E
6000|$|What {{it cost me}} to {{preserve}} the outward appearance of composure as I handed back the letter, I am ashamed to tell. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to <b>him</b> <b>with</b> some bitterness. [...] "Your wishes are gratified," [...] I said; [...] "I don't wonder that you are eager to leave your place." [...] He reined back his horse and repeated my words. [...] "Eager to leave my place? I am heart-broken at leaving it." [...] I was reckless enough to ask why. His head sank. [...] "I daren't tell you," [...] he said. I went on from one imprudence to another. [...] "What are you afraid of?" [...] I asked. He suddenly looked up at me. His eyes answered: [...] "You." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear! my dear!" [...] he cried, [...] "what a {{piece of}} news have I for you! It is {{incredible}} and past all belief! Who, ladies, do you suppose is here in New Hope? Nay, you cannot guess; I shall have to enlighten you. 'Tis none other than Frederick Dunburne, my lordship's second son. Yes, you may well look amazed. <b>I</b> saw and <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> this very morning, and that not above a half-hour ago. He is travelling incognito, but my brother Obadiah discovered his identity, and is now entertaining him at his new house upon the Point. A large party of young officers from the garrison are there, all very gay with cards and dice, I am told. My noble young gentleman knew me so soon as he clapped eyes upon me. 'This,' says he, 'if I am not mistook, must be Colonel Belford, my father's honored friend.' He is," [...] exclaimed the speaker, [...] "a most interesting and ingenuous youth, with extremely lively and elegant manners, and a person exactly resembling that of his dear and honored father." ...|$|R

5000|$|Following {{the death}} of co-founder and host Ryan Davis in 2013, Ryckert and fellow Game Informer staff member Jason Oestreicher joined Giant Bomb in 2014 as senior content {{producer}} and video producer, first introducing themselves on the Giant Bombcast. Succeeding what Vice described as a year of emptiness, mourning and with a gap in editorial, the magazine said that the hiring of Ryckert, Oestreicher and news editor Austin Walker together ensured that [...] "Giant Bomb has a future." [...] I wish I could've known Ryan better - Whenever <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> he was just the nicest, funniest guy in the world, I never considered myself a replacement and it was never presented to me as such. I'm just the new guy. I'm pretty public about my issues with anxiety so doing these panels and being in front of camera is certainly nerve-racking, but I've really enjoyed getting my personality out there. I love pro wrestling, and I've always loved the idea of these big personalities, but I never could be a wrestler because I'm tiny and weak. When I first came to Giant Bomb I could finally be that. It was a release for me. Dan Ryckert, September 30th, 2015 October 2014 saw Ryckert and Jeff Gerstmann compete against each other at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California. The mock competition saw them attempting {{to make the most}} progress in Super Mario Bros. 3 on the Nintendo 3DS while riding on the theme park's Medusa steel roller coaster. Publications with articles on the video such as Polygon and The A.V. Club joined in with the joke, with Polygon saying that it was [...] "a glorious display of video game endurance. Possibly stupidity as well. But mostly, endurance."Metal Gear Scanlon was a Let's Play show for paid subscribers that ran from 2014 to 2017 in which Metal Gear Solid expert Ryckert guided Drew Scanlon through his first playthroughs of the Metal Gear franchise games. In a Metal Gear guide James Davenport of PC Gamer cited Metal Gear Scanlon as his favourite method of watching start to finish playthroughs of Metal Gear Solid games.Ryckert relocated to New York and starting working out of Giant Bomb's New York office, becoming a permanent fixture on the Giant Beastcast podcast.|$|E
40|$|The {{third time}} I visited D. Carleton Gajdusek, an {{ambulance}} was blocking {{the street outside}} his apartment building in Amsterdam. It had been there some time, and the drivers of the cars behind it lounged about outside. Some shook their heads and muttered to themselves or talked loudly into their mobile phones; some walked up and down; some shrugged their shoulders; others smoked cigarettes and waited patiently. Although it was summer, a misty Dutch rain had started to fall. I went inside and quickly {{up the stairs to}} his room. A large, thickset man, partly dressed, was arguing with the ambulance officers. It was Carleton, who did not want them {{to take him to the}} emergency room at the Amsterdam Medical Center. He shouted and waved his arms in the air and paced the room. A friend of his who was visiting had called them an hour earlier. She told me it seemed he was having a stroke, though the incident lasted only a fewminutes. As he recovered, his speech slurred and he became angry and aggressive. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> trying to calm him and persuade him to go to hospital, if only for a checkup.
