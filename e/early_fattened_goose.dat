At the best moment {{to start this}} activity, just after the rainy season, high demand for these pigs induced higher prices and low margins. The start after the rainy season does not fit in the existing production system as farmers sell their surplus pigs {{before and during the}} rainy season. Traditional pig fattening lasts 3 years. About 60 women in 8 villages tested <b>early</b> <b>fattening</b> of young piglets. Piglets of the treatment were supplemented with a special concentrate and showed higher daily weight gains compared to the traditionally fed group. The gross margin of the <b>early</b> <b>fattening</b> was equal to the recommended pig fattening, but the first solved problems related to availability of piglets and thus fits better in the existing production system. Almost half of the <b>early</b> <b>fattened</b> pigs were sold within a year. Most of the women appreciated the experiment positively and suggested positive margins can be attained by selecting suitable piglets and rigorously respecting feeding and management schemes. Criteria were developed for selecting the most suitable piglets with a simple tailor tape.

40|$|In boars, social {{relationships}} could influence pubertal development and feeding behaviour. The {{objectives of the}} present study were to determine the relationships between behaviour (agonistic, mounting and feeding behaviours), plasma sex steroids (oestradiol, testosterone) and fat androstenone. A total of 270 Pietrain x Large White boars, derived from four distinct genotypes were used. They were raised in groups of 11 - 12 pigs/pen. Animals were observed for about two times 10 h/day at the beginning or about 6 h at the end of fattening. Agonistic (fighting, hitting, biting, threatening, chasing) and sexual (mounting) behaviours were counted in <b>early</b> <b>fattening</b> shortly after a social mixing (for 177 of the 270 animals) and in late fattening after several weeks of social stability. Skin lesions were counted in the same periods and on carcasses. Data obtained from electronic feeders were used to determine the number and duration of meals, and the feed intake over 96 -h periods in the middle {{and at the end of}} fattening. At the end of fattening, blood was sampled to measure oestradiol and testosterone. At slaughter, fat was collected to measure androstenone. Using the agonistic behaviours, a dominance index was calculated (DRrank). As expected, numbers of skin lesions and agonistic acts were higher in <b>early</b> <b>fattening</b> (P < 0. 0001) whereas that of mounting acts was lower in early than in late fattening (P < 0. 05). The feeding characteristics (r = 0. 25 to 0. 39) were significantly correlated between ages, whereas numbers of mountings (r = 0. 18), of skin lesions (r = 0. 05) and agonistic acts (r =- 0. 05) were not. The number of agonistic acts was significantly correlated with that of mountings only-in <b>early</b> <b>fattening</b> (r = 0. 38). At both ages, no difference between dominance groups was observed for feeding characteristics. This was probably related to low competition between boars for access to feed. Dominant boars had a higher concentration of androstenone in fat than subordinates (P < 0. 05) but no difference was observed for plasma steroids.

40|$|SummaryMedical {{etymology}} sometimes provides unexpected {{information about}} health concepts and medical practice in {{different times and}} cultures. We conducted an etymological analysis of the terms used to indicate “liver” in Germanic and Romance languages. The Greek word “hèpar” was originally connected {{to the concept of}} “pleasure”, showing that in antiquity the liver was considered to be the seat of soul and human feelings. In Romance languages, the Latin term “ficatum” was linked to the ancient practice of <b>fattening</b> <b>geese</b> with figs (ficus in Latin) to make their livers more delicious. This relationship between the liver, fat, and carbohydrates seems to indicate that ancient gourmets had clear knowledge of the nutritional mechanisms underlying “fatty liver” in animals. On the other hand, the Germanic term “lifere” was initially connected to “life”, underscoring the relation of the liver to health and existence. In the Early Modern Age, the liver became a recurring image in political reflection, especially within the Elizabethan tradition of the body politic, where the king was frequently described as the “liver” of his country. Finally, the liver was used to indicate courage, or the lack of it: some modern French and English idiomatic expressions derive from the ancient belief that people who had no blood in their liver (“lily-livered”) would thus be cowards or betrayers...|$|R

40|$|The Coastal Zone of Western Desert (CZWD) Egypt, {{extended}} from Alexandria East to Libyan border West, {{is a hot}} dry area of < 150 mm annual rainfall; the area had faced 14 years of drought from 1995 to 2011. Field survey {{has been carried out}} with the Bedouins in the area to assess the effect of such long drought incidence on their socioeconomic vulnerability and livestock production systems, upon which they rely for sustaining their livelihood. The study covered 182 breeders during the Summer 2011, distributed over 3 agro-ecological zones; the rain-fed area (West), the new reclaimed land (East) and Siwa desert oasis (South). The breeders in the rain-fed area who were affected more by the incidence of drought, had to take some radical measures to cope with such prolonged drought. One of which is reducing their flock size from 201 heads, in average, by 1995 to 115 in 2011. Raising more goats was another means in their adaptive strategy to the incidence of long drought. Goat percent in the oasis flocks has been raised from 32 in 1995 to 56 % in 2011, and in the rain-fed area from 20. 7 to 22. 5 %. Twenty percent of the breeders in the oasis raised only goats. The situation differs in the new reclaimed lands, with the availability of the cultivated green fodder and crop residues, the breeders increased their flock size from 161 heads in 1995 to 234 in 2011, mostly from sheep. Goats contribute significantly to the nutritional status of the householders in the 3 agro ecological zones; in average family consumed 15 % of their goats for the family meat requirement in the rain-fed and oasis areas. More than 50 % of the cash income of the breeders in the rain-fed area during 2011 came from selling weaned kids and lambs, 62 % in the oasis from <b>early</b> <b>fattened</b> kids and lambs, and 42 % in the reclaimed land came from selling late fattening lambs. Raising goats seems to be an effective adaptive process to cope with the long drought incidence in the hot dry region.

At this season several {{thousands}} of birds are killed; and the old ones, as if to defend their brood, hover {{over the heads of the}} Indians, uttering terrible cries. The young, which fall to the ground, are opened on the spot. Their peritoneum is extremely loaded with fat, and a layer of fat reaches from the abdomen to the anus, forming a kind of cushion between the legs of the bird. This quantity of fat in frugivorous animals, not exposed to the light, and exerting very little muscular motion, reminds us of what has been long since observed in the <b>fattening</b> of <b>geese</b> and oxen. It is well known how favourable darkness and repose are to this process. The nocturnal birds of Europe are lean, because, instead of feeding on fruits, like the Guacharo, they live on the scanty produce of their prey. At the period which is commonly called at Caripe the [...] "oil harvest," [...] the Indians build huts with palm-leaves near the entrance, and even in the porch of the cavern. Of these we still saw some remains. There, with a fire of brushwood, they melt in pots of clay the fat of the young birds just killed. This fat is known by the name of butter or oil (manteca or aceite) of the Guacharo. It is half liquid, transparent without smell, and so pure that it may be kept above a year without becoming rancid. At the convent of Caripe no other oil is used in the kitchen of the monks but that of the cavern; and we never observed that it gave the aliments a disagreeable taste or smell.|$|R
50|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the counts}} or their fiefholders, {{by way of}} the Schultheißen and with help from the Vögte, drew income owed by the peasants. This was destined partly for themselves, but also partly for their lords, the Waldgraves. These {{payments}} were what would be called taxes today. The heftiest among these was der große Zehnt - “the great tithe”. The knight’s Vogt came by horse right onto the field and set aside the ten best sheaves for the lord. All other obligations had been laid down long before in the municipality’s Weistum. These were read out yearly on New Year’s Day, the day when the thing was held. The lordship needed everything, from hay for horse fodder to honey for their dining tables to beeswax for their candles. It goes without saying that they also needed goose feathers, flax and finished linens, along with eggs, <b>fattened</b> <b>geese</b> (for Martinmas), and also Shrovetide chickens, flitches of bacon and smoked meat, all of which had to be delivered on particular days throughout the year. The lord’s tithe barns with their cellars and storage rooms are still in living memory in Löllbach. Older villagers remember that one stood in what is now Karl Herrmann’s garden. It may well have reached across the modern street, Schweinschieder Weg, for behind the municipally owned memorial square is today still found a cellar from the old Kyrburg landhold. The other tithe barn stood in what is now the Family Paulus’s small front garden, just outside the school windows. It, too, would have been of quite a size. Der kleine Zehnt - “the little tithe” - had to be paid, for example, on the occasion of a wedding, while after a family head’s death, the so-called Besthaupt (“best head”) was payable, wherein the heirs took the best head of livestock from the stable - meaning the one that was worth the most - to be paid as a kind of death duty. It should not be overlooked that the exact terms of taxation were not always pursued with the utmost insistence. There are known cases in which judicious lords supported the bereaved with benevolence and charity in special cases. Responsible for oversight and management {{under the terms of the}} Weistum was the Schultheiß. Above him was the Oberamt administration in Kirn. His yearly remuneration was 12 Rhenish guilders, 5 Albus, 8 Malter of corn (likely either wheat or rye), three Malter of oats; he was also accorded personal and material freedom. If the taxes were manifold and high, more burdensome still was the unfree labour also laid down in the Weistum. The lord’s livestock grazed on the “Herrenwasem”. Parts of this field were also laid out as a cropfield. It was the lord who reaped the field’s yield, but the peasant was the one who did all the unpaid work. The same was true over at the “Herrenberg”, the lord’s vineyards. Indeed, all work in the fields and vineyards was done as compulsory labour on the lord’s orders, and it was overseen by the Vogt (reeve). One only needs to look carefully at the land to see clearly where the pond could have lain. There, the lord’s carp were big, and at Shrovetide, the pond was fished clean to fill the lord’s table. Of course, all the fishing and other jobs done at the pond were also unfree work. It is likely that the reeve and the count guessed that this work led to the odd carp landing on a peasant’s table. Unfree labour done for the lord came before one’s own farming, of course, meaning that the peasants’ own harvest was often rained out or because of the inevitable neglect otherwise spoilt. Even the unfree workers’ food and drink were often laid down in the Weistum. Everything done for the lord was unpaid: building the lord’s castle; repairing walls and paths; transporting stone; lugging the tithes to the Kyrburg; supplying young boys and girls to work at the castle; running the lord’s errands from castle to castle.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIntramuscular {{fat content}} is {{important}} for many meat quality parameters. This work is aimed at identifying functional categories of genes associated with natural variation among individuals in intramuscular fat content to help the design of genetic schemes for high marbling potential. Taking advantage of the global nature of transcriptomic and proteomic technologies, 40 genes were identified as differently expressed between high fat and low fat pig Longissimus muscles at slaughter weight. They are involved in metabolic processes, cell communication, binding, and response to stimulus. Using real-time PCR in muscle biopsies taken <b>earlier</b> in the <b>fattening</b> period, the group with a high intramuscular fat content was also characterized by the down-expression of genes playing a negative role in adipogenesis, such as architectural transcription factor high-motility hook A 1, mitogen activated protein-kinase 14, and cyclin D 1. These results suggest that interindividual variability in intramuscular fat content might arise essentially from differences in early adipogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural and {{physiological}} changes during the reproductive period were documented in male European ground squirrels including: initiated conflict, scent marking, locomotion and range size, {{as well as}} testis size, scrotal pigmentation, testosterone levels and changes in body mass. Spring emergence dates in adult males varied but preceded those of females. Gonadal maturation was complete in adult males at emergence. Most yearlings did not mature and emerged with females. After a quiescent premating phase, male range, range overlap, conflict rates and locomotion increased at female emergence. The synchrony of females, their small ranges and short latencies to ovulation produced a highly male-biased operational sex ratio (OSR) and potential for scramble competition polygyny. In contrast to other ground squirrel species, each female apparently mated with only a single male. Scramble competition did appear to occur, in that males tried to contact as many females {{as often as possible}} before copulation. Females placed high temporal prerequisites on males. Costs of scrambling were documented by body mass loss during mating, which covaried with the number of 'acquired' females. Testicular regression occurred <b>earlier,</b> and <b>fattening,</b> moult and onset of next hibernation were delayed in successful males. The determinant factor in these costs was found to be mass loss intensity during the main mating period. Surprisingly, this factor was best related to feeding changes and not to locomotion or aggression. Time budget constraints perhaps imposed by the female, with compounding influences of exercise and stress effects of conflict, then negatively affected ensuing seasonal activities. The individual changes may adversely affect individual survivability and/or future reproductive success. ...|$|R

30|$|Our data {{indicate}} that in remote rural counties of the Mongolian Altai mountains, livestock losses in the 2009 / 10 dzud were very high and in particular affected herders with smaller and/or goat-dominated herds, who often were of Kazakh and Uriankhai ethnicity. Whereas Uriankhai households and the wealthier Torguud herders pursued a quick re-stocking of herds, small-scale Kazakh herders abandoned livestock-keeping. For a majority of herders, local ecological knowledge of predicting harsh winters and taking precautions against such disaster gained importance only after the 2009 / 10 dzud. Therefore, priority was given to hay-making and winter pen preparation, whereas improvement of livestock productivity through segregated grazing (otor) of selected animals, frequent pastureland rotation of the main herd, controlled mating and <b>early</b> sale of <b>fattened</b> as well as skinny livestock were sometimes mentioned but hardly practiced. Since animals that enter the winter season in healthy and well-fed condition are more resistant against disaster than lean animals, national and international organizations wishing to support livestock keepers in this and similar regions should highlight the relevance of these local approaches. However, labour investments in refined herding strategies, hay-making and winter pen preparation can be substantial and surpass the capacities of individual households. Therefore, community-based activities are highly advisable.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese or Lop-Eared cat is most interesting, {{because it}} {{provides}} proof that by continual disuse of an organ, the organ withers. With the Chinese cat the hearing and ears have deteriorated. Michel says the Chinese, not only admire the cat in porcelain, but also value it for culinary reasons. The cats are regarded as special morsels and enjoyed particularly with noodles or with rice. This cat is bred particularly {{for the purpose of}} meat production, and is a preferred Chinese morsel; this is not unusual if one considers that the Chinese consume much the sight of which revolts the stomachs of Europeans. The poor creature is confined in small bamboo cages and <b>fattened</b> like a <b>goose</b> on plentiful portions. There is extensive trade with other parts of Asia and the canny Chinese allow no tomcats to be exported so there is no interference in this lucrative source of income.Due to the restrictive conditions that have deprived the cat of its actual use, its hearing has decreased because it is no longer needed for hunting its own food. With no need for watchfulness, it had no need of sharp hearing to listen for hidden things so its hearing became blunted and as a natural consequence its ears lost their upright nature, gradually becoming lower and becoming the hanging ear that is now the characteristic feature of the Chinese cat. At first impression this is a surprising and amusing look, but this impression is lost with closer examination. If one ignores the characteristic of the ears, one sees a beauty similar to the Angora cat: a long, close coat of hair, albeit less rich, covers the body. The hair is silky-soft and shining and the colour is usually isabelline or a dirty white yellow, although some have the usual colouring of the common house-cat. In size it is considerably larger and stronger than a housecat. The ears hang completely, as with our hunting dogs and are large in relation to the cat.Although the Chinese cat is found in considerable numbers in its homeland, it is rarely found at European animal markets. Only one such cat has reached us in the flesh; we acquired this years ago when a sailor returning from China brought it into Hamburg. The accompanying illustration is based on this cat. In character it is like the Angora cat and somewhat languid. It prefer to live by a warm fire, is rather sensitive to flattery, hears badly and is at its most animated when given milk or food. Apart from its unusual ears, it has no really attractive characteristics and is a curious specimen of housecat.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Goma district of Jimma Zone of Ethiopia with objectives of generating baseline information and identifying challenges and opportunities of small ruminant production and marketing. Results are based on diagnostic survey of 160 sample households, group discussions, monitoring of 36 flocks and rapid appraisal of major sheep and goat markets. The study district was stratified into three groups based on flock distribution as: sheep dominating, goat dominating and mixed flock sites. The average land holding per household was 1. 93 ha. On average, a household owned 3. 6 cattle, 3. 6 sheep, 2. 1 goats, 0. 2 equines and 2. 7 chickens. In Goma where coffee and chat are the major cash sources for farmers, small ruminant are mainly kept for cash generation and saving in time of coffee failure. About 94 % of the small ruminant owners reported to keep them for income generation. The second main reason for keeping small ruminant in the study area was for saving purpose. Keeping small ruminant for manure purpose was the third important reason. Other important reasons included for meat production and for risk distribution. Farmers kept larger proportion of female animals than male animals and it was rare to find male of advanced age as they were sold or slaughtered at <b>early</b> age. <b>Fattening</b> small ruminants is commonly practiced by most farmers and nowadays getting more attention due to high market demand and better prices. From the interviewed households, 59. 4 %, 32. 1, 23. 5 %, and 19. 4 % of them utilize communal grazing, after math grazing, roadside grazing, and riverside grazing, respectively. Most small ruminants are either tethered or herded all the seasons due to the cultivation of perennial crops and predators. All small ruminants are housed for protection from adverse weather conditions and predators. Most lambings and kiddings occurred in the main rainy season. The average litter size, birth weight (kg), and weaning weight (kg) of sheep were found to be: 1. 37, 2. 86 and 11. 59, respectively. The corresponding values for goats were 1. 6, 2. 76, and 9, respectively. There are five towns where small ruminants were marketed in addition to many villages that were used as primary market sources for small ruminants. Farmers, traders, brokers, restaurant/hotel owners, butchers are the major market participants. There is one main market route i. e., from Agaro to Addis. The major problems for small ruminant production and marketing were: feed and grazing land shortage, lack of input, predators, diseases and parasites and marketing problems. In order to utilize the current growing demand of small ruminant meat at local and international markets, identification of alternative feed resources and strategic feeding management, identification of causes of diseases and their control methods as well as improving marketing efficiency through appropriate policy and provision of information are areas of interventions.
