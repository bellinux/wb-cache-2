5|$|Executive {{producer}} Akitoshi Kawazu {{was pleased}} by Famitsus rating but admitted that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> game was not perfect; {{he felt that}} the storyline did not meet some fans' expectations. Kawazu expressed his frustration and regrets regarding the storyline, citing creative differences between the PlayOnline and Final Fantasy Tactics members of the development team.|$|E
5|$|A year {{prior to}} Kameo release, GamesRadar wrote {{that while they}} highly {{anticipated}} the title and {{expected it to be}} of high quality, they thought the game's continual delays would likely hurt the final product. Closer to release, Tom Bramwell (Eurogamer) added that he had expected the game to be the best among the Xbox 360 launch titles. Kameo core gameplay concept brought his anticipation to par with that customary for The Legend of Zelda titles, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> game would reap the benefits of its long development through refined audiovisuals. Xbox executive Peter Moore announced Kameo as his favorite launch title in anticipation of the Xbox 360's launch.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 2002 season, Thome, who was a free agent, rejected the Indians' offer, to instead sign a six-year, $85 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies – <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Phillies were closer to winning a championship than the Indians. With the Phillies, Thome's salary rose from $8 million per year to $11 million per year. Thome hit a franchise record 334 home runs in his first stint with the Indians.|$|E

60|$|Resolved {{not to be}} beaten, {{the unfortunate}} Irishman sat down again, and again started up, but, feeling ashamed, {{suddenly}} flung himself flat on his back, held his breath, and ground his teeth together. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> of gridirons; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>the</b> rack; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of purgatory; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>the</b> propriety of starting up and of tearing limb from limb the attendant, who, with a quiet smile, lay down beside him and shut his eyes; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>the</b> impossibility of bearing it an instant longer; and then <b>he</b> suddenly <b>thought</b> that it felt a little easier. From this point he began to experience sensations that were slightly pleasurable, and a profuse perspiration broke out over his whole body.|$|R

5|$|Because of Billingsley's long-standing {{friendship}} with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged. During {{his work on}} the Stork Club book, author and New York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing the file to the tapes, said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Stork Club incident was overblown.|$|E
5|$|Brocius waived the {{preliminary}} hearing so he and his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson. Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon {{the next day to}} Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius' pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional. Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death.|$|E
5|$|For his part, Thompson said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> {{judge was}} trying to protect Moore's {{criminal}} conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney {{who claimed to have}} influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.|$|E

5|$|Frank Oz said The Land of Gorch {{experiment}} had its positives and negatives. Oz said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> routine {{was not a}} {{good fit}} for Saturday Night Live, and that the cartoon-style humor of their characters did not work well with the comedy of Saturday Night Live, much of which was initially derived from the Second City environment. Oz said he generally enjoyed working on Saturday Night Live and witnessing the skill of performers such as Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Wilder's agent {{sent him}} a script for a film called Super Chief. Wilder accepted, but told the film's {{producers}} that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> only person who could keep the film from being offensive was Richard Pryor. Pryor accepted the role in the film, which had been renamed Silver Streak, the first film to team Wilder and Pryor. They became Hollywood's first successful interracial movie comedy duo.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others {{not directly related to}} the author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E

5|$|According to Kaneko, {{the reason}} for {{choosing}} the Judeo-Christian god, YHVH, as the game's antagonist, was that he saw YHVH as the base for all other gods around the world: Having observed common motives throughout different mythologies, such as the flood {{and the creation of}} the world, he reasoned that they all originated in one single mythology, which had been changed as people took it with them, leading to modern-day myths. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> original mythology would be the Old Testament, and therefore considered YHVH the folkloristic base of all gods. Despite casting YHVH as the antagonist, Kaneko noted that he did not intend for YHVH to be evil incarnate in Megami Tensei.|$|E
5|$|According to Meintjes, Kruger {{was still}} not {{particularly}} anti-British; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> British {{had made a mistake}} and would rectify the situation if this could be proven to them. After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure—587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against—he organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication that since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> noise came from a firecracker.|$|E

5|$|Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas were Glimcher's ideal {{choices for}} the roles of Cesar and Nestor Castillo. Prior to The Mambo Kings, Assante had {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} films but had not yet broken out as a major star. Banderas, a Spanish actor, had moved to Los Angeles, California, hoping to make an international debut with his first English speaking role. Warner Bros., however, wanted to cast Jeremy Irons as Cesar and Ray Liotta as Nestor. Both actors had received critical acclaim for their performances in Reversal of Fortune and Goodfellas respectively, and the studio felt that they would appeal to a wider audience. Through a translator, Glimcher told Banderas to work on improving his English for one month before performing a screen test opposite Irons. The Spanish actor, lacking the ability to speak English, learned his lines phonetically. Despite Irons's excellent screen test, Glimcher thought he was wrong for the part and insisted on Assante; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> charm and seductiveness of Assante made him perfect for the role, and the studio eventually gave in.|$|E
5|$|Catesby {{waited for}} Percy's {{return from the}} north, before making his decision. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> letter too vague to {{constitute}} any meaningful threat to the plan, and decided to forge ahead. As Fawkes made a final check on the gunpowder, other conspirators took up their positions in the Midlands. Salisbury, already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, did not yet know {{the exact nature of}} the plot or who exactly was involved. He elected to wait, to see how events unfolded. On 3November, Catesby met with Wintour and Percy in London. Although the nature of their discussion is unknown, Fraser theorises that some adjustment of their plan to abduct Princess Elizabeth may have occurred, as later accounts told how Percy had been seen at the Duke of York's lodgings, enquiring as to the movements of the king's daughter. Nicholls mentions that a week earlier—on the same day that Monteagle received his letter—Catesby was at White Webbs with Fawkes, to discuss kidnapping Prince Henry rather than Princess Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|Christian Donlan of Eurogamer was {{surprised}} by the long length of the game and the amount of variety it offered given its simple premise. He enjoyed the game's pacing and felt that separating puzzles into short levels kept the game fun. Game Informer reviewer Kyle Hilliard also approved of the game's pacing. He remarked that BoxBoy!s low price and well-designed puzzles made it entirely worth playing. VentureBeat writer Gavin Greene agreed that the game offered a lot of content at an inexpensive price. The game's structure did draw some criticism from Jon Wahlgren, writing for Nintendo Life. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> game spent too much time teaching new mechanics and did not give players enough freedom to explore or experiment; as a result he believed the game felt restricted.|$|E

5|$|Conscription for the Army, {{but not for}} {{civilian}} industry, had been brought in {{during the first half}} of 1916. Towards the end of Asquith’s Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville’s brother Austen, but it had no executive powers. After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> task of building up a new ministry was beyond him, Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen. In December 1916, the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. Though reluctant to leave his post in Birmingham, Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} Pompeii, he lost his passport, {{and went back to}} the amphitheatre he had visited earlier in the day in order to find it. Walking around the deserted ruins, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> silence and natural ambient sounds present would make a good {{backdrop}} for the music. He also felt that filming the band without an audience would be a good reaction to earlier films such as Woodstock and Gimme Shelter, where the films paid equal attention to performers and spectators. One of Maben's contacts at the University of Naples, a professor who was a Pink Floyd fan, managed to persuade the local authorities to close the amphitheatre for six days that October for filming.|$|E
5|$|In December, Longstreet's First Corps {{played the}} decisive {{role in the}} Battle of Fredericksburg. Since Lee moved Longstreet to Fredericksburg early, it allowed Longstreet {{to take the time}} to dig in {{portions}} of his line, methodically site artillery, and set up a kill zone over the axis of advance <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Union attack would follow. Remembering the slaughter at Antietam, in which the Confederates did not construct defensive works, Longstreet ordered trenches, abatis, and fieldworks to be constructed, which would set a precedent for future defensive battles by the Army of Northern Virginia. Subsequently, Longstreet positioned his men behind a stone wall at the foot of Marye's Heights and held off fourteen assaults by Union forces. The Union army suffered almost 8,000 casualties at Marye's Heights, Longstreet only 1,000. His great defensive success was not based entirely on the advantage of terrain; this time it was the combination of terrain, defensive works, and a centralized coordination of artillery.|$|E
