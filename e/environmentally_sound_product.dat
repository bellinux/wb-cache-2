This study firstly collects the environmental performance indicators through intensive literature review and employs them as the criteria. Together with Delphi questionnaire, AHP is used to model {{the hierarchy of the}} decision problem, which will be basis to develop green product assessment framework in the follow-up research. By completing the study, this well-designed green product assessment framework is intended to provide a systematic, comprehensive, and timely platform to assess the environmental impact of a product. And it aims to reflect the following factors: (1) The green product assessment framework can help design <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>product</b> that take the entire life-cycle into consideration. (2) The green product assessment framework is based on environmental and ecological impact.

40|$|Extended {{producer}} responsibility (EPR) is {{a concept}} from Industrial Ecology that has changed waste management policies inside and gradually outside the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This article bridges the gap {{in our understanding of}} the policy process wherein policy change occurred. It employs the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) to explain the forces promoting and opposing EPR-based policies for waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in India, Thailand and Argentina. The analysis of 92 qualitative interviews with stakeholders and key events in the three countries shows the division and dynamics between the EPR-skeptic and pro-EPR coalitions that shaped the policy decisions and preliminary outputs. This division in the policy subsystem was stable not only along time but also across the three cases. Skeptics like governmental agencies and a fraction of the electrical and electronic industries questioned the need and merit of profound changes in waste policies. On the other hand, leading producers of information and communication technologies and environmental NGOs were found to advocate EPR. The discussion explains the forces behind these advocacy coalitions, policy change and policy-oriented learning based on ACF hypotheses and suggests possible modifications of the framework. Based on the analysis and discussion, we suggest a new approach to revitalize EPR as a guiding principle to create shared values with <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>product</b> systems that align with the social and economic conditions of developing and emerging economies...|$|E

40|$|Green Public Procurement (GPP) {{can be seen}} as a {{promising}} method to promote <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>product</b> design and motivate manufacturers to make products with reduced environmental impacts. For furniture, environmental impacts are quite limited during use but more associated with production and disposal. The requirements and criteria for furniture purchasing should be targeted to those environmental aspects that have the most influence and could, through eco-design, lead to the greatest environmental benefits. In order to do this, an RPS selection tool (Relevance-Potential-Steerability) is used. It is a tool developed for the assessment of the feasibility of eco-labelling criteria for a certain product group, and is applied in this study. The purpose of this paper is to recognize the major environmental aspects of furniture and to analyze to which extent they are taken into consideration in public purchasing, i. e., in the calls for tenders. The paper begins with describing the concepts of GPP and eco-design, as well as essential elements in this context such as the 'most economically advantageous' tender, the environmental aspects of furniture, eco-labels and eco-design strategies. The article continues with an analysis of 31 calls for tenders of furniture, including 15 Finnish and 16 Swedish calls for tenders. Finally, the paper discusses about the potential of GPP in promoting eco-design of furniture, i. e., what criteria are relevant from the view point of eco-design. The criteria that were presented in the studied calls for tenders seemed to be relevant from this perspective and subsequently may encourage eco-design among furniture manufacturers.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{sustainable}} society, {{it is necessary to}} transform industrial structure to the one that does not reduce the Earth's resources. Under this circumstance, a business model of "not selling goods, but selling services" has been expected as a measure of co-existence of business and the environment. This idea, which is called as "Product-Service Systems: PSS" or "Servicizing" etc., has been studied in Europe, the United States and international organisations, and is now studied in Japan. However, the idea of PSS is still not effectively used for policy development. One of the major reasons is that PSS concept itself is under-developed. Under the unclear concept of PSS, researchers are working towards more scientific understanding while policy makers are trying to develop new policy measures, and there is confusion in those communities. In order to develop policy measures, it is necessary to make clear the position of PSS in socio-economic system. This paper overviews previous PSS researches and relevant policy measures conducted in Japan, the US and EU, and tries to grasp the context of researches and policy activities and to find out the agenda of the current status. The characteristics of PSS rest on the innovative relationship between producer and consumer. However, PSS researches are stuck at measurement of environmental loads, and relevant policies tend to be rest on the ones targeting producers. In order {{to get out of this}} situation, it is necessary to ask question what is PSS and to make it clear where PSS can be positioned in socio-economic system. PSS is important, because PSS has an element of creating sufficiency as well as eco-efficiency. It is recommended that PSS concept needs to be examined as a research effort, and <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>product</b> policy needs to be systematically organised...|$|E
40|$|An {{increased}} {{understanding of}} the application of environmental Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies in the microelectronics packaging area should help in developing <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>product</b> systems. The aim of the present thesis {{is to increase the}} knowledge of using LCA tools, methods and models, in application to current and new microelectronic products. A subgoal is to establish {{a better understanding of how}} to collect data to be used in a Life-Cycle Inventory (LCI) and environmentally assess the importance of the upstream processes. The objective has been to explore how variants of LCA could be used in microelectronics applications and the LCA software EcoLab and available data were utilised to analyse environmental loads. Different case studies were performed on (i) microelectronic products, (ii) substrate and soldering materials, and (iii) plating and soldering processes. The main emphasis has been on the upstream processes. Analysis of the results shows that the input data needed for environmental assessment of electronics applications comes from many different sources. An LCI data collection model applicable to most electronic products helps quantifying upstream processes. This is explained for a digital telephone. The global shift from Sn-Pb to Pb-free solder paste was modelled using attributional LCA and consequential LCA. It was found that the attributional and consequential methodologies yield complimentary knowledge about the environmental consequences of the shift. In this thesis, uncertainty estimation in LCI using Monte Carlo simulation was also investigated. The approach was applicable to small one parameter cradle-to-gate systems. There are strong indications that electrochemical pattern replication is more CO 2 efficient than conventional photolithography, and that glass fiber enforced liquid crystalline polymers are more CO 2 efficient than the corresponding brominated epoxy (FR 4), polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon®) and ceramic/glass tape. In addition to this, the effect of system expansion of manufacturing processes of the new packaging concept System-In-a-Package was addressed. This expansion of the upstream product system changes the relative environmental importance of manufacturing processes. Overall, environmental LCA are applicable to microelectronics packaging, but the assessments are hampered by the lack of ready available input LCI data...|$|E

40|$|Growing {{concerns}} regarding {{the environmental impact}} of industrial activities, coupled with consumer demands for <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>products,</b> have forced manufacturers to scrutinize carefully the environmental friendliness and economical prosperity of their products during the design process; a domain called eco-efficient product design. To design an eco-efficient product, related requirements must be considered during the conceptual design phase, where the cost of incorporating changes is relatively low, and different feasible concepts of the product should be evaluated as such. However, at this early design stage, life cycle data and information are subject to severe uncertainties that make the selection of the most favourable eco-efficient product concept arbitrary based on incomplete information and knowledge.

40|$|Economic {{incentives}} such {{as environmental}} taxes can create attractive markets for <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>products</b> and process technologies. Many European countries {{have a long}} tradition with environmental taxes but recent figures indicate that the share of green tax revenues in the EU- 15 GDP is slightly declining. This is surprising since several governments had declared they would gradually shift the fiscal burden from labour to pollution. This paper tries to explain the fiscal inertia by analysing {{the role of the}} taxation base, fiscal neutrality, government failure with respect to the use of economic instruments and the dependence of government budgets on consumption-driven economic growth. We conclude that the initial focus on the double dividend hypothesis has strongly limited the impact of green taxes.

40|$|Greening {{of product}} chains {{has come up}} as an {{important}} means to systematically improve the environmental performance of products from cradle to cradle in Europe and elsewhere. Some experience with inter-firm co-operation aiming at reducing the environmental impacts has been generated in recent years. Most of these experiences involve cooperation between some of the links in product chains, very often stopping at European borders. Problems of market communication, information availability and information costs prevent companies from going beyond these lines. Also, anonymous markets may prevent communication between producers and end-users in the West and supplying firms in developing countries. Only very few documented case studies of global greening of product chains are available. Therefore, the challenge here is how to establish interactions with the first links in supply chains. Within the context of South Africa it is of cardinal importance to identify these links to ensure sustainable synergy. European countries are constantly changing the standards of products {{in order to meet}} environmental targets. Moreover, European consumer markets are increasingly sensitive to <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>products.</b> From the perspective of South African suppliers there is an increasing need for interaction in their global product chains.

40|$|The {{public sector}} in Norway {{purchases}} {{products and services}} for more then 300 billion NOK per year. This purchasing power {{can play an important}} role in leveraging the market share of <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>products</b> by increasing the level of environmental requirements in public contracts. Environmental considerations in public procurement have been on the international agenda since the 1992 conference in Rio, and the OECD, the EU and the Nordic Council of Ministers have also placed Green Public Procurement (GPP) on their agendas. Together with statements from the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, they all underline GPP as a tool for making a shift to more sustainable production and consumption practices. In Norway, the Government launched a Norwegian Action Plan on Environmental and Social Responsibility in Public Procurement in 2007. The aim of the plan was to encourage the public sector to demand <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>products</b> and services. However, several previous studies that have assessed the status of GPP show that, despite efforts to promote environmental considerations, there is a long way to go before these are fully integrated into public procurement practice The aim of this study was to produce information about how widespread the use of environmental criteria are in Norway, and to identify what drivers and barriers are seen to influence the GPP status. Based on experiences from other studies, the method design chosen was an analysis of tender documents complemented by case studies with interviews. Using both methods provided a way of balancing the results so as to get the most objective status scores on GPP together with more detailed answers on perceived drivers and barriers. The results revealed that almost 60 % of all tender documents included some kind of environmental criteria, but 1 / 3 of these were so unclear that it was doubtful as to whether or not they would result in any green procurement. Of the product groups that were in focus, the one that included paper and print was by far the “greenest” of the groups, with the others both containing less GPP and more unclear criteria. Compared to other studies this puts Norway at the same level as Sweden, and shows a slight improvement in total GPP compared to previous assessments. Still, taking the high amount of unclear criteria into account may lower the overall GPP score. The interview results indicated that lack of knowledge, focus on economic considerations and product functionality, lack of support and management focus and work pressure were the five main barriers preventing GPP. Increased co-operation, increased focus from management, simplification of criteria and more available products with environmental labels were identified as drivers. The drivers and barriers identified correspond to those of previous studies, with some new finding such as identifying the lack of product specific knowledge, where previous studies have focused more on lack of procurement knowledge. The findings are all important when it comes to working out a strategy to follow up the Norwegian Action Plan. They give information about the needs identified by the procurement officers themselves, thus giving an indication of what initiatives to prioritise...|$|R

Just as thinking about environment after industrial development is planned and implemented does not optimize environmental quality, consideration of labour concerns also requires deliberate and intelligent actions before embarking on industrialization efforts in guiding industrial transformations. The recent downturn of the extraordinary long economic boom might be expected to reveal fundamental structural employment problems in the industrialized world. It is likely that employment considerations will be the central issue in the coming decade for countries in the expanding European Union, and will influence the nature and direction of (re) industrialization and the growth of the service economy.

In addition to energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, other environmental impact parameters and environmental improvement potentials are taken into account when developing the criteria, such as: lower air emissions related to energy production and consumption, lower resource consumption, potentially higher resource efficiency management (with respect to the issue of recycling and recyclability), etc. Finally, the products covered by the GPP criteria should also bring public customers direct cost savings when evaluated using a life-cycle cost perspective (e. g. lower overall costs due to lower energy bills).

New environmental legislation increases pressure on companies during the development of new products and processees and in the manufacture of existing designs. This challange requires a method which is integrated into business management. There is a need for Environmental Business Management (E. B.

M. there would be a loss of market share or potential market openings, also, the risk of the company being held liable for environmental damage caused by its processes or products thus jeopardising the future of the company. The improvement in profitability which can be obtained by apopting cost reducing environmental protection measures and by exploiting market openings for <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>products</b> is also relevant to companies.
