40|$|Two {{different}} {{fiber optic}} sensors were {{developed for the}} determination of hydrogen sulfide at ppb concentration levels; a probe-type fiber optic sensor coated with polyethylene oxide containing 0. 5 M CdCl 2 and a fiber optic sensor utilizing 0. 5 M CdCl 2 -pretreated filter paper as solid substrate. In the first type, CdCl 2 –polyethyleneoxide (PEO) mixture was coated onto {{the tip of a}} fiber optic probe and the probe was exposed to H 2 S. The methodology is based on the measurement of CdS fluorescence on the surface. Detection limit (3 s) of the PEO-coated fiber optic system was 36. 0 ppb for H 2 S and precision at the 0. 552 ppm level was 29 % R. S. D. For the fiber optic system utilizing CdCl 2 -pretreated filter paper, two different configurations were devised and evaluated; a bifurcated fiber optic sensor and a single fiber optic sensor. Similar figures were obtained with these two systems; the detection limit (3 s) was 4. 0 ppb for the bifurcated fiber optic sensor and 4. 3 ppb for the single fiber optic sensor, and both sensors had linear responses in the range 0. 032 – 1. 0 ppm. Their precisions at 0. 299 ppm level were also very similar, 10 and 11 % R. S. D., respectively, for the bifurcated and single fiber systems. In addition to the fiber optic sensors developed, various surfactants (sodiumdodecylsulfate (SDS), Aerosol OT, Aerosol A 102, Aerosol 501), some cellulosic substances (sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, <b>ethylhydroxyethylcellulose,</b> α-cellulose) and several water-soluble polymers (polyacrylicacid polyethleneoxide (PEO), polyvinylalcohol (PVA)) were dissolved in proper solvents and after mixing with 0. 5 M CdCl 2, were spread over glass slides. These novel solid substrates were exposed to H 2 S and fluorescence signal on the surfaces of the glass slides was measured with a luminescence spectrometer. The new substrates were shown to be good alternatives to filter paper for the determination of H 2 S by room temperature solid surface fluorescence spectrometry...|$|E
