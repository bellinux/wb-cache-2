5|$|After 1863, {{relations}} between Mihail Kogălniceanu {{and his friend}} Vasile Alecsandri soured <b>dramatically,</b> as the latter declared himself disgusted with politics. Alecsandri withdrew to his estate in Mircești, where he wrote pieces critical of the political developments.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{population}} size would not <b>dramatically</b> increase until the Song dynasty period, when the population doubled to 100 million {{people because of}} extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with rural farmers holding more abundant yields of food that they could easily provide to the growing market.|$|E
5|$|Double mutants deleted {{for both}} MLH3 (major pathway) and MMS4 (minor pathway) showed <b>dramatically</b> reduced {{crossing}} over compared to wild-type (6- to 17-fold); however spore viability was reasonably high (62%) and chromosomal disjunction appeared mostly functional.|$|E
5|$|During {{the great}} housing {{boom of the}} late 1930s, Giffnock began to grow rapidly. Between 1930 and 1940, as many as 3,000 {{dwellings}} were constructed, and the population rose <b>dramatically,</b> from 1,425 to 3,471 in 1939 and 9,144 in 1951.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, as {{a direct}} result of this campaign, Belgium {{formally}} annexed the territory, creating the Belgian Congo. Conditions for the indigenous population improved <b>dramatically</b> with the suppression of forced labour, although many officials who had formerly worked for the Free State were retained in their posts long after annexation.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, McNair took an axe to {{the armored}} {{division}} organization, <b>dramatically</b> downsizing it. For {{all but the}} 2nd and 3rd Armored Divisions, the number of armored battalions was reduced to three. Devers favored the older, larger organization. The surplus armored battalions were utilized as separate armored battalions, so {{by the end of}} 1943 there were 54 armored battalions in armored divisions and 65 non-divisional battalions. By this time, the planned number of Army Ground Force divisions had been <b>dramatically</b> cut to 90, and McNair considered that only ten armored divisions were required, and he suggested that six of the sixteen armored divisions already active be broken up. This proposal was not accepted, and the number of armored divisions was frozen at sixteen.|$|E
5|$|In a dogfight, {{particularly}} when attacking Allied aircraft in a Lufbery circle, Marseille would often favour <b>dramatically</b> reducing the throttle and even lowering the flaps {{to reduce speed}} and shorten his turn radius, rather than the standard procedure of using full throttle throughout.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, {{economic}} {{decline in the}} music industry <b>dramatically</b> reduced readership and advertising from Billboards traditional audience. Circulation declined from 40,000 in circulation in the 1990s to less than 17,000 by 2014. The publication's staff and ownership were also undergoing frequent changes.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific Northwest, {{wild salmon}} stocks, a main {{resident}} food source, have declined <b>dramatically</b> in recent years. On {{the west coast}} of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, seal and sea lion populations have also substantially declined.|$|E
5|$|Introduction {{of a local}} militia {{in order}} to lessen the budget of {{expenses}} paid for upholding the official standing army, which had grown <b>dramatically</b> to roughly 1 million soldiers by 1022.|$|E
5|$|Popularity of Salukis <b>dramatically</b> increased, and the Saluki Club of America {{was founded}} in 1927, Salukis were {{recognized}} by The Kennel Club in 1923, and by the American Kennel Club in 1929. The breed is also the mascot of Southern Illinois University Carbondale.|$|E
5|$|Since his record-breaking win at the 1997 Masters, golf's {{increased}} {{popularity is}} commonly attributed to Woods' presence. He is credited by some sources for <b>dramatically</b> increasing prize money in golf, generating interest in new PGA tournament audiences, and for drawing the largest TV ratings in golf history.|$|E
5|$|Spirited Away {{contains}} critical {{commentary on}} modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues. Chihiro {{has been seen}} as a representation of the shōjo, whose roles and ideology had changed <b>dramatically</b> since post-war Japan.|$|E
5|$|The 1999 play Charlie Victor Romeo (made into a film in 2013) <b>dramatically</b> reenacted the {{incident}} using transcripts from {{the flight deck}} voice recorder.|$|E
5|$|The Mississippi-class {{ships were}} {{designed}} to meet Congressional and Navy Department objectives of reducing the escalating cost of new battleships, the quantity, size, and cost of which had increased <b>dramatically</b> over the first two decades of US battleship production.|$|E
5|$|The Sinclair Scientific {{calculator}} was a 12-function, pocket-sized {{scientific calculator}} introduced in 1974, <b>dramatically</b> undercutting in price other calculators {{available at the}} time. The Sinclair Scientific Programmable, released a year later, was advertised as the first budget programmable calculator.|$|E
5|$|The Zong killings {{offered a}} {{powerful}} {{example of the}} horrors of the slave trade, stimulating the development of the abolitionist movement in Britain, which <b>dramatically</b> expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s. In 1787, the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was founded.|$|E
5|$|The diamond {{industry}} {{falls into}} two categories: one dealing with gem-grade diamonds and the other, with industrial-grade diamonds. While a large trade in {{both types of}} diamonds exists, the two markets act in <b>dramatically</b> different ways.|$|E
5|$|The figures {{improved}} {{after the}} autumn 1941. More resources, better training and equipment including more capable strike aircraft resulted in increasing kill numbers. By 1942, increased numbers of better aircraft and armament enabled the offensive {{capabilities of the}} Command to increase <b>dramatically.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first condition, {{suggested}} by an influential paper written by Kenneth Rogoff & Carmen Reinhart has been disputed due to major calculation errors. In fact, the average GDP growth at public debt/GDP ratios over 90% is not <b>dramatically</b> different from when debt/GDP ratios are lower.|$|E
5|$|The {{installation}} of dams <b>dramatically</b> altered {{the landscape and}} ecosystem of the river. At one time, the Columbia {{was one of the}} top salmon-producing river systems in the world. Previously active fishing sites, such as Celilo Falls in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, have exhibited a sharp decline in fishing along the Columbia in the last century, and salmon populations have been <b>dramatically</b> reduced. Fish ladders have been installed at some dam sites to help the fish journey to spawning waters. Chief Joseph Dam has no fish ladders and completely blocks fish migration to the upper half of the Columbia River system.|$|E
5|$|The {{market price}} of nickel surged {{throughout}} 2006 {{and the early}} months of 2007; as of April 5, 2007, the metal was trading at US$52,300/tonne or $1.47/oz. The price subsequently fell <b>dramatically,</b> and as of September 2017, the metal was trading at $11,000/tonne, or $0.31/oz.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} graphic {{novel by}} Moore and Lloyd was re-released as a hardback collection in October 2005 to tie into the film's original release date of November 5, 2005. The film {{renewed interest in}} Alan Moore's original story, and sales of the original graphic novel rose <b>dramatically</b> in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{rates of}} TB varies with age. In Africa, it {{primarily}} affects {{adolescents and young}} adults. However, in countries where incidence rates have declined <b>dramatically</b> (such as the United States), TB is mainly a disease of older people and the immunocompromised (risk factors are listed above).|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} {{increase in}} international attention to self-determination {{and human rights}} put further pressure on Indonesia. Subsequent events within East Timor in the 1990s helped to <b>dramatically</b> raise the international profile of East Timor, which in turn significantly boosted {{the momentum of the}} resistance groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{supernova}} classification type {{is closely}} tied to the type of star {{at the time of the}} collapse. The occurrence of each type of supernova depends <b>dramatically</b> on the metallicity, and hence the age of the host galaxy.|$|E
5|$|This is {{in stark}} {{contrast}} to the stance taken by his predecessor, Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that <b>dramatically</b> improved during Bush's tenure.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally carbenes {{are viewed}} as so {{reactive}} that were only studied indirectly, e.g. by trapping reactions. This situation has changed <b>dramatically</b> {{with the emergence of}} persistent carbenes. Although they are fairly reactive substances, i.e., undergoing dimerization, many can be isolated as pure substances.|$|E
5|$|While on tour, Webb {{noticed that}} {{attendance}} at his shows had increased <b>dramatically</b> {{after he had}} made Mockingbird available for free online. Inspired by that realization, Webb helped form NoiseTrade, a website that allows users to download music for free from independent musicians.|$|E
5|$|With <b>dramatically</b> {{increasing}} {{population in}} the 20th century, there was major civil unrest in Omaha, resulting from competition and fierce labor struggles. In 1900, Omaha {{was the center of}} a national uproar over the kidnapping of Edward Cudahy, Jr., the son of a local meatpacking magnate.|$|E
5|$|Yellow {{fever and}} malaria among workers had seriously delayed {{construction}} of the Panama Canal. Mosquito control instituted by William C. Gorgas <b>dramatically</b> reduced this problem.|$|E
5|$|A {{sea anemone}} {{is capable of}} {{changing}} its shape <b>dramatically.</b> The column and tentacles have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets of muscle and can lengthen and contract, as well as bend and twist. The gullet and mesenteries can evert (turn inside out), or the oral disc and tentacles can retract inside the gullet, with the sphincter closing the aperture; during this process, the gullet folds transversely and water is discharged through the mouth.|$|E
5|$|According to USA Today, Omaha ranks eighth {{among the}} nation's 50 largest cities in both per-capita billionaires and Fortune 500 companies. With {{diversification}} in several industries, including banking, insurance, telecommunications, architecture/construction, and transportation, Omaha's economy has grown <b>dramatically</b> {{since the early}} 1990s. In 2001 Newsweek identified Omaha {{as one of the}} top 10 high-tech havens in the nation. Six national fiber optic networks converge in Omaha.|$|E
5|$|After {{adapting}} to the higher competition level, he improved <b>dramatically</b> in time, putting on 28 pounds and developing his post game to transition from a perimeter player to a forward. He finished {{with an average of}} 15 points and 8 rebounds for his senior season. Nominated for the 2012 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, he didn't make the final selection.|$|E
5|$|After the Angolan War of Independence of 1975, the Soviet Union's role in Third World {{politics}} increased <b>dramatically.</b> Some of {{the regions}} were important for national security, while other regions {{were important to}} the expansion of Soviet socialism to other countries. According to an anonymous Soviet writer, the national liberation struggle was the cornerstone of Soviet ideology, and therefore became a cornerstone for Soviet diplomatic activity in the Third World.|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} by fire of the Palace of Whitehall in 1698, the surroundings of the Privy Garden changed <b>dramatically.</b> Most {{of the palace}} buildings had been burned down in the 1698 fire; others were torn down as {{the last vestiges of}} the old Tudor and Stuart Palace were removed. With the demise of the Privy Gallery, the Privy Garden was extended north to include the Pebble Court behind the Banqueting House.|$|E
