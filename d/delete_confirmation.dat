40|$|Bugs Fixed Upgrades {{could fail}} for users moving many {{versions}} at once due to zeroes in date columns PHP 7. 1 compatibility fixed (Storage interface type mismatch) "Full" <b>delete</b> <b>confirmation</b> pages (as opposed to popups) prevented the user from actually clicking the delete button (a regression in 2. 5) Admin Appearance navigation {{had the wrong}} filter name, {{it is now the}} correct admin_navigation_appearance (contributed by @luku) The value 0 (zero) was not allowed in several places as an element text (contributed by @luku) It was impossible to navigate to the "top" link in nested navigation on a touch-enabled device. Now a single tap opens the menu (as before), and tapping again on the top link will actually navigate. is_allowed would cause an error if run in the background (or whenever the ACL is not loaded) TinyMCE would not load correctly in some situations on IE (a regression in 2. 5) Changes User delete confirm from browse now uses the popup instead of the full page Sample configuration file now links to new location of Zend's session documentation Composer added, currently for dev/testing purposes only The size column of the files table is now bigint, allowing for file sizes greater than 4 GiB (contributed by @jajm) TinyMCE is downgraded to 3. 5. 1...|$|E
