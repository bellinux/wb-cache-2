30|$|From estimations {{made using}} {{empirical}} equations, the ancient mean bankfull width (Wc) <b>was</b> <b>approximately</b> 100  m, the single meandering belt mean width <b>was</b> <b>approximately</b> 800  m, the mean channel bend {{radius of curvature}} <b>was</b> <b>approximately</b> 250  m, the mean along channel bend length <b>was</b> <b>approximately</b> 700  m, the mean meander wavelength <b>was</b> <b>approximately</b> 1300  m, the channel average sinuosity <b>was</b> <b>approximately</b> almost 3.0 (S[*]>[*] 1.7 was high sinuosity), and the annual mean discharge rate <b>was</b> <b>approximately</b> 450  m 3 /s. For multi-layer fluvial successions, the lower portion was more easily eroded, and therefore {{it was difficult to}} completely preserve the bottom meandering belt. On a geological timescale, the meandering channel was more prone to reworking. During meandering channel evolution, the direction of diverging thalweg trajectories indicated that the upstream bar was subjected to powerful erosion, whereas the downstream bar experienced expansion, translation, or rotation.|$|R
