5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E
5|$|Dummy {{horses were}} {{sometimes}} used to deceive the enemy into misreading {{the location of}} troops. They were effectively used by Allenby during his campaigns in the east, especially late in the war. Evidence exists that the Germans used horses in their experimentations with chemical and biological warfare. German agents in the US are suspected of infecting cattle and horses bound for France with glanders, a disease which can fatally spread to humans; similar tactics were used by the Germans against the Russians, causing breakdowns <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> move artillery on the Eastern Front.|$|E

5|$|Organisms vary <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{synthesize}} the 20 common amino acids. Most {{bacteria and}} plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven non{{essential amino acids}}, so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts. All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. Amino acid synthesis depends on {{the formation of the}} appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an amino acid.|$|E

Ethics issues related to lobbyists and other matters are handled by the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics, a twelve-member committee that includes six Senators. Members of the Senate may turn to either this committee or an ethics counsel to help them resolve questions of potential ethical conflict. Members are encouraged to avoid conflicts of interest, and are required to submit public financial disclosures to the state. In addition to employment prohibitions laid out in the state constitution, members are barred from advocating for any paying client before any part of the state government.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> take up foreign dsRNA {{and use it}} in the RNAi pathway. The {{effects of}} RNA {{interference}} can be both systemic and heritable in plants and C. elegans, although not in Drosophila or mammals. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through plasmodesmata (channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport). Heritability comes from methylation of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell. A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the targeting of endogenously produced miRNAs; in plants, miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs {{tend to be more}} divergent in sequence and induce translational repression. This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation initiation factors with the messenger RNA's polyadenine tail.|$|E

5|$|Since a {{large number}} of oxidoreductases use NAD and NADH as substrates, and bind them using a highly conserved {{structural}} motif, the idea that inhibitors based on NAD could be specific to one enzyme is surprising. However, this can be possible: for example, inhibitors based on the compounds mycophenolic acid and tiazofurin inhibit IMP dehydrogenase at the NAD binding site. Because of the importance of this enzyme in purine metabolism, these compounds may be useful as anti-cancer, anti-viral, or immunosuppressive drugs. Other drugs are not enzyme inhibitors, but instead activate enzymes involved in NAD metabolism. Sirtuins are a particularly interesting target for such drugs, since activation of these NAD-dependent deacetylases extends lifespan. Compounds such as resveratrol increase the activity of these enzymes, which may be important <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> delay aging in both vertebrate, and invertebrate model organisms.|$|E
5|$|The F/A-18 Hornets are modern {{all-weather}} strike fighter jets, {{designed to}} attack both ground and aerial targets. Australia's F/A-18s were built during the 1980s and early 1990s and {{are currently being}} upgraded to improve their capabilities and extend their service lives. ACG operates a total of 71 F/A-18A and F/A-18B Hornets. The F/A-18A is a single-seat fighter and the F/A-18B is a two-seat variant which is mainly used for pilot training. The Australian Government is planning to replace the F/A-18A and Bs with the F-35A Lightning II from 2013 onwards. The F/A-18F Super Hornet is a dedicated strike aircraft in RAAF service and are considered superior to the F-22 Raptor <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> acquire and track moving ground targets, {{and will continue to}} be upgraded until the F-35s are delivered.|$|E
5|$|Three {{hypotheses}} might {{account for}} consistent foraging specializations across individuals: food source variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> use each foraging skill and stably specialize on the most profitable one. The pattern of specialization {{is expected to be}} stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most profitable skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization. Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Gallipoli {{marked the}} end for Hamilton and Stopford but Hunter-Weston went on to lead VIII Corps {{on the first day}} of the Battle of the Somme. The {{competence}} of Australian brigade commanders, John Monash (4th Infantry Brigade) and Harry Chauvel (1st Light Horse Brigade, New Zealand and Australian Division), was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command. The influence of Kitchener waned after the coalition government was formed in May 1915, partly because of the growing sense of failure in the Dardanelles and culminated in Kitchener being over-ruled on support for the French at Salonika in early December 1915, when his influence on the Cabinet was at its lowest. The campaign gave confidence to the Ottomans <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> defeat the Allies. In Mesopotamia, the Turks surrounded a British expedition at Kut Al Amara, forcing their surrender in April 1916. Ottoman forces in southern Palestine were poised to launch an attack against the Suez Canal and Egypt. Defeat at the Battle of Romani and lack of materials to complete the military railway, necessary for such an operation, {{marked the end}} of that ambition. The optimism which came from the victory at Gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense of despair and the British remained on the offensive in the Middle East for the rest of the war.|$|E
