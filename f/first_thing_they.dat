5|$|First thing, I {{saw these}} guys as scientifically {{accomplished}} but ethically, morons. They {{never had any}} reasons before to have ethical questions. So when they're hit with this device they're blindsided by it. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> do is make money with it. They're {{not talking about the}} ethics of altering your former self.|$|E
25|$|The Malta Independent {{wrote that}} “for many people, looking up her blog was the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> did each day, {{and the last}} thing too. Now there is just emptiness. A silence that speaks volumes.” Both the daily and the weekly version of her column were {{published}} as blank pages in the days following her murder.|$|E
2500|$|Whoever is {{familiar}} with the history of colonialism and the Islamic world knows that whenever they wanted to get a foothold in a place, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> did in order to clear their paths– whether overtly or covertly– was to undermine the people's genuine Islamic morals. [...] and claimed an unnamed British foreign secretary once told the British parliament, [...] "So long as the Qur'an is revered by Muslims, {{we will not be able}} to consolidate a foothold among the Muslims".|$|E
60|$|Among {{the people}} who were looking at it were a party who seemed to have run out from dinner in some {{neighbouring}} house; the ladies were fantastically wrapped up, as if they had flung on the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> could seize.|$|R
60|$|One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> did at Baden was {{to stroll}} into the Trink-halle, where Paula sipped the water. She {{was about to}} put down the glass, when De Stancy quickly took it from her hands as though to make use of it himself.|$|R
50|$|Lutheran {{schools and}} {{education}} were {{a priority for}} Lutherans who migrated to the United States and Australia from Germany and Scandinavia. One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> did was to create schools for their children. This strong educational tradition was handed down from Martin Luther himself.|$|R
2500|$|Blondie's Throne is a flowstone {{located near}} the end of the tour of the cave, the name comes from its obvious {{resemblance}} to a throne. The name [...] "Blondie" [...] comes from a story about a boy (Charles Smallwood) who was lost in the cave in the late 19th or early 20th century. He was later found sleeping near this formation, and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> saw in the candlelight was his blonde hair. While there is a legend that some substance in the cave turned his hair blonde, it is more likely that the boy was known for his blonde hair.|$|E
2500|$|The Houdini Gravesite Restoration Committee {{under the}} Chairmanship of National President David Bowers, is {{working closely with}} National President Kenrick [...] "Ice" [...] McDonald to see this project to completion. Bowers said it is a foregone {{conclusion}} that the Society will approve the funding request, because [...] "Houdini {{is responsible for the}} Society of American Magicians being what it is today. We owe a debt of gratitude to him." [...] Like Bowers, McDonald said the motivation behind the repairs is to properly honor the grave of the [...] "Babe Ruth of magicians". [...] "This is hallowed ground," [...] he said. [...] "When you ask people about magicians, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> say is Harry Houdini." [...] While the actual plot will remain under the control of Machpelah Cemetery management, the Society of American Magicians, {{with the help of the}} Houdini Museum in Pennsylvania, will be in charge of the restoration.|$|E
2500|$|The Driver was {{financed by}} EMI Films who {{announced}} {{they would make}} a second film with Hill, a Western he wrote with Roger Spottiswoode, The Last Gun. However The Driver was a commercial failure in the US. [...] "To say it did not do well would be kind," [...] said Hill. [...] "Had I not been shooting The Warriors at the time, I don't think my career would have survived. They loved it overseas, but in those days, that didn't matter that much. It made exactly zero dollars in the United States. I remember the studio had this huge sheaf of Xeroxed reviews they'd handed me — you could stop a fucking [...]45 slug with this stack, it was so thick. And of all the reviews in this six-inch thick pile, {{there was only one}} good one." [...] (In 2016 Hill would say that [...] "whenever they show retrospectives of my stuff, it's usually the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> show. Sometimes you just have to wait it out.") ...|$|E
60|$|The Glass Cat did not {{rejoin the}} party of travelers. She was still resentful, and they moved too slowly to suit her, besides. When {{they arrived at the}} Royal Palace, one of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> saw was the Glass Cat curled up on a bench as bright and clean and {{transparent}} as ever. But she pretended not to notice them, and they passed her by without remark.|$|R
50|$|Built in {{the early}} 1950s {{in honor of the}} Chinese {{community}} leaders who were executed by the Japanese during World War II. Japan invaded the country in 1941 and one of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> did was to round up prominent Chinese community leaders and executed them. Having been enemies even before World War II commenced, the Japanese were wary of the trouble the Chinese community would cause on the plans when they invaded the Philippines.|$|R
50|$|At {{the outset}} of the movie, Nanu emerges from the cave where she was born along with her brother, just born as well, and their mother. The two polar bear cubs play in the snow for a while until {{returning}} to their snow cave. The next day, the cubs start learning from their mother how to survive in the wild. One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> find out by watching their mother is to stay away from grown male polar bears who are apt to kill them.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{days after}} {{publication}} of The Lost Evidence, Japanese historian and blogger Kota Yamano investigated the issue, and published a blog entry {{that showed the}} original source of the photograph that the ONI had used: a travel book , which {{was first published in}} 1935. [...] Earhart and Noonan's final flight was in 1937, so a 1935 photo would be unrelated to Earhart and Noonan's disappearance. [...] In an interview with The Guardian, Yamano criticized the work behind the documentary, saying [...] "I find it strange that the documentary makers didn't confirm the date of the photograph or the publication in which it originally appeared. That's the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> should have done." [...] Yamano also said that it only took thirty minutes of searching to find the source. [...] On Twitter, Yamano (as @baron_yamaneko) identified the ship in the right of the photo as a different ship called Kōshū seized by Allied Japanese forces in World War I from the German Empire and not the Kōshū Maru of the Japanese navy.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{draft for}} the remake had moved the setting to {{northern}} California, and altered the third act to include {{elements of the}} supernatural. When that script was rejected, Carl Ellsworth {{was brought in to}} touch up the script written by Adam Alleca. Ellsworth had previously worked with Craven on Red Eye, but had never seen the original Last House on the Left. After reading the script and watching the 1972 film—the latter he found difficult to watch because of its extreme nature—Ellsworth decided that the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> needed to do was to establish someone whose survival you wanted the audience to root for. The writer wanted to know how the [...] "typical family" [...] would react to such a heinous act being perpetrated on their daughter, and what they were truly capable of. Craven points out that most of the early script problems were based around deciding what elements to include. They were never sure how much of the Krug family needed to be seen, what elements from the original film should be included, or even if Mari should live or die.|$|E

50|$|Edmund de Waal is {{the author}} of The Hare with Amber Eyes, which tells the story of his family, the wealthy Jewish Ephrussi family, who settled in Vienna {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> did to {{establish}} themselves was to commission portraits. The exhibition catalogue explores the way in which portraiture in Vienna was intertwined with patronage, politics and the creation of taste. Included in the exhibition (exhibit no. 73) is an Ephrussi family photograph album, dating from about 1904, depicting members of the family in tableaux vivants.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{pilot is}} {{undergoing}} flight training, the cruise attitude is usually {{one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>things</b> that <b>they</b> will learn. The sight picture associated with cruise flight, will include the horizon and a combination of sky and ground.|$|R
50|$|For {{children}} or {{young people who}} have profound and extremely limiting physical and intellectual disabilities, operating a switch adapted toy may be the <b>first</b> independent <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> can do, which builds confidence and enjoyment as well as intellectual stimulation and potential learning.|$|R

40|$|This memo is {{addressed}} {{to members of}} our university (and maybe others) {{who want to know}} whether they need to know about MOOCs, and what the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> would need to know are. MOOCS were the academic buzzword of 2012. 1 But what is a MOOC. Do we care? Should we? In this short memo we begin with a list of questions, in no particular order, that we have either asked or been asked. The discussion that follows will contain the answers to these, and other, questions, although there may not be a separate section for each question...|$|R
50|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, the pilots and ground personnel of the 45th had the job of cleaning up the mess at Wheeler Field. Among the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> did was put the remaining aircraft back into their revetments. After moving their flight operations to different fields in Hawaii, the 45th {{was back in the}} air conducting daily air defense patrols over the islands. These long flights put a heavy toll on the P-36s and P-40Bs that the pilots flew, so they requested new aircraft. The pilots soon received new P-40E Warhawks and the tricycle-gear Bell P-39 Airacobra.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} settlers {{were all}} of the Roman Catholic faith {{and one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> turned their attention to was constructing a church. This was completed in 1881 and dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul whose feast day in the Catholic calendar falls on 29 June, the date of the arrival of the first settlers. The church still stands today and serves the community. The hotel and general store also have their origins from the times of the first settlers. There is a museum which occupies premises that were originally built as the Catholic primary school (1923-1964).|$|R
60|$|It did. They {{started with}} {{breaking}} a cup. That was the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> did. They did that {{just to show}} you what they could do, and to get you interested.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> both did was {{to run to the}} {{cupboard}} and unlock it, but when the door opened they started back, for, instead of the ball, there stood a handsome young man.|$|E

60|$|In the hall, Tom Wychecombe, and his namesake, the lieutenant, met the party. From {{the formal}} despondency of the <b>first,</b> every <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> apprehended was confirmed.

6000|$|I {{wonder how}} many, even {{of those who}} {{honestly}} and attentively join in our Church services, attach any distinct idea to the second clause of the Lord's Prayer--the first petition of it--the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>they</b> are ordered by Christ to seek of their Father? ...|$|R
2500|$|In March 2011, Brown {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} for a senate floor {{speech in which}} he cited the names of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin while he criticized Republican efforts in Ohio and Wisconsin to mitigate the power of public employee unions to negotiate with taxpayers. In his speech he said [...] "some of the worst governments that we've ever had, do you {{know one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> did? They went after unions. Hitler didn't want unions, Stalin didn't want unions, Mubarak didn't want independent unions". Brown, however, added that he was not comparing the two situations. He later apologized for his speech.|$|R

5000|$|In {{this episode}} Attenborough {{explored}} the incredible scientific breakthroughs within his lifetime {{that have helped}} to shape {{an understanding of the}} world. He talked of the early interviews he conducted with biologist Konrad Lorenz, who was famous for his discoveries about the behaviour of geese (the [...] "imprinting" [...] of young goslings on the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> saw on hatching meant Lorenz was able to observe them closely as they regarded him as their parent). He also talked of Stanley Miller's groundbreaking experiment in the 1950s that first demonstrated how the chemical [...] "primordial soup" [...] could be transformed by electricity into the basic building blocks of life.|$|R
5000|$|In a July 2006 Variety article, Janice Min, Us Weekly editor-in-chief, cited People for the {{increase}} in cost to publishers of celebrity photos: They are among the biggest spenders of celebrity photos in the industry. ... One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> ever did, {{that led to the}} jacking up of photo prices, was to pay $75,000 to buy pictures of Jennifer Lopez reading Us magazine, so Us Weekly couldn't buy them.That was the watershed moment that kicked off high photo prices in my mind. I {{had never seen anything like}} it. But they saw a competitor come along, and responded. It was a business move, and probably a smart one.|$|R
