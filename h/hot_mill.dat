40|$|ARCO Metals Company (Formerly Anaconda Aluminum Company) is {{proceeding}} as scheduled {{with the construction}} of a $ 400 Million aluminum processing complex in Logan County, Kentucky. When the initial construction phase is completed in the Fall 1983, the complex will be capable of producing 400 million pounds per year of aluminum, sheet and foil using highly automated, computer controlled equipment that will maximize end product quality and minimize the consumption of energy. This paper will describe the basic processes used in the Logan complex and several design features that are being incorporated to reduce energy consumption. Large reverberatroy melting furnaces will remelt scrap aluminum and ingots will be cast on site to supplement those delivered to the site from ARCO Metal's reduction plants. The melting furnaces are expected to achieve a high efficiency which will be further enhanced by the utilization of exhaust gases to preheat the scrap as well as the combustion air. A coreless induction furnace will be used to reduce the melt loss normally associated with light gauge scrap. The ingots will be heated prior to rolling in the <b>hot</b> <b>mill</b> in direct fired preheating furnaces with variable speed fans that minimize cycle time.

40|$|International audienceIn hot rolling, the {{mechanical}} properties of steel alloys are conditioned by the rolling process {{but a great}} part is ensured by the cooling of the hot strip mill. Well controlling this cooling rate and its homogeneity is thus of primary importance for obtaining steels with desired mechanical properties. As the water used in the cooling stage of the rolling process can be polluted by oil (in <b>hot</b> <b>mill</b> strip, some oil is used to lubricate the rolls {{and a part of}} it can pollute the water), {{it is important to know}} how much varies the cooling rates when water is polluted. In this study, transient cooling has been investigated during quenching of a hot metal disk with various subcooled oil-in-water emulsion jets. The aim of this work is to compare the cooling efficiency of oil-in-water emulsion jet with a pure water jet. Experimental investigations of axi-symmetric jet impingements on a preheated hot metal disk (500 – 600 °C) have been performed with various oil-in-water emulsions. The transient cooling heat fluxes on the quenched side are estimated by coupling the measurement of the temperature field of the other side (rear face) with a semi-analytical inverse heat conduction model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Steel strip surface {{oxidation}} during <b>hot</b> <b>mill</b> processing represents an industrial and environmental problem: secondary oxide is removed after roughing, but tertiary oxide scales already start to form {{before entering the}} finishing stands. Their properties affect the final steel surface quality and its response to further processing. Controlling the oxide layer growth kinetics and mechanical properties can make pickling easier and improve downstream behaviour. A thin wustite-dominated scale layer (< 20 µm) is created under controlled conditions in an original laboratory device adequately positioned in a compression test machine to investigate plane strain compression. A first series of oxidation tests were performed on a ULC steel grade to measure the kinetics of oxide scale growth. The samples were first heated up under a protective atmosphere (nitrogen), before being oxidised in air at different temperatures for various oxidation times. These experiments can be considered fair quantitative and qualitative simulations of scale growth as it occurs in a hot strip mill, insofar as the results thus obtained are in good agreement with the literature. After the oxide growth, plane strain compression (PSC) was performed immediately to simulate the hot rolling process. The oxide layers were characterised before and after compression tests by optical and secondary electron microscopy. As expected, the oxide is seen to deform during compression. The obtained oxide layers exhibit good adhesion to the substrate and homogeneity over the thickness, even after compression...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{thermal damage}} to <b>hot</b> <b>mill</b> work roll {{materials}} was investigated using twin-disc high-temperature laboratory test rig under {{conditions that are}} relevant to those of the early stands of a hot strip rolling mill. Two typical roll grades were tested: high speed tool steel and high-carbon high-chromium steel. Mill data were scaled down to suit the test sample dimensions and used to calculate the thermal cycle, contact times and contact pressure. A coupled thermomechanical model based on the finite element method was developed to predict the temperature distribution within the core and at the surface of the roll test samples. The predictions of the model showed good agreement with the temperatures measured using embedded thermocouples at several depths in the sub-surface of the roll test sample. After high temperature testing, the test samples were sectioned and prepared by conventional metallography for microscopic analysis. The thermally induced surface damage in the test samples were found to exhibit similar features to those observed in actual mill work rolls during service, especially the high-carbon-high-chromium steel, which showed a greater extent of surface thermal damage than the high speed tool steel test samples. Based on the results, it is concluded that the new test rig was proven capable of producing thermal damage in a consistent and reproducible manner and, thus, it can be regarded as a valuable off-line test resource to assist in further understanding the work roll surface deterioration phenomena...|$|E

40|$|Roll {{inspection}} in roll grinding shops {{is necessary}} to ensure that rolls being returned to the <b>hot</b> strip <b>mill</b> after grinding are free from surface breaking cracks and internal defects that may cause roll failure during service. <b>Hot</b> strip <b>mills</b> in finishing stands normally utilize cast duplex type work rolls in alloy indefinite chill double poured (ICDP) or high chrome iron grades and back up rolls of alloy cast or forged heat treated steels.
