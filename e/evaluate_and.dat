5|$|Buffy's former nemesis is Spike (James Marsters), a vampire. In {{the fourth}} season The Initiative, a secret {{military}} organization whose {{mission is to}} <b>evaluate</b> <b>and</b> eliminate demonic beings, rendered Spike harmless by implanting a microchip in his head that causes him intense pain when he attacks humans. However, the chip does not affect him when he harms demons and he now often fights on Buffy's side, after at first fighting just {{for the pleasure of}} brawling. His motivations changed when, in the fifth season, Spike realized he {{had fallen in love with}} Buffy. She initially rejected him, but after and just before her death they had begun to form a friendship of sorts. She has been confiding in him; prior to this episode, he is the only one to whom Buffy has revealed that she was in heaven.|$|E
5|$|The theatre also hosts {{a variety}} of special events, and offers a number of {{education}} and outreach programs to school-age children and adults reaching over 61,000 students, professional performers, and audiences each year. One {{example of this is}} the 5th Avenue High School Musical Theatre Awards which <b>evaluate</b> <b>and</b> honor the performances of student actors and stage hands in Washington state high school productions. At the end of each school year, a Tony Awards-style ceremony is held which includes high-profile presenters, performances by nominees, and acceptance speeches by the award recipients. The awards ceremony has become a useful scouting event for colleges looking to recruit talent for their drama departments.|$|E

30|$|The task of OSS-LMS {{evaluation}} and selection is often assigned under schedule pressure, and evaluators {{may not have}} time or experience to plan the {{evaluation and}} selection in detail.
