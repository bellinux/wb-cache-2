5000|$|This {{distinction}} between a Basse-Terre (western side of an island) and a Cabesterre (eastern side of an island) was used in several Caribbean islands colonized by France. The capital of Saint Kitts and Nevis, for example, was named Basseterre because it {{is located on the}} western side of the island of Saint Kitts. Basse-Terre Island was originally called [...] "Guadeloupe" [...] (a name which did not originally include the sister island of <b>Grande-Terre)</b> <b>and</b> as in other French Caribbean islands its western side was called Basse-Terre while its eastern side was called Cabesterre. The capital and main settlement of Guadeloupe was established on the Basse-Terre side of the island in the 17th century and was simply called the city of Basse-Terre (in the same way as what happened in Saint Kitts). Later in the 18th century, the entire island (and not just its western side) {{came to be known as}} Basse-Terre Island, probably under the influence of its largest settlement the city of Basse-Terre, and the name Guadeloupe was then used for the combined islands of Basse-Terre Island <b>and</b> <b>Grande-Terre.</b>|$|R

The {{location}} of the house he {{was born in}} is now a State owned Museum (a later house, on the same property, built in 1788) referred to as [...] "Madame John's Legacy". The original building was erected in 1725 and sold to René Beluche (Renato's Father) about 1777. The son of a recently emigrated Frenchman whose wig-making business was a front for smuggling, he lived on the family's Chalmette plantation. In 1802 Beluche went to sea as a pilot’s mate on the flagship of the Spanish fleet, and by 1805 he was master of a merchant schooner. By this time, the Laffitte brothers had established a smuggling base at Grande Terre Island in Barataria Bay on the Louisiana coast. Flying the French flag, Beluche captured Spanish and English ships and sent them to <b>Grande-Terre</b> <b>and</b> Cartagena de Indias in New Granada. There is evidence that Beluche may have used the alias Pierre (or Pedro) Brugman, though it appears that this may have been an associate - or at least a convenient look-alike.|$|R

On 2 February a British fleet under Vice-admiral Sir John Jervis and 6,100 troops under Lieutenant-general Sir Charles Grey, left Barbados. The troops were landed on Martinique on 5 February and by 16 March, gained control of the whole island, save the town of Fort Royal and the forts Bourbon and Louis. Seaman and marines from the fleet then joined the troops in laying siege to {{the town and the}} forts. The whole of Martinique had surrendered by 22 March 1794. Leaving a contingent to hold the island, the British left for St Lucia on 31 March, capturing it on 4 April. Jervis then took his fleet to Guadeloupe, forcing the capitulation of <b>Grande-Terre</b> <b>and</b> Basse-Terre on 12 and 20 April respectively.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} study of the genetic {{diversity}} and structure of a tropical tree in an insular system. Santalum austrocaledonicum is endemic to the archipelago of New Caledonia and is exploited for oil extraction from heartwood. A total of 431 individuals over 17 populations were analysed for eight polymorphic microsatellite loci. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 33 and the observed heterozygosity per population ranged from 0. 01 in Maré to 0. 74 in Ile des Pins. The genetic diversity was lowest in the most recent islands, the Loyautés, and highest in the oldest island, Grande Terre, as well as the nearby small Ile des Pins. Significant departures from panmixia were observed for some loci-population combinations (per population F IS = 0 - 0. 03 on <b>Grande-Terre</b> <b>and</b> Ile des Pins, and 0 - 0. 67 on Loyautés). A strong genetic differentiation among all islands was observed (F ST = 0. 22), and the amount of differentiation increased with geographic distance in Iles Loyauté and in Grande Terre. At both population and island levels, island age and isolation seem to be the main factors influencing the amount of genetic diversity. In particular, populations from recent islands had large average F IS that could not be entirely explained by null alleles or a Wahlund effect. This result suggests that, at least in some populations, selfing occurred extensively. Conclusively, our results indicate a strong influence of insularity on the genetic diversity and structure of Santalum austrocaledonicu...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{occurrence}} {{and distribution}} of archaeal and bacterial glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipids (GDGTs) in continental saline environments have been rarely investigated. Here, the abundance {{and distribution of}} archaeal isoprenoid GDGTs (iGDGTs) and archaeol, and of bacterial branched GDGTs (brGDGTs) in four tropical water ponds of contrasting salinity in two islands from the French Western Indies, <b>Grande-Terre</b> <b>and</b> La Désirade, have been determined. The sedimentary distribution of the GDGTs strongly differed between the two islands. Caldarchaeol was largely predominant among iGDGTs in the (hyper) saline ponds from Grande-Terre, suggesting a substantial contribution of iGDGTs derived from methanogenic Archaea. In contrast, both caldarchaeol and crenarchaeol were present in high relative abundance in the low salinity ponds from La Désirade, suggesting that iGDGTs were derived from mixed archaeal communities. In addition, the relative proportion of the most methylated brGDGTs was much higher in Grande-Terre ponds than in La Désirade ponds. The applicability of different proxies based on GDGTs and archaeol was tested for these specific environments. The relative abundance of archaeol vs. caldarchaeol (ACE index) was comparable for the four ponds, independent of salinity, showing that the ACE might not necessarily track salinity change. Moreover, the relative proportion of caldarchaeol vs. total iGDGTs was unexpectedly observed to increase with salinity, suggesting production of this compound by halophilic Archaea. The supposed high abundance of methanogenic Archaea in Grande-Terre ponds prevented the application of TEX 86 as a temperature proxy, whereas the TEX 86 could be successfully used for local temperature reconstruction in La Désirade ponds. BrGDGTs seem to be produced predominantly in situ (water column and/or sediment) in hypersaline ponds from Grande-Terre, but in La Désirade ponds likely result from a mixture of soil and aquatic sources. In Grande-Terre ponds, brGDGT-derived temperature estimates generated using either soil or lacustrine calibrations were much lower than expected. The mismatch between expected and estimated temperature might {{be explained by the}} presence of halophilic microbial communities producing specific brGDGT distributions in the saline ponds from Grande-Terre. The study shows that the sources of brGDGTs, iGDGTs and archaeol (i) may strongly differ in aquatic environments of varying salinity, even at a regional scale, and (ii) have to be constrained before tetraether-derived proxies in such settings can be confidently applied...|$|R
