40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports a}} dynamic causal {{modeling}} study of electrocorticographic (ECoG) data that addresses functional asymmetries between <b>forward</b> and backward <b>connections</b> {{in the visual}} cortical hierarchy. Specifically, we ask whether <b>forward</b> <b>connections</b> employ gamma-band frequencies, while backward connections preferentially use lower (beta-band) frequencies. We addressed this question by modeling empirical cross spectra using a neural mass model equipped with superficial and deep pyramidal cell populations—that model the source of <b>forward</b> and backward <b>connections,</b> respectively. This enabled us to reconstruct the transfer functions and associated spectra of specific subpopulations within cortical sources. We first established that Bayesian model comparison was able to discriminate between <b>forward</b> and backward <b>connections,</b> {{defined in terms of}} their cells of origin. We then confirmed that model selection was able to identify extrastriate (V 4) sources as being hierarchically higher than early visual (V 1) sources. Finally, an examination of the auto spectra and transfer functions associated with superficial and deep pyramidal cells confirmed that <b>forward</b> <b>connections</b> employed predominantly higher (gamma) frequencies, while backward connections were mediated by lower (alpha/beta) frequencies. We discuss these findings in relation to current views about alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations and predictive coding in the brain...|$|R

A number of revised algorithms have been proposed to improve TCP performance. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to improve TCP throughpt without modifying TCP protocol. Since TCP uses the acknowledgments (ACKs) to adjust the sending rate, the basic idea of our scheme is to delay (or shape) ACKs traveling through a node where its <b>forward</b> <b>connection</b> is congested. The algorithm aims to fully eliminate packet loss caused by buffer overflow. We implement this scheme in the intermediate nodes connecting satellite links and make a simulation study on its effect.

The proposed method uses a simple implementation {{to inform the}} traffic source {{at a very early}} stage that the network is becoming overloaded or congested and ask the source to slow down its transmission rate. Since TCP uses acknowledgments (ACKs) to adjust the number of packets sent over the network, the basic idea of our scheme is to control (or delay) TCP ACKs in the access node where its <b>forward</b> <b>connection</b> through the network is congested. To shorten the control loop, the congested network node generates ICMP Source Quench to initiate ACK control at the access node at the onset of congestion. The mechanism is proven very effective to improve TCP throughput and fairness performance and reduce buffer occupancy, by theoretical analysis and simulations. In particular, formulae for buffer occupancy and average throughput are derived relative to the distance between the congested node and the source terminal.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-based investigation of mechanisms underlying {{the reduction of}} mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitudes under the NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine. We applied dynamic causal modeling and Bayesian model selection to data from a recent ketamine study of the roving MMN paradigm, using a cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Our modeling was guided by a predictive coding framework that unifies contemporary "adaptation" and "model adjustment" MMN theories. Comparing a series of dynamic causal models that allowed for different expressions of neuronal adaptation and synaptic plasticity, we obtained 3 major results: 1) We replicated previous results that both adaptation and short-term plasticity are necessary to explain MMN generation per se; 2) we found significant ketamine effects on synaptic plasticity, but not adaptation, and a selective ketamine effect on the <b>forward</b> <b>connection</b> from left primary auditory cortex to superior temporal gyrus; 3) this model-based estimate of ketamine effects on synaptic plasticity correlated significantly with ratings of ketamine-induced impairments in cognition and control. Our modeling approach thus suggests a concrete mechanism for ketamine effects on MMN that correlates with drug-induced psychopathology. More generally, this demonstrates the potential of modeling for inferring on synaptic physiology, and its pharmacological modulation, from electroencephalography data...|$|E
40|$|The {{perception}} of facial affect engages a distributed cortical network. We used functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and dynamic causal modeling to characterize effective connectivity during explicit (conscious) categorization of affective stimuli in the human brain. Specifically, we examined the modulation of connectivity from posterior regions of the face-processing network to the lateral ventral prefrontal cortex (VPFC) during affective categorization and we tested for a potential role of the amygdala (AMG) in mediating this modulation. We found that explicit processing of facial affect led to prominent modulation (increase) in the effective connectivity from the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) to the VPFC, while there was less evidence for modulation of the afferent connections from fusiform gyrus and AMG to VPFC. More specifically, the <b>forward</b> <b>connection</b> from IOG to the VPFC exhibited a selective increase under anger (as opposed to fear or sadness). Furthermore, Bayesian model comparison suggested that the modulation of afferent connections to the VPFC was mediated directly by facial affect, as opposed to an indirect modulation mediated by the AMG. Our results thus suggest that affective information is conveyed to the VPFC along multiple parallel pathways and that AMG activity is not sufficient to account for the gating of information transfer to the VPFC during explicit emotional processing...|$|E

Therefore, we investigated the underlying neural activation occurring when we encounter someone acting in angry or joyful situation. We hypothesized a dynamic interplay between the right insula, both involved in mapping visceral states associated with emotional experiences and autonomic control, and the bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG), part of the "social brain", when facing angry vs. joyful situations. Twenty participants underwent a {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) scanning session while watching video clips of actors grasping objects in joyful and angry situations. The analyses of functional connectivity, psychophysiological interaction (PPI) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM), all revealed changes in functional connectivity associated with the angry situation. Indeed, the DCM model showed that the modulatory effect of anger increased the ipsilateral <b>forward</b> <b>connection</b> from the right insula to the right STG, while it suppressed the contralateral one. Our findings reveal a critical role played by the right insula when we are engaged in angry situations. In addition, they suggest that facing angry people modulates the effective connectivity between these two nodes associated, respectively, with autonomic responses and bodily movements and human-agent motion recognition. Taken together, these results add knowledge to the current understanding of hierarchical brain network for social cognition...|$|E

Functional asymmetry in <b>forward</b> and backward <b>connections</b> was addressed by comparing dynamic causal models of MEG responses induced by visual processing of normal and scrambled faces. We compared models with and without nonlinear (between-frequency) coupling in both <b>forward</b> and backward <b>connections.</b> Bayesian model comparison indicated that the best model had nonlinear <b>forward</b> and backward <b>connections.</b> Using the best model we then quantified frequency-specific causal influences mediating observed spectral responses. We found a striking asymmetry between forward and backward connections; in which high (gamma) frequencies in higher cortical areas suppressed low (alpha) frequencies in lower areas. This suppression was significantly greater than the homologous coupling in the <b>forward</b> <b>connections.</b> Furthermore, exactly the asymmetry was observed when we examined face-selective coupling (i. e., coupling under faces minus scrambled faces). These results highlight the importance of nonlinear coupling among brain regions and point to a functional asymmetry between <b>forward</b> and backward <b>connections</b> in the human brain {{that is consistent with}} anatomical and physiological evidence from animal studies. This asymmetry is also consistent with functional architectures implied by theories of perceptual inference in the brain, based on hierarchical generative models...|$|R

Using a new procedure to score model evidence without computationally costly estimation, we conducted an exhaustive search for {{the best of all possible}} models. The results elucidate how the activity in the areas from our previously reported analysis (Dumontheil et al., 2010) are causally linked and how the connections are modulated by both the social as well as executive task demands of the task.

40|$|Recent {{views of}} {{information}} processing in the (human) brain emphasize the hierarchical {{structure of the}} central nervous system, which is assumed to {{form the basis of}} a functional hierarchy. Hierarchical predictive processing refers to the notion that higher levels try to predict activity in lower areas, while lower levels transmit a prediction error up the hierarchy whenever the predictions fail. The present study aims at testing hypothetical modulatory effects of unpredictable visual motion on forward connectivities within the visual cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired from 35 healthy volunteers while viewing a moving ball under three different levels of predictability. In two different runs subjects were asked to attend to direction changes in the ball’s motion, where a button-press was required in one of these runs only. Dynamic causal modeling was applied to a network comprising V 1, V 5 and posterior parietal cortex in the right hemisphere. The winning model of a Bayesian model selection indicated an enhanced strength in the <b>forward</b> <b>connection</b> from V 1 to V 5 with decreasing predictability for the run requiring motor response. These results support the notion of hierarchical predictive processing in the sense of an augmented bottom-up transmission of prediction error with increasing uncertainty about motion direction.

40|$|Around the world, vehicle {{emission}} regulations become stricter, increasing {{exhaust emission}} demands. To manage these rules and regulations, vehicle manufacturers {{put a lot}} of effort into minimizing the exhaust emissions. The three-way catalytic converter was developed, and today it is the most commonly used device to control the exhaust emissions. To work properly the catalytic converter needs to control the air-fuel mixture with great precision. This then increases the demands on the engine management systems, causing them to become more complex. With increased complexity, the time effort of optimizing parameters has grown drastically, hence increasing development costs. In addition to this, operating conditions change due to vehicles age, requiring further optimization of the parameters while running. To minimize development cost and to control the air-fuel mixture with great precision during an engines full life span, this master thesis proposes a self-optimized system, i. e. an adaptive system, to control the air-fuel mixture. In the suggested method, the fuel injection to the engine is controlled with help of a linear lambda sensor, which measures the air-fuel mixture. The mapping from injection to measured air-fuel mixture forms a nonlinear system. It can be approximated as a linear function at static engine operating points, allowing the system at each static point to be modelled as a first order system with long time delay. To enable utilization over full operating area, and not only in static point, the controller uses large maps, so called gain-scheduling maps, to change control parameters. The tested controller is model based. It uses an Otto-Smith Predictor and a feed <b>forward</b> <b>connection</b> of target air-fuel.

Twelve healthy adult volunteers participated in the study. They performed a variation of a line-drawing task (Nielsen, 1963;Fourneret and Jeannerod, 1998), in which they moved a cursor on a digital tablet with their right hand without seeing the hand. Visual feedback displayed on a computer monitor was either in correspondence with or deviated from the actual movement. This made participants uncertain as to the agent of the movement and they reported SoA in approximately 50 % of trials when the movement was computer-generated. We tested whether IPC-preSMA coupling was associated with SoA, using dynamic causal modelling (DCM) for induced responses (Chen et al., 2008;Herz et al., 2012). Nine different DCMs were constructed for the early and late phases of the task, respectively. All models included two regions: a superior medial gyrus (preSMA) region and a right supramarginal gyrus (IPC) region. Bayesian models selection (Stephan et al., 2009) favoured a model with input to IPC and modulation of the <b>forward</b> <b>connection</b> to SMA in the late task phase, and a model with input to preSMA and modulation of the backward connection was favoured for the early task phase.

Sources generating the registered magnetic fields were localized with Magnetic Field Tomography (MFT). Anatomical identification of cytoarchitectonically defined areas V 1 /V 2 and V 5 was achieved by means of probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps. We found that the areas V 1 /V 2 and V 5 + (V 5 and other adjacent motion sensitive areas) exhibited two main activations peaks at 100 - 130 ms and at 140 - 200 ms after motion onset. The first peak found for V 1 /V 2, which corresponds to the visual evoked field (VEF) M 1, always preceded the peak found in V 5 +. Additionally, the V 5 + peak was correlated significantly and positively with the second V 1 /V 2 peak. This result supports the idea that the M 1 component is generated not only by the visual area V 1 /V 2 (as it is usually proposed), but also by V 5 +. It reflects a <b>forward</b> <b>connection</b> between both structures, and a feedback projection to V 1 /V 2, which provokes a second activation in V 1 /V 2 around 200 ms. This second V 1 /V 2 activation (corresponding to motion VEF M 2) appeared earlier than the second V 5 + activation but both peaked simultaneously. This result supports the hypothesis that both areas also generate the M 2 component, which reflects a feedback input from V 5 + to V 1 /V 2 and a crosstalk between both structures. Our study indicates that during visual motion analysis, V 1 /V 2 and V 5 + are activated repeatedly through forward and feedback connections and both contribute to m-VEFs M 1 and M 2...|$|E
40|$|It is a truism that {{systems as}} complex as {{vertebrate}} nervous systems are {{more than the sum}} of their parts. What is meant is that the interconnection of numbers of neurons gives rise to collective properties belonging to the neural populations and not to the neurons taken one at a time. The purpose of this essay is to explore some facets of the nature of neural collective properties.    Conventional wisdom holds that such properties emerge from the interconnection of finite numbers of neurons in discrete chains and networks, which are logical and anatomical counterparts of the Jacksonian-Sherringtonian heirarchy of reflex arcs. According to a popular analogy, neurons are like the electronic components of a television receiver which can be connected in a certain way or set of ways to give the properties of the receiver. The central thesis of this essay is the idea that, when neurons strongly interact in sufficiently large numbers (on the order of 10 ' or more), new collective properties emerge that demand a different kind or level of conceptualization.    An analogy equivalent to that given above is the notion that temperature and pressure exist only for a mass, in contrast to the thermal kinetic energy of molecules in the mass. The suggestion is that certain interactive phenomena in vertebrate brains occur only as broadly distributed and continuous events or waves across masses of neurons, and that in some instances these cooperative phenomena may be essential aspects of normal brain function. The task is to describe some of these wave phenomena in terms of underlying collective properties, and to do so in such a way as to minimize confusion between observables and principles. Again by analogy, brain potentials (EEG waves) appear to have somewhat the relation to wave activity of neural masses that flow patterns have to temperature and pressure waves in atmospheric storms. They are observable side effects that are of interest mainly because they give access to the internal dynamics.    The approach used is to review the historical interplay between ideas concerning neural networks and masses, to develop a set of rules for describing neural masses as dynamic entities, and then to discuss some of the implications of those rules for neurophysiology.    Throughout the development the emphasis is placed on the idea of graded neural synaptic interaction, because it is interaction of neurons that gives rise to something {{more than the sum of}} parts. Neurons are connected to each other by structural synaptic linkages. For each neuron there is a certain density of these anatomical connections, referring to the number and size of contacts of each neuron with its neighbors within each unit volume of neural mass. But the significant quantity is the momentary functional or effective connection density, which denotes the level of transfer of influence across a given set of connections at a given time and place. If, for example, a volley arrives on an afferent path to a neuron that is in an absolute refractory state, the functional connection density is zero, even though the anatomical connection density is nonzero.    Two kinds of massive connections are distinguished. The first is a one-way or <b>forward</b> <b>connection</b> from one neuron to neurons in another mass; the second is feedback connection of one neuron with many others in the same mass. Both types give rise to mass actions of many neurons, but only the second gives rise to the collective properties of interest in the present context. That is, neural interactions based on functional interconnection densities give rise to wave phenomena, and, as is shown for some of the neural masses in the mammalian olfactory system, the observable effects of wave patterns in turn provide the means for measuring the intensities of interactions...|$|E

Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) uses Bayesian model inversion and selection to infer the synaptic mechanisms underlying empirically observed brain responses. DCM for electrophysiological data, in particular, aims to estimate the relative strength of synaptic transmission at different cell types and via specific neurotransmitters. Here, we report a DCM validation study concerning inference on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, using different doses of a volatile anaesthetic agent (isoflurane) to parametrically modify excitatory and inhibitory synaptic processing while recording local field potentials (LFPs) from primary auditory cortex (A 1) and the posterior auditory field (PAF) in the auditory belt region in rodents. We test whether DCM can infer, from the LFP measurements, the expected drug-induced changes in synaptic transmission mediated via fast ionotropic receptors; i. e., excitatory (glutamatergic) AMPA and inhibitory GABA(A) receptors. Cross- and auto-spectra from the two regions were used to optimise three DCMs based on biologically plausible neural mass models and specific network architectures. Consistent with known extrinsic connectivity patterns in sensory hierarchies, we found that a model comprising <b>forward</b> <b>connections</b> from A 1 to PAF and backward connections from PAF to A 1 outperformed a model with <b>forward</b> <b>connections</b> from PAF to A 1 and backward connections from A 1 to PAF and a model with reciprocal lateral connections.

Specifically, with increasing levels of anaesthesia, glutamatergic EPSPs decreased linearly, whereas fast GABAergic IPSPs displayed a nonlinear (saturating) increase.

40|$|Dynamic causal {{modelling}} (DCM) {{has been}} applied recently to event-related responses (ERPs) measured with EEG/MEG. DCM attempts to explain ERPs using a network of interacting cortical sources and waveform differences in terms of coupling changes among sources. The aim of this work was to establish the validity of DCM by assessing its reproducibility across subjects. We used an oddball paradigm to elicit mismatch responses. Sources of cortical activity were modelled as equivalent current dipoles, using a biophysical informed spatiotemporal forward model that included connections among neuronal subpopulations in each source. Bayesian inversion provided estimates of changes in coupling among sources and the marginal likelihood of each model. By specifying different connectivity models {{we were able to}} evaluate three different hypotheses: differences in the ERPs to rare and frequent events are mediated by changes in <b>forward</b> <b>connections</b> (F-model), backward connections (B-model) or both (FB-model) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how {{to carry}} TCP/IP over ATM, or, in general, how to carry connectionless and/or connection oriented network layer protocol over connection oriented QoS-ed datalink layer. Low latency property of ATM is fully extracted both for connectionless and connection oriented communication over TCP/IP without changing the current architecture of TCP/IP network. Regarding connection oriented IP packet forwarding, source host, having the mapping functionality between flow-ID (e. g. in the SIPP 16 header) and VCI/VPI value, <b>forwards</b> <b>connection</b> oriented IP packets cell-by-cell. Connectionless IP packets can be also transferred cell-by-cell through the re-directed (concatenated) VCCs which bypass IP processing in the intermediate routers, when the cache for re-directed VCCs is hit. Otherwise, {{they will be}} forwarded to the adjacent router (hop-by-hop IP forwarding). Also, the active connectionless IP packet flow can use a dedicated VCC as a IP forwarding cache. Connectionless I...|$|R
