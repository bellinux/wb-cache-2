25|$|With {{the advent}} of {{large-scale}} ranches worked by extended families with staffs of cowboys, wranglers and hired help, Jackson <b>Hole</b> <b>saw</b> the construction of planned complexes of buildings, as opposed to ad hoc assemblages of sheds and cabins. The new structures used milled lumber and typical western carpentry details in keeping with Wyoming construction practices. The working ranches moved away from rustic design, reflecting a maturing social order in the newly populated valley, which by 1909 had three sawmills to provide sawn lumber.|$|E

60|$|One day {{the farmer}} {{had to go}} away and stay all night, leaving the old lady alone with two boys. They were not afraid; for they had a gun, and quite longed {{for a chance to}} fire it. Now it {{happened}} that the farmer had a good deal of money in the house, and some bad men knew it; so they waited for him to go away that they might steal it. Cocky was picking about in the field when he heard voices behind the wall, and peeping through a <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> two shabby men hiding there.|$|E
50|$|Diamond <b>hole</b> <b>saws</b> will {{drill through}} tile, {{porcelain}} tiles, granite, marble, concrete, metals and any lapidary material.|$|R
50|$|Saw {{teeth are}} used for most materials, such as wood, plastic, soft plaster, and metal. Diamond <b>hole</b> <b>saws</b> are used to bore holes in brick, concrete, glass, and stone.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{got down}} by their <b>holes.</b> <b>Saw</b> 'em come out, you know, {{and tried to}} cut 'em off. They lolloped out--like rabbits. We ran down and let fly. They ran about wild after our first shot and {{suddenly}} came at us. Went for us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{the core}} plug will twist apart mid-cut, {{creating}} a condition where the core inside the <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> spins on the yet-uncut {{portion of the}} core still in the workpiece. This tends to stop the cutting action of the saw, and if the workpiece is wood or plastic, the friction will start to singe it, creating a burning smell and heating up the <b>hole</b> <b>saw.</b> The twisted-off core must then be pried out of the <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> before the cutting can continue.|$|E
50|$|An {{adjustable}} <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> {{consists of}} a number of thin metal saw blade-like strips, and a flat disc with a large number of grooves in one side and a shank on the other. By snapping the blades into different grooves on the disc, a <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> {{of a wide variety of}} sizes can be constructed.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> usually {{attaches}} to a mandrel, basically a drill bit with threads {{to secure the}} saw.|$|E
50|$|Chinnarat won {{his third}} event on the Asian Tour at the 2009 Queen's Cup. He entered {{the final round}} a stroke behind the leader but a final round of 67 (-4) {{including}} three birdies on the last five <b>holes</b> <b>saw</b> him win the tournament {{by a margin of}} three strokes.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Hole</b> <b>saws</b> {{take the}} form of a short open {{cylinder}} with saw-teeth on the open edge, used for making relatively large holes in thin material. They remove material only from the edge of the hole, cutting out an intact disc of material, unlike many drills which remove all material in the interior of the hole. [...] They can be used to make large holes in wood, sheet metal and other materials.|$|R
50|$|Diamond <b>hole</b> <b>saws</b> {{are also}} called diamond core drill bits. Laser welded diamond core drill bits {{can be used}} in wet and dry drilling, but not all {{materials}} to be drilled are suitable for dry drilling. Very hard materials like reinforced concrete normally should be drilled with water, otherwise the excessive heat generated during the drilling process may cause the diamonds on the core bit to become blunt, and then lead to poor drilling performance.|$|R
50|$|Tube {{notching}} for {{fabrication of}} circular tube is thus most commonly {{done with a}} rotary <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> in which a <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> of {{the diameter of the}} tube being attached to is fed into the stock to be notched at a semi-perpendicular angle. This produces a semi-circular notch. Rather than using large presses, such saw notching may only require a simple jig, also making it suitable for on-site working.|$|E
50|$|The same as {{conventional}} lock installation. Drilling with a <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> {{may be required}} in doors lacking a hole for assembly.|$|E
50|$|A {{much more}} {{accurate}} way of notching {{the end of}} tube stock {{is to use a}} specially made milling cutter called an end mill. The stock to be notched is clamped into a vise and can then be fed slowly and accurately into a rotating, hardened metal, end mill. The equipment required for this method is considerably more expensive than the <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> method and does not lend well to the same portability of the <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> method as the machine is usually bolted to the floor for stability and safety reasons. This method of end notching is much faster and thus greatly minimizes the chance of damaging the stock either by warping due to heat build up or by squashing as can still happen with a <b>hole</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Saw Kill creek (west) {{contains}} whitewater rapids for rafting and kayaking, {{in addition}} to swimming <b>holes.</b> The <b>Saw</b> Kill also attracts fishers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Holes</b> <b>saws</b> for {{use with}} {{portable}} drills are commonly available in diameters from 6 to 130 mm. The only limit {{on the length of}} the cylinder, and thus depth of the hole, is the need to remove the bit from the hole to clear dust. A 300 mm cylinder length is not uncommon, although shorter bits are usual. By breaking the core off {{from time to time and}} using a shank extension, a diamond core drill can drill to depths many times its length.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, inventors {{continued}} to design, build, and test TBMs {{in response to}} the need for tunnels for railroads, subways, sewers, water supplies, etc. TBMs employing rotating arrays of drills or hammers were patented.TBMs that resembled giant <b>hole</b> <b>saws</b> were proposed.Other TBMs consisted of a rotating drum with metal tines on its outer surface,or a rotating circular plate covered with teeth,or revolving belts covered with metal teeth.However, all of these TBMs proved expensive, cumbersome, and unable to excavate hard rock; interest in TBMs therefore declined. Nevertheless, TBM development continued in potash and coal mines, where the rock was softer.|$|R
5000|$|The {{core plug}} often binds inside the <b>hole</b> <b>saw,</b> and often must be pried out after each hole is cut. Sometimes the prying is quite difficult.|$|E
50|$|Hot tapping is {{also the}} first {{procedure}} in line stopping, where a <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> is used to make {{an opening in the}} pipe, so a line plugging head can be inserted.|$|E
50|$|A {{core drill}} is a drill {{specifically}} designed to remove a cylinder of material, much like a <b>hole</b> <b>saw.</b> The material left inside the drill bit {{is referred to as}} the core.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's warm work," [...] {{observed}} Maggot, as {{he looked}} down the <b>hole,</b> and <b>saw</b> that what the boatsman said was true, {{and that they would}} not be long of reaching the spot where the liquor had been concealed.|$|R
50|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{twist drill}} bits used in metalworking also {{work well in}} wood, {{but they tend to}} chip wood out at the entry and exit of the hole. In some cases, as in rough holes for carpentry, the quality of the hole does not matter, and a number of bits for fast cutting in wood exist, including spade bits and self-feeding auger bits. Many types of specialised drill bits for boring clean holes in wood have been developed, including brad-point bits, Forstner bits and <b>hole</b> <b>saws.</b> Chipping on exit can be minimized by using a piece of wood as backing behind the work piece, and the same technique is sometimes used to keep the hole entry neat.|$|R
50|$|A janitor, who <b>saw</b> <b>holes</b> in {{the ceiling}} and had heard {{something}} on the roof, contacted the police.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> (also styled holesaw), {{also known}} as a hole cutter, is a saw blade of [...] (ring) shape, whose annular [...] creates a hole in the {{workpiece}} without having to cut up the core material. It is used in a drill. Hole saws typically have a pilot drill bit at their center to keep the saw teeth from walking. The fact that a <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> creates the hole without needing to cut up the core often makes it preferable to twist drills or spade drills for relatively large holes (especially those larger than 25 mm). The same hole can be made faster and using less power.|$|E
50|$|Cutting with a <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> is {{analogous}} to some machining operations, called trepanning in the trade, that swing a cutter analogous to a fly cutter {{in order to achieve}} a similar result of annular kerf and intact core.|$|E
5000|$|Drill {{holes in}} wall with <b>hole</b> <b>saw,</b> taking firestops, {{plumbing}} pipes, and other obstructions into account. It may be desirable to drill two holes in each wall cavity/joist section, {{one at the}} bottom and a second at the top for both verification and top-off.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hole</b> saw: {{ring-shaped}} <b>saw</b> {{to attach}} to a power drill, used for cutting a circular hole in material.|$|R
6000|$|Dick {{looked and}} then he, too, gave a cry. From under {{the edge of}} a rock they saw one end of a heavy wooden chest. A part of the side was split away and through the <b>hole</b> they <b>saw</b> a {{quantity}} of gold money! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's safe {{now as a}} {{squirrel}} in a <b>hole.</b> I <b>saw</b> him dartin' among the trees with his white eagle feathers stickin' up like a buck's flag," [...] replied Jonathan. [...] "He can run. If I'd only had my rifle loaded! But I'm not sure he was that arrow-shootin' Shawnee." ...|$|R
50|$|Notching in {{thin-wall}} tube {{may also}} {{be carried out by}} abrasive tools, reducing some of the risk of damage from a <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> snatching. This also allows more complex shapes to be performed, such as vee notches. In some cases, a helical end mill cutter may be used.|$|E
50|$|The {{depth to}} which a <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> can cut {{is limited by the}} depth of its cup-like shape. Most hole saws have a fairly short aspect ratio of {{diameter}} to depth, and they are used to cut through relatively thin workpieces. However, longer aspect ratios are available for applications that warrant them.|$|E
50|$|The novel {{opens with}} a {{deceased}} programmer inside a device that has driven a <b>hole</b> <b>saw</b> {{through the back of}} her neck.We then meet the protagonist, a professional social engineer named James Pryce who works for Red Rook, a gray-hat security company. He attends a meeting at a giant media company, run by twins Blake and Blythe Randall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} the box was a hole {{perhaps an}} inch in diameter. As they looked through the <b>hole</b> they <b>saw</b> the picture of a man. It was a most {{marvelous}} picture. It bowed and smiled and waved its hands and took off its hat with the most perfect naturalness and grace. Every motion was perfect....|$|R
60|$|But Otter {{fell into}} no <b>hole</b> and he <b>saw</b> no crocodile, since, as it chanced, the Water Dweller of the People of the Mist was a bachelor.|$|R
50|$|Travers {{took the}} lead in the third round with a 73, a shot ahead of Barnes, Tellier, Bob MacDonald, and Mike Brady, with McNamara two behind. MacDonald shot a 78 in the final round to finish in third, while Barnes and Tellier both shot 79 to finish in fourth. McNamara posted a 75 to total 298 as Travers made the turn at 39, and needed a 37 on the back-nine to win the title. His drive at the 10th went out of bounds, while his second shot found the rough. His third shot cleared the water {{surrounding}} the green and settled less than three feet (0.9 m) from the hole. He managed to save par with a 15-footer (4.5 m) at the 11th, three-putted for bogey at the 12th, but then made a birdie at 15. Pars over the final three <b>holes</b> <b>saw</b> him finish with a 76 and a 297 total.|$|R
