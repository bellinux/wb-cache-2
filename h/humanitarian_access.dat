25|$|The International Day of Peace, {{sometimes}} unofficially {{known as}} World Peace Day, is observed annually on 21 September. It {{is dedicated to}} peace, and specifically the absence of war and violence, such as might be occasioned by a temporary ceasefire in a combat zone for <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>access.</b> The day was first celebrated in 1982, and is kept by many nations, political groups, military groups, and peoples. In 2013, for the first time, the Day has been dedicated to peace education, i.e. by the key preventive means to reduce war sustainably.|$|R

It additionally underscored the need for refraining from escalation of the conflict, calling for an investigation that will meet international standards, and expressed hope that this incident will not hamper the recently restarted Middle East peace process. Furthermore, it emphasized the need for <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>access</b> to the civilian population of the Gaza Strip. As a member of NATO, Croatia activated an emergency decision-making mechanism.|$|R

The resolution does not describe the mission as an investigation as demanded by Arab nations, due to diplomatic pressure from the United States and Israel.|$|R
25|$|Aid {{may serve}} {{one or more}} functions: it may be given as a signal of {{diplomatic}} approval, or to strengthen a military ally, to reward a government for behaviour desired by the donor, to extend the donor's cultural influence, to provide infrastructure needed by the donor for resource extraction from the recipient country, or to gain other kinds of commercial <b>access.</b> <b>Humanitarian</b> and altruistic purposes are at least {{partly responsible for the}} giving of aid.|$|R
2500|$|There {{has been}} an extreme {{shortage}} of trucks entering the Gaza strip {{since the beginning of}} the conflict. In December 2005, an average of 631 trucks was entering Gaza strip on a daily basis. This figure has dropped to 475 trucks daily by May 2007, and by 27 December 2008, the first day of the attacks, Kerem Shalom has a daily average of 73 trucks entering the Gaza strip. The UN reports that international agencies have faced [...] "unprecedented denial" [...] of access to Gaza since 5 November. <b>Humanitarian</b> <b>access</b> remains unreliable and needs to be granted everyday without restriction. By 5 February, one month and 8 days after the beginning of Israeli attacks, the UN reported that the number of truckloads of aid permitted to enter Gaza daily by the Israeli authorities remains insufficient.|$|E

2500|$|French President Emanuel Macron {{described}} {{the situation as}} [...] "genocide" [...] and [...] "ethnic purification", and alluded to the prospect of UN-led intervention. In a statement, the French foreign ministry said: [...] "As we recently indicated, France is concerned by the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Rakhine State. It calls for the cessation of violence against the civilian populations who {{have been forced to}} flee in huge numbers and demands that the Burmese security forces ensure their protection and guarantee the restoration of safe <b>humanitarian</b> <b>access.</b> We reaffirm our support for the work of the humanitarian organizations on the ground. They provide aid and protection to all civilian populations. We are helping the French NGOs in order to respond {{to the needs of the}} affected populations as well as the internally displaced persons in Rakhine State; this is in addition to France’s voluntary contribution to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). France calls on Bangladesh to continue to accept the Rohingya who are seeking refuge within its borders. A political solution must be found in order to put an end to this cycle of violence. In this respect, we reaffirm our support for the Burmese government in implementing the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State chaired by Kofi Annan".|$|E
30|$|Humanitarian NGOs, {{like all}} other types of organizations, address {{particular}} stakeholders {{in order to gain}} and maintain legitimacy. An increase in organizational legitimacy means an increase in support, resources, and hence survival prospects (Meyer and Rowan 1977). The more the aims and activities of an organization resonate with the expectations of its stakeholders, the more legitimate an organization seems and the more support it will get (Benford and Snow 2000). In the case of <b>humanitarian</b> NGOs, <b>access</b> to those in need and the security of their staff in crisis zones also increase in relation to greater legitimacy (Sezgin and Dijkzeul 2013). Owing to the dichotomies noted above, secular and traditional Islamic aid cultures provide fundamentally different conditions of legitimacy in terms {{of the extent to which}} their actions are perceived as desirable, proper, or appropriate within their institutional environment (Suchman 1995).|$|R
30|$|Slim (2002) {{explains}} that humanitarian action necessitates the linking of suffering to innocence, as an ‘innocent victim’ is ‘more likely {{to generate the}} giving reflex than an image of people as oppressed rights-bearers demanding a duty from states and peoples across the world’ (p. 9). Medicalisation, then, depoliticises the (female) victim/survivor of sexual violence in order to render her, as a recipient of international aid, ‘palatable, legitimate, even sympathetic’ (Ticktin 2011, p. 260)—not unrelated to the significance placed on sexual integrity, Victorian ideas {{about the loss of}} honour, and societal views that blame victims for their own rape (Engle 2014). Medicalisation and consequent depoliticisation have not only allowed victims/survivors of sexual violence to become the ‘poster child for humanitarian aid’ but also connects humanitarian work on sexual violence to political neutrality, often crucial for <b>humanitarian</b> actors’ <b>access</b> to and relative safety in war zones (Ticktin 2011, pp. 250 – 251).|$|R
40|$|The North Korean {{refugee crisis}} merits {{significant}} international attention {{because these people}} are the most vulnerable group and the silent victims in our international community {{of the last few}} decades. Their government does not have the ability to protect its citizens. It is a question of State Sovereignty as to whether China recognizes North Koreans as refugees or not and provides them with humanitarian relief. China argues that North Koreans are not refugees, forcibly repatrates them, and blocks UNHCR and <b>Humanitarian</b> workers' <b>access</b> to protect them. The aim of this thesis is to explore the duties of China as a pertaining the non-refoulement and human rights standards according to the theory of State responsibility. It will also endevour to discuss the North Koreans' human rights situation and their refugee eligibility in a bid to support North Koreans' refugee claims and protect them from forcible repatriation...|$|R
2500|$|In 2009 the Committee on the Honouring of Obligations and Commitments of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe {{asked the}} European Commission for Democracy Through Law (Venice Commission) for {{an opinion on}} the law on {{occupied}} territories of Georgia. The Commission's resulting March 2009 report criticised the Georgian law. The law was at odds with UN Security Council resolutions that were binding both on the Russian Federation and on Georgia. The report said that the law raised concerns [...] "with regard to <b>humanitarian</b> <b>access</b> to the conflict affected areas." [...] The terms used in Article 2 contradicted 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Limitation on free migration [...] "may be in contradiction with the Georgian international engagements." [...] The Commission also stressed Georgia's obligation to respect the 1951 Refugee Convention. The commission also criticised the law's lack of clarity, saying that [...] "the text {{of the law is}} not clear." [...] In its aspects dealing with private property (Article 5), it might have violated Article 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the principle of proportionality, as well as additionally violating further aspects of the Hague Convention (The Laws and Customs of War on Land). A restriction and criminalisation of economic activities (Article 6) was contrary to the rule of customary international law, and also the IV Geneva Convention. The Commission also recommended [...] "to insert a clarifying provision" [...] into the law regarding basic documents issued by illegal authorities concerning the personal status.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} finding the role of the United Nations in the elimination of the Lords Resistance Army in Africa, and to help address the humanitarian crisis that occurred because of the civil conflict caused by the LRA armed forces in Uganda. The motive of the LRA and the horrid human rights abuse conducted, have led United Nations to engage on several engagements to eliminate the group. In other words, the United Nations has succeed to help address the humanitarian crisis by the help of Office of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and kick the armed forces from Uganda. Challenges though are still faced, like the complication of the Security Council priorities, Office of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rightss tasks to help the <b>humanitarian</b> crisis, <b>access</b> towards LRA affected areas, and the limited mandate of the peacekeeping forces.

50|$|Due to {{the number}} of {{civilian}} casualties and the deteriorating humanitarian situation, Israel faced significant international pressure for a ceasefire, the establishment of a <b>humanitarian</b> corridor, <b>access</b> to the population of Gaza and the lifting of the blockade. On 7 January, Israel opened a humanitarian corridor to allow the shipment of aid into Gaza. The Israeli army agreed to interrupt fighting for three hours and Hamas agreed not to launch rockets during the pause. Israel repeated the ceasefire either daily or every other day. Aid officials and the UN praised the truce, but said it was not enough as fighting usually resumed immediately following the humanitarian ceasefires. An Israeli Government report, published in July 2009, notes that during the period between 8 and 17 January, Hamas fired a total of 44 rockets and mortars at Israel during humanitarian pauses. An independent report commissioned jointly by the Israeli NGO Physicians for Human Rights and the Palestinian Medical Relief Society notes that according to testimonies by local witnesses, there were several cases where IDF ground forces breached the daily ceasefire agreement.|$|R

30|$|In {{the study}} of the working of aid paradigms, it is {{important}} to highlight the relational property of service provision. It is useful to make a small detour here to discuss the different politics at play in humanitarian aid. Humanitarian politics concern diplomacy and advocacy to convince parties to respect international humanitarian law and to grant <b>humanitarian</b> actors unrestricted <b>access</b> to people in need. Humanitarian aid is also subject to geopolitics and the politics of parties that instrumentalize aid to advance their interests. In addition, there are organizational politics that rule the hierarchies and power games within organizations and make organizations devise strategies in order to gain or retain their competitive advantage vis-à-vis other players.|$|R
30|$|The United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) {{does not}} discern between refugees, {{stateless}} people and economic migrants. Both mass movements to Europe and within Central and South-East Asia consist of complex, mixed migratory movements. Despite the intricacy, the UNHCR speaks about a global refugee crisis in need for coherent management and demanded global action {{to deal with}} the greatest flight of humanity since the Second World War. 3 Also political leaders demanded global action. At a UN Conference in Washington on invitation US President Barrack Obama and a participation of 52 governments in late 2016, Co-host German Foreign Minister Frank- Walter Steinmeier stated that the world needed a “global management of migration”. In accordance, the the G 20 has turned its attention to the refugee crisis. In a statement the G 20 said a “coordinated and comprehensive” response is needed to surmount the crisis. Demanding an international response and burden sharing of the crisis, the G 20 Communique demands collective action on refuge settlement and admission, <b>humanitarian</b> aid and <b>access</b> for refugees to services, education and livelihood opportunities.|$|R
