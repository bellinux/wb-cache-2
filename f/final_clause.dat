5|$|In January 1920 Lasker and José Raúl Capablanca {{signed an}} {{agreement}} to play a World Championship match in 1921, noting that Capablanca was not free to play in 1920. Because of the delay, Lasker insisted on a <b>final</b> <b>clause</b> {{that allowed him to}} play anyone else for the championship in 1920, that nullified the contract with Capablanca if Lasker lost a title match in 1920, and that stipulated that if Lasker resigned the title Capablanca should become World Champion. Lasker had previously included in his agreement before World War I to play Akiba Rubinstein for the title a similar clause that if he resigned the title, it should become Rubinstein's.|$|E

25|$|Despite the agreement, Ali Pasha {{remained}} unconvinced. The fifth clause {{indicated that}} the Ottomans had recognized Montenegro's independence, while the <b>final</b> <b>clause</b> {{made no mention of}} Ali Pasha at all. Indeed, Ali Pasha resented what he viewed as Mehmed Pasha's interference in the affairs of the Herzegovina eyalet and began plotting to undermine the agreement. In early 1839, Njegoš sent a delegation consisting of Daković, vojvoda Radovan Piper, reverend Stevan Kovačević and several others to Bosnia to ascertain the exact amount that the people of Grahovo would be paying to the Sultan. Mehmed Pasha received the Montenegrins well, but when the delegation travelled south to Mostar, Ali Pasha had them arrested. Several warriors from Grahovo went to Mostar in the hope of freeing their kinsmen, but were impaled on Ali Pasha's orders. The Grahovo delegates remained in Ottoman custody until May 1839, when they were released following the arrest of several other Montenegrins who then took their place as Ali Pasha's hostages. For his part, Njegoš backed down on his commitment to raze any Montenegrin fortifications overlooking Grahovo and left the Humac fortress intact, ensuring that the agreement between him and Mehmed Pasha was never implemented.|$|E

500|$|Sotomayor {{reasoned}} that the majority ignored ICWA’s logical structure and adopted a “textually backward reading” by starting its analysis with the <b>final</b> <b>clause</b> of §1912(f). [...] Sotomayor stated that [...] "continued custody" [...] in §1912(f) is [...] "most sensibly read to refer generally to {{the continuation of the}} parent-child relationship that an ICWA [...] "parent" [...] has with his or her child." [...] She also stated that even a non-custodial father-child relationship was a [...] "family" [...] for the purposes of §1912(d) and therefore efforts needed to be made to prevent its breakup. She stated that the majority turned the law [...] "upside down" [...] to reach their result. [...] Rather than granting Indian birth fathers an “undeserved windfall”, Sotomayor reasoned Congress had simply provided the rights birth fathers already enjoyed in several states. [...] By instead deferring to each state’s laws, Sotomayor thinks the majority read ICWA as “an illogical piecemeal scheme”.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} adverbial clauses in spoken {{as well as}} written Chinese discourse. The adverbial clauses in the spoken data were categorized into (i) initial clauses {{that occur in the}} initial position with respect to their linked material across continuing intonation, (ii) <b>final</b> <b>clauses</b> that occur in the final position with respect to their linked material across continuing intonation, and (iii) <b>final</b> <b>clauses</b> that occur in the final position with respect to their linked material across final intonation. Those in the written data were classified into (i) initial and (ii) <b>final</b> <b>clauses</b> that occur in the initial or <b>final</b> <b>clauses</b> that occur in the initial or final position, respectively, with respect to their main clauses. An analysis of the spoken and written data shows that the temporal, conditional, and concessiveclauses are quite different from the other adverbial clauses. Specifically, the causal clauses commonly appear in the final position with respect to their associated material in the spoken data, while the initial and <b>final</b> causal <b>clauses</b> are nearly evenly distributed in the written data. The data suggest that temporal, conditional, and concessive clauses, like topics, are presupposed parts of their sentences; i. e., all of them may be thought of as establishing frameworks for the interpretation of propositions that follow, which seem to be prototypically textual in their functioning. By contrast, causal clauses in Chinese are noticeably distinct from other adverbial clauses not only in spoken data, but also in written data; they play interactional as well as textual roles in discourse linking...|$|R

Purpose clause topological mapping aims to explain the universal conceptual characteristics of morphosyntactic coding in the communicative functions, as well as the cognitive-psychological mechanisms involved in the use. Purpose clauses differ from typical adverbial relations, and are a special case which, is closely related to complement clauses and some relative clauses.|$|R

40|$|Particular {{problems}} in EU human rights protection {{stem from the}} <b>final</b> <b>clauses</b> of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (Articles 51 ff). This paper examines these key provisions {{as well as the}} proposals for amendments which have been put forward by Working Group II of the Convention and which have been accepted by the Convention's Praesidium in February 2003. The author argues that {{a closer look at the}} adjustments to the <b>final</b> <b>clauses</b> reveals that cardinal problems with far-reaching systemic implications remain unsettled. This holds true, particularly, for the question of whether Member States will continue to be bound by EU fundamental rights when they derogate from Community law, or "Union law" in future. The same is true, second, as regards the question of whether and under what conditions the supremacy of Community law (or, according to the Praesidium's draft Article 9, "the law of the Union") cannot supersede national fundamental rights. A third fundamental problem has been added, unnecessarily, to the former two through Article 52 para 5 on "rights and principles" which is apt to negatively affect the significance and scope of fundamental rights set out in the Charter. As also the other proposed adjustments can hardly be regarded as adequately addressing actual or perceived constitutional concerns, this paper submits that existing doubts are reinforced as to whether the much-discussed "Convention method" really allows for an appropriate treatment of fundamental, albeit technically intricate problems.
