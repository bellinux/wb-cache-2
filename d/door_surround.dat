25|$|The last {{significant}} {{buildings in}} the future district came to South Highland {{at the end of}} the decade. On the corner just south of the First Baptist Church, the Cynthard Building was erected in 1930 when the Romanesque Revival doctor's office that had replaced the Union Hotel in 1890, and a house to the south, were themselves demolished. The Cynthard was a single-story commercial block faced in terra cotta topped by a polychrome parapet. Also that year, the third and last bank building downtown was built at 13 Croton Avenue, the corner with North Highland. The First National Bank, which had occupied the spot since 1880, moved into the district's only Art Deco building. It has an unusual neoclassical <b>door</b> <b>surround.</b>|$|E
