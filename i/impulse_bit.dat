It evolved into the Mk VI, developed to reproduce Mk V single-shot tests, which completely characterize thruster performance. It uses an improved coil of hollow copper tube construction and an improved propellant valve, but is electrically identical to the Mk V, using the same capacitors and switches. The Mk VII (early 2000s) has the same geometry as Mk VI, but is designed for high pulse frequency and long-duration firing with a liquid-cooled coil, longer-life capacitors, and fast, high-power solid-state switches. The goal for Mk VII is to demonstrate up to 50 pulses per second at the rated efficiency and <b>impulse</b> <b>bit</b> at 200 kW of input power in a single thruster.

Given that the Tunny indicators used 25 letters (excluding J) for 11 of the positions, but only 23 letters for the twelfth, he tried Kasiski's technique on the first <b>impulse</b> (<b>bit)</b> of the key characters using a repetition of 25 × 23 = 575. This did not produce a large number of repetitions in the columns, but Tutte did observe the phenomenon on a diagonal. He therefore tried again with 574, which showed up repeats in the columns. Recognising that the prime factors of this number are 2, 7 and 41, he tried again with a period of 41 and [...] "got a rectangle of dots and crosses that was replete with repetitions".|$|E

40|$|At {{the chair}} of Space Systems Engineering, {{students}} and staff work {{on the development of}} small propulsion systems in a wide thrust capability. Especially in recent years low thrust propulsion systems have gained an increased amount of interest in the entire department of Space Engineering. To support the development of these propulsion systems, {{there is a need for}} the testing of micropropulsion systems that provide a thrust in the 1 ?N to 5 mN range. This capability complements the existing measurement equipment of the Delft Aerospace Rocket Thrust Stand facility of 0. 5 mN to 1 N. To provide a solution to this need, the research question for this research is phrased as: "How can the DARTS facility be upgraded to measure thrust levels in the 1 ?N to 5 mN range and <b>impulse</b> <b>bits</b> in the 1 ?Ns to 1 mNs range?". Using numerical modelling the answer to that question is found in an upgraded design of the TB- 2 m thrust stand that was developed in 2010 by Perez-Grande. By introducing several improvements, amongst which are the replacement of the sensor system by a capacitive displacement sensor and the use of a segmented counter mass, the range of the TB- 2 m has been extended and the accuracy has been improved to meet the new requirements. A complementary calibration system is designed that allows an in situ calibration for the measurement of both the thrust and <b>impulse</b> <b>bits.</b> Where typical calibration actuators supply a force that is non-linear with engagement distance and have to rely on displacement measurements to linearize the calibration force, the new actuator is able to provide a force that is independent on the distance to the target. Using a specially designed solenoid that has a linearly varying turn-density along its length, the magnetic field is shaped to provide a constant magnetic gradient. The thrust stand and calibration system are manufactured and tested. Using a previously tested cold gas thruster that is provided by Bradford Engineering, the complete thrust measurement system is validated with hardware-in-the-loop. This process has shown that the pendulum is in a state constant of oscillation. It is expected that this oscillation is removed by the introduction of a Foucault damper in the next design iteration. The validation process has shown that the thrust range is on par with the requirements. Also <b>impulse</b> <b>bits</b> can be measured, but the constant state of oscillation prohibited the detection of the smallest <b>impulse</b> <b>bits</b> of 1 ?Ns.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Electrical and computer engineering. Micropropulsion is an enabling technology for microspacecraft. As requirements for microspacecraft missions become more demanding, so do the requirements for micropropulsion. Therefore, existing technologies require improvement, or new technologies need to be developed. The Ferroelectric Plasma Thruster (FEPT) is a new technology for microspacecraft propulsion. This dissertation is a demonstration of this technology and its characteristics. To produce thrust, the FEPT produces a plasma and a beam of ions. The acceleration of these ions away from the thruster is the mass-transfer mechanism of the thruster. Plasma parameters were measured such as average ion current, ion energy, ion species, and average power dissipated. Photography was performed including open-shutter photography and framing photography. These measured parameters were used to make a calculation of the thrust due to ions. For a more direct measurement of thrust, a micro-thrust stand was designed, built, and characterized. In addition, the mass flow rate from the thruster was measured by weighing the FEPT before and after operation. Combining these two measurements leads to a calculation of the specific impulse. Measured parameters include a thrust of [tilde operator] 704 N, specific impulse of [tilde operator] 400 s, average power of [tilde operator] 6 W, and <b>impulse</b> <b>bits</b> of [lesser than] 1 nN [multiple] s. Advantages of the FEPT include its small mass of less than 6 g and its inherent simplicity. Only a single, low-power rf power supply is needed to form plasma and accelerate particles. Also, electrons are also expelled from the thruster which potentially removes the necessity of a separate neutralizer. Finally, the <b>impulse</b> <b>bits</b> delivered by the FEPT are extremely small which leads to very fine control of microspacecraft attitude...|$|R

40|$|Attitude {{control of}} a {{prototype}} satellite bus using fluid mechanical vectoring on an aerospike nozzle is demonstrated. The design achieves thrust vectoring by injecting pro- pellant asymmetrically into the unconstrained aerospike exhaust plume near the nozzle base. The prototype system uses cold-gas thrusters to both spin-up and de-tumble the test article. The system is configured with axially directed annular flows that produce large lon- gitudinal thrusts and smaller secondary lateral-injection flows for side thrusts. Both open and closed-loop attitude control, with and without main aerospike annular flow active, are demonstrated. Proportional, integral, derivative (PID) regulation is used for closed-loop attitude control. When the vectoring ports are operated with no primary plenum flow, very small <b>impulse</b> <b>bits</b> are generated.
