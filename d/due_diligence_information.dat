During the past decades, mergers and acquisitions were intensively researched through the lens of strategic management, corporate finance, behavioral finance etc. Despite the intense effort, the made progress is still fragmented and lacks unifying theories that approaches the whole acquisition process on the one side, and indepth research of critical factors on the other side. The dissertation topic intends to establish vital link between research and practice, deeply exploring infor mation asymmetry and role of exploratory learning in the pre - acquisition phase of cross - border acquisition. This thesis investigates the critical factors – and the scope of the due diligence, which is carried out in the pre - acquisition phase. Pre - acquisition due diligence theoretically conforms to the organizational learning theory, proposing that the more the acquiring firm learns about the acquisition target, the higher the probability of successful acquisition. The central hypothesis of the comprehensive model states that due diligence in the pre - acquisition phase is necessary for acquisition success. The empirical evidence is data sample of acquisitions made in the automotive manufacturing firms and their cross - border acquisitions in the European automot ive industry. The main results support the proposition that Choice of Strategic Partner, Business Capabilities and HR Knowledge and Financial Factors and Acquisition Premium are critical factors of due diligence needed for acquisition success. The main eff ort lies in pinpointing the specific area by which the business capabilities and knowledge transfer build the main asset in the realization of synergy values in the acquisition phase. In this context, the valuation of the business capabilities of the acqui sition targets is classified as the main challenge reflecting suitability of the acquisition price and establishing value generation from the combined firms in the post - acquisition phase. By studying acquisition risk and critical factors – both success and failure reasons – this research has tested and partially approved a theoretically sound assessment framework that can pre - determine the success or failure of planned acquisition efforts. From a practical standpoint, the research results provide acquisition management with proven method of performing the pre - acquisition evaluation of potential acquisition candidates. Such a reference offers critical factors evidence for firms with acquisition needs.

40|$|Information system (IS) in {{the company}} (hereinafter {{referred}} to as organization) is a broader term, which apart from Information Communication Technology (ICT) defines how users should use technology {{and how they can}} interact with technology in delivering day-to-day business activities and support processes within the organization. We can say that IS encompasses ICT, users, processes, data, events and activities in a particular organization or environment. Nowadays the majority of organizations face the issues of ICT governance. In order to obtain effective information on the status of ICT or IS in general, organizations can perform IS <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> activities. Islovar - Informatics Terminology Dictionary defines this term as an analysis of a particular area of business in the organization in order to provide the management or client with real information on the reviewed segment. In the past two decades, organizations used various ways to increase the volume of business, including mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Prior to any acquisition or capital investment, several activities need to be carried out with initial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> playing the key role. In most cases the initial DD focuses on reviewing liquidity, investments (credit and equity investments), and risk management. With the ever-growing impact of IS on the organizations’ daily business support, reviewing the IS of an organization has become very important, if not vital. This is mainly due to the large dependence of the IS segment on substantial investments in quality and up-to-date support, ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of <b>information.</b> IS initial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is very comprehensive and demanding as it covers a range of segments, such as information security and operational risk assessment. Furthermore it should ascertain and assess compliance with the local regulation, security aspects of the implemented information system and establish and analyze any deviations. In addition <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> of <b>information</b> system should establish the possibility of adjustments to the corporate information system {{in the event of a}} positive decision on capital investment. It is necessary that these activities be performed in a short period of time. Between 1996 and 2006, I conducted over 60 IS <b>due</b> <b>diligences</b> in financial organizations in 15 European countries. Through the implementation of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and analysis of different methods, tools, standards, best practices and procedures (hereinafter approaches) the Universal framework for IS <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> delivery was formed. The presented framework is not a completely new method to be placed alongside others, but an attempt at creating a comprehensive synthesis method using existing approaches upgraded with innovations that proved useful through extensive personal experience with the use of standard approaches. With this framework it is possible to perform an IS <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> in small and large organizations a in a very short period of time. It includes a decision model enabling a transparent, uniform and effective decision-making process. This universal framework has been tested with a case study of four financial institutions in 2007 and 2008. Moreover, for the purpose of this thesis, it was verified in one non-financial organization.

40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&A) {{have become an}} important strategy for international expansion, even though numerous acquisitions fail to achieve their financial and strategic objectives. The risk associated with transactions partly depends {{on the extent to}} which the insight into the target company actually holds true. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is performed to eliminate this <b>information</b> asymmetry. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is an audit conducted prior to the planned transaction. It can be described as a purposeful and systematic investigation of business opportunity and risk during on-going sale negotiations. The importance of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is emphasized widely in the academic literature as well as among M&A practitioners. On the other hand, researches and practitioners have differing views on what and how much is enough for a <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> audit. Therefore, this study examines the role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> in a cross-border acquisition process. The main objective of the research is fulfilled by examining the reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence,</b> recognizing the elements affecting effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and analyzing the need and opportunities for enhancing the utilization of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> For the empirical part of this qualitative study five expert interviews were conducted among experienced Finnish acquirers and advisors. In addition, five expert interviews conducted for a distinct study were utilized as a secondary source of data. The results of this study present fundamental reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> However, conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is not always self-evident. Doubtful attitude towards <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> exists, though it is exceptional. Carefully planning the focus of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and compiling and managing the team conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> are identified as the main elements affecting effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> Altogether, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> can have plural roles which in this study are categorized as the confirmatory, preparative, and cross-functional roles of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> The older academic literature tends to emphasize the confirmatory role whereas the current academic discussion also supports the preparative role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> It can be argued that the roles of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> differ among experienced <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practitioners based on several factors. In attempt to increase the value of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> for acquirers, more than one role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is likely to exist.

A dataset of traditional <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practices was compiled from the literature, which {{formed the basis for}} an interview which was conducted with corporate finance practices. The findings indicate that the traditional <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process is considered to be an evolving process, where <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practices of the last decade are considered to be significantly different from the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> required in acquisitions today. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is also considered to be indispensable, and its scope and importance underestimated.

40|$|Cambridge University Press 2013. In {{the context}} of {{corporate}} accountability, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and complicity are two important concepts. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> as ‘the care that a reasonable person exercises to avoid harm to other persons or their property’. In the business context, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> refers to the ‘research and analysis of a company or organization done {{in preparation for a}} business transaction’, or the ‘duty of a firm’s directors and officers to act prudently in evaluating associated risks in all transactions’. Complicity, on the other hand, is described as ‘association or participation in… a wrongful act’. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> and complicity are thus different notions. This chapter will explore the various possible connections between these two concepts. Questions arising in this respect include, for example, whether the assessment and avoidance of the risk of complicity is part of a company’s <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> responsibility. If so, can complicity liability arise even though the company acted with <b>due</b> <b>diligence,</b> but harm nevertheless occurs? And can <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> responsibilities help to define the elements of complicity liability, with regard to both the question of which acts might result in liability of the company for third party wrongdoing, and which mental element is necessary in order to hold the corporation to account in such circumstances?

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M & A) {{are a big}} part of the corporate finance world. Everyday investment bankers arrange M & A transactions, which bring separate companies together to form larger ones. The key principle behind buying a company is to create shareholder value over and above that of the sum of the two companies. Two companies together are more valuable than two separate companies; at least that's the reasoning behind M & A. Before an M & A transaction, companies usually require some kind of evaluation of the company that is to be acquired. This evaluation is then used to determine whether the transaction should take place, and what the target price should be for the acquiring company. The most commonly known method used to do such an evaluation is known as a <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> The <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process can be a long drawn out process, which can be extremely disruptive to an organisation. <b>Due</b> <b>diligences</b> can take several months to complete in a complex organization. The issue surrounding the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process is that it is not a standardized procedure and each organization or specialist carries out the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process differently, when considering a merger and acquisition. The problem is that there is no one structure, format or model which can make the necessary information available to the decision-makers of the acquiring company without going through the complete <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process. If a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model was available, which could give pertinent information to decision-makers, huge <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> costs could be saved. Therefore the main study objective of this dissertation is to determine the value of a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> before an M & A, and whether a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model would be beneficial to decision-makers of manufacturing companies. The study will lead to the development of a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model that can be used by South African manufacturing organisations for M & A. A combination of the theoretical techniques, literature review data and the empirical study data will be used to determine what should be included in a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model, which can be used by decision-makers to determine whether or not to pursue the merger and acquisition.

40|$|Title: Soft <b>Due</b> <b>Diligence</b> to Improve Integration in Business Acquisitions Level: Master thesis in Business Administration Authors: Emma Sundberg & Robert Svensson Supervisor: Daniella Fjellström Examiner: Maria Fregidou-Malama Date: June 1 st, 2017 Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to create a deeper {{understanding}} of soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and its role in the integration process of acquisitions. Methodology: This research applies a qualitative research approach. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants from an electro engineering company in Sweden that performs business acquisitions and <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> Secondary data was obtained from relevant scientific peer reviewed articles, book, and websites. Findings & Conclusion: This study provides insight regarding the connection between soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and integration. To integrate target employees, it is essential that the soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> assessment manages to provide with knowledge surrounding cultural and HR related issues. Some of the issues identified to influence the integration are: quality of soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> assessment to minimize gap between target and acquiring firm, attitudes of employees, key personnel, organizational cultures, neglected risks and aptness between the target and acquiring firm. It is necessary to gather information about the factors mentioned above for the integration to proceed and for the acquisition to realize its purpose. Finally, if the strategic goal is to integrate an acquired company to achieve synergies and productiveness, the soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> assessment is of major importance to find implications and to act on gathered knowledge. Theoretical contributions: This study is one of the first to apply the concept of soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> to integration in acquisitions. The developed conceptual model reflects the influence of HR and cultural <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> on the integration process. It also signifies the influence of potential risks in the integration emanating from neglected soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> Managerial implications: By conducting soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> assessments the gap between target and acquiring firms could shrink, thus facilitating integration efforts. Managers should evaluate how they can make use of the main factors found influencing integration in their acquisitions. By using such factors, we found how critical aspects of how to successfully integrate retained personnel can be provided to managers and <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> teams. Furthermore, managers can closely scrutinize the risk identified to emerge from substandard soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> assessments, while being aware of how these can help managers to develop a deeper understanding for issues that can affect their integration efforts and facilitate the process by applying appropriate actions. Limitations: Since human and cultural related aspects are considered in this research, the findings related to the specific company with limited room for generalization and integration factors, may not concur with similar research. Furthermore, our research is based on a case study which in addition, limits the external validity. Therefore, there is a possibility of getting different answers with the same questions, thus limiting the application of this research to other companies. Suggestions for further research: Further research should focus on developing a strategic soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> framework to gain in-depth understanding of the target company. In addition, it should be investigated if and how the motives behind an acquisition influence the soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> assessment. ...|$|R
