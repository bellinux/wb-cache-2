40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyse some results of {{cost-benefit}} analysis {{in a sample of}} ISPA (Structural Instrument for pre-accession countries) projects. The focus is particularly on the variability of financial and economic rates of return and how to integrate this information in the EU co- financing mechanism. We investigate, through the analysis of variance of <b>co-financing</b> <b>rate,</b> to which extent variability of rates is due to structural characteristics (sectors, countries) or to the existence of a residual variance due both to specificity of the project and discretional element of the appraisal method, which may constitute an information noise. We find that the variance of <b>co-financing</b> <b>rate</b> across countries is poorly explained by different composition of sectors of investment. This suggests the need to reinforce a more consistent approach to evaluation and co-financing. We suggest some possible solutions.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{results of}} cost-benefit analysis (CBA) {{in a large}} sample of ISPA (Structural Instrument for Pre-Accession countries) projects co-financed by the European Union to support investment in transport and environment. The research {{focus is on the}} empirical analysis of the variability of financial and economic rates of return and how to integrate this information in the EU co-financing mechanism. We investigate to what extent the variability of expected returns and of EU <b>co-financing</b> <b>rates</b> is due to structural project characteristics (sectors, countries) or to other unexplained factors, including errors in the appraisal. We find that while the absolute level of grants is related to sectors, the EU <b>co-financing</b> <b>rate</b> depends on countries. There is no justification in economic analysis of such a country bias, because the variability of economic rate of returns is unrelated either to sector or country factors. These findings points to the need of a more consistent approach to evaluation and EU co-financing of infrastructure supported by the EU funds. We suggest possible improvements, based on the idea to offer an incentive to projects with high-expected economic␣rates of return relative to a benchmark and showing ex-post the realism of the initial analysis.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{highlight}} aspects {{related to the}} links between international migration, foreign tied aid and the welfare state. We model migration as a costly movement from an aid-recipient developing country with low income, infrastructure, and no welfare system, towards a rich donor, developed country with a well-developed welfare system. Within this model, we find, among other things, that the best response of the developed donor country is to increase aid as the <b>co-financing</b> <b>rate</b> by the recipient country increases. When the immigration cost decreases, e. g., due to greater economic integration between the two countries, it is beneficial for the donor country to increase aid...|$|R

This paper gives {{an overview of the}} various economic consequences incurred by AI epidemics. The funding of these losses is discussed, making a distinction between the compensation currently regulated by the EU or national government and the additional financing possibilities by means of insurance or co-financing systems. A general economic analysis is performed to explore the required level of insurance or <b>co-financing</b> <b>rates</b> for the various EU member states to cover the expected AI losses. The level of rates turned out to vary widely among the individual EU countries...|$|R
40|$|Additionality {{is one of}} the key {{principles}} {{driving the}} functioning of the EU Cohesion Policies (ECP). The present paper studies how additionality affects the distributional effects of the ECP. Using the example of the firm-level investment support, we analyse the role of additionality and <b>co-financing</b> <b>rate</b> in differently competitive markets. We find that the investment additionality and the level of competition importantly affect the distributional effects of the ECP. Imposing additionality to the ECP investments in a perfectly competitive environment causes distortions in the capital market and leads to lower welfare levels. In contrast, without the enforcement of additionality, the distortions are zero and the support fully benefits firms. In an imperfectly competitive environment the firm-level investment support may increase capital use and may be welfare increasing with and without the enforcement of the investment additionality.

Malta introduced the first renewable energy scheme in 2006, which promoted the use of Photovoltaic technology on a small scale. Most of the funding available was directed at improving the energy efficiency of appliances and housing. In 2010, the focus has moved on towards larger support for the preferred choice in renewable energy technology, namely photovoltaics, as Malta struggles to work towards achieving its 2020 renewable energy targets. There has been a relatively strong reliance on solar energy, with a very small attempt to introduce wind turbines, the use of biofuels in industry and no use of geothermal energy. While the expectation was that wind energy would play a major part in the national landscape of renewables, technological and regulatory hurdles faced resulted in this technology not featuring on any substantial scale in the residential sector the industrial sector in Malta. The policy in Malta is reflective of EU policy, and justification for intervention in the provision of renewable energy is strong. The implementation of such policy, however, is still in its infancy. Malta obtains ERDF and Cohesion funds under the Convergence Objective, under which it can obtain a maximum EU <b>co-financing</b> <b>rate</b> of 85 % of the total eligible cost of projects. This is complemented by national co-financing. Regional differences in such support exist between the two larger islands, Malta (Main Island) and Gozo. However, this is not specific to renewable energy projects but pertains to interventions in general, as the country had at one point committed 10 % of EU funding to the island of Gozo. Moreover, Gozo is designated to become an Eco-Island over the next years, with a specific budget line out of national resources devoted specifically to this purpose, which may impact upon rates of support applicable to renewable energy projects in the Island Region. Real estate market differentiation for energy efficient housing is almost non-existent, with very few signs of any references to this in the property marketN/...|$|R
