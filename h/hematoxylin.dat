5|$|Microscopically, poxviruses produce {{characteristic}} cytoplasmic inclusions, {{the most}} important of which are known as Guarnieri bodies, and are the sites of viral replication. Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with <b>hematoxylin</b> and eosin, and appear as pink blobs. They are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies cannot be used to rule out smallpox. The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by electron microscopic examination of pustular fluid or scabs. However, all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy. However, if particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this will eliminate smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{administration}} of spironolactone gives the histologic characteristic of spironolactone {{bodies in the}} adrenal cortex. Spironolactone bodies are eosinophilic, round, concentrically laminated cytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by clear halos in preparations stained with <b>hematoxylin</b> and eosin.|$|E
25|$|Counter stain in Haris <b>Hematoxylin,</b> 6 minutes, or Light Green working Solution, 10 seconds. Light Green {{is better}} used when {{delineation}} of fungi is required. Prepare the working solution by adding Light Green, 0.2% solution 1:5 with distilled water, proceed to step #7, dehydration. Tap water and ammonia decolorize Light Green.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathologist}} {{will examine}} the specimen using light microscopy with multiple staining techniques (<b>hematoxylin</b> and eosin/H, PAS, trichrome, silver stain) on multiple level sections. Multiple immunofluorescence stains {{are performed to evaluate}} for antibody, protein and complement deposition. Finally, ultra-structural examination is performed with electron microscopy and may reveal the presence of electron-dense deposits or other characteristic abnormalities that may suggest an etiology for the patient's renal disease.|$|E
25|$|Identified by {{methenamine}} silver stain of lung tissue, type I pneumocytes, {{and type}} II pneumocytes over-replicate and damage alveolar epithelium, causing death by asphyxiation. Fluid leaks into alveoli, producing an exudate seen as honeycomb/cotton candy appearance on <b>hematoxylin</b> and eosin-stained slides. Drug {{of choice is}} Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, pentamidine, or dapsone. In HIV patients, most cases occur when the CD4 count is below 200 cells per microliter.|$|E
25|$|Goblet {{cells are}} simple {{columnar}} epithelial cells, having {{a height of}} four times that of their width. The cytoplasm of goblet cells tends to be displaced toward the basal end of the cell body by the large mucin granules, which accumulate near the apical surface of the cell along the Golgi apparatus, which lies between the granules and the nucleus. This gives the basal part of the cell a basophilic staining because of nucleic acids within the nucleus and rough endoplasmic reticulum staining with <b>hematoxylin.</b> Mucin within the granules stains pale in routine histology sections, primarily because these carbohydrate-rich proteins are washed out {{in the preparation of}} microscopy samples. However, they stain easily with the PAS staining method, which colours them magenta.|$|E
25|$|Sentinel {{lymph node}} biopsy is often performed, {{especially}} for T1b/T2+ tumors, mucosal tumors, ocular melanoma and tumors of the limbs. A process called lymphoscintigraphy is performed in which a radioactive tracer is injected at the tumor site to localize the sentinel node(s). Further precision is provided using a blue tracer dye, and surgery is performed to biopsy the node(s). Routine <b>hematoxylin</b> and eosin (H) and immunoperoxidase staining will be adequate to rule out node involvement. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on nodes, usually performed to test for entry into clinical trials, now demonstrate that many patients with a negative sentinel lymph node actually had {{a small number of}} positive cells in their nodes. Alternatively, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may be performed and is often used to test masses.|$|E
2500|$|The tissue {{section in}} the image shown here was also counterstained with <b>hematoxylin</b> to stain DNA in nuclei a blue-gray color. [...] Nuclei of cells in the lamina propria, cells which are below and {{surround}} the epithelial crypts, largely show <b>hematoxylin</b> blue-gray color and have little expression of PMS2, ERCC1 or ERCC4 (XPF). [...] In addition, cells at the very tops of the crypts stained for PMS2 (panel A) or ERCC4 (XPF) (panel C) have low levels of these DNA repair proteins, so that such cells show the blue-gray DNA stain as well.|$|E
2500|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} by biopsy of {{an infected}} muscle. Sarcocysts are identifiable with [...] <b>hematoxylin</b> and eosin. The PAS stain {{may be helpful}} but variable uptake of stain is common. Along with the sarcocysts inflammatory cells may be found. Other findings include myositis, myonecrosis, perivascular and interstitial inflammation, vasculitis and eosinophilic myositis.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{staining}} techniques include acid-fast staining, {{which will}} stain the oocysts red. [...] One type of acid-fast stain is the Kinyoun stain. [...] Giemsa staining {{can also be}} performed. [...] Part of the small intestine can be stained with <b>hematoxylin</b> and eosin (H & E), which will show oocysts attached to the epithelial cells.|$|E
2500|$|Gömöri-positive astrocytes. [...] These are {{a subset}} of protoplasmic astrocytes that contain {{numerous}} cytoplasmic inclusions, or granules, that stain positively with Gömöri's chrome-alum <b>hematoxylin</b> stain. [...] It is now known that these granules are formed from the remnants of degenerating mitochondria engulfed within lysosomes, [...] Some type of oxidative stress appears {{to be responsible for}} the mitochondrial damage within these specialized astrocytes. [...] Gömöri-positive astrocytes are much more abundant within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and in the hippocampus than in other brain regions. [...] They may have a role in regulating the response of the hypothalamus to glucose.|$|E
