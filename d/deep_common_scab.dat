40|$|Abstract Potato <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> (Streptomyces scabies (Thaxt.)

For identification {{of the most common}} scab-tolerant material, and for developing molecular markers for <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> tolerance, more information is needed on the genetic basis of <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> tolerance. Phenotyping <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> susceptibility is difficult be-cause of the large variability in disease symptoms among tubers from a single plant, ranging from no <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> to severe pits. Two years of field data were collected for scab reaction on a segregating tetraploid population (MSL 603, 160 individuals).

40|$|Streptomyces scabies is {{a causal}} agent of <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> of potato, which generates {{necrotic}} tuber lesions. We have previously demonstrated that inoculation of potato plants with phenazine- 1 -carboxylic acid (PCA) - producing Pseudomonas sp. LBUM 223 could significantly reduce <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> symptoms. In the present study, we investigated whether LBUM 223 or an isogenic phzC- mutant not producing PCA could elicit an induced systemic resistance response in potato. The expression of eight defense-related genes (salicylic acid [SA]-related ChtA, PR- 1 b, PR- 2, and PR- 5; and jasmonic acid and ethylene-related LOX, PIN 2, PAL- 2, and ERF 3) was quantified using newly developed TaqMan reverse-transcription quantitative {{polymerase chain reaction}} assays in 5 - and 10 -week-old potted potato plants. Although only wild-type LBUM 223 was capable of significantly reducing <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> symptoms, the presence of both LBUM 223 and its PCA-deficient mutant were equally able to upregulate the expression of LOX and PR- 5. The presence of S. scabies overexpressed all SA-related genes. This indicates that (i) upregulation of potato defense-related genes by LBUM 223 is unlikely to contribute to <b>common</b> <b>scab's</b> control and (ii) LBUM 223 's capacity to produce PCA {{is not involved in}} this upregulation. These results suggest that a direct interaction occurring between S. scabies and PCA-producing LBUM 223 is more likely involved in controlling <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> development...|$|R

50|$|The {{first known}} {{reference}} to <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> {{dates back to}} 1825 when it was included in John Claudius Loudon Encyclopaedia of Agriculture.

In 1884, Worthington George Smith suggested that it was caused by grit in soil irritating potato tubers as they grew. The theory gained much support, as it was known to be more common on light gritty soils. In 1890 however, Roland Thaxter isolated a microbe that could cause <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> lesions, naming it Oospora scabies.

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>scab</b> of {{potatoes}} is a disease, which {{is difficult to}} manage due to complex interactions of the pathogenic bacteria (Streptomyces spp.) with soil, microbial community and potato plants. In Bohemian-Moravian Highlands in the Czech Republic two sites (Vyklantice and Zdirec) were selected {{for a study of}} <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> disease suppressivity. At both sites, a field with low disease severity occurs next to one with high severity and the situation was regularly observed over four decades although all four fields undergo a crop rotation. In the four fields, quantities of bacteria, actinobacteria and the gene txtB from the biosynthetic gene cluster of thaxtomin, the main pathogenicity factor of <b>common</b> <b>scab,</b> were analyzed by real-time PCR. Microbial community structure was compared by terminal fragment length polymorphism analysis. Soil and potato periderm were characterized by contents of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Quality of organic matter was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography of soil extracts. The study demonstrated that the suppressive character of the fields is locally specific. At Zdirec, the suppressivity was associated with low txtB gene copies in bulk soil, while at Vyklantice site it was associated with low txtB gene copies in the tuberosphere. The differences were discussed with respect to the effect of abiotic conditions at Zdirec and interaction between potato plant and soil microbial community at Vyklantice. Soil pH, Ca soil content or cation concentrations, although different were not in the range to predict the disease severity.

Major soilborne diseases of concern to the Australian potato industry include <b>common</b> <b>scab,</b> powdery scab, black scurf and the post-harvest disease tuber soft rot. These diseases have negative impacts on the French fry potato processing sector where the cultivar ‘Russet Burbank’ is the most important commercial cultivar used. <b>Common</b> <b>scab</b> is caused by infection of developing tubers with Streptomyces spp. Previous research has developed <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> resistant somaclonal variants of Russet Burbank using a somatic cell-selection breeding technique, with the pathogens toxin (thaxtomin A) used as a positive selective agent. The current study involved determining the breadth and possible mechanism of resistance of these novel variants of Russet Burbank to other important tuber diseases such as powdery scab caused by Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea (a protozoan), black scurf caused by Rhizoctonia solani (a fungus), tuber soft rot caused by Pectobacterium atrosepticum and P. carotovorum (both bacteria species). This study also involved measurement of Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea root infection and developing model systems to track infection and provide an early indication of putative controls which may improve management options for powdery scab.

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>scab</b> on potato, {{caused by}} Streptomyces spp., {{can result in}} severe damage to pota-toes. The {{increased}} prevalence of this disease in Israel, especially in Ma'on region (South-West Israel), is attributable to several factors, among which are: susceptible crops such as peanuts and radish being grown in short rotations, soils that are conducive to the disease, {{and the absence of}} effective eradication methods. Contaminated potato seed tubers are the major means of spreading the pathogen. Seed borne inoculum arrives through certified seed lots imported from Northern-Europe for the spring. In average 26 % of the seed lots were contaminated with intermediate and high levels of <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> between 2004 and 2007. However, so far any of the tested seed treatments was efficient in reducing the disease incidence or severity. The primary inoculum source of Sreptomyces is seed tubers. Once the pathogen is introduced and established into the soil, it survives for a long time, and only a radical soil fumigation (such as formaldehyde) can reduce the pathogen levels. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate SG 101, a stabilized formulation of hy-drogen peroxide agent (3. 5 - 7 % H 2 O 2) as a seed treatment for controlling <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> on potatoes. Seed tubers (cv. Desiree) highly contaminated with <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> were treated with SG 101 or Bactoril (Quat Ammonium) by a low volume spray, and mancozeb by dusting. Two experiments arranged in a randomized complete block design, with four replications were planted in two sites (Gilat -loess soil and Halutza - sandy soil). In Gilat, the incidence of progeny tubers with russet scab was significantly reduced in both SG 101 and mancozeb treatments. In Halutza, the incidence of russet and <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> were significantly lowerin SG 101, compared with the control and Bactoril. mancozeb treatment. The findings in this study indicate the high potential of using SG 101 as a seed treatment for controlling scab in the short-term (in the harvested progeny). Furthermore, because of this SG 101 efficiency, an advantage for the long-term is being achieved, by preventing the spread of the pathogen and infestation of soils. Additional studies on the potential use of SG 101 as a furrow treatment and its effect on other seed-borne pathogens are being currently conducted. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R
