By masking the amidinium moiety as a carbamate-ester and turning the carboxylate into an ester they were able to make a prodrug called <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate,</b> a highly lipophilic, gastrointestinally absorbed and orally bioavailable double prodrug such as ximelagatran, with the plasma half-life of approximately 12 hours. <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> is rapidly absorbed, it lacks interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes and with other food and drugs, {{there is no need for}} routine monitoring and it has a broad therapeutic index and a fixed-dose administration, which is excellent safety compared with warfarin. Unlike ximelagatran, a long-term treatment of <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> has not been linked with hepatic toxicity, seeing as how the drug is predominantly eliminated (>80%) by the kidneys. <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> was approved in Canada and Europe in 2008 for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing hip- and knee surgery.

40|$|ObjectiveWarfarin reduces risk {{of stroke}} in {{patients}} with mechanical heart valves but increases risk of hemorrhage and is difficult to use. <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate,</b> a new oral direct thrombin inhibitor, is safe and effective in reducing risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation. No data exist {{in the setting of}} mechanical heart valves. We tested the hypothesis that <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> is as effective as heparin for thromboprophylaxis of mechanical valves in a porcine heterotopic aortic valve model. MethodsThirty swine underwent implantation of modified bileaflet mechanical valved conduit bypassing the ligated, native descending thoracic aorta. Animals randomly received no anticoagulation (n =  10), enoxaparin 2  mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily (n =  10), or <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> 20 mg/kg orally twice daily. Primary end point was amount of valve thrombus at 30 days. Secondary end points included quantitative measurement of platelet deposition on valve prosthesis, thromboelastography, and hemorrhagic and embolic events. ResultsAt 30 days, we observed 638 ± 895 mg thrombus in no anticoagulation group, 121 ± 128 mg in enoxaparin group, and 19 ± 31 mg in <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> group (P =. 01 enoxaparin vs <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate).</b> Fewer platelets were deposited on valves in <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> group (2. 7  ×  108) than in enoxaparin group (1. 8  ×  109, P = . 03). No major or occult hemorrhagic or embolic events were observed. By thromboelastographic analysis, <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> produced less prolongation of K value (P = . 01) and less decreases in angle (P = . 01) and maximum amplitude (P = . 001) than enoxaparin. ConclusionsDabigatran etexilate is as effective as enoxaparin for short-term thromboprophylaxis of mechanical valves.

Among the advantages of <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> over subcutaneous prophylaxis with Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) are reduced resource uses for (i) teaching patients to self-inject; (ii) home-care visits for subcutaneous administration; and (iii) absence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Based on the demonstrated non-inferiority, {{the aim of this}} study was to conduct a cost-minimization analysis of oral <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> vs subcutaneous low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and fondaparinux from the Dutch healthcare perspective. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to measure resource use associated with subcutaneous prophylaxis. Results of this study were used in the model to elucidate specific advantages of <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate,</b> next to reduced needs for self-inject teaching and lack of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia. Drug and other resource utilization data were combined with local unit costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to account for uncertainty around relevant parameters included. RESULTS: Home-care visits for subcutaneous administration problems were needed in 9. 9 % (95 % CI= 6. 4 - 13. 4) and 9. 6 % (95 % CI= 5. 8 - 13. 4) of THR and TKR patients, respectively. Based on costs for 1000 patients treated with <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> vs LMWHs, per patient cost-savings with <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> were estimated at euro 30. 68 (95 % CI= 2. 01 - 65. 52) and euro 23. 19 (95 % CI= 0. 69 - 48. 48) for THR and TKR, respectively. The probability that <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> would be cost-saving was estimated at 98. 3 % and 97. 9 % for THR and TKR, respectively. These cost-savings were even higher when including fondaparinux in the analysis, with per patient cost-savings of euro 69. 87 (43. 42 - 106. 10) and euro 18. 33 (1. 63 - 41. 26) for THR and TKR, respectively. Separate calculations for <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> vs nadroparin and dalteparin in THR resulted in probabilities of achieving cost-savings with <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> of 36. 2 % and 100 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: The risk of venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) {{in patients}} undergoing total knee or hip replacement surgery is high. As a result, thromboprophylaxis is highly recommended. While current thromboprophylactic agents, such as {{low molecular weight}} heparins (LMWH) and vitamin K antagonists, are safe and effective their use can be problematic. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for alternative anticoagulants that are as safe and effective as conventional agents, but are more convenient and easier to use. <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate,</b> a direct thrombin inhibitor, is one such anticoagulant. For VTE prevention following major orthopaedic surgery, <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> shows similar efficacy and safety to the LMWH enoxaparin, and is approved for use in more than 75 countries, including Europe and Canada. Here, we summarize and discuss the experiences of four German clinics that have recently introduced <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> into clinical practice. Overall, <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> was well received by patients, surgeons and nurses, and compared favourably with enoxaparin.

40|$|Background: Deep vein {{thrombosis}} leading to pulmonary embolism {{is one of}} the major complication after fracture. After a fracture occurs, the coagulation cascade activates thrombin, a protease that finally generates clotting. <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> reduce clot formation by inhibiting thrombin. <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> is a widely used drug for thromboprophylaxis. There is no study of the effects of <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> on fracture healing in the literature, so we aimed to evaluate the effects of <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> on fracture healing. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six female Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups, each consisting of 6 rats. In all rats, right tibias were used for the fracture model. An oral regimen of <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> suspension in 0. 5 % hydroxyethylcellulose was administered to the rats. Although the first and second groups received 10 mg/kg daily doses, the third and fourth groups received 50 mg/kg daily doses. The fifth and sixth groups were assigned as sham groups and only hydroxyethylcellulose solution was administered. The first, third and fifth groups were sacrificed on 14 th days; whereas the second, fourth and sixth groups were sacrificed on 28 th days. Results were evaluated radiologically and histologically. Results: Radiologically and histologically no statistically significant differences were observed on the 14 th day between the first, third and fifth groups; and on the 28 th days between the second, fourth and sixth groups. Conclusion: Radiological and histological evaluations revealed that fracture healing was not affected by <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate.</b> We think that <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> can be used for the prophylaxis of thromboembolism in patients with fractures, but further clinical studies are mandatory...|$|E

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that major orthopaedic surgery has the highest risk of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) when compared with other surgery. Two new orally active anticoagulants have recently become licensed in Ireland for the primary prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult patients undergoing elective total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR). Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is a direct factor Xa inhibitor and <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> (Pradaxa) is a prodrug of the active compound dabigatran, which inhibits thrombin. Objective: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban and <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> compared with enoxaparin sodium for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing elective THR and TKR in the Irish healthcare setting. Methods: The evaluation was conducted from the Irish health-payer perspective. A static decision-tree model was developed with a 180 -day post-surgery time horizon. Separate models for the disease states THR and TKR were run to accommodate the different venous thromboembolism risks associated with each procedure. Outcome measures were QALYs and life-years gained (LYG). Costs were valued in &U 20 AC;, year 2008 values. One-way sensitivity analysis of all probabilities in the model was performed. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis using second-order Monte Carlo simulation was performed to determine the probability of cost effectiveness at a &U 20 AC; 45 [*] 000 per QALY threshold. Results: In the THR base-case model, rivaroxaban dominated both <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> and enoxaparin sodium. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> relative to enoxaparin were &U 20 AC; 23 [*] 934 per LYG and &U 20 AC; 17 [*] 835 per QALY. In the TKR base-case model, rivaroxaban dominated both <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> and enoxaparin sodium. <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> also dominated enoxaparin sodium. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, the THR model was robust to all but four probability variations; the TKR model was robust to all variations. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of &U 20 AC; 45 [*] 000 per QALY, the probability that rivaroxaban was the most cost-effective strategy after THR was 39 %, followed by <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> at 32 % and enoxaparin sodium at 29 %. The probability that rivaroxaban was the most cost-effective strategy after TKR was 46 %, followed by <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> at 30 % and enoxaparin sodium at 24 %. Conclusion: Base-case analysis indicates that when both rivaroxaban and <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> are compared with enoxaparin sodium, rivaroxaban is the less costly and more effective option after THR and TKR. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates that rivaroxaban is the most cost-effective strategy at a cost-effectiveness threshold of &U 20 AC; 45 [*] 000 per QALY; however, there is uncertainty regarding this strategy being more cost effective than <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> when both are compared with enoxaparin sodium. ...|$|E

METHODS: In this double-blind study, we randomised 3494 patients undergoing total {{hip replacement}} to treatment for 28 - 35 days with <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> 220 mg (n= 1157) or 150 mg (1174) once daily, starting with a half-dose 1 - 4 h after surgery, or subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily (1162), starting the evening before surgery. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of total venous thromboembolism (venographic or symptomatic) and death from all causes during treatment. On the basis of the absolute difference in rates of venous thromboembolism with enoxaparin versus placebo, the non-inferiority margin for the difference in rates of thromboembolism was defined as 7. 7 %. Efficacy analyses were done by modified intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00168818. FINDINGS: Median treatment duration was 33 days. 880 patients in the <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> 220 mg group, 874 in the <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> 150 mg group, and 897 in the enoxaparin group were available for the primary efficacy outcome analysis; the main reasons for exclusion in all three groups were the lack of adequate venographic data. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 60 (6. 7 %) of 897 individuals in the enoxaparin group versus 53 (6. 0 %) of 880 patients in the <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> 220 mg group (absolute difference - 0. 7 %, 95 % CI - 2. 9 to 1. 6 %) and 75 (8. 6 %) of 874 people in the 150 mg group (1. 9 %, - 0. 6 to 4. 4 %). Both doses were thus non-inferior to enoxaparin. There was no significant difference in major bleeding rates with either dose of <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> compared with enoxaparin (p= 0. 44 for 220 mg, p= 0. 60 for 150 mg). The frequency of increases in liver enzyme concentrations and of acute coronary events during the study did not differ significantly between the groups.

40|$|Thrombo-embolic {{disease is}} a major {{challenging}} clinical problem associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Anticoagulation with the existing heparin products and vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulants are still the mainstay of management. However, due {{to the risk of}} bleeding and well-documented drawbacks, the quest for a novel oral anticoagulant has led to the clinical development of <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate.</b> <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> is a direct thrombin (IIa) inhibitor which has recently been approved in India for prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in patients who have undergone major orthopaedic (total knee or hip replacement) surgery and for prevention of stroke, systemic embolism and reduction of vascular mortality in adult patients with atrial fibrillation. Thus <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> is a promising alternative to the current heparin products and VKAs in patients who require long-term oral anticoagulation.

40|$|Diffuse venous malformations can be {{associated}} with a consumptive coagulopathy characterized by a reduction of fibrinogen level, platelet count and elevated D-dimer level. We report a case of a patient with extensive venous malformations, hemorrhagic symptoms and biological signs of intravascular coagulopathy. She was initially treated effectively with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (enoxaparin 1  mg/kg, bid) and switched to low-dose <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> (110  mg bid) for more than 2 years. Both treatments showed a similar clinical efficacy with the absence of bleeding or thrombotic complications. Compared with LMWH, <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> provided a similar correction of the fibrinogen level and platelet count but was less effective to reduce the D-dimer level. Although <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> can be safely used to control the consumptive coagulopathy secondary to venous malformation and provides a practical alternative to LMWH, its efficacy in vivo at a low dose to reduce the D-dimer level was lower than that of LMWH...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> {{is one of}} the new oral {{anticoagulants}} {{approved to}} reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). A variety of bleeding complications with dabigatran have been reported, but reports of hemopericardium are rare. We described a case of a 66 year-old female patient with non-valvular AF receiving <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> 150 mg twice daily for one year who suffered from hemopericardium. Her laboratory tests performed 1 year prior were normal and her admission tests revealed acute renal failure and elevated international normalized ratio (INR) level (4. 79). Urgent pericardiocentesis was followed by improved renal functions and normalized INR. <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> is a new oral anticoagulant that is increasingly used in daily practice. However, life-threatening complications warrant caution. Elevated INR may be related with overdose but the association of bleeding risk of dabigatran and INR requires further confirmation.

40|$|Background: <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> is an oral direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor undergoing evaluation for {{the prevention}} of venous thromboembolism (VTE) following orthopedic surgery. Methods: In a multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind study, 1973 patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement were randomized to 6 - 10 days of oral <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> (50, 150 mg twice daily, 300 mg once daily, 225 mg twice daily), starting 1 - 4 h after surgery, or subcutaneous enoxaparin (40 mg once daily) starting 12 h prior to surgery. The primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of VTE (detected by bilateral venography or symptomatic events) during treatment. Results: Of the 1949 treated patients, 1464 (75 %) patients were evaluable for the efficacy analysis. VTE occurred in 28. 5 %, 17. 4 %, 16. 6 %, 13. 1 % and 24 % of patients assigned to <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> 50, 150 mg twice daily, 300 mg once daily, 225 mg twice daily and enoxaparin, respectively. A significant dose-dependent decrease in VTE occurred with increasing doses of <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> (P < 0. 0001). Compared with enoxaparin, VTE was significantly lower in patients receiving 150 mg twice daily [odds ratio (OR) 0. 65, P = 0. 04], 300 mg once daily (OR 0. 61, P = 0. 02) and 225 mg twice daily (OR 0. 47, P = 0. 0007). Compared with enoxaparin, major bleeding was significantly lower with 50 mg twice daily (0. 3 % vs. 2. 0 %, P = 0. 047) but elevated with higher doses, nearly reaching statistical significance with the 300 mg once-daily dose (4. 7 %, P = 0. 051). Conclusions: Oral administration of <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate,</b> commenced early in the postoperative period, was effective and safe across a range of doses.

40|$|Background: <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> {{is one of}} the few direct {{thrombin}} inhibitors with anti-coagulant {{activities and}} the following distinctive features: taken orally, no need to closely monitor for complications, and no need for regular dose adjustments. Relying on the above mentioned valuable advantages, <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> can be considered as a premier choice for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement arthroplasty. Methods: Forty five patients undergoing 50 knee replacement surgeries were included in this case-series study undertaken in Hazrat Rasool Akram and Khatam-alanbia Hospitals during 2010. <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> was administered for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee arthroplasty in doses of 110 mg in the first 1 - 4 h after surgery followed by daily doses of 220 mg for 10 days. Patients were examined 3 times and a color Doppler sonography was performed on the 11 th day to check for venous thrombosis. Finally, the patients were re-examined at the end of the 1 st and the 3 rd months postoperatively. Results: Only one out of 45 patients was diagnosed to have venous thrombosis on sonography done on the 11 th day but the patient did not have any symptoms and repeat sonographies at the end of the 1 st and the 3 rd months postoperatively showed no venous thrombosis either. No complications were witnessed in the patients in the 3 -month follow-up period. Conclusion: <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> (220 mg/d for 10 days) can be an effective drug against venous thrombosis after total knee replacement surgeries...|$|E

40|$|Background.  Infective {{endocarditis}} (IE) mostly occurs after spontaneous low-grade bacteremia. Thus, IE {{cannot be}} prevented by circumstantial antibiotic prophylaxis. Platelet activation following bacterial-fibrinogen interaction or thrombin-mediated fibrinogen-fibrin polymerization {{is a critical}} step in vegetation formation. We tested the efficacy of antiplatelet and antithrombin to prevent experimental IE. Methods.  A rat model of experimental IE following prolonged low-grade bacteremia mimicking smoldering bacteremia in humans was used. Prophylaxis with antiplatelets (aspirin, ticlopidine [alone or in combination], eptifibatide, or abciximab) or anticoagulants (antithrombin <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> or anti-vitamin K acenocoumarol) was started 2 days before inoculation with Streptococcus gordonii or Staphylococcus aureus. Valve infection was assessed 24 hours later. Results.  Aspirin plus ticlopidine, as well as abciximab, protected 45 %- 88 % of animals against S. gordonii and S. aureus IE (P <. 05). <b>Dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> protected 75 % of rats against IE due to S. aureus (P <. 005) but failed to protect against S. gordonii (< 30 % protection). Acenocoumarol was ineffective. Conclusions.  Antiplatelet and direct antithrombin agents {{may be useful in}} the prophylaxis of IE in humans. In particular, the potential dual benefit of <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> might be reconsidered for patients with prosthetic valves, who require life-long anticoagulation and in whom S. aureus IE is associated with high mortalit...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There {{has been}} a shift towards greater use of neuraxial over general {{anaesthesia}} for patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty. Furthermore, suggestions that peripheral nerve block may reduce adverse effects have recently been put forward. Although older studies showed a reduction in venous thromboembolism (VTE) with neuraxial compared with general anaesthesia, this difference has not been confirmed in studies using effective current thromboprophylaxis. We used a large data set to investigate the pattern of anaesthesia usage, and whether anaesthesia type affects efficacy and bleeding outcomes of thromboprophylaxis overall, within each treatment group, or for the novel oral anticoagulant <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> versus enoxaparin. Methods Three previously reported trials compared 220 [*]mg and 150 [*]mg <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> once daily with enoxaparin after knee or hip arthroplasty. A pooled analysis was performed in patients receiving general or neuraxial anaesthesia, or the combination of either with peripheral nerve block (n[*]=[*] 8062). Outcome measures were major VTE plus VTE-related mortality, major bleeding and major plus clinically relevant bleeding events. Results General, neuraxial and combination anaesthesia were used in 29 %, 52 % and 19 % of patients, respectively. Differences in efficacy and safety between anaesthesia subgroups were small and not significant, except for a slightly higher rate of major VTE and VTE-related mortality with general versus neuraxial anaesthesia (odds ratio: 1. 40; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 03 – 1. 90; p[*]=[*] 0. 035) in the overall population. There were no significant effects of anaesthesia type on efficacy or safety of <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> versus enoxaparin. Conclusions Anaesthesia type did not greatly affect efficacy and safety outcomes in the pooled population of all three treatment groups. The efficacy and safety of <b>dabigatran</b> <b>etexilate</b> was comparable with enoxaparin, regardless of type of anaesthesia.
