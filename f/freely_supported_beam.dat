In this case, the girder crane beam, when the load is moving with uniform velocity.

40|$|Cross-laminated timber is an {{environmentally}} friendly material, which possesses a decreased level of anisotropy {{in comparison with}} the solid and glued timber. Cross-laminated timber could be used for load-bearing walls and slabs of multi-storey timber buildings as well as decking structures of pedestrian and road bridges. Design methods of cross-laminated timber elements subjected to bending and compression with bending were considered. The presented methods were experimentally validated and verified by FEM. Two cross-laminated timber slabs were tested at the action of static load. Pine wood was chosen as a board's material. <b>Freely</b> <b>supported</b> <b>beam</b> with the span equal to 1. 9 m, which was loaded by the uniformly distributed load, was a design scheme of the considered plates. The width of the plates was equal to 1 m. The considered cross-laminated timber plates were analysed by FEM method. The comparison of stresses acting in the edge fibres of the plate and the maximum vertical displacements shows that both considered methods can be used for engineering calculations. The difference between the results obtained experimentally and analytically is within the limits from 2 to 31 %. The difference in results obtained by effective strength and stiffness and transformed sections methods was not significant...|$|E

30|$|Simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam</b> bridges {{are widely}} used in the {{construction}} of passenger dedicated lines in China because of their characteristics of simple structure, clear path for force transfer, low cost, easy manufacturing and installing techniques [1, 2]. After long-term research in design and application, the system of simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam</b> bridges (20, 24 and 32  m in span) for Chinese passenger dedicated line was formed [3, 4]. According to statistical data, the total kilometrage of simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam</b> bridges is {{more than half of the}} total length of high-speed railways in China, and the most widely used is the 32  m simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam.</b> Thus, ensuring the service performance of continuous welded rail (CWR) on the simply <b>supported</b> <b>beam</b> bridge is essential for safe operation of railways.|$|R

The suspended membrane design uses thin <b>beams</b> to <b>support,</b> {{as well as}} electrically connect, the resonator and has been fabricated using both thin film processing and bulk silicon micromachining. The quality factor and the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient were characterized {{as a function of}} the number and the length of the <b>support</b> <b>beams.</b> The length of the <b>support</b> <b>beams</b> was found to affect neither the quality factor at resonance nor the effective electromechanical coupling factor. However, longer <b>support</b> <b>beams</b> did facilitate better frequency pair response.

40|$|Abstract—The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics of}} micromechanical oscil-lators are explored experimentally. Devices consist of singly and doubly <b>supported</b> Si <b>beams,</b> 200 nm thick and 35 μm long. When illuminated within a laser interference field, devices self-oscillate {{in their first}} bending mode due to feedback between laser heating and device displacement. Compressive prestress buckles doubly <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> leading to a strong amplitude–frequency relationship. Significant frequency instability is seen in doubly <b>supported</b> devices. Self-resonant <b>beams</b> are also driven inertially with varying drive amplitude and frequency. Regions of primary, sub-, and superharmonic entrainment are measured. Statistics of primary entrainment are measured for low drive amplitudes, where the effects of frequency instability are measurable. Sub-and superharmonic entrainment are not seen in singly <b>supported</b> <b>beams.</b> A simple model is built to explain why high-order entrainment is seen only in doubly <b>supported</b> <b>beams.</b> Its analysis suggests that the strong amplitude–frequency relationship in doubly <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> enables hysteresis, wide regions of primary entrainment, and high orders of sub- and superharmonic entrainment.
