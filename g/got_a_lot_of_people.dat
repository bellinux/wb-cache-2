But you can begin with the hotel, and meanwhile you can live at my house. In that way--simply sleeping at the hotel--you will find it tolerable. For the rest, you must make yourself at home at my place. You mustn't be shy, you know; if you are only here for a month that will be a great waste of time. Mrs. Westgate won't neglect you, and you had better not try to resist her. I know something about that. I expect you'll find some pretty girls on the premises. I shall write to my wife by this afternoon's mail, and tomorrow morning she and Miss Alden will look out for you. Just walk right in and make yourself comfortable. Your steamer leaves from this part of the city, and I will immediately send out and get you a cabin. Then, at half past four o'clock, just call for me here, and I will go with you and put you on board. It's a big boat; you might get lost. A few days hence, {{at the end of the}} week, I will come down to Newport and see how you are getting on." ...|$|E

5000|$|In April 2007, Channel 4 TV's Dispatches {{documentary}} series broadcast film secretly recorded at North Sea Camp by a prisoner, Dafydd Evans. Evans's filming showed prisoners taking drugs and smuggling alcohol. He also demonstrated apparent {{weaknesses in the}} prison's security procedures and described the escape {{of a man with}} convictions for robbery and arson which he blamed on security failures and collusion by fellow prisoners. Lord Ramsbotham, a former Chief Inspector of Prisons for England and Wales, was quoted in the programme as saying: [...] "It is not secure; it’s under-staffed, it’s under-resourced and you’ve <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who quite frankly should not be in those conditions.

[...] Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the cancellation was a good decision amidst possible eurozone impatience with Greece. [...] "It was a bizarre proposal. We think it’s of great importance to the eurozone that we prevent Greece from going bankrupt. But in the end, the euro {{is more important than}} Greece’s membership of the eurozone." [...] Conversely former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said that: [...] "It’s no surprise Papandreou hardly had a chance to push through what was being demanded from him. The conservatives across Europe did very little to convince the Greek conservative opposition to stop acting irresponsibly." ...|$|E

5000|$|Later, in SOHH.com's Pre VMA Interview, Ludacris {{was asked}} if the song was self-referential. Ludacris replied, [...] "Man, {{somebody}} misquoted me talking about...they misquoted me saying it was about me. What I was telling them was that I devote {{a lot of information}} about myself, and I think they're taking that in. I'm not battling myself on the record, that's ridiculous. What happens is you <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> taking subliminal shots, but nobody ever says my name. I'm not for sure, so that record is like my way of taking subliminal shots right back. Don't get it misquoted, don't get it messed up. That's basically what it is man. It's like, you know, like I said I do devote a lot of information about myself on there. I started to wreck it up by saying I'm the best, and there's nothing you could do about it. say I've never done this I've never done that, so you know when you look into it, it's a lot more records where it comes from on the album, September 26, Release Therapy, where it's the most personal album I've done. It's nothing but honesty so you can criticize it all you want to {{but at the end of}} the day you got to respect it cause I'm coming straight from the heart. I'm just telling the truth, and that's all you gotta know." ...|$|E
5000|$|When I came up {{with this}} story last summer, I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> raising their eyebrows about it in terms of J.T. He's not going to give her two looks. But I saw {{something}} special in these guys, and that was the story. This very unexpected interest. Of course, initially, it was a girl who was gaga over him. And he, being J.T., enjoyed the attention. What he didn't expect was to find himself drawn to her. —Former co-head writer John F. Smith on why he wanted to pair J.T. and Colleen The original storyline designed for J.T. and Colleen centered around an unrequited crush she feels for him. Luckinbill and Fonseca, the first actress to portray Colleen, thought their character's relationship would progress no further than friendship. Fonseca said that if they became a couple, the fun brought on by the [...] "tug-and-pull" [...] element between them could disappear. Luckinbill considered the age difference too great an obstacle to overcome, as at the time, J.T. was 18 years old and Colleen was 15. Smith later pushed for the plot to be taken further and the characters were paired romantically. Both soap opera critics and members of the show's cast and crew considered this a controversial and surprising move. Fonseca stated she [...] "wasn't expecting it at all", and admitted that even former executive producer David Shaughnessy found the pairing [...] "shocking".|$|E
