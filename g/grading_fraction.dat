Concern about nutrient pollution {{and the need to}} use water and nutrients more efficiently may lead in the future to regulations about capturing and re-cycling drainage water.

These experiments were started to study the performance of nursery stock plants in closed systems and to compare ebb and flood and capillary irrigation with overhead spraylines.

40|$|Vygotsky posed {{a variety}} of {{meaningful}} ideas for education in his short life. This paper focuses on everyday concepts and mathematical concepts or scientific concepts from his theory, reorganizing these ideas {{according to a new}} idea of sublated concepts. Using a series of interviews from a third <b>grade</b> <b>fraction</b> class in Japan, the paper discusses how everyday and mathematical concepts arise out of discussions among children and a teacher, and how they develop into sublated concepts. DEVELOPMENT OF CONCEPTS ACCORDING TO VYGOTSKY “Everyday concepts ” and “mathematical concepts” Vygotsky (1934 / 1987) thought that concepts consist of two types, i. e. everyday concepts and scientific concepts, and pointed out that the greatest difference between these two is whether they are based on a system. According to Vygotsky (1933 / 1975; 1934 / 1987), everyday concepts are not based on a system; rather they are based in rich daily contexts and, therefore, might be used incorrectly by children. For instance, in series of one-on-one interviews with second graders in Japan, when asked the meaning of a word half, a child described that half meant to share somethin...|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{settling}} slurries often {{consist of}} particles of very different sizes; the {{particle size distribution}} may cover sizes which differ with two orders of magnitude. A broad particle size distribution affects parameters of slurry flow including deposition limit velocity. We present experimental results of the deposition limit velocity collected during a comprehensive experimental campaign testing slurry flows composed of solids of different fractions in the GIW Hydraulic Laboratory in 2016. Four narrow <b>graded</b> <b>fractions</b> (carrier fluid, pseudo-homogeneous, heterogeneous, and stratified) were tested in permutations from the individual components to the complete mixture at various concentrations. The primary experiments were carried out in a 203 -mm pipe, and selected corresponding experiments were repeated in a 103 -mm pipe. The experimental results show that interactions among components affect the resulting deposition limit velocity in flows of broadly graded settling slurries. The effect of particle size distribution on the deposition limit velocity is not benign. The deposit velocity is not necessarily lower in a flow of slurry composed of four components than in slurry flow of one component with the highest deposit velocity from the four components.

In this study, the usability of cyclones in the beneficiation of tailings of a coal preparation plant was investigated. For this purpose, separation tests were conducted using spiral concentrator and heavy medium cyclones with the specific weight of medium 1.3 – 1.8 (g/cm 3) on different <b>grading</b> <b>fractions</b> of tailing in an industrial scale (the weight of tail sample was five tons). Spiral concentrator was utilized to beneficiate particles smaller than 1  mm. In order to evaluate the efficiency of cyclones, sink and float experiments using a specific weight of 1.3, 1.5, 1.7 and 1.9  g/cm 3, were conducted on a pilot scale. Based on the obtained results, the recovery of floated materials in cyclones with the specific weight of 1.40, 1.47 and 1.55  g/cm 3 are 17.75 %, 33.80 %, and 50 %, respectively. Also, the cut point (ρ 50), which is the relative density at which particles report equally to the both products are 1.40, 1.67 and 1.86  g/cm 3. The probable errors of separation for defined specific weights for cyclones are 0.080, 0.085 and 0.030, respectively. Also, the coefficients of variation was calculated to be 0.20, 0.12 and 0.03. Finally, it could be said that the performance of a cyclone with a heavy medium of 1.40  g/cm 3 specific weight is desirable compared with other specific weights.|$|R

Most of the sources of variability may be simply overcome with the direct measurement of the depth of the anterior chamber through utilisation of equipment such as the Pentacam or imaging digital image analysis, rather than by merely <b>grading</b> the <b>fraction</b> between the anterior chamber depth and the corneal thickness.|$|R

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} proportion of sand {{as well as its}} gradation on the undrained strength behavior of soils, undrained tests on statically compacted specimens of clay–sand mixtures were carried, with two extreme clay minerals, namely commercially available kaolinite and bentonite mixed with specimens of three <b>grades</b> of sand <b>fractions,</b> and also varying their proportion from 10 to 80 %. This work was extended to two natural soils, viz., Red earth (kaolinitic type) and B.C. soil (montmorillitic type) by using fractionized fine portion from these soils obtained by sedimentation process, and later mixed with different proportions and <b>grades</b> of sand <b>fractions.</b> Results from this experimental investigation reveals that, at optimum sand content in clay–sand mixtures, use of medium sand fractions is more beneficial to improve the undrained strength of the mixtures irrespective of the clay mineral type being present in the mixture. It thus implies that proper selection of grade of sand is also important along with the optimum content to obtain higher strength of a clay–sand mixture. This has practical implications in understanding the performance of embankments or any ground improvement applications involving strength of clayey natural soils for better load carrying capacity, stability, and good performance of the structure supported by soil. It is also very useful in the geo-environmental applications like proper selection of proper grade of clay–sand mixtures as liners for better performance.|$|R
40|$|The Sanga Sanga PSC in the Kutai Basin of East Kalimantan is host {{to several}} {{gas and oil}} fields with {{hydrocarbons}} principally reservoired in Miocene fluvio-deltaic channel sandstones. Limestones form only a subordinate lithology {{in this area and}} carbonate development is restricted both temporally and spatially. The thickest and most extensive limestones are in the uppermost G interval of the Badak Field where several discrete horizons of limestones are interbedded with shales, sandstones and coals. Limestones exhibit an overall thickening upwards trend although individual limestones often display strong lateral variations in thickness and are notably absent from some wells. These limestones do not form reservoirs whereas laterally adjacent sandstones display similar production characteristics to carbonate-free intervals immediately above and below. An extensive blanket of thick shale in the basal F interval overlies this limestone bearing succession. Previous models explain the lateral contrast in limestone thickness as the product of variable erosion and incision during sea level low stands. An alternative origin is proposed whereby limestones have developed marginal to coeval siliciclastic channel-mouthbar systems. Evidence includes the location of these carbonates within an overall transgressive regime with limestone deposition terminated by deepening or increased admixed fine siliciclastic input rather than exposure. Individual limestones typically pass upwards and laterally into shale mouthbar deposits rather than erosively-based sandstones and {{there is no evidence of}} carbonate lags that might reflect local erosion. It is suggested that the lateral variation in limestone thickness reflects their original patchy development. Coeval siliciclastic deposition, although concentrated at mouthbars and channel levees, was also dispersed throughout the carbonate patch reef deposits. The predominantly clay <b>grade</b> <b>fraction</b> within the carbonates strongly influenced the biota present and the development of the patch reefs. This re-interpretation suggests that the poor reservoir quality of the carbonates reflects their overall transgressive nature and the high percentage of admixed fine grained siliciclastics. Alternative models fail to explain the paucity of secondary porosity that might otherwise develop during exposure in a tropical humid climate. Coeval shales may have provided argillaceous baffles that restricted the exchange of carbonate-bearing pore fluids into the coeval sandstones that have consequently retained reservoir quality...|$|R

An example of non-truthful grading, that we observed in classrooms, consists in students assigning the maximum grade to all submissions. With a naive grading scheme, such as averaging the assigned grades, all students would receive the maximum grade. In this paper, we develop three grading schemes that provide incentives for truthful peer grading. In the first scheme, the instructor <b>grades</b> a <b>fraction</b> p of the submissions, and penalizes students whose grade deviates from the instructor grade. We provide lower bounds on p to ensure truthfulness, and conclude that these schemes work only for moderate class sizes, up {{to a few}} hundred students. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hierarchical extension of this supervised scheme, and we show that it can handle classes of any size with bounded (and little) instructor work, and is therefore applicable to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Finally, we propose unsupervised incentive schemes, in which the student incentive is based on statistical properties of the grade distribution, without any grading required by the instructor. We show that the proposed unsupervised schemes provide incentives to truthful grading, {{at the price of}} being possibly unfair to individual students. Comment: 26 page...|$|R

However, many fraction concepts are generalizations of analogous whole number concepts; for example, fraction division and whole number division share a similar conceptual structure. Drawing on past studies of analogical transfer, we hypothesize that children’s whole number division knowledge will support their understanding of fraction division when their relevant prior knowledge is activated immediately before engaging with fraction division. Children in 5 th and 6 th <b>grade</b> modeled <b>fraction</b> division with physical objects after modeling a series of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems with whole number operands and fraction operands.

In another condition, problems were blocked by number type, such that children modeled all four arithmetic operations with whole numbers in the first block, and then operations with fractions in the second block. Children who solved whole number division problems immediately before fraction division problems were significantly better at modeling the conceptual structure of fraction division than those who solved all of the fraction problems together. Thus, implicit analogies across shared concepts can affect children’s mathematical thinking. Moreover, specific analogies between whole number and fraction concepts can yield a positive, rather than a negative, whole number bias...|$|R

It has been proposed that the HER 2 gene amplification reported in these tumors might mask an underlying TOP 2 A gene amplification that occurs frequently and concurrently with HER 2 amplification. Topoisomerase II alpha, encoded by TOP 2 A, is a direct molecular target of anthracycline drug action and is potentially useful as a predictive marker of response to anthracycline therapy for breast cancer. In this study, we examined whether TOP 2 A gene amplification is an appropriate marker for identifying breast tumors expressing high levels of topoisomerase II alpha.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of manual and virtual manipulatives, {{in order to gain}} a better {{understanding}} of the impact of their use by 5 th <b>grade</b> students learning <b>fraction</b> concepts. Manipulatives are often used during classroom experiences to reinforce abstract concepts and provide deeper understanding. For this study, students were exposed to both manual and virtual manipulatives in order to develop an understanding of how each supported student understanding and attitudes. The evident success of using manipulatives in improving student's understanding of fractions was apparent based on improved scores on a posttest. Most students benefitted from {{the use of}} both types ofmanipulatives, whether they were manual or virtual. Therefore, both virtual and manual manipulatives were found to support student learning of concepts related to addition of fractions. Based on a survey and teacher observations, students were found to have positive attitudes towards the use of both manipulatives as well. Particular attention was paid to the use of virtual manipulatives in the study due to the newness of this resource. Virtual manipulatives were found to support the learning of fractions by aiding in the visual representation and because the technology enabled students to concentrate on the conceptual knowledge and not computation. Virtual manipulatives also gave second language learners a way to express their thinking and understanding of patterns.

40|$|Objective: Permeability {{parameters}} from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) {{and apparent}} diffusion coefficient (ADC) value on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can be quantitative physiologic metrics for gliomas. The transfer constant (Ktrans) has shown efficacy in <b>grading</b> gliomas. Volume <b>fraction</b> of extravascular extracellular space (ve) has been underutilized to grade gliomas. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate ve in its ability to grade gliomas and to assess the correlation with other permeability parameters and ADC values. Materials and Methods: A total of 33 patients diagnosed with pathologically-confirmed gliomas were examined by 3 T MRI including DCE-MRI and ADC map. A region of interest analyses for permeability parameters from DCE-MRI and ADC were performed on the enhancing solid portion of the tumors. Permeability parameters form DCE-MRI and ADC between low- and high-grade gliomas; the diagnostic performances of presumptive metrics and correlation among those metrics were statistically analyzed. Results: High-grade gliomas showed higher Ktrans (0. 050 vs. 0. 010 in median value, p = 0. 002) and higher ve (0. 170 vs. 0. 015 in median value, p = 0. 001) than low-grade gliomas. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed significance in both Ktrans and ve for glioma grading. However, there was no significant difference in diagnostic performance between Ktrans and ve. ADC value did not correlate with any of the permeability parameters from DCE-MRI. Conclusion: Extravascular extracellular space (ve) appears to be comparable with transfer constant (...|$|R
40|$|Increasing the {{operating}} temperature of infrared detectors {{is a prime}} importance for practical applications. The use of split-off band transitions has been proposed for high operating temperature infrared detectors. Initial results showed increasing the potential barrier for free carrier emission has led to increases in operating temperature from 150 K for a detector with an 8 3 ̆bcm threshold to room temperature for detector with a 4 3 ̆bcm threshold. However, these detectors showed a low responsivity due to the capture of carriers in each emitter. A proposal was made to use graded barriers with an offset between the barriers on {{the two sides of}} an emitter as a method of reducing the capture in the emitters. Two GaAs/AlGaAs samples with a single <b>graded</b> barrier (Al <b>fraction</b> x = 0. 57 to 1 and 0. 45 to 0. 75, respectively) were used to test the effects. The sample with the lower barrier show responsivity increased by a factor of 2 ̆ 23 c 10 or more compared to the higher graded barrier sample and detectors without the graded barrier. The higher graded barrier sample, space charge build up causes almost all potential drop across the first barrier, and hence reduces the response. Based on the modeling it is believed that this effect will be greatly reduced in detectors with multiple periods of graded barriers and emitters, allowing the full gain effects of the graded barriers to be realized.
