25|$|Since many tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes are}} silenced by DNA methylation during carcinogenesis, {{there have been}} attempts to re-express these genes by inhibiting the DNMTs. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (<b>decitabine)</b> is a nucleoside analog that inhibits DNMTs by trapping them in a covalent complex on DNA by preventing the β-elimination step of catalysis, thus resulting in the enzymes' degradation. However, for <b>decitabine</b> to be active, it must {{be incorporated into the}} genome of the cell, which can cause mutations in the daughter cells if the cell does not die. In addition, <b>decitabine</b> is toxic to the bone marrow, which limits the size of its therapeutic window. These pitfalls have {{led to the development of}} antisense RNA therapies that target the DNMTs by degrading their mRNAs and preventing their translation. However, it is currently unclear whether targeting DNMT1 alone is sufficient to reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by DNA methylation.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy {{with the}} hypomethylating agents 5-azacytidine and <b>decitabine</b> {{has been shown}} to {{decrease}} blood transfusion requirements and to retard the progression of MDS to AML. Lenalidomide was approved by the FDA in December 2005 only for use in the 5q- syndrome. In the United States, treatment of MDS with lenalidomide costs about $9,200 per month.|$|E
25|$|Azacitidine {{is a drug}} {{approved}} by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) {{for the treatment of}} CMML and by the European Medicines Agency for high risk non-proliferative CMML with 10-19% marrow blasts. It is a cytidine analogue that causes hypomethylation of DNA by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. <b>Decitabine</b> is a similar drug to azacitidine and is {{approved by}} the FDA for treatments of all subtypes of MDS, including CMML. Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapy that is used in the myeloproliferative form of CMML to reduce cell numbers.|$|E
25|$|Another {{gene that}} {{experiences}} {{a change in}} methylation status in atherosclerosis is the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT3), which produces a protein responsible for the transport of lactate and other ketone bodies out of many cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells. In atherosclerosis patients, there {{is an increase in}} methylation of the CpG islands in exon 2, which decreases MCT3 protein expression. The down regulation of MCT3 impairs lactate transport, and significantly increases smooth muscle cell proliferation, which further contributes to the atherosclerotic lesion. An ex vivo experiment using the demethylating agent <b>Decitabine</b> (5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine) was shown to induce MCT3 expression in a dose dependant manner, as all hypermethylated sites in the exon 2 CpG island became demethylated after treatment. This may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to treat atherosclerosis, although no human studies have been conducted thus far.|$|E
25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, <b>decitabine,</b> azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E
500|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of small, usually heritable, {{molecular}} modifications—or [...] "tags"—that bind DNA and modify gene expression levels. Targeting these tags with drugs can kill cancer cells. Early-stage research in NSCLC using drugs aimed at epigenetic modifications shows that blocking more than one of these tags can kill cancer cells with fewer side effects. Studies also show that giving patients these drugs before standard treatment can improve its effectiveness. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate how well these drugs kill lung cancer cells in humans. Several drugs that target epigenetic mechanisms are in development. Histone deacetylase inhibitors in development include valproic acid, vorinostat, belinostat, panobinostat, entinostat, and romidepsin. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in development include <b>decitabine,</b> azacytidine, and hydralazine.|$|E

Proper DNA methylation is critical in the regulation of proliferation genes, {{and the loss of}} DNA methylation control can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cytopenias. [...] The recently approved DNA methyltransferase inhibitors take advantage of this mechanism by creating a more orderly DNA methylation profile in the hematopoietic stem cell nucleus, and thereby restoring normal blood counts and retarding the progression of MDS to acute leukemia.|$|E

5000|$|Demethylating {{agents are}} {{compounds}} that can inhibit methylation, {{resulting in the}} expression of the previously hypermethylated silenced genes (see Methylation#Cancer for more detail). Cytidine analogs such as 5-azacytidine (azacitidine) and 5-azadeoxycytidine (<b>decitabine)</b> are the most commonly used demethylating agents [...] These compounds work by binding to the enzymes that catalyse the methylation reaction, DNA methyltransferases; and titrate out these enzymes. Both compounds have been approved in the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in United States. Azacitidine and <b>decitabine</b> are marketed as Vidaza and Dacogen respectively. Azacitidine is the first drug to be approved by FDA for treating MDS and has been given orphan drug status.

50|$|The ongoing phase 3 trial, SEAMLESS, has 485 {{enrolled}} {{members and}} {{is open to}} elderly (70+ years of age) AML (acute myeloid leukemia) patients with good renal and liver function and who are not viable candidates for or have refused intensive induction chemotherapy. SEAMLESS is a global study with 118 different sites in the United States, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In the trial an arm of oral sapacitibine is given in alternating cycles with IV <b>decitabine,</b> which is compared to the control arm of IV <b>decitabine</b> alone. The SEAMLESS study was constructed based on the promising results of a phase 2 one-year survival study for patients with AML. The efficacy goal of the treatment is overall survival; the average survival of an elderly person diagnosed with AML is approximately three to six months. The Data Safety Monitoring Board has communicated the unlikelihood that this phase 3 study will reach a statistically significant survival improvement due to the planned futility boundary of 247 patient deaths already being crossed, but the trial is ongoing. During a poster session at the 2012 American Society of Hematology, results from a phase 1/2 clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of the oral sapacitibine along with IV <b>decitabine</b> were presented, selected data highlights are as follows: median overall survival was approximately 8 months, patients still alive at 3 months was 83%, 35% of patients survived a year or longer, 2 dose-limiting toxicities {{in the form of}} lung infection and typhlitis were observed.|$|E
50|$|Drugs that {{specifically}} target the inverted methylation pattern of cancerous cells include the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacitidine and <b>decitabine.</b> These hypomethylating agents {{are used to}} treat myelodysplastic syndrome, a blood cancer produced by abnormal bone marrow stem cells.
