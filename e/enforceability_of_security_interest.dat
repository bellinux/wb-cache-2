40|$|This paper {{considers}} some of {{the difficulties}} arising from how English law conceptualises certain types <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> over IPRs, and the problems arising from dual registration systems. This analysis is informed by a critical comparison of the current English doctrine, alongside the US system and the proposals from UNCITRAL. It is argued that attempts to regulate a world of integrated goods (whereby goods and software are inextricably interconnected), through unintegrated regimes of legal governance <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> over goods and IPRs, is unsustainable. It will thus be argued that reform <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> law generally (to bring about a functional system <b>of</b> <b>security)</b> and a single register for <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> whether over goods or IPRs is necessary. Specific recommendations to deal with problems concerning purchase money <b>security</b> <b>interests,</b> and third-party purchasers, are put forward...|$|R

50|$|A <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> {{is a type}} of {{property}} interest created by agreement or by operation of law over assets to secure the performance of an obligation, usually the payment of a debt. It gives the beneficiary <b>of</b> the <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> certain preferential rights in the disposition of secured assets. Such rights vary according to the type <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interest,</b> but in most cases, a holder <b>of</b> the <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> is entitled to seize, and usually sell, the property to discharge the debt that the <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> secures.|$|R

These types <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> are generally {{the purview of the}} Royal Court of Justice. Bhutanese law includes normative definitions and procedures for attachment and perfection <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> as well as types <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interests,</b> such as purchase money <b>security</b> <b>interests.</b> The law also covers default, foreclosure, deficiency, redemption, and allocation of risk of loss in modern terms. Notably, non-citizens are prohibited from taking a <b>security</b> <b>interest</b> in immovable property without prior government approval. Also notably, Bhutanese law provides for tolling of interest for mortgagees while incarcerated, and extends some redemption rights to family members of the debtor.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the United States (U.S.) legal {{community}} {{arrived at a}} consensus that the traditional common law distinctions were obsolete and served no useful purpose. They tended to generate too much unnecessary litigation about whether the creditor had selected the correct type <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interest.</b> There was a growing recognition that the different types <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> had developed only because on the one hand, many judges thought there was something inherently wrong with allowing a person, either out of desperation or foolishness, to summarily encumber all his or her personal property as collateral for a loan, but on the other, debtors and creditors would attempt to reach a desired result by any means necessary, even if that meant resorting to creating multiple <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> to cover different types of personal property. There was also {{the problem of the}} above-mentioned early English cases that regarded such <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> as fraudulent conveyances and failed to recognize that they had legitimate uses in a modern industrial economy. Therefore, because the very history <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> demonstrated that judicial resistance to enforcing broad <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> would not stop debtors from trying to give them as inducement to creditors to extend financing, and that they were socially useful under the proper circumstances, the better choice was to make the law <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> as clear and simple as possible.|$|R

5000|$|In other common-law countries, {{the term}} lien {{refers to a}} very {{specific}} type <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interest,</b> being a passive right to retain (but not sell) property until the debt or other obligation is discharged.

5000|$|Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), as {{adopted by}} all fifty states, {{generally}} governs secured transactions where <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> are taken in personal property. [...] It regulates creation and enforcement <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> in movable property, intangible property, and fixtures. UCC Article 9 replaced a wildly diverse array <b>of</b> <b>security</b> devices that had {{evolved in the}} various states during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{in response to the}} reluctance of U.S. courts to enforce general nonpossessory <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> as either against public policy or because they were perceived as fraudulent conveyances. [...] The drafters of UCC Article 9, particularly Grant Gilmore, successfully argued that since historical experience showed that disfavoring such <b>security</b> <b>interests</b> would not prevent creditors from requesting them or debtors from trying to give them by any means necessary, and because they were clearly economically useful, the better path was to develop a unified, simplified law <b>of</b> <b>security</b> <b>interests.</b>|$|R
