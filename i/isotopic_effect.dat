50|$|The GEBIK and GEBIF {{equations}} are {{the most}} generalized approach to describe <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> in any chemical, catalytic reaction and biochemical reactions because they can describe <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> in equilibrium reactions, kinetic chemical reactions and kinetic biochemical reactions. In the latter two cases, they can describe both stationary and non-stationary fractionation (i.e., variable and inverse fractionation). In general, <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> depend {{on the number of}} reactants and on the number of combinations resulting from the number of substitutions in all reactants and products. Describing with accuracy <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects,</b> however, depends also on the specific rate law used to describe the chemical or biochemical reaction that produces <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects.</b> Normally, regardless of whether a reaction is purely chemical or whether it involves some enzyme of biological nature, the equations used to describe <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> base on first-order kinetics. This approach systematically leads to <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> that can be described by means of the Rayleigh equation. In this case, <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> will always be expressed as a constant, hence {{will not be able to}} describe <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> in reactions where fractionation and enrichment are variable or inverse during the course of a reaction. Most chemical reactions do not follow first-order kinetics; neither biochemical reactions can normally be described with first-order kinetics. To properly describe <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> in chemical or biochemical reactions, different approaches must be employed such as the use of Michaelis-Menten reaction order (for chemical reactions) or coupled Michaelis-Menten and Monod reaction orders (for biochemical reactions). However, conversely to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, GEBIK and GEBIF equations are solved under the hypothesis of non-steady state. This characteristic allows GEBIK and GEBIF to capture transient <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R
50|$|For non-equilibrium reactions, <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> {{are better}} {{described}} by the GEBIK and GEBIF equations for transient kinetic isotope fractionation, which generalize non-steady <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> in any chemical and biochemical reactions.|$|R
40|$|Hydrogenic ion mass <b>effects,</b> {{namely the}} <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> on {{impurity}} transport driven by ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence are investigated using gyrokinetic theory. For non-trace impurities, changing from hydrogen (H) to deuterium (D), and to tritium (T) plasmas, the outward flux for lower (higher) ionized impurities or for lighter (heavier) impurities {{is found to}} decrease (increase), although isotopic dependence of ITG linear growth rate is weak. This is mainly due to the decrease of outward (inward) convection, while the isotopic dependence of diffusion is relatively weak. In addition, the <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> reduce (enhance) the impurity flux of fully ionized carbon (C 6 +) for weaker (stronger) magnetic shear. In trace impurity limit, the <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> are found to reduce the accumulation of high-Z tungsten (W).

5000|$|Tracer {{diffusion}} and Self-diffusion, {{which is}} a spontaneous mixing of molecules {{taking place in the}} absence of concentration (or chemical potential) gradient. This type of diffusion can be followed using isotopic tracers, hence the name. The tracer diffusion is usually assumed to be identical to self-diffusion (assuming no significant <b>isotopic</b> <b>effect).</b> This diffusion can take place under equilibrium. An excellent method for the measurement of self-diffusion coefficients is pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR, where no isotopic tracers are needed. In a so-called NMR spin echo experiment this technique uses the nuclear spin precession phase, allowing to distinguish chemically and physically completely identical species e.g. in the liquid phase, as for example water molecules within liquid water. The self-diffusion coefficient of water has been experimentally determined with high accuracy and thus serves often as a reference value for measurements on other liquids. The self-diffusion coefficient of neat water is: 2.299·10−9 m²·s−1 at 25 °C and 1.261·10−9 m²·s−1 at 4 °C.|$|E

Dissimilatory reduction of sulfate, and sulfite reduction by certain assimilatory microorganisms, causes particularly marked <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects,</b> the expression of which depends {{on the extent of}} reaction and other incompletely defined environmental conditions. Models have been proposed to account for these effects based on current knowledge of the reduction pathways. Many of the trends observed during dissimilatory sulfate reduction in the laboratory can also be found in the modern environment leaving little doubt that microbiological factors {{play a significant role in}} determining sulfur isotope distributions in nature.

The mass spectral scans from these pooled samples show the pairing of biological peaks allowing: 1) the removal of artifacts; and 2) the reinforced identification of the compounds the peaks represent because the distance between the paired peaks exactly corresponds to the number of carbons in the molecule.|$|E

40|$|Highlight Narrative: We {{report a}} study of the <b>isotopic</b> <b>effects</b> of {{deuterium}} substitution on the structure, morphology, and optoelectronic properties of regioregular poly(3 -hexylthiophene) s (P 3 HT) with an integrated approach that combines the synthesis of deuterated materials, optoelectronic properties measurements, theoretical simulation, and neutron scattering. Selective substitutions of deuterium on the backbone or side-chains of P 3 HT result in distinct optoelectronic responses in P 3 HT/[6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) photovoltaics. The weak non-covalent intermolecular interactions induced by the main-chain deuteration change the film crystallinity and morphology of P 3 HT/PCBM blends, and consequently reduce the short circuit current, while decreased electronic coupling, the formation of a charge transfer state, and increased electron-phonon coupling result from side chain deuteration and induce a remarkable reduction in open circuit voltage.

40|$|With the {{prototype}} {{electron cyclotron resonance}} ion source for the next carbon therapy facility in Japan a series of measurements has been performed in order (a) {{to find the best}} condition for producing high beam currents of C 4 + ions, and (b) to study the effect of "special" gas mixing by using a chemical compound as a feed gas. The effect would then appear as an increase in high charge state production in this case of C 5 + ions. In "regular" gas-mixing experiments {{it is well known that}} an isotopic phenomenon occurs: a heavier isotope of the mixing gas is increasing the production of high charge states of the beam gas ions. A similar <b>isotopic</b> <b>effect</b> has been found in the present experiment: with deuterated methane (CD 4 gas) the C 5 + beam currents are about 10 % higher than with regular methane (CH 4 gas). The "mixing-gas" ratio D (or H) to C can be decreased by choosing, e. g., butane gas; in this case the <b>isotopic</b> <b>effect</b> for C 5 + production is even stronger (> 15 %). For production of C 4 + ions the <b>isotopic</b> <b>effect</b> appears to be absent. Clearly this is related to the much easier production.

40|$|Primitive meteorites exhibit certain {{features}} {{that are consistent with}} aqueous and thermal alteration on asteroids, but O-isotopic analyses show only a modest heavy-isotope shift, interpreted as indicating modification in the nebula. To understand the isotopic effects of asteroidal alteration, we take the L-group ordinary chondrites weathered in Antarctica as an analogue. The data show that alteration is a two-stage process, with an initial phase producing only a negligible <b>isotopic</b> <b>effect.</b> Although surprising, a possible explanation is found when we consider the alteration of terrestrial silicates. Numerous studies report pervasive development of channels a few to a few tens of nanometer wide in the incipient alteration of silicates. We observe a similar texture. Alteration involves a restructuring of clay minerals along these narrow channels, in which access of water is restricted. The clay shows a topotactic relationship to the primary grain, which suggests either epitaxial growth of the clay using the silicate as a substrate or inheritance of the original O structure by the clay. Our data suggests the latter: with extensive inheritance of structural polymers by the weathering product, the bulk O- isotopic composition is comparatively unaffected. This offers an explanation for the lack of an <b>isotopic</b> <b>effect</b> in the weathering of the L chondrites. If substantial modification of chondritic materials may occur without a pronounced <b>isotopic</b> <b>effect,</b> it also reconciles existing O analyses of CV chondrites with an asteroidal model of aqueous alteration...|$|E
