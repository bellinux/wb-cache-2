This paper seeks to highlight how the RTK GPS from Trimble is being employed at Gold Fields Ghana Limited, Tarkwa Mine to provide accurate drill depth and <b>drill</b> <b>pattern</b> design. The usage, problems, processing and efficiency of this system in a mining environment is also explored. It also looks at the level of accuracies provided by this system. Before the introduction of RTK GPS into the blasting process, the current blast fragmentation was resulting in sub-optimal feed size to crushers on the Mine and an unfriendly floor conditions resulting in excessive sheeting of digging floor to prevent tyre damage. It was decided to use RTK GPS to improve the fragmentation through accurate drill depth and design pattern in order to achieve a constant throughput to the north heap leach crusher of 1500 t/hr, a 5 % increase in pit loading efficiency and a 50 % decrease in rock breaker hours, equipment damage costs and in-pit sheeting costs respectively. This paper is intended to take the reader through the application of RTK GPS in accurate drill depth and <b>drill</b> <b>pattern</b> which have resulted in a 10 % reduction in loading times, of which half has been attributed to improved fragmentation, as well as a substantial increase in blasted stocks whiles rock breaker hours have also decreased resulting in substantial financial gains to the company.

40|$|Development {{drilling}} {{is used in}} {{underground mining}} to create access tunnels. A common method involves using a drilling rig, known as a jumbo, to drill holes {{into the face of}} a tunnel. Jumbo drill rigs have two or more articulated arms with drills as end-effectors, that extend outwards from a vehicle. Once drilled, the holes are charged with explosives and fired to advance the tunnel. There is an ongoing imperative within the mining industry to reduce development times and reducing time spent drilling is seen as the best opportunity for achieving this. Notwithstanding that three-boom jumbos have been available for some years, the industry has maintained a preference for using jumbo rigs with two drilling booms. Three-boom machines have the potential to reduce drilling time by as much as one third, but they have proven difficult to operate and, in practice, this benefit has not been realized. The key difficulty lies in manoeuvering the booms within the tight confines of the tunnel and ensuring sequencing the drilling of holes so that each boom spends maximum time drilling. This thesis addresses the problem of optimally sequencing multi-boom jumbo drill rigs to minimize the overall time to drill a blast hole pattern, taking into account the various constraints on the problem including the geometric constraints restricting motion of the booms. The specific aims of the thesis are to: ² develop the algorithmic machinery needed to determine minimum- or near-minimum-time drill assignment for multi-boom jumbos which is suitable for "real-time" implementation; ² use this <b>drill</b> <b>pattern</b> assignment algorithm to quantify the benefits of optimal <b>drill</b> <b>pattern</b> assignment with three-boom jumbos; and ² investigate the management of unplanned events, such as boom breakdowns, and assess the potential of the algorithm to assist a human operator with the forward planning of drill-hole selection. Jumbo drill task assignment is a combinatorial optimization problem. A methodology based around receding horizon mixed integer programming is developed to solve the problem. At any time the set of drill-holes available to a boom is restricted by the location of the other booms as well as the tunnel perimeter. Importantly these constraints change as the problem evolves. The methodology builds these constraints into problem through use of a feasibility tensor that encodes the moves available to each boom given configurations of other booms. The feasibility tensor is constructed off-line using a rapidly exploring random tree algorithm. Simulations conducted using the sequencing algorithm predict, for a standard drill-hole pattern, a 10 - 22 % reduction in drilling time with the three-boom rig relative to two-boom machines. The algorithms developed in this thesis have two intended applications. The first is for automated jumbo drill rigs where the capability to plan drilling sequences algorithmically is a prerequisite. Automated drill rigs are still some years from being a reality. The second, and more immediate application is in providing decision support for drill rig operators. It is envisaged that the algorithms described here might form the basis of a operator assist that provides guidance on which holes to drill next with each boom, adapting this plan as circumstances change...|$|E

40|$|The {{quest of}} AI and Robotics {{researchers}} to realize fully AI-driven integrated robotic systems {{has not yet}} led to such realizations, in spite of great attainments in both research areas. This thesis claims {{that one of the}} major hindrances to these realizations is the lack of attention to what we call “the hybrid reasoning problem”. This is the problem of jointly reasoning about heterogeneous and inter-dependent aspects of the world, expressed in different forms and at different levels of abstraction. In this thesis, we propose an approach to hybrid reasoning (or integrated reasoning) for robot applications. Our approach constitutes a systematic way of achieving a domain-specific integration of reasoning capabilities. Its underpinning is to jointly reason about the sub-problems of an overall hybrid problem in the combined search space of mutual decisions. Each sub-problem represents one viewpoint, or type of requirement, that is meaningful in the particular application. We propose a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) formulation of the hybrid reasoning problem. This CSP, called meta-CSP, captures the dependencies between sub-problems. It constitutes a high-level representation of the (hybrid) requirements that define a particular application. We formalize the meta-CSP {{in a way that is}} independent of the viewpoints that are relevant in the application, as is the algorithm used for solving the meta-CSP. In order to verify the applicability of the meta-CSP approach in real-world robot applications, we instantiate it in several different domains, namely, a waiter robot, an automated industrial fleet management application, and a <b>drill</b> <b>pattern</b> planning problem in open-pit mining. These realizations highlight the important features of the approach, namely, modularity, generality, online reasoning and solution adjustment, and the ability to account for domain-specific metric and symbolic knowledge...|$|E

40|$|A common adage in the Explosives Industry goes {{by saying}} that "Blasting is not bombing". One of the key {{differences}} between the two employs of explosive energy lays in the same gap existing between the application of acoustic energy that differentiates noise from music: timing and the distribution of energization in time. While timing in blasting is widely accepted to influence blast induced vibrations, it is still not completely investigated when related to rock fragmentation and downstream benefits. This paper shows a research about this topic, developedon two phases: 1) test blasts at the Experimental Mine of the Research Center of Responsible Mining of the University of São Paulo; 2) development project for large-scale production blasts in an open-cast mine. The first phase of the research was performed attempting to increase the productivity of the experimental mine, by lowering production costs and improving the quality of the product. Some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were established to monitor the results. A new blast design method and a more appropriate initiation sequence were designed according to the principles of: i) decomposition of the blast; ii) taking advantage of the free surfaces to favor the movement of the blasted material; iii) simultaneous holes firing as far away as possible, to avoid undesired cooperation of charges that may induce the explosive energy to work with shear effect instead of producing fragmentation. The results show that the proper selection of delay timing leads to significant benefits for rock fragmentation, downstream processes and the quality of final walls. The second phase of the study was a research and development (R&D) project in an open-cast mine with the goal to achieve an average P 80 of 300 mm (11, 8 ") in the run-of-mine (ROM) product without altering the existing budget. The project included several variables in the blast design that were not previously taken into account, such as the orientation of natural joint sets in the rock mass, specific energy of the explosive and firing sequence. The new blast design method considered the directions of natural joint sets and determined the drilling pattern and the firing sequence accordingly to favor the movement of the blasted rock along its preferential direction, to reduce its confinement. At the end of the project, it was achieved an average P 80 of 304 mm (12 ") in the ROM, 50 % lower than the one {{at the beginning of the}} project. The final blast of the project showed a reduction of 3 % of the drill and blast cost, employing the same powder factor and the same <b>drill</b> <b>pattern</b> size used at the beginning of the project.

40|$|This project aims to {{investigate}} the parameters that affect the swell factor used in design and reported volumes for {{different parts of the}} mining process and cast blasting methods at various locations around Callide mine. The Callide coal mine along with most mines worldwide have been using a swell factor as a variable in open cut mine design and volume removed calculations throughout history. At Callide coal mine a swell factor with now unknown origins or validity is being used. The current swell factor appears to be correct which can be seen by design being achieved however, after the annual Audit by Anglo BCO, the validity of this figure has been requested. As well as validating the swell factor, this report aims to predict the swell factor for future cast blasting applications. This report is an investigation and includes the identification of the properties affecting the swelling of overburden material during the drill and blast process. These properties include those within the <b>drill</b> <b>pattern</b> design, explosives used and the geological makeup of the overburden. The report then validates the swell factor through measurement using traditional survey techniques. Upon identifying the drill, explosive and geological properties and the swell factor, the use of projection modelling and linear regression techniques for the analysis are employed. This is to discover which of the design and geological properties affect the swell factor the most and attempt to predict site specific swell factors based upon them. The research needed {{to investigate}} the previously mentioned aims is based in their relative industries and professions. These include the mining industry, surveying and spatial science, geology and geotechnical engineering, drill and blast engineering, mathematics and data analysis. This investigation will provide background knowledge and {{a review of the literature}} applied, information on the application and methodology used and a detailed analysis of captured data and resulting conclusions for the swell factor. The exploration and use of survey techniques employed for calculating the swell factor and the data collection and analysis will use aerial scanning, I-Site terrestrial scanning, three dimensional modelling as well as standard survey procedures. The geological study has required research into geological properties, in specific those affected by the drill and blast process, the lithology of Callide mine and methods of testing and acquisition. Research into drill and blast engineering includes desired fragmentation size and maximum cast, the effect of drill and blast techniques on the overburden and which properties affect a change in overburden volume. To obtain an accurate prediction of the swell factors a model must be created that amalgamates the information from the three professions, eliminates superfluous data and has the ability to be validated. To facilitate this, projection modelling and linear regression techniques are used in an effort to identify the a priori components to mathematically and graphically represent the relationship of properties within the data sets and the swell factor. Developing a method of calculating the overburden swell factor will greatly affect mine design and reporting. If the swell factor is accurately known there is a possibility that design constraints can be tightened leading to better equipment utilisation, time management and an overall increase in efficiency. An increase in efficiency will lead to improved production and ultimately enhance capital gain. ...|$|E
40|$|Open pit mines {{constitute}} {{more than}} half of global minerals production. Yet most of the large, high-grade, and close to the surface deposits have been depleted or are currently in production. Besides, volatility in commodity prices and stringent environmental regulations limit the up-scaling expansions in large open pits. Consequently, the mines are determined to increase their operational efficiency in order to thrive. This has recently led to major metallurgical improvements in the processing of ores; whereas the improvements in mining of the said ores are relatively overdue in terms of efficiency and technological advancement. This thesis concentrates on the mining activities and their efficiency in open pits with a focus on drilling, blasting, loading, and crushing. As all of these tasks revolve around the fragmentation of run-of-mine ore, their relationships and efficiencies are explored within the context of fragmentation. Fragmentation is a result of complex interactions between rockmass, blasting geometry, explosive, and timing sequence of blast holes. The influence of rockmass and timing sequence on fragmentation and efficiency are explored, as well as the target fragmentation for efficient loading and crushing. Moreover, the techniques for measuring fragmentation are evaluated as to whether they can benefit mines in terms of efficiency. As the circumstances in open pits are essentially site-specific, these issues are addressed as a case study of the Aitik mine in Sweden. The research comprised four elements. First, the influence of rockmass fractures on blast results and downstream efficiency was evaluated via full-scale field trials. The fractures in and around the case study mine were mapped using a photogrammetric technique and six production blasts were adapted to the major fracture sets to evaluate the effect of initiation direction on downstream efficiency. Second, the influence of the timing sequence of blast holes was explored within the theories of stress waves interaction and their consequent effect on fragmentation. Theoretical and numerical solutions were accompanied by six field trials in full-scale to evaluate the influence of short delay times on fragmentation and efficiency. Third, an empirical study was conducted to correlate fragmentation to the efficiency of loading and crushing; this was done to define a target fragmentation for the studied case. Finally, the techniques to assess fragmentation were discussed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings indicated that rockmass fractures have a significant influence on the quality of blasts and efficiency of downstream tasks. In the case study mine, adjustments to orientation of <b>drill</b> <b>pattern</b> and initiation direction of blasts suggested that careful experimentation in this regard can yield a favourable initiation direction with respect to existing discontinuities. Finer fragmentation and higher loading efficiencies can be achieved by adapting the blast designs to the existing fractures, which can lead to significant savings in the long run. On the contrary, the influence of stress waves interaction on blast results turned out to be marginal. Neither the theoretical and numerical solutions nor the field trials showed any significant improvements in blast results from short delays. In fact, it was found rather implausible to expect any noticeable improvements by using short delays. The empirical method to evaluate target fragmentation proved useful as well. It was shown that by incorporating different data from various sources in a mine, one can follow the ore from muckpile to loaders and then to crushers. Having a qualitative understanding of the fragmentation, and by developing tools to measure efficiency, one can estimate what fragmentation is most favourable for an efficient operation. Finally, two image-based methods to assess fragmentation were discussed in terms of repeatability and statistical significance. It was found that the scatter in both methods is rather large, introducing a certain ambiguity in representativeness of their results. Admittedly, it was found that in matters of long-term efficiency, the number, size and representativeness of assessed samples are of more importance compared to the accuracy of individual measurements...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{battleship}} USS Maine exploded at Havana, Cuba in February 1898, a [...] "war fever" [...] against Spain swept through America with the cry: [...] "Remember the Maine!" [...] On March 4, 1898, a highly charged war rally {{was held at}} the Avilla Methodist Church. Three attorneys gave rousing speeches to the packed house, fueled with patriotic songs from a ladies choir. As a result, fifty-three young men immediately volunteered for military service in a new company that would be known as the Avilla Zouaves. These units were characterized by colorful uniforms and/or precision <b>drilling</b> <b>patterned</b> after the French Zouaves, and were very stylish in the 19th century military. The Avilla youth would be designated in the US Army as Company G, 5th Missouri Infantry Regiment. Two months later, the new Avilla unit was escorted by flag-bearing GAR members to the Carthage Train Depot, and with music from the Light Guard Band were ceremoniously sent off for battle in the Spanish–American War. The fighting in Cuba was over quickly and the 5th Missouri Infantry was mustered out on November 9, 1898, before the Avilla Zouaves saw any action. Although they did not fight in the war, this event illustrates the raw patriotic spirit of Avilla, Missouri still present in 1898.|$|R
40|$|Medical {{devices and}} {{engineering}} products need {{an increasing number}} of micro scaled–features, such as holes for filtration, separation and ventilation or small structures e. g. for hydrophobic effects. The size of these structures is often in the range of 20 μm and below while the structured areas grow at the same time. Therefore the factors influencing the drilling process {{are becoming more and more}} important and used to generate high process stability during the laser process. This paper investigates the process limits as well as the factors influencing the application of perforation with laser radiation of a 15 μm thick aluminum foil with UV ps-pulses. The pitch of the holes within the <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern</b> is varied as is the repetition rate used for the percussion drilling of each of the holes. The holes are evaluated by means of their diameter and shape. The precision of the hole shape is examined for two characteristics: circularity and ellipticity. Holes with a diameter of < 10 μm are drilled with pitches between 14 μm and 25 μm. Depending on the repetition rate three different drilling regimes are identified: 1. thermal drilling with increasing surface-oxidation, 2. thermal drilling with decreasing surface-oxidation and 3. shadowing of laser radiation...|$|R
40|$|Drilling {{constitutes}} {{an important part}} of the production process in sublevel stoping method and up to 50 % of the total costs can be attributed to this element. With the advent of recently developed sophisticated and expensive drilling machines, sublevel stoping has gained renewed advantage over other similar methods. The use of these machines, however, substantially increases the capital cost of the whole operation and hence choosing the optimum drilling system can produce significant savings in costs. In this paper, <b>drilling</b> <b>patterns</b> have been designed for various conditions of the physical characteristics and geometrical conditions of an ore body. Total costs of some 150 different patterns have been compiled. Based on these empirical data, a practical model has been devised that determines drilling costs in all different feasible situations in sublevel stoping. The model shows that parallel drilling is the most efficient alternative in all workable conditions. As well the break-even orebody thickness in ring drilling between one or two production drifts in sublevels is, in most cases, about 30 meters. The prescribed drilling methods in different circumstances and the model introduced, can serve as useful tools to the mining design engineer in choosing the most economical drilling system when designing a stope...|$|R
40|$|In {{the world}} today, {{due to the}} current high price of gold, {{thousands}} of artisanal small-scale mines operate without the financial or technical capacity to upgrade their production methods, often using equipment and working methods that were forsaken decades ago in the conventional mining industry. This article illustrates, with a practical example, {{that it is possible}} to achieve the modern requirements of quality, safety and productivity, while operating with mining equipment that basically possesses the same characteristics as that employed in the 1950 s. The operation involved the excavation of a 6 meter long tunnel and over 25 stoping sections in both rock and concrete by drilling and blasting in an underground gold mine. The article describes how the main operational problems were overcome. An effective <b>drilling</b> <b>pattern</b> was designed in order to be easily achievable with the limited local equipment. The behavior of the local nitrate explosive was effectively predicted and managed. The interaction with the drilling teams was managed in order to determine a meeting point between their traditional working methods and the scientific view of the engineer. At the end of the article some general guidelines are proposed for the management of similar situations, in order to improve the efficiency, productivity and safety of drill and blast operations in small-scale mines...|$|R
