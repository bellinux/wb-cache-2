40|$|This study {{explored}} the relational dimensions of perinatal grieving. Three perinatally bereaved couples each participated in one interview, {{as well as}} a <b>follow-up</b> <b>member</b> check interview. The research question for this study was, “how do bereaved parents grieve jointly following perinatal loss?” Data were collected using the qualitative action-project method, and participants were asked how they grieved together for their deceased baby. Joint grieving processes were identified at couples’ initial interviews, and then, following preliminary analyses, were presented back to the couples during the member check interviews for confirmation and alteration. The data analysis followed the protocols set forth in the action-project and instrumental case study methods, combining all data collected from both sets of interviews. Within-case analyses revealed intentional frameworks for each of the couples joint grieving projects, including: (1) Marveling at God’s presence in the midst of loss and the endurance of grace, respect, and togetherness in marriage, (2) Finding each other in the midst of grieving differences to celebrate and honour the sanctity of life, and (3) Coming back into life to find joy and new responsibilities while continuing to mark and honour the existence of the deceased. Joint grieving involved several commonalities between the couples, including re-learning the uniqueness of one another through grieving, interspersing grief within ongoing faith careers, using the safety of the relationship to express painful thoughts and feelings, oscillations between hope and pain, and the ongoing nature of grieving rituals as joint actions. The findings of this study support the application of broader theoretical models of bereavement to the unique context of perinatal loss, as well as emerging constructivist models of perinatal bereavement. The findings also demonstrate the relevance of relational dimensions of grieving for future empirical and clinical developments in the area of perinatal bereavement...|$|E

Drawing on these theories, a brief planning intervention was designed and its effectiveness compared to an information-based health promotion programme (control) All participants were given information about the safe limits per dnnking occasion and the adverse consequences of binge dnnking, {{and were asked to}} dnnk within the safe limits in order to avoid these consequences. In addition, participants in the planning intervention group received an option menu of possible responses for refusing a dnnk, asked to choose one strategy and specify a time and place in which the chosen strategy would be implemented.

30|$|This {{household}} {{has five}} members. At baseline, member A and member D are away as migrants. In the <b>follow-up</b> period, <b>member</b> A is still away as a migrant, while member D {{has returned to}} the household. Now, member E is away as a migrant. If we were to compare only the total number of migrants away, we would see no difference between these two periods for this household. However, member D might have returned with money for the household and will now contribute again to the household production (farm or business), and he or she potentially returned with new skills that could improve the returns to her or his labour. At the same time, for member E to migrate, the household had to incur some costs, maybe by selling assets or using savings. These factors have different impacts on the household welfare, so we focus on new migrants instead {{of the total number of}} migrants. Thus, this example household would be defined as a household with migration experience and a new migrant. Member E would be this new migrant.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} the prospective effects of weight perception {{of self and}} weight comments by others on psychological health problems among Chinese adolescents. Methods: In the Hong Kong Student Obesity Surveillance project, 8716 adolescents (41. 3 % boys) aged 14. 2 ± 1. 7 years were followed prospectively. Logistic regression yielded odds ratios (ORs) for psychological health problems at 1 -year follow-up by weight comments received and weight perception at baseline (2006), adjusting for each other sociodemographic factors and body mass index. Results: Perceived fatness at baseline predicted subsequent headache and feeling stressful with adjusted ORs (95 % confidence intervals) of 1. 17 (1. 03 - 1. 33) and 1. 20 (1. 03 - 1. 39), respectively. Perceived thinness at baseline did not predict any subsequent health problems. Receiving incorrect weight comments at baseline also predicted headache, feeling stressful and feeling depressed at follow-up, with adjusted ORs of 1. 19 (1. 08 - 1. 31), 1. 26 (1. 04 - 1. 53) and 1. 38 (1. 10 - 1. 74) respectively.

Treatment of dialysis patients will not be effective without their participation via some self-care activities. This study aimed to investigate the effects of training and follow-up via text messaging on weight control in hemodialysis patients. In this clinical trial, 70 hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned into two groups: face to face training (35) and training with SMS follow-up (n = 35). Both groups received face to face training on self-care behaviors. The SMS <b>follow-up</b> group <b>members</b> were sent text messages. A check list {{was used to measure}} the patients' weight before and 2 and 6 weeks after training in both groups. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20 via paired and independent t-tests. There was {{a significant difference between the}} training group (P < 0. 001) and SMS follow-up group (P < 0. 001) in terms of mean weight changes before the training and two weeks after training. There was no significant difference between weight change before the training and after 6 weeks of training (P = 0. 972) in the training group. However, in the SMS follow-up (P < 0. 001) this difference was statistically significant. Training along with follow-up via SMS is effective in weight management in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

Contrary to the existing situation for low-level waste, no institutional policy has yet been formally approved for {{the long-term}} management of long-lived and high level waste. In this context, ONDRAF considers the public and stakeholders’ participation and engagement as essential {{in the formulation of}} an effective and legitimate policy. This is why, over the past few years, it has decided to engage them in different ways (public dialogues, interdisciplinary conference, consensus conference, legal public consultation) to elaborate the “Waste Plan”, an ONDRAF-document containing guidelines to make a principled policy decision about nuclear waste management. To achieve “successful” public participation exercises, social scientists have been regularly mobilized either as external evaluators, <b>follow-up</b> committee <b>members,</b> or participative observers. Our previous research on such public participation processes showed that little had been said as to how stakeholders and the “public” have been mobilized by the Belgian Agency during the elaboration of the Waste Plan.

At the same time, {{more and more people}} becomes members of a fitness center. There is a lack of studies that investigate the effect of interventions to increase the physical activity for members at fitness centers by increasing their use of the services offered at fitness centers. E-mail and telephone-delivered interventions have such a potential. Purpose The purpose was to investigate the effect of a structured follow-up program on how new members' use a fitness center compared to new members with no structured follow-up. We hypothesize that a structured <b>follow-up</b> on new <b>members</b> will increase the attendance frequency at the fitness centers. Methods This was a participant and provider blinded parallel group randomized controlled trial. Participants (n = 350) were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 172) or a control group (n = 178). The intervention group received two telephone calls and one e-mail that contained information that intended to motivate the intervention group to increase their attendance frequency and bookings at the fitness center. The control group received no structured follow-up. The primary outcome was attendance frequency (days with visits) and the secondary outcomes were booking of individual guidance, individual follow-up and group activities. Results/discussion The intervention group had a higher probability to book individual guidance (risk ratio 2. 79; 95 % CI 2. 06 to 3. 78), follow-ups (risk ratio 4. 14; CI 1. 99 to 8. 60) and group activity (risk ratio 1. 85; CI 1. 25 to 2. 74). However, the intervention had no effect on the attendance frequency (risk ratio 0. 93; CI 0. 79 to 1. 09) at the fitness centers among participants in the intervention group compared to participants in the control group. Conclusion: A structured <b>follow-up</b> of new <b>members</b> at a fitness center did not give an increased attendance frequency among new members at a fitness center.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} {{prevalence and}} incidence of distal symmetric neuropathies (DSN) in the Italian elderly, and {{to evaluate the}} accuracy of our procedure to screen for DSN. METHODS: In eight Italian municipalities, a population-based sample was directly evaluated both at baseline (1992) and after a 3 -year <b>follow-up.</b> Cohort <b>members</b> who had died were studied. DSN diagnosis and subtyping were made according to specified diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: Our screening procedure proved accurate (sensitivity 94. 7 %, specificity 70 %, positive predictive value 18. 9 %), and provided an adjusted prevalence of 7. 0 (95 % CI, 6. 9 to 7. 0). Women outnumber men both in the oldest age groups and as a whole. Rates increase with increasing age in both genders. Among the 2, 845 individuals re-screened at the follow-up and the 221 deceased subjects with reliable information, we identified 100 incident cases of DSN. Adjusted annual incidence rate (per 1, 000 person-years) in the population 65 to 84 years of age is 7. 9 (95 % CI, 6. 3 to 9. 5), and for the nondiabetic DSN is 5. 76 (95 % CI, 4. 3 to 7. 3). Age significantly predicted the onset of DSN both in diabetic individuals (for every increasing year of age RR = 1. 07; 95 % CI, 1. 01 to 1. 14) and in the entire study population (RR = 1. 05; 95 % CI, 1. 02 to 1. 09).

For a PhD student under contract with ONDRAF/NIRAS, this mandate consists of thinking out a way to construct an inter-organizational innovative communication system that would be participative, transparent and embedded in a long- term perspective, thus integrating all the further legal steps to take throughout the decision-making process. In this regard, two paradoxical constraints must be taken into account: on the one hand, my own influence on the legal decision-making process should remain limited, because of a series of constraints, lock-ins and previous decisions which have to be respected; on the other hand, ONDRAF/NIRAS expects the research conclusions to be policy relevant and useful. In this paper, the purpose is twofold. Firstly, the issues raised by this policy mandate is an opportunity to question the performative dimensions of the social scientist in the decision- making process and, more specifically, to have a reflexive view on our position as PhD Student. Secondly, assuming the role of “embarked” social scientist, numerous of answers will discuss to face the different dilemmas of the researcher “in action”. Those reflections follow on, among others, those from previous papers discussed in Quimper in April 2013 [1] and in Leuven in June 2013 [2]. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{determinants}} {{of prostate cancer}} [...] aside from established but non-modifiable risk factors of increased age, black ethnicity, and a positive family history [...] are poorly understood. METHODS: We examined the association {{of a series of}} baseline socioeconomic, behavioral, and metabolic characteristics with the risk of prostate cancer mortality in a 40 -year <b>follow-up</b> of study <b>members</b> from the original Whitehall cohort study. During this period there were 578 prostate cancer deaths in 17, 934 men. RESULTS: After adjustment for a series of baseline covariates, results from proportional hazards regression analyses indicated that marital status (hazard ratio; 95 % confidence interval: widowed/divorced vs. married: 1. 44; 0. 95, 2. 18), raised blood cholesterol (tertile 3 vs. 1 : 1. 35; 1. 11, 1. 65), and increased physical stature (tertile 3 vs. 1 : 1. 37; 1. 09, 1. 74) were associated with death from prostate cancer, although statistical significance at conventional levels was not apparent in all analyses. There was no evidence that physical activity, smoking habit, socio-economic status, component of either blood pressure or diabetes predicted the risk of death from this malignancy herein. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, there was a suggestion that marital status, blood cholesterol, and height were risk indices for death from prostate cancer...|$|R
40|$|Background: Mutations in {{the bone}} {{morphogenetic}} protein receptor 2 (BMPR 2) gene can lead to hereditary pulmonary arterial hypertension (HPAH) and are detected in more than 80 % of cases with familial aggregation of the disease. Factors determining disease penetrance are largely unknown. Methods: A mean clinical follow-up of 12 years was accomplished in 46 family members including echocardiography, stress-Dopplerechocardiography and genetic analysis of TGF-b pathway genes. Right heart catheterization and RNA-analysis was performed in members with pathological findings. Results: Manifest HPAH was diagnosed in 8 members, 4 were already deceased, two died during the follow-up, two are still alive. Normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure at rest but hypertensive response to exercise has been identified in 19 family members. Analysis of BMPR 2 transcripts revealed aberrant splicing due to an insertion of an intronic Alu element adjacent to exon 6. All HPAH patients and 12 further asymptomatic family members carried this insertion. During <b>follow-up</b> two family <b>members</b> carrying hypertensive response and the Alu insertion developed manifest HPAH. Conclusion: This is the first report of an intronic BMPR 2 mutation due to an Alu element insertion causing HPAH in a large family which has been confirmed on RNA-level. Only those members that carried both hypertensive response and the mutation developed manifest HPAH during follow-up. Our findings highlight the importance of including further method...|$|R
40|$|The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the {{worldwide}} repository of 3 D structures of proteins, nucleic acids and complex assemblies. The PDB’s large corpus of data (> 100, 000 struc-tures) and related citations provide a well-organized and extensive test set for developing and understanding data citation and access metrics. In this paper, {{we present a}} systematic investigation of how authors cite PDB as a data repository. We describe a novel metric based on information cascade constructed by exploring the citation network to measure influence between competing works and apply that to analyze different data citation prac-tices to PDB. Based on this new metric, {{we found that the}} original publication of RCSB PDB in the year 2000 continues to attract most citations though many follow-up updates were published. None of these <b>follow-up</b> publications by <b>members</b> of the wwPDB organization can compete with the original publication in terms of citations and influence. Meanwhile, authors increasingly choose to use URLs of PDB in the text instead of citing PDB papers, leading to disruption of the growth of the literature citations. A comparison of data usage sta-tistics and paper citations shows that PDBWeb access is highly correlated with URL men-tions in the text. The results reveal the trend of how authors cite a biomedical data repository and may provide useful insight of how to measure the impact of a data repository...|$|R
