5|$|Mold played {{another three}} matches in 1901 without being no-balled for throwing, but his {{reputation}} was ruined and he retired {{at the end}} of the season, although Lancashire had offered <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> contract.

5|$|Within a {{few months}} of the war's end in November 1918 a draft {{agreement}} had been accepted by the Paris Peace Conference to create a League of Nations, as a means of resolving disputes between nations by peaceful means.

As a condition to renewing the contract, Camacho {{requested that the}} club sign more established players, but budget restraints allowed for limited investment. After several unsuccessful player bids, Benfica added Luisão to the squad and re-signed Geovanni in August. Because their second-place finish only granted a berth in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, Benfica had to play Lazio for {{a spot in the}} group stage. They lost both legs and were relegated to the UEFA Cup.|$|E

Ford was encouraged into football by his father who would buy <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> football and boots for each birthday. He grew up in the Townhill district of the city and attended Powys Avenue School as a child, captaining the school's football side as a centre-half.|$|E
5|$|By April 1834 {{the opera}} had {{received}} over 100 performances in Paris. Nourrit sang {{the role of}} Robert until 1837, when he was replaced as premier tenor at the Opéra by Gilbert Duprez, whom, however, Meyerbeer did not like in the role; nor did he approve of an alternative, Lafont. However, he {{was impressed by the}} newcomer Mario (Cavaliere Giovanni Matteo di Candia), and wrote for <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> aria for Robert which was performed at his debut in the revival of the opera on 30 November 1838. Mario's debut was the launch of his very successful career. Others singing in the 1838 revival included Julie Dorus-Gras (Alice), Prosper Dérivis (Bertram) and François Wartel (Raimbaut). By Meyerbeer's death in 1864 the opera had been performed over 470 times in Paris alone.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to that of the {{original}} game in which players control Sir Daniel Fortesque as he travels through Gallowmere to stop the evil Zarok. Dan can utilize a variety of weapons, including close range weapons such as swords and axes to long ranged weapons such as throwing knives and crossbows. If Dan defeats enough enemies to collect the Chalice of Souls hidden throughout each level, he will be able to travel to the Hall of Heroes, where a legendary hero rewards him by giving <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> weapon or other helpful items. Dan possesses a single life bar throughout the game, which can be sustained by collecting Life Bottles throughout the game which can be replenished by energy vials and Life Fountains. The remastered version also includes some exclusive arcade-style minigames which can also be played over online multiplayer.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Hsu {{went to the}} United States as a Columbia University {{exchange}} scholar. In {{the same}} year, he joined the World United Formosans for Independence, and he also served as the literary editor for the Taiwan Tribune. As a result, he {{was placed on the}} Kuomintang's black list and was unable to return to Taiwan. He then earned his PhD candidacy from New School for Social Research. In 1990, Hsu was invited to a meeting by President Lee Teng-hui and returned to Taiwan as a Taiwanese-American professor. With the influence of then-legislators Chen Shui-bian, Peng Pai-hsien, Hung Chi-chang, and Lu Hsiu-yi, the government relented and removed the restriction for Hsu to exit and enter the country, finally issuing <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> passport.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Port Vale's Micky Adams {{appointed}} Horsfield as player-assistant manager. He {{aimed to}} play a majority of Vale's games in the 2009–10 season while learning the ropes of management. He played in the opening four {{games of the season}} despite needing painkillers for a cracked rib and a cracked bone in his hand, the first broken bones he had ever suffered. The club reached the third round of the League Cup, but after three consecutive defeats, Adams placed the entire squad on the transfer list. He suffered from niggling injuries, in addition to a torn hamstring, which limited his appearances. This caused him to consider his retirement in the summer of 2010. Port Vale did not offer <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> playing contract, but did retain him on the coaching staff.|$|E

5|$|Juventus {{confirmed}} on 18 October 2011 {{that the}} 2011–12 season would be Del Piero's last with the club. The 2011–12 season under new manager Antonio Conte, his former Juventus teammate, saw Del Piero being used sparingly, and mainly as a substitute, {{because of the}} summer arrival of forward Mirko Vučinić from Roma. Del Piero scored his first goal in the new Juventus Stadium on 24 January 2012, in a 3–0 win over Roma in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia. Later in the season, Del Piero stated that he was surprised at Juventus president Andrea Agnelli's announcement regarding the club's decision not to offer <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> contract.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau {{was born}} on August 23, 1970, in Jacksonville, Florida. His father, Craig Mehldau, was a doctor, and his mother, Annette, was a homemaker. His sister, Leigh Anne, became a social worker. There was always a piano in the house during Mehldau's childhood, and he {{initially}} listened to pop and rock music on the radio. His family moved to West Hartford, Connecticut, when Mehldau was 10. Up to this point he had played mostly simple pop tunes and exercises from books, but the move brought <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> piano teacher, who introduced him to classical music. This new interest lasted for a few years, but {{by the age of}} 14 he was listening more to jazz, including recordings by saxophonist John Coltrane and pianist Oscar Peterson.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April 1809, {{about three}} months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, {{offering}} <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> manuscript of Susan if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the UK he joined Bobby Gould's First Division Coventry City on a one-year £300 a week contract. He was made captain, and though Coventry enjoyed a good first half to the 1983–84 season they faltered badly {{in the second half}} of the season and finished just one place and two points above the relegation zone after beating Norwich City on the final day of the season. Midway through the campaign Gould had promised <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> two-year contract, but following the poor end to the season he instead opted to release Allardyce.|$|E
5|$|Đuric's {{relationship}} with Singapore Armed Forces had been damaged with his attempted transfer to Sriwijaya. Following their {{decision not to}} offer <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> contract, he signed for Tampines Rovers in 2010. He scored 20 league goals {{in his first season}} there as the club finished in second place. He clinched three consecutive S.League titles with Tampines Rovers from 2011 to 2013, and four Charity Shield honours from 2011 to 2014. He became the first player to reach a milestone 300th goal on 27 September 2010 with two goals against Balestier Khalsa in the Singapore Cup. With 328 goals in 444 top division club appearances, Đuric was ranked by IFFHS as the world top scorer in July 2011. He picked up his third Player of the Year award in 2012 and finished joint league top-scorer with Moon Soon-Ho in 2013.|$|E
