40|$|A {{major problem}} for {{insuring}} catastrophic risk is that, as a disaster causes damages to many insureds at the same time, such insurance and in particular reinsurance contracts are often subject to considerable default risk. On the other hand, the securitization of insurance risk, for example via a catastrophe bond, can be designed to completely avoid default risk. In many cases, however, the payout from an <b>insurance-linked</b> <b>security</b> is tied to some stochastic variable, an index, which is correlated, but not identical, with the insured’s actual losses. Therefore, such an instrument will usually not provide a perfect hedge. There will be some mismatch, the so-called basis risk. This paper investigates how the trade off between default respectively credit risk and basis risk affects optimal risk management solutions, when (re) insurance and risk securitization are used simultaneously. In particular, the impact of credit risk and risk securitization on the optimal reinsurance contract is analysed...|$|E
40|$|Mortality {{improvements}} {{around the}} world are putting more pressure on governments, pension funds, life insurance companies as well as individuals to deal with the increasing longevity risk they face. Financial markets, on the other hand, can in principle provide vehicles to hedge longevity risk effectively. Many new investment products have been created both by the insurance/reinsurance industry and by the capital markets. Mortality catastrophe bonds are an example of a successful <b>insurance-linked</b> <b>security.</b> Some new innovative capital market solutions for transferring longevity risk include survivor bonds, reverse mortgages, longevity-linked swaps and forward contracts. The aim of the International Longevity Risk and Capital Markets Solutions Conferences is to bring together academics and practitioners {{from all over the world}} to discuss and analyze these exciting new developments. The first conference was held at Cass Business School in London in February 2005. This conference was prompted by the announcement of the Swiss Re mortality catastrophe bond in December 2003 and the EIB/BNP/PartnerRe longevity bond in November 2004.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of heterogeneous agent models, this paper analyzes the impact factors on the issuance of an <b>insurance-linked</b> <b>security</b> (ILS), and gives an ILS pricing formula and the conditions of existence and stability of the issue price. We consider two cases: fixed supply and flexible supply. We find that, in the fixed volume case, to assure the successful issuance of an ILS, an appropriate volume of the ILS is necessary, and to attract investors, the ILS should pay a positive premium which can help investors to enhance the efficient frontier of their portfolio. In the flexible supply case, we show that the issue price of an ILS is given by the weighted average of different beliefs about the discounted ILS return, and {{the stability of the}} issue price depends on the numbers of investors and sponsors and the extrapolation rate to the ILS of investors. In addition, whether an ILS has the hedging ability to sponsors depends on their own understanding about the ILS coupon and the relationship between the recovery from the ILS and their liability, but how much the risk of sponsors can be hedged relies on the ILS coupon expected by investors...|$|E

The aim of this thesis is to investigate the valuation of non-hedgable insurance risks and consider how the insurance institutions can use insura'nce-linked securities to hedge these risks. We start from a simple discrete multi-period market model. By issuing a new security, which can be viewed a [...] c:; an insurance liability, we are looking for the equilibrium price of the new a [...] c:;set. We will also use some pricing methods from financial mathematics, Le. risk minimization methods and the variance optimal martingale approach, to value the new asset [...] We also introduce a set of approximate pricing methods based on power series expansions. Based on a two-factor stochastic mortality model, we simulate the price of a pension annuity. By using a linear approximation method, we bridge the gap between the discrete time model and continuous model. We extend the discrete market model to a continuous model, and we consider an investor with some future insurance liability. We use the martingale approach with a pension annuity as the numeraire and the stochastic optimal control method to find out the investor's optimal terminal wealth and the optimal trading portfolio process. By introducing a new asset, (that is, an <b>insurance-linked</b> <b>security</b> into the market model), we investigate how the investor can use the new asset to hedge the insurance risk, and how to benefit from the insurance-linked asset. We also consider some more complex asset models, such as a stochastic interest rate model, as well as a more complex and practical pension annuity model. We also investigate how the choice of a numeraire can simplify the calculation process by using a numeraire with,a general form. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

From a financial viewpoint, natural catastrophes represent idiosyncratic risks, diversifiable at the world level.

This paper argues that downside risk aversion and ambiguity aversion explain the limited success of cat bonds.

Using the concept of market modified risk measure, the paper shows that replacing simple cat bonds with hybrid cat bonds would lead to an increase in market volume.

Catastrophe models are shown to enable economic exchange of contingent futures belonging to ontologically and geographically disparate orders. Pension funds are then introduced to illustrate how biological lives and retirement savings have become deeply entangled in the creation and extension of the ILS market. Pension funds are both major institutional investors in catastrophe bonds and also the principal sellers of “longevity risk” posed by pensioners.

40|$|A {{catastrophe}} (CAT) bond {{is designed}} for peanut production {{as a means of}} transferring natural disaster risks from insurance purveyors to the global capital market. The CAT bond so designed is priced using state-level historical yields for peanut production {{in the southern part of}} the United States in the State of Georgia. The index triggering the CAT bond contract was based on percent deviation from state average yield. The principal finding of the study is that it appears feasible for crop insurance purveyors to issue <b>insurance-linked</b> <b>securities.</b> CAT bonds can reduce the variance of the loss ratio when issued optimally with regard to the number of bonds and contract specifications.

They explain why, despite this very encouraging evolution, the market has not expanded more (contrary to credit derivatives for instance). They propose three complementary ways to increase interest in these instruments that could effectively trigger the tipping point toward a much more significant volume of capital entering the ILS market: (1) increasing investors' interest through tranching, (2) addressing the basis risk challenge through index-based derivatives, and (3) innovating through the development of new products; the authors introduce the concept of derivative solutions based on equity volatility dispersion.

40|$|<b>Insurance-linked</b> <b>securities</b> (ILS) {{will play}} an {{important}} role in the future. At Zurich Financial Services, ILS have contributed to a better understanding of alternative capital market solutions. They are an essential part of our capital market activities and a key strategic lever. More broadly, the process of securitization has contributed to the recent transformation of the banking industry, and we should ask ourselves whether the banking model (“originate to securitize”) could be valid for insurers too. One strength of securitization is that it will open access to non-traditional and seemingly unlimited sources of capital on a multi-year basis and with limited counterparty credit risk. Securitization is also likely to foster a more efficient use of capital. But insufficient data and modeling capacity make it hard to repackage insurance risk for the markets. Additional impediments are the lack of standardization and the industry's reluctance to disclose proprietary underwriting information. Our comparative advantage is underwriting, which appears to make capital market solutions relatively unattractive. At the same time, we should not discount the demand side. ILS constitute an alternative and attractive class of assets. The development of secondary trading platforms will be essential for the ILS market to grow to maturity. We should also ensure that the incentive structure of market participants reflects underlying risks. This could be done within a framework of self-regulation.

40|$|The devastating calamitous {{events of}} the last decades have raised a {{widespread}} interest in the still unexploited coverage opportunities offered by the CAT derivatives, especially in the height of the global financial crisis; this concerns not only primary insurers but also governments seeking assistance with the huge costs of emergency and reconstruction by the transfer of natural risk to capital market investors in lieu of reinsurers. Hence, such economic reasons, encompassing the preservation of financial stability, behind the development of the market for <b>insurance-linked</b> <b>securities</b> (ILS) urge a thorough analysis of their fair valuation as a crucial requisite for liquidity. Indeed, the catastrophic jumps of their underlying loss index raise the issue of market incompleteness, whereby a natural solution is found in the pricing approach based on Esscher Transforms; in fact, such actuarial tool proves particularly intuitive yet effective when dealing with the ILS. Once its theoretical foundations have been outlined, a straightforward application leads to a closed-form pricing formula for a PCS option. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations allow a numerical analysis of fair prices and yield spreads of an index-triggered CAT bond. Such analysis, original {{to the best of our}} knowledge in that it accounts for both a general class of Lévy-type underlying and global Transforms to justify jump risk premia, makes an interesting contribution also to the issue of the choice between alternative pricing measures; moreover, it opens wide perspectives of research, bridging a gap between actuarial tools and financial theory, thanks to the dual nature of the presented approach...|$|R
