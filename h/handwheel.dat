5|$|Also {{known as}} a {{manifold}} cage or regulator cage, this is a structure which can be clamped to {{the neck of the}} cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the valves and regulator first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the <b>handwheel</b> against an overhead. A valve cage is often made of stainless steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.|$|E
5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a <b>handwheel</b> driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E
25|$|The PT-22 {{fuel system}} {{consists}} of a single tank mounted forward of the front cockpit. Fuel is gravity fed to the carburetor. The oil system is a dry-sump type, with all oil stored in a tank located on the front side of the firewall in the upper section of the fuselage. The wing flaps are mechanically operated from a lever located {{on the left side}} of each cockpit. Adjustable elevator trim is provided via an elevator trim tab controllable from a <b>handwheel</b> mounted {{on the left side of}} each cockpit. In its original configuration, the aircraft was not equipped with an electrical system. Hydraulic brakes are provided for each wheel, controllable via the rudder pedals in each cockpit.|$|E
50|$|<b>HandWheels</b> offer X, Y, Z {{coordinate}} entry. They can {{be adjusted}} on three axes. The operator can set the height, depth, and angle of the <b>handwheels.</b>|$|R

50|$|The M5 {{director}} {{is used to}} determine or estimate the altitude or slant range of the aerial target. Two observers then track the aircraft through a pair of telescopes {{on opposite sides of}} the director. The trackers turn <b>handwheels</b> to keep the crosshairs of their respective telescope on the aircraft image. The rotation of the <b>handwheels</b> provides the director with data on the aircraft's change in elevation and change in azimuth in relation to the director. As the mechanisms inside the director respond to the rotation of the <b>handwheels,</b> a firing solution is mechanically calculated and continuously updated for as long as the target is tracked. Essentially, the director predicts future position based on the aircraft's present location and how it is moving.|$|R
2500|$|Electric motors {{became so}} common that Singer made {{provision}} for them: the model 127/128 'modernized' versions included mounting lugs for a motor, whereas earlier models {{had to be}} drilled and tapped. [...] Some 127/128 machines were even given motors right at the factory, and of those, a few models used a smaller lighter solid <b>handwheel</b> instead of the larger heavier spoked <b>handwheel</b> used on machines sold as treadles. [...] The spoked <b>handwheel</b> is better for treadles because its larger inertia keeps it spinning longer, whereas the lighter solid <b>handwheel</b> is better for motors because its smaller inertia causes it to start and stop more quickly.|$|E
2500|$|The add-on {{motor drives}} the <b>handwheel</b> {{by means of}} a rubber belt. [...] Meanwhile the bobbin winder has a {{separate}} belt: the models 27 and 28 drive the bobbin winder using a long round or V belt to the motor, whereas the 'modernized' models 127 and 128 drive the bobbin winder directly off the <b>handwheel</b> {{by means of a}} small [...] "ring belt" [...] or [...] "bobbin belt" [...] acting as a tire.|$|E
2500|$|The crank {{is geared}} {{to give a}} {{negative}} mechanical advantage {{so that it can}} crank the machine at high speed. [...] Each rotation of the crank handle produces three rotations of the <b>handwheel,</b> and hence three stitches.|$|E

50|$|The gunner was {{occupied}} with manually operating the loading and firing lever, while the gun captain aimed {{the gun and}} operated the elevation and training <b>handwheels.</b>|$|R
25|$|A few older 27 and 28 {{machines}} {{have also}} shown up with solid <b>handwheels,</b> which {{they must have}} received retrofit during the addition of their electric motor.|$|R
2500|$|Driving the {{bobbin winder}} with a {{separate}} belt, hooked onto the motor pulley whenever needed, means that the standard V belt cannot be used to drive the <b>handwheel.</b> [...] A less-desirable stretch belt, easier to get onto and off the motor pulley, must be used instead.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{electric}} conversions {{consisted of}} mounting a motor in the treadle cabinet. [...] The treadle belt was shortened to run {{only from the}} motor's pulley to the <b>handwheel.</b> [...] The treadle pad was then given a mechanism for controlling the motor's speed {{in the manner of}} a modern car gas pedal.|$|E
2500|$|To answer this, the modernized models 127 and 128 {{moved the}} bobbin winder up several inches where, with a {{suitable}} tire, it can run directly off the <b>handwheel.</b> [...] The older 27 and 28, {{on the other}} hand, require a dedicated belt to drive the bobbin winder, but the motor kit only has one pulley, resulting in problems: ...|$|E
50|$|In the Splash Pad {{area of the}} park, many of the {{features}} are interactive and controlled by user-operable valves. The valves are free-turning ball-valves connected to large <b>handwheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 10 cm Gebirgshaubitze M 10 was {{virtually}} identical {{except that it}} had its traversing and elevating <b>handwheels</b> on different sides {{and it was not}} given a high-angle mount.|$|R
50|$|The wagons were {{operated}} by being pulled along track {{at a very}} slow speed, with track workers (gangers) walking alongside and using <b>handwheels</b> to open the discharge doors slung beneath the hoppers.|$|R
2500|$|Driving {{both the}} <b>handwheel</b> and the bobbin winder {{with a single}} belt running in a {{triangular}} path causes traction problems at the motor, due to decreased belt contact area (from 90 degrees to about 60 degrees). [...] This can be compensated by high belt tension, but that in turn will wear out the bearings and quickly exhaust a stretch belt.|$|E
2500|$|As a foot treadle, {{the machine}} mounts in a cabinet {{about the size}} of an adult schooldesk. [...] The treadle pad is built into the cabinet's base right at the user's feet. [...] A round leather [...] "treadle belt" [...] passes up from the treadle, up through the cabinet, over the <b>handwheel</b> by {{following}} the belt groove, back down through the cabinet again, and then back to the treadle.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his design}} Whitehill {{retained}} the White machine's dimensions and most aspects of its exterior; his contribution mainly {{consists of the}} new interior. [...] That is, he rethought the entire powertrain—the mechanism that carries energy from the <b>handwheel</b> to the needlebar, to the bobbin driver, and to the feed dogs. [...] He also conceived the bullet-shaped shuttle, which the White machine promptly adopted over its more traditional boat shuttle.|$|E
50|$|The Mounting Barbette Mark V (the {{original}} mounting with Mark IX and X guns) gave {{a maximum}} elevation of 15 degrees, and maximum range of 21,000 yards. This and some modified to Mark VI (30 degrees and 29,500 yards) were manually powered, the projectile and propelling charge were manually hoisted to loading level, the projectile manually loaded and rammed, and traverse and elevation were by <b>handwheels.</b> There was an elevated platform around the breech {{area for the}} gun detachment commander (No 1) and some detachment members, and a gun shield to the front. The ordnance and mounting together weighed some 125 tons, they were well balanced and the <b>handwheels</b> needed very little effort to move the gun.|$|R
5000|$|Jig borer Vertical mills {{that are}} built to bore holes, and very light slot or face milling. They are {{typically}} bed mills {{with a long}} spindle throw. The beds are more accurate, and the <b>handwheels</b> are graduated down to [...]0001" [...] for precise hole placement.|$|R
50|$|The three radar {{operators}} sat at consoles {{mounted on}} the pedestal just below the antenna cross-arm, each with their own oscilloscope display. One controlled the azimuth, another the elevation, and the third the range. Pointing the antenna was controlled by rotating large <b>handwheels,</b> the range being reported by a similar wheel.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} had a metal monocoque fuselage, {{while the}} wings were of corrugated metal construction. The mainwheels {{of the conventional}} landing gear retracted backwards into the wing, being operated by cables driven by a <b>handwheel</b> turned by the pilot. The first prototype was powered by an imported 433kW (580hp) Bristol Mercury radial engine enclosed by an NACA cowling and driving a two-bladed wooden propeller. [...] It was armed with a single PV-1 machine gun, with provision for two Kurchevsky APK-37 recoilless autocannon under the wing.|$|E
2500|$|Later motor kits {{dispensed}} {{entirely with}} the treadle, treadle belt, and cabinet. [...] The motor bolted {{right to the}} machine's pillar, where—thanks to its compact size—it could remain even when the machine was tilted into its cabinet or enclosed within its cover. [...] This was an improvement over earlier pivoting-motor designs, large offset belt-drive motors, and the many schemes for entirely replacing the <b>handwheel</b> with a motor. [...] Credit for the original idea may belong to George F. Green, who proposed it back in 1879 but was probably unable to build or obtain the sufficiently compact motor required by his design. [...] It was Frederick Diehl and Martin Hemler, Singer employees, who finally developed the idea in 1921.|$|E
2500|$|A {{retractable}} radiator, deployed via a <b>handwheel</b> in the cockpit, {{was mounted}} under the nose. [...] When retracted this radiator warmed {{the cockpit and}} it was claimed {{that there would be}} no need for electrically heated clothing in the open cockpit, even at 20,000ft (6,100 m) in winter. [...] There were air vents for cooling the cockpit in summer and also a skin-type ancillary radiator built into the upper wing centre section surface. The land undercarriage was of the single-axle type, with forward-leaning oleo legs to the lower fuselage ahead of the leading edge and rearward struts. [...] The wheels incorporated servo-assisted brakes operated from the rudder bar. [...] The land- and seaplane undercarriages were designed to be rapidly interchangeable and shared the same attachment points, though the oleo legs were moved aft for the floats and there were additional bracing struts forward from their feet to the fuselage. [...] The floats, linked by a pair of horizontal struts, were duralumin with a single step and water rudder.|$|E
50|$|The Flakvierling weapon {{consisted}} of quad-mounted 2 cm Flak 38 AA guns with collapsing seats, folding handles, and ammunition racks. The mount had a triangular base with a jack at each leg for levelling the gun. The tracker traversed and elevated the mount manually using two <b>handwheels.</b> When raised, the weapon measured 307 cm (10 feet 1 inch) high.|$|R
50|$|The Gebirgsflak 38 {{was fired}} using a foot pedal {{on the right}} front of the flak mount. The gunlayer’s seat was mounted behind the gun and rotated with the mount in traverse. Elevating and {{traversing}} of the gun were manual using <b>handwheels</b> located {{on the right and}} left sides of the mount respectively. There are two speeds, high and low, in both elevating and traversing.|$|R
50|$|In a {{metalworking}} lathe, metal {{is removed}} from the workpiece using a hardened cutting tool, which is usually fixed to a solid moveable mounting, either a tool-post or a turret, which is then moved against the workpiece using <b>handwheels</b> and/or computer-controlled motors. These cutting tools come {{in a wide range of}} sizes and shapes, depending upon their application. Some common styles are diamond, round, square and triangular.|$|R
2500|$|The Mussel II {{also spent}} time as both landplane and seaplane. [...] Until March 1930 both Mussels had used {{what was in}} the UK at least the {{standard}} two float configuration. In that month a single long central float arrangement, similar to one built by Shorts for a de Havilland Gipsy Moth the previous summer. The single float required wing tip stabilising floats, and these were strutted to the outer wing and braced with another pair of struts inboard, meeting the underside of the wing at the same point as the wing compression struts above, so running almost co-linearly with them and giving a shallow cross like look to the aircraft from the front. [...] In its original form this undercarriage was amphibious, with main wheels mounted on a streamlined cross piece on the float, as on the Moth. [...] The main axle could be rotated from the cockpit by turning a <b>handwheel</b> and hence raising or lowering the mainwheels. [...] The water rudder on the float was reinforced to act as a small tailskid for use on land.|$|E
50|$|In {{their basic}} version most {{electric}} actuators {{are equipped with}} a <b>handwheel</b> for operating the actuators during commissioning or power failure. The <b>handwheel</b> does not move during motor operation.|$|E

50|$|The 75-mm was {{operated}} by a gunner and a loader. Sighting the 75-mm gun used an M1 periscope — with an integral telescope — {{on the top of}} the sponson. The periscope rotated with the gun. The sight was marked from zero to 3000 yd with vertical markings to aid deflection shooting at a moving target. The gunner laid the gun on target through geared <b>handwheels</b> for traverse and elevation.|$|R
50|$|The Class S1 boiler was {{provided}} with SAR standard boiler fittings, {{such as a}} multi-valve steam regulator fitted in the smokebox, a duplex top-feed valve for the delivery of feedwater from the injectors, a soot blower and external exhaust pipe to the smokebox, and a steam turret for the distribution of steam to the various steam-operated mechanisms. The valves for the latter were mounted on the steam turret and were fitted with spindles which extended into the cab from where they were operated by means of <b>handwheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|A typical {{jig borer}} has a work table of around 400 x 200 mm, (15.748 x 7.87402 inch) {{which can be}} moved using large <b>handwheels</b> (with micrometer-style {{readouts}} and verniers) on particularly carefully made shafts with a strong degree of gearing; this allowed positions to be set on the two axes to an accuracy of 0.0001 inch (2.5 micron). It was generally used to enlarge to a precise size smaller holes drilled with less accurate machinery in approximately the correct place (i.e., with the small hole strictly within the area to be bored out for the large hole).|$|R
