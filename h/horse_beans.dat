40|$|The {{objective}} of the experiments was to demonstrate the influence of low- and high-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> on the selected fermentation indicators. The sheep rumen content {{with the addition of}} 1, 2 and 5 g of high- and low-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> was incubated in vessels of 250 ml volume. A significant increase of ammonia, lactic acid, CO 2 and methane as well as pH decrease in samples with addition of <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> seed was demonstrated. While comparing high- and low-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> varieties, it was observed {{that in the case of}} small doses of 1 and 2 g a higher intensity of fermentation takes place in the samples with the addition of high-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean.</b> In the case of larger doses of 5 g per sample, a higher intensity of fermentation takes place in the samples with the addition of low-tannin horse-bean. A probable reason for the decrease in the fermentation process intensity in the samples with the addition of 5 g of high-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> is a high content of tannins, which reduce fermentation processes.

Tillage treatments included conventional tillage (CT), two-layer tillage (TT), surface tillage (ST) and minimum tillage (MT).

5000|$|Upon arrival {{the guests}} found all three granary {{buildings}} decorated with evergreens, flags, banners, and bunting. Lawson used the largest room, with seating arrangements for over one thousand guests {{for music and}} dancing; assigning the two smaller rooms, each with a seating capacity for 400 guests, for lectures and the serving of refreshments. The formalities began with James Burns, the celebrated London gymnast reciting an amusing sketch entitled, ‘How to read a man like a book’. At noon Lawson served a ‘fruit, grain, and vegetable meal’, consisting of raw turnip, boiled cabbage, boiled wheat, boiled barley, shelled peas, oatmeal gruel, boiled <b>horse</b> <b>beans</b> and boiled potatoes. He also presented a salad, made from chopped carrot, turnip, cabbage, parsley and celery, served with a congealed sauce made from boiled linseed. There were no condiments and since everything was cold except the potatoes, one can only imagine the guest's apprehension, as they sat down to dinner. To compensate for the poorly prepared meal each guest upon rising from the table received an apple and a biscuit. The {{total cost of the}} ingredients was less than £8. The entertainment continued in the afternoon with a colourful concert comprising gymnastic displays, music, songs and speeches. During the afternoon, the two [...] steam engines set off with whistles screaming to lead a procession through the farm. Around five in the afternoon guests received an ‘evening meal’, followed by a lecture entitled, ‘Diet and the Health of the Human Body’. However unpalatable these proceedings may appear today the guests appreciated the proceedings. The problems arose from lack of experience, a shortage of cooking facilities, and from Lawson's insistence that the food comprise a truly national flavour, thus excluding rice, raisins, currants, pepper, sugar, salt and other readily available imports. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, public opinion suggested that the lectures and experiments were ample compensation for the dissatisfaction caused by the bland food. The second festival was equally successful, and although Lawson levied a small charge for food, he did provide bread and beef. Lawson hailed the third festival as a Social Science Congress, with a series of lectures covering a wide variety of scientific topics. Again, food was free and although beef and ham were available, the meal consisted in the main of rice boiled with currants and raisons. On this occasion, the application for free tickets was so immediate and numerous that after receiving almost 3,000 requests he closed the offer on December 3, Although ruined by rain, observers recalled two novel events, labourers using Cain’s boiler to heat the water to mash tea, and an attempt by Lawson to introduce a non-smoking policy. In total, Lawson sponsored five festivals, the first four on consecutive Christmas days, while the fifth celebration took place in July, in a meadow adjoining the River Ellen.|$|E
