The Viterbi decoder is constructed based on a symbolic state representation of the transmitter 's chaos generator.

INTRODUCTION In classical communications channel coding is divided in two large classes [...] block <b>encoding</b> <b>methods</b> and convolutional <b>encoding</b> <b>methods.</b> In a similar way chaos communication approaches may be classified into blockwise (or static) <b>encoding</b> <b>methods</b> exploiting free-running chaos generators and dynamic <b>encoding</b> <b>methods,</b> where the message to be transmitted affects the dynamics of the generator. In this paper we will present a digital chaos communication scheme with dynamic encoding. In the receiver we exploit a method developed for the reception of convolutionally encode [...] ...|$|R
25|$|The {{modified}} <b>encoding</b> <b>method</b> ignores {{building the}} LZW table and emits only the root palette codes and the codes for CLEAR and STOP. This yields a simpler encoding (a 1-to-1 correspondence between code values and palette codes) but sacrifices {{all of the}} compression: each pixel in the image generates an output code indicating its color index. When processing an uncompressed GIF, a standard GIF decoder will not be prevented from writing strings to its dictionary table, but the code width must never increase since that triggers a different packing of bits to bytes.|$|E
25|$|JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) format {{can produce}} a smaller file than PNG for {{photographic}} (and photo-like) images, since JPEG uses a lossy <b>encoding</b> <b>method</b> specifically designed for photographic image data, which is typically dominated by soft, low-contrast transitions, and an amount of noise or similar irregular structures. Using PNG instead of a high-quality JPEG for such images {{would result in a}} large increase in filesize with negligible gain in quality. In comparison, when storing images that contain text, line art, or graphics – images with sharp transitions and large areas of solid color – the PNG format can compress image data more than JPEG can. Additionally, PNG is lossless, while JPEG produces noticeable visual artifacts around high-contrast areas. Where an image contains both sharp transitions and photographic parts, a choice must be made between the two effects. JPEG does not support transparency.|$|E

This paper presents irredundant address bus <b>encoding</b> <b>methods</b> which reduce signal transitions on the instruction address buses by using adaptive codebook methods.

40|$|Abstract. Bag {{of visual}} words (BoVW) {{models have been}} widely and {{successfully}} used in video based action recognition. One key step in con-structing BoVW representation is to encode feature with a codebook. Re-cently, {{a number of new}} encodingmethods have been developed to improve the performance of BoVW based object recognition and scene classifica-tion, such as soft assignment encoding [1], sparse encoding [2], locality-constrained linear encoding [3] and Fisher kernel encoding [4]. However, their effects for action recognition are still unknown. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate and compare these new <b>encoding</b> <b>methods</b> in the context of video based action recognition. We also analyze and evalu-ate the combination of <b>encoding</b> <b>methods</b> with different pooling and nor-malization strategies. We carry out experiments on KTH dataset [5] and HMDB 51 dataset [6]. The results show the new <b>encoding</b> <b>methods</b> can sig-nificantly improve the recognition accuracy compared with classical VQ. Among them, Fisher kernel encoding and sparse encoding have the best performance. By properly choosing pooling and normalization methods, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on HMDB 51. 1...|$|R

The proposed methods simultaneously reduce more dynamic power dissipation and wire propagation delay than existing bus <b>encoding</b> <b>methods.</b> Our methods also reduce more total power consumption than other <b>encoding</b> <b>methods.</b> The proposed methods transform the bus signal to reduce and eliminate the worst crosstalk types, i. e.

40|$|XML {{is quickly}} {{becoming}} {{the de facto}} standard for data exchange over the Intemet. This is creating {{a new set of}} data management requirements involving XML, such as the need to store and query XML documents. Researchers have proposed using relational database systems to satisfy these requirements by devising ways to &quot;shred &quot; XML documents into relations, and translate XML queries into SQL queries over these relations. However, a key issue with such an approach, which has largely been ignored in the research literature, is how (and whether) the ordered XML data model can be efficiently supported by the unordered relational data model. This paper shows that XML's ordered data model can indeed be efficiently supported by a relational database system. This is accomplished by encoding order as a data value. We propose three order <b>encoding</b> <b>methods</b> {{that can be used to}} represent XML order in the relational data model, and also propose algorithms for translating ordered XPath expressions into SQL using these <b>encoding</b> <b>methods.</b> Finally, we report the results of an experimental study that investigates the performance of the proposed order <b>encoding</b> <b>methods</b> on a workload of ordered XML queries and updates. 1...|$|R
