40|$|<b>Drag</b> <b>torques</b> of {{gearboxes}} are {{an important}} part of the overall losses in today’s vehicle drive trains. From measurements it is well known that overall <b>drag</b> <b>torques</b> of vehicle gearboxes vary significantly over the range of operating points and speeds, de-pending on the interaction of the losses of the single gearbox elements like bearings, gearings, etc. Be-cause today’s vehicle emission regulations are be-coming stricter and stricter "drag torque design " of gearboxes will be even more important in the future. Prediction of losses helps to save cost (e. g. drag tor-que measurements), speeds up the development and allows to assess many concepts in short time. We collected detailed semi-analytical drag models for the common gearbox components from literature and from manufacturer information and implemented them in a Modelica library. This library contains models for radial shaft seals, rotary unions, synchro-nizers, multi-disc clutches, helical gearings, planeta-ry gearings, various kinds of bearings, lubrication systems and lubricant characteristics.

50|$|Magnetic liquid rotary seals {{operate with}} no {{maintenance}} and extremely low leakage {{in a very}} wide range of applications. Ferrofluid-based seals used in industrial and scientific applications are most often packaged in mechanical seal assemblies called rotary feedthroughs, which also contain a central shaft, ball bearings and an outer housing. The ball bearings provide two important functions: maintaining the shaft's centering within the seal gap, and supporting external loads. The bearings are the only mechanical wear-items, as the dynamic seal is actually a series of rings made of ultra-low vapor pressure, oil-based liquid held magnetically between the rotor and stator. Therefore, the operating life and equipment maintenance cycles are generally very long, and the <b>drag</b> <b>torque</b> very low. The magnet material is permanently charged and requires no electrical power or other re-energizing or maintenance. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs reach performance levels that other technologies can't achieve, by optimizing features such as ferrofluid viscosity and magnetic strength, magnet and steel materials, bearing arrangements, and water cooling for applications with extremely high speeds or temperatures. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs routinely operate in environments including ultra-high vacuum (below 10−8 mbar), temperatures over 1,000 °C, {{tens of thousands of}} RPM, and multiple-atmosphere pressures.|$|E

The {{goal of this}} system is to achieve a nadir pointing accuracy {{on the order of}} 0. 1 to 1. 0 deg without the need for thrusters or wheels. The open-loop system is under-actuated because magnetic torque rods cannot torque about the local magnetic field direction. This direction moves in space as the spacecraft moves along an inclined orbit, and the resulting system is roughly periodic. Periodic controllers are designed using an asymptotic linear quadratic regulator technique. The control laws include integral action and saturation logic. This system's performance has been studied via analysis and simulation. The resulting closed-loop systems are robust with respect to parametric modeling uncertainty.

Because the effects on libration of both the changing kinematic and atmospheric <b>drag</b> <b>torques</b> caused by changing length are largely predictable, the controller that models these changes has substantially better performance. In particular, the altitude variation of the tethered satellite above an oblate earth can be controlled substantially better with a controller that uses a length command adapted to these predictable changes than one that only reacts to tension changes. Also, small amplitude out-of-plane librations, that are coupled only to second-order with changing length, can be damped substantially faster by the controller that periodically commands properly phased length changes than by the controller that only reacts to the second-order changes in tension...|$|R
40|$|Passive {{levitation}} by superconducting magnetic bearings can {{be utilized}} in flywheels for energy storage. Basic design criteria {{of such a}} bearing are high levitation force, sufficient vertical and horizontal stability and low friction. A test facility was built for the measurement and evaluation of friction in a superconducting magnetic bearing {{as a function of}} operating temperature and pressure in the vacuum vessel. The bearing consists of a commercial disk shaped magnet levitated above single grain, melt-textured YBCO high-temperature superconductor material. The superconductor was conduction cooled by an integrated AEG tactical cryocooler. The temperature could be varied from 50 K to 80 K. The pressure in the vacuum chamber was varied from 1 bar to 10 (exp - 5) mbar. At the lowest pressure setting, the <b>drag</b> <b>torque</b> shows a linear frequency dependence over the entire range investigated (0 less than f less than 40 Hz). Magnetic friction, the frequency independent contribution, is very low. The frequency dependent <b>drag</b> <b>torque</b> is generated by molecular friction from molecule-surface collisions and by eddy currents. Given the specific geometry of the set-up and gas pressure, the molecular <b>drag</b> <b>torque</b> can be estimated. At a speed of 40 Hz, the coefficient of friction (drag-to-lift ratio) was measured to be mu = 1. 6 x 10 (exp - 7) at 10 (exp - 5) mbar and T = 60 K. This is equivalent to a <b>drag</b> <b>torque</b> of 7. 6 x 10 (exp - 10) Nm. Magnetic friction causes approx. 1 % of the total losses.

30|$|The microswimmer {{has been}} {{actuated}} at a frequency range from 1 to 16  Hz on a Si substrate in the tank. The flux {{density of the}} magnetic field maintains 9 mT during the experiments. When the input frequency is below 8 Hz, the microswimmer exhibits simple rotation and no translational velocity is observed (Fig. 9 a), whereas it exhibits propulsion with varied poses when the input frequency is higher than 8 Hz (Fig. 9 b). Experiment results show that 8 Hz is the pose-change frequency ω _c. When the input frequency is below ω _c (8 Hz), the microswimmer exhibits simple rotation and the <b>drag</b> <b>torque</b> is small enough to be balanced by the magnetic torque. The projection of rotation axis in XY-plane is closing to the centroid of the simplified triangle gradually with increasing the input frequency, {{in order to reduce}} the <b>drag</b> <b>torque</b> (Fig. 4 a). Such adjustment of rotation axis cannot affect the actuation pose (simple rotation) of the microswimmer. Equations 14 – 17 have shown the limitation of this adjustment method, which also explains why the microswimmer cannot maintain simple rotation with input frequency higher than ω _c. While when the input frequency is higher than ω _c (8  Hz), the <b>drag</b> <b>torque</b> is affected by both the pose angle φ and the distance d_m (Fig. 4 c). Different input frequencies of the magnetic field change the <b>drag</b> <b>torque,</b> and dynamic behaviors of the microswimmer are governed by the interplay of magnetic and resistant torques. The dynamic behaviors appear when turning on the magnetic field or changing the input frequency (see Additional file 1). As shown in the experimental results (Fig. 9 b), after turning on the magnetic field the dynamic behaviors of the microswimmer last less than 2  s (0 – 2 s). After that the microswimmer exhibits steady rotation and propulsion (2 – 29 s).|$|E
