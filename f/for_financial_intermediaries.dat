40|$|Pension funds {{require the}} {{managerial}} expertise of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> {{who must be}} paid a fee or spread. The spread significantly reduces {{the value of the}} pension fund over longer holding periods, and implies significantly greater incentive conflicts for defined contribution-funded pension funds than for defined benefit-funded pension funds. The magnitude of the intermediary spread and those factors affecting the demand <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> reputation and the marginal fee for this reputation are examined for a sample of 66 defined contribution and 54 defined benefit Australian pension funds during 1991 - 93. The intermediary spread significantly reduces the average net return provided to individual investors, particularly for defined contribution pension funds. Agency-related factors affecting the demand <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> reputation and its marginal fee reflect underlying contract-based differences between these types of fund.

40|$|A major {{lesson of}} the EMU crisis is that serious disequilibria result from {{regional}} monetary arrangements not designed to be robust {{to a variety of}} shocks. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess these disequilibria within the CEMAC, UEMOA and CFA zones. In the assessments, monetary policy targets inflation and financial dynamics of depth, efficiency, activity and size while real sector policy targets economic performance in terms of GDP growth. We also provide the speed of convergence and time required to achieve a 100 % convergence. But <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> size within the CFA zone, findings for the most part support only unconditional convergence. There is no form of convergence within the CEMAC zone. The broad insignificance of conditional convergence results have substantial policy implications. Monetary and real policies which are often homogenous for member states are thwarted by heterogeneous structural and institutional characteristics which give rise to different levels and patterns of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development. Therefore member states should work towards harmonizing cross-country differences in structural and institutional characteristics that hamper the effectiveness of monetary policies. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of the European Central Bank's expanded asset purchase programme (APP) on yields and on the macroeconomy, and sheds some light on its transmission channels. It shows, first, that the January 2015 announcement of the programme has significantly and persistently reduced sovereign yields on long-term bonds and raised the share prices of banks that held more sovereign bonds in their portfolios. This evidence is consistent with versions of the portfolio rebalancing channel acting through the removal of duration risk and the relaxation of leverage constraints <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> It then presents a stylised macroeconomic model that incorporates the aforementioned transmission channels. The model suggests that the macroeconomic impact of the programme can be expected to be sizable...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} data quality {{in the real estate}} market. In many countries, the returns indices for direct markets are provided by several sources differing in terms of the methodology adopted and index weights. These differences produce a lack of informative standardisation, which could negatively affect the ability of market participants to make predictions. By focusing on the Italian real estate market, the aim of the paper is therefore twofold: to investigate the reliability of property data sources and to assess the impact <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> involved in real estate investments. Our results show a significant level of divergence between the data, and considerable implications for those financial institutions dealing with them. These findings conflict with the requirements of an efficient (or at least sub-efficient) market...|$|E

This study evaluated the effect of financial reforms on the liquidity of the Nigerian stock market. Time series data spanning the period 1986 to 2010 which were sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) statistical bulletin was used. The empirical model was analyzed using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) technique and the impact of the financial reforms was determined using the Chow-Forecast Test of parameter stability and breaking point technique.

40|$|What is {{the main}} {{limitation}} of much modern macro-economic theory, among the failings pointed out by William R. White at the 2010 Mayekawa Lecture? We argue that the main deficiency is a failure to incorporate the possibility of default, including that of banks, into {{the core of the}} analysis. With default assumed away, there can be no role <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> for financial disturbances, or even for money. Models incorporating defaults are, however, harder to construct, in part because the representative agent fiction must be abandoned. Moreover, financial crises are hard to predict and to resolve. All of the previously available alternatives for handling failing systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) are problematical. We end by discussing a variety of current proposals for improving the resolution of failed SIFIs. Default, Transversality, Money, Bankruptcy cost, Asset bubbles, Resolution mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the macroeconomic consequences of future demographic trends for economic growth, financial markets and public finances. It {{shows that in}} the absence of reforms and responses by economic agents, the currently projected demographic trends imply a decline in average real GDP growth and a severe burden in terms of pay-as-you-go pension and health care systems. Population ageing will change the financial landscape, with a potentially larger role <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> and asset prices. All this points to a need to closely monitor demographic change also from a monetary policy perspective. While population projections are surrounded by considerable uncertainty and the effects of demographic change tend to be drawn out, the magnitude of the potential effects calls for an early recognition of this issue. This paper provides some input to the examination of possible policy issues. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} ‘systemic’ banking crises in New Zealand. While there {{are examples of}} individual institutional failures in New Zealand’s early colonial development for example, {{there are only two}} episodes that have involved a significant erosion of banking system capital – our definition of a systemic banking crisis. The first episode occurred in the late 1880 s and early 1890 s after a credit-fuelled rural land boom in the 1870 s, while the second occurred in the late 1980 s as a result of another credit-driven asset price boom and bust cycle following financial deregulation earlier in the decade. Both episodes can be understood within a framework that places at centre stage the propensity for economic agents to under-price risk, thereby creating balance sheet vulnerabilities <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> which can occasionally erupt into financial panic and crisis. ...|$|E
