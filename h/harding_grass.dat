5000|$|The third essay {{concerned}} {{different species}} of crops, and its publication increased the variety of crops grown in the challenging New England climate. Eliot stressed that not only grains and grasses could be grown, but fruits and vegetables as well.

30|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the patterns in moisture content found in the seven other species, the non-native <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> had much higher moisture content than all other species throughout the growing season. Even on its driest sampling date, the moisture content of <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> was still more than double a probable value for moisture of extinction. One caveat to our findings is that limited pilot sampling on 28 June 2013 confirmed that the new <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> location we moved to in July was more mesic than our original <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> location. Mean moisture content for <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> at our initial location was 239 % compared to 290 % at the location we moved to (a 18 % difference relative to the new location). <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> was also sampled from two other locations in the Bald Hills that had mean moisture contents of 201 % and 203 %, a 31 % and 30 % difference relative to our new <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> location, respectively. On 25 September 2012, however, the relative difference between six of the grass species and <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> ranged from 84 % to 95 % (relative to <b>Harding</b> <b>grass),</b> and the relative difference between <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> and California fescue was 58 % (relative to <b>Harding</b> <b>grass).</b> It is unlikely that sampling in the more mesic location would negate the general pattern we reported, as the magnitude of difference between <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> and the other species was so large. Additionally, at our sampling location, <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> culms were noticeably greener late into the fall compared to the other co-occurring species. Although the inferences we are able to make from a single study location are somewhat limited, the patterns that we observed are still noteworthy.|$|E
30|$|The high {{moisture}} content of <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> may {{have implications for}} prescribed fire. In the Bald Hills, known <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> infestations totaled approximately 33 ha in 2012, with infestation densities ranging from scattered individuals to dense monocultures (S. Samuels, personal communication). Depending on the density and extent of <b>Harding</b> <b>grass</b> infestations, combined with burn-day weather conditions of wind speed and relative humidity, as well as topographic position, this species may act to dampen fire intensity. Because of the other threats it poses to native species, park managers are currently trying to eradicate this species from the Bald Hills. The potential impediments that this species may pose to prescribed burning may serve as additional motivation for managers to eradicate this species from fire-dependent ecosystems.|$|E
