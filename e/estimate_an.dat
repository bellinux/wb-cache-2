5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{estimate of}} the temperature of outer space was by the Swiss physicist Charles É. Guillaume in 1896. Using the estimated radiation of the background stars, he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5–6K. British physicist Arthur Eddington made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3.18K in 1926. German physicist Erich Regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to <b>estimate</b> <b>an</b> intergalactic temperature of 2.8K in 1933.|$|E
500|$|The {{giant otter}} has lost {{as much as}} 80% of its South American range. While still present {{in a number of}} north-central countries, giant otter populations are under {{considerable}} stress. The IUCN lists Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela as current range countries. Given local extinctions, the species' range has become discontinuous. Total population numbers are difficult to <b>estimate.</b> <b>An</b> IUCN study in 2006 suggested 1,000 to 5,000 otters remain. Populations in Bolivia were once widespread but the country became a [...] "black spot" [...] on distribution maps after poaching between the 1940s and 1970s; a relatively healthy, but still small, population of 350 was estimated in the country in 2002. The species has likely been extirpated from southern Brazil, but in the west of the country, decreased hunting pressure in the critical Pantanal has led to very successful recolonization; an estimate suggests 1,000 or more animals in the region.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{being in}} an area with {{favorable}} conditions, lack of inner core organization proved difficult for rapid deepening to occur, and initially, model guidance did not forecast any significant strengthening. Contrary to expectations, satellite imagery showed a gradual increase in organization later that evening. Bands of convection deepened in the southern quadrant, indicating that the storm was steadily strengthening. Located just {{to the south of}} a large mid-level ridge over Mexico, the system was steered toward the west-northwest, proceeding within a favorable environment. Based on the improved appearance on satellite imagery, it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Odile at 0600 UTC on October 9 about 330mi (530km) southeast of Puerto Ángel, Mexico. Shortly after attaining tropical storm status, Odile began to develop a small area of central dense overcast, and upper-level cirrus outflow became well-defined within the western semicircle of the storm. Convective banding organized to the south and southwest of the circulation, leading Dvorak T-numbers to <b>estimate</b> <b>an</b> intensity of at least [...] Based on this estimate, the NHC noted a high chance of further intensification into a minimal hurricane. Odile maintained its intensity, as upper-level outflow of the circulation was reduced to the northeast. Although wind shear initially dislocated the circulation from the main convection, a large burst of convection allowed Odile to intensify slightly further to peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) at around 0600 UTC on October 10.|$|E

40|$|<b>Estimating</b> <b>a</b> {{constrained}} relation is {{a fundamental}} problem in machine learning. Special cases are classification (the problem of <b>estimating</b> <b>a</b> map from a set of to-be-classified elements {{to a set of}} labels), clustering (the problem of <b>estimating</b> <b>an</b> equivalence relation on a set) and ranking (the problem of <b>estimating</b> <b>a</b> linear order on a set). We contribute a family of probability measures on the set of all relations between two finite, non-empty sets, which offers a joint abstraction of multi-label classification, correlation clustering and ranking by linear ordering. <b>Estimating</b> (learning) <b>a</b> maximally probable measure, given (a training set of) related and unrelated pairs, is a convex optimization problem. <b>Estimating</b> (inferring) <b>a</b> maximally probable relation, given a measure, is a 01 -linear program. It is solved in linear time for maps. It is NP-hard for equivalence relations and linear orders. Practical solutions for all three cases are shown in experiments with real data. Finally, <b>estimating</b> <b>a</b> maximally probable measure and relation jointly is posed as a mixed-integer nonlinear program. This formulation suggests a mathematical programming approach to semi-supervised learning. ...|$|R

[...] If (as in nearly all practical statistical work) the population standard deviation of these errors is unknown and has to be estimated from the data, the t-distribution is often used to account for the extra uncertainty that results from this estimation. [...] In most such problems, if the standard deviation of the errors were known, a normal distribution would be used instead of the t-distribution.|$|E

2500|$|Many social {{scientists}} including economist Michael Zweig and sociologist Dennis Gilbert contend that middle class persons usually have above median incomes. As social classes lack clear boundaries and overlap {{there are no}} definite income thresholds as for what is considered middle class. In 2004, sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies a male making $57,000 and a female making $40,000 with a combined households income of $97,000 as a typical middle-class family. In 2005, sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey <b>estimate</b> <b>an</b> income range of roughly $35,000 to $75,000 for the lower middle class and $100,000 or more for the upper middle class.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} with President Vladimir Putin, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov stated that [...] "the power of the tests carried out was 5 to 15 kilotons", though this early {{estimate}} {{is much higher than}} any other international <b>estimate.</b> <b>An</b> early report by the Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources of South Korea said the blast was equivalent to an earthquake registering 3.58 on the Richter scale, which corresponds to the explosion of 100 tons of TNT. This was later revised to at least 800 tons, corresponding to a blast wave of 4.2. The U.S. Geological Survey also estimates the blast wave at 4.2. (Note that 4.2 is considerably more powerful than 3.58 because the Richter scale is a logarithmic scale.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Uncritical use of {{standardized}} test scores to evaluate teacher and school performance is inappropriate, because the students' scores are influenced by three things: what students learn in school, what students learn outside of school, and the students' innate intelligence. The school only has control over one of these three factors. Value-added modeling has been proposed {{to cope with this}} criticism by statistically controlling for innate ability and out-of-school contextual factors. In a value-added system of interpreting test scores, analysts <b>estimate</b> <b>an</b> expected score for each student, based on factors such as the student's own previous test scores, primary language, or socioeconomic status. [...] The difference between the student's expected score and actual score is presumed to be due primarily to the teacher's efforts.|$|E
