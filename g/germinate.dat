5|$|Many {{species of}} sundews are self-fertile; their flowers will often self-pollinate upon closing. Often, {{numerous}} seeds are produced. The tiny black seeds <b>germinate</b> {{in response to}} moisture and light, while seeds of temperate species also require cold, damp, stratification to <b>germinate.</b> Seeds of the tuberous species require a hot, dry summer period followed by a cool, moist winter to <b>germinate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds <b>germinate</b> almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can <b>germinate</b> in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E
5|$|Michigan State's {{campus was}} among the first to serve as a botanical {{laboratory}} for its faculty and students and is the site of what is, today, the oldest continuously operated botanical garden in the US. In December 1879, Professor William J. Beal buried seeds of 23 common plants in 20 jars of sand (to prevent water accumulation) in various locations around campus. At certain fixed intervals, currently every 20 years, a jar is dug up to determine which seeds still <b>germinate</b> after their prolonged periods of unlit isolation. The most recent jar exhumation, April 2000, found only a few specimens surviving to <b>germinate,</b> notably Verbascum blattaria (moth mullein), after 120 years. Five buried jars remain, with the next unearthing scheduled for 2020.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPaddy rice samples (Oryza sativa) were <b>germinated</b> {{to prepare}} <b>germinated</b> brown rice flours.

40|$|Abstract <b>Germinated</b> grains {{have been}} known as sources of Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that provide {{beneficial}} effects for human health. This study was aimed to investigate GABA production, dietary fiber, antioxidant activity, {{and the effect of}} cooking on GABA loss in <b>germinated</b> legumes and sesame. The highest GABA content was found in <b>germinated</b> mung bean, (0. 8068 g kg- 1, 24 h incubation) followed by <b>germinated</b> soybean, <b>germinated</b> black bean and soaked sesame. Beside GABA, dietary fiber content also increased in all grains during germination where the insoluble dietary fiber fractions were always found in higher proportions to soluble dietary fiber fractions. Our results also confirmed that <b>germinated</b> mung bean is a rich source of GABA and dietary fibers. Microwave cooking resulted in the smallest loss of GABA in mung bean and sesame, while steaming led to the least GABA content loss in soybean and black bean. Therefore microwave cooking and steaming are the most recommended cooking processes to preserve GABA in <b>germinated</b> legumes and sesame...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to determine changes in the chemical composition in lupin seeds during seed germination in a solution containing selected nitrogen compounds. Blue lupin seeds of the Neptun cultivar were <b>germinated</b> for 3 or 4 days in darkness, at 24 °C in 1 % solutions containing the following nitrogen compounds: urea, nitric acid, ammonium sulphate, methionine or yeast extract. The control consisted of seeds <b>germinated</b> in water. The presence of all nitrogen sources has resulted in a poorer growth of the sprouts as compared to seeds <b>germinated</b> in water. There was {{a significant increase in the}} true protein content as well as a significant decrease in the content of crude ash and alkaloids in the <b>germinated</b> seeds. The seeds <b>germinated</b> for 4 days had significantly higher total protein content and significantly lower content of nitrogen-free extract compounds and oligosaccharides as compared to the seeds <b>germinated</b> for 3 days. A significant influence of the nitrogen source on the concentration of some amino acids was found. Cystine was found to be absent in seeds <b>germinated</b> in the nitric acid solution, while there occurred a twofold increase in the cystine content and a fivefold increase in the methionine content in seeds <b>germinated</b> in the aqueous solution of methionine and an 50 % increase in the cystine concentration was observed in seeds <b>germinated</b> in the yeast extract and ammonium sulphate solution.
