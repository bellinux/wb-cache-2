A thin metallic membrane enclosing a vacuum chamber (a similar design is still used today in old-fashioned wall barometers) gradually deformed as ambient air pressure increased during descent.

50|$|Preliminary {{construction}} (roads, bridges, river diversion) on {{the project}} began in March 1990.

In November 1996, the reservoir was full. The project also includes the 16 km long Head Main Canal which connects to a designed network of 154 km of branch and lateral canals.
