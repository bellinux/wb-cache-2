2500|$|Moreover, Emanuele Ottolenghi {{said that}} Jews, such as Prof. Israel Shahak argues act as {{enablers}} for anti-Semites, because {{the rhetoric of}} anti-semitic Jews plays a [...] "crucial role... in excusing, condoning, and — in effect — abetting anti-Semitism." [...] In his opinion, [...] "Anti-Semites rely on Jews to confirm their prejudice: If Jews recur to such language, and advocate such policies, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>anyone</b> be accused of anti-Semitism, for making the same arguments?... The mechanism through which an anti-Semitic accusation becomes respectable once a Jew endorses it {{is not limited to}} Israel's new historians.... Israel Shahak made the comparison between Israel and Nazism respectable — all the while describing Judaism according to the medieval canons of the blood libel".|$|E

With a low thud the kneeler hits the floor and I kneel in prayer, concentrating on the blood-red flame of the candle. Christ is in this place, it whispers. Even the silence seems to listen as the answers to my prayers stream through the myriad-colored windows that drench me in richly stained light. I close my eyes, pray for guidance, and just think. God will not mind, and I smile to myself. Outside lies chaos and hatred, but in this place is peace and security.

We loved you equally, and could not bear the thought of losing either of you. We had two sons instead of one, that was all; and had one been proved to be ours, we should have lost the other. We intended to tell you in a short time how the matter stood, and that while one was our adopted son and the other our own, we neither knew nor cared which was which, loving you both equally and regarding you both as our own. Indeed we should never have told you about it, had it not been that as the story of the confusion at your birth was known to a great many men who were at that time in India, it was almost sure to come to your ears sooner or later.

I am one of the newer kind of men, one of those men who cannot sit and hug their credit and their honour and their possessions and be content. I have seen the light of better things than that, and because of my vision, because of my vision and for no other reason I am the most ridiculous of men. Always I have tried to go out from myself to the world and give. Those early books of mine, those meretricious books in which I pretended all was so well with the world,--I did them because I wanted to give happiness and contentment and to be happy in the giving. And all the watchers and the grippers, the strong silent men and the calculating possessors of things, the masters of the world, they grinned at me. How I lied to please!
