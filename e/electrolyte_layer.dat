A SOFC {{consists of a}} porous cathode, a gas tight oxygen ion conductive electrolyte, and a porous anode. The ionic conductivity of usually used yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte shows a strong dependency on layer thickness and cell operating temperature. Usually SOFCs operate in a temperature range of 900 to 1000 °C. The current development in SOFCs is focused on reducing the operating temperature below 800 °C. Reduction of cell temperature leads to decrease of ionic conductivity of electrolytes following Arrhenius law.

SOFCs with bulk ionic conductivity dominated thin-film electrolyte demonstrate superior electrochemical performances. Conventional materials for SOFCs are applied in this work: Ni-YSZ cermet as the anode, yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the electrolyte, gadolinia-doped ceria (CGO) as the Sr-diffusion barrier layer, and LSCF or LSC as the cathode. At 0. 7 V and 600 degrees C. single cells with an active LSCF and LSC cathode area of 4 x 4 cm(2) obtain a power density of 0. 7 and 1. 4 W cm(- 2), respectively.

A pseudo-steady state is considered wherein the oxygen diffusion is at steady state while the metal and hydroxyl ions keep accumulating in the thin <b>electrolyte</b> <b>layer</b> due to a decoupling arising from the assumed Tafel laws for corrosion kinetics.

The electrolyte was prepared using analytical reagent Pb(NO 3) 2, TeO 2 (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA), and Millipore water (Millipore Co., Billerica, MA, USA). The ion concentrations of Pb 2 + and HTeO 2 + in the electrolyte were 0.005 and 0.001 M, respectively. The pH value of the electrolyte was adjusted to 1.87 by nitric acid. The treated silicon substrate (20 × 20 mm 2) (Fluka) was first placed on the Peltier element. Silicon was treated using chemical erosion and oxidation process, which would bring an insulation and uniform thickness of the SiO 2 layer {{on the surface of the}} silicon wafer. Next, the two parallel lead foil electrodes with 30 -μm thickness (Fluka) were placed on the substrate and filled with the electrolyte. A cover glass was put on the electrodes, and the simple electrolytic cell was assembled.

Such a system gives rise to a situation where the overall EDL electrostatic potential in the system is dictated by the competitive influences of the boundary-induced effects and the effects induced by the jump in the ion-solvent interaction potential at the liquid-liquid interfaces.

All constrained sintering measurements were performed in a dilatometer. Sintering properties, microstructure, and conductivity of sprayed and sintered YSZ <b>electrolyte</b> <b>layers</b> were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 4 -point dc method, and mercury intrusion porosimetry and image analysis. By comparison of nanostructured and conventional YSZ layers, differences in the sintering rate were determined. Lower thermal expansion rate of nanostructured compared to conventional plasma sprayed YSZ during heating above 900 °C was measured, indicating initiation of densification at lower temperature compared to conventional YSZ. A higher shrinkage rate of the nanostructured YSZ layer strongly suggests that observed differences in sintering rates are due to different particle sizes of the powder feedstock. Experimental shrinkage rates were assigned to different mass transfer effects according to the sintering model of Coble. Changes of the microstructural characteristics were identified using SEM. According to the constraint from the substrate, the nanostructured YSZ sample constrained sintered at 1000 °C has achieved a lower thickness compared to the free-standing sample sintered at 1520 °C. Comparing the values of both YSZ electrolytes sintered at 1325 °C to the ones of the as-sprayed layers, a faster sintering process of the nanostructured YSZ can be supposed. The lamellar microstructure in the as-sprayed samples was found to significantly reduce the electrical conductivity of the YSZ electrolytes, measured by 4 -point dc method.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a conductive textile and its making method. The conductive textile comprises a textile substrate, an <b>electrolyte</b> adhesion <b>layer</b> formed on the textile substrate through in-situ polymerization, and a metal coat formed on the <b>electrolyte</b> adhesion <b>layer</b> through chemical plating. According to the invention, the {{modification of the}} <b>electrolyte</b> adhesion <b>layer</b> prepared between a conductive group and the textile substrate through the in-situ free radical polymerization substantially improves the adhesion of the conductive group to the textile substrate, so an electrical element made through using the conductive textile is more reliable, tough and durable during rubbing, stretching and washing; and the process for the polyelectrolyte preparation through the in-situ free radical polymerization is carried out under a mild condition, and the high chemical conversion rate of a monomer to a polymer reduces {{the cost of the}} conductive textile, so the large-scale production of the conductive textile can be easily carried out. 本发明涉及一种导电纺织品及其制作方法，该导电纺织品包括：纺织品基底；通过原位聚合方法在纺织品基底上形成的电解质粘结层；通过化学镀在所述电解质粘结层上形成的金属涂层。本发明通过使用原位自由基聚合方法在导电基团和纺织基底之间制备电解质粘结层，该电解质粘结层的修饰大大提高了导电基团到纺织基底之间的附着力，这使得如此制得的电气元件在经受搓揉、拉伸和洗涤时更加可靠、强韧和耐用；且原位自由基聚合方法制备聚电解质的过程是在温和的条件下进行的，从单体到聚合物的原位自由基聚合的较高化学转化率，降低了本发明的成本，同时使得本发明易于进行大规模生产。Institute of Textiles and ClothingInventor name used in this publication: 郑子剑Inventor name used in this publication: 胡红Inventor name used in this publication: 王晓龙Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種導電紡織品及其製作方法Chin...|$|R
40|$|The high {{sintering}} temperature of Yttrium doped barium zirconate (BZY), {{the most promising}} high temperature proton conductor (HTPC) for Intermediate Temperature (400 - 750 °C) Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFCs), has been reduced by using ZnO as a sintering aid. Obtaining a dense electrolyte at a reduced temperature allows conventional fuel cell preparation methods. A reproducible spin coating method to fabricate highly performing anode supported button cells with dense micrometric BZYZn <b>electrolyte</b> <b>layers</b> has been developed. The electrochemical characterization of button cells at 600 °C shows promising performance, {{higher than that of}} comparable fuel cells from literature. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.
