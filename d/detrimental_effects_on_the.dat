5|$|The {{environmental}} {{movement in the}} American Southwest has opposed the damming and diversion of the Colorado River system because of <b>detrimental</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ecology and natural beauty {{of the river and}} its tributaries. During the construction of Glen Canyon Dam, environmental organizations vowed to block any further development of the river, and a number of later dam and aqueduct proposals were defeated by citizen opposition. As demands for Colorado River water continue to rise, the level of human development and control of the river continues to generate controversy.|$|E
5|$|Since Madagascar gained {{independence}} from France in 1960, the island's political transitions have {{been marked by}} numerous popular protests, several disputed elections, an impeachment, two military coups and one assassination. The island's recurrent political crises are often prolonged, with <b>detrimental</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> local economy, international relations and Malagasy living standards. The eight-month standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana following the 2001 presidential elections cost Madagascar {{millions of dollars in}} lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure, such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson. A series of protests led by Andry Rajoelina against Ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent, with more than 170 people killed. Modern politics in Madagascar are colored by the history of Merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century. The consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence.|$|E

25|$|In {{a survey}} of five European {{countries}} (Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, Italy, and France), a 1995 survey noted that only Sweden provided access to translators for 100% of those who needed it, while the other countries lacked this service potentially compromising healthcare to non-native populations. Given that non-natives composed a considerable section of these nations (6%, 17%, 3%, 1%, and 6% respectively), this could have significant <b>detrimental</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> health equity of the nation. In France, an older study noted significant differences in access to healthcare between native French populations, and non-French/migrant populations based upon health expenditure; however this was not fully independent of poorer economic and working conditions experienced by these populations.|$|E
25|$|The Akha have {{traditionally}} employed slash and burn agriculture, in which new fields are cleared by burning or cutting down forests and woodlands. In such a system, {{there is usually}} no market for land. Rights to land are considered traditional and established over many generations. This type of agriculture {{has contributed to the}} Akha's semi-nomadic status as villages move to clear new farmland with each successive burn cycle. The Thai government has forbidden this practice, citing its <b>detrimental</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environment. The Akha have adapted to new types of subsistence farming, but the quality of their land has suffered as they are no longer allowed to expand onto new plots. In many cases, chemical fertilizers are the only option for re-fertilizing the land.|$|E
25|$|After the season, {{majority}} owner Pollin fired Jordan as team president, much to {{the shock}} of players, associates, and the public. Jordan felt betrayed, thinking {{that he would get}} his ownership back after his playing days ended, but Pollin justified Jordan's dismissal by noting that Jordan had <b>detrimental</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team, such as benching Hughes for Tyronn Lue, making poor trades, and using the team's 2001 1st round draft pick on high schooler Kwame Brown. Without Jordan in the fold the following year, the Washington Wizards were not expected to win, and they did not. Despite the signing of future All-Star point guard Gilbert Arenas, in a move that was ironically made possible by Jordan's prior cap-clearing maneuvers as a team executive, the team stumbled to a 25–57 record in the 2003–04 season.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1950s and through the 1960s, Congress reacted to {{increasing}} public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment. Senator James E. Murray introduced a bill, the Resources and Conservation Act of 1959, in the 86th Congress. The 1962 publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson alerted {{the public about the}} <b>detrimental</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environment of the indiscriminate use of pesticides. In the years following, similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and Congress's potential responses. In 1968, a joint House-Senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Senator Henry M. Jackson, and the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Representative George Miller, to discuss the need for and means of implementing a national environmental policy. In the colloquium, some members of Congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment.|$|E
500|$|Carson's main {{argument}} is that pesticides have <b>detrimental</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environment; they are more properly termed biocides, she argues, because their effects are rarely limited to the target pests.

Carson also accuses the chemical industry of intentionally spreading disinformation and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically. Most {{of the book is}} devoted to pesticides' effects on natural ecosystems, but four chapters also detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides.

2500|$|As {{it becomes}} {{increasingly}} difficult to remain self-sufficient through agriculture, and as roads open up the villages to the cities, the Akha must contend with the sometimes corrosive effects of the tourist industry. Not all Akha are happy to let tourists come in and observe village life. The Akha are often the objects of ecotourism which purports to open up remote spaces and people to Western tourists to expand {{their knowledge of the}} plight of the people and their perilous situation, and thus, expand their involvement in the fight to maintain their environment and way of life. It is pitched as [...] "responsible tourism". There are many critiques of ecotourism as exploitative and a highly consumer-centered and contradictory activity including <b>detrimental</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environment from the amount of jet engine fuel burned on the flight there and back, the additional amenities that must be built to cater to Western expectations, the pollution and garbage associated with a Western lifestyle, the disturbance of flora and fauna and a bevy of other concerns expressed by environmentalist voices.|$|E
2500|$|Intrauterine hypoxia is a {{condition}} or state caused by insufficient oxygen levels reaching a fetus during gestation, having <b>detrimental</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> development of its central nervous system (CNS). [...] In many cases, intrauterine hypoxia results {{in the death of}} the fetus. [...] Commonly known, the CNS is vital to the communication and response transmissions between the brain and all of the body parts within an organism. [...] Due to dysfunction in this system such things as cognitive functioning and attention capacity are impeded, resulting in a poor ability to decode or encode information and form memories. It has also been discovered that lower levels of oxygen reaching the developing fetus may, in fact, decrease the amount of grey matter produced within its brain and increase the amount of sulcal (referring to a sulcus: a fissure within the surface of the brain) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); importantly in the frontal lobe and temporal lobe, which are critical memory centers. The later point regarding sulcal CSF has been linked to schizophrenia (a mental disorder affecting thought processes). Grey matter is a large component of the CNS and is related to: muscle control, sensory perceptions, memory, emotions and speech; please follow this link for more information regarding the different brain structures and their effects on human function.|$|E
