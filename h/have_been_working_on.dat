A week later the band posted that they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> a full-length album for the last two-and-a-half years. The band's new album, Havens Dumb, was released on 3 October 2014.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the disappearances, Gui Minhai was rumoured to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> a book {{regarding}} current CPC general secretary Xi Jinping's personal history, tentatively named Xi and His Six Women (習近平和他的六個女人). The project was suggested to be linked to the disappearances. The publishing house had also already gone to press with a book entitled 2017: Upheaval in China, but it was withdrawn by the author before publication.|$|E
5|$|The non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised {{explanatory}} treatise {{may have}} been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the seconda pratica was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit the issue. On the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the seconda practica, in a treatise entitled Melodia; he may still <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> this {{at the time of his}} death ten years later.|$|E

The proposed aim of the e-military is to secure the vital infrastructure and e-infrastructure of Estonia. The main cyber warfare facility is the Computer Emergency Response Team of Estonia (CERT), founded in 2006. The organisation operates on security issues in local networks.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, Morphy went to Europe to play Staunton {{and other}} chess greats. Morphy made {{numerous}} attempts at {{setting up a}} match with Staunton, but none ever came through. Staunton was later criticised for avoiding a match with Morphy, although his peak as a player {{had been in the}} 1840s and he was considered past his prime by the late 1850s. Staunton is known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> his edition of the complete works of Shakespeare at the time, but he also competed in a chess tournament during Morphy's visit. Staunton later blamed Morphy for the failure to have a match, suggesting among other things that Morphy lacked the funds required for match stakes—a most unlikely charge given Morphy's popularity. Morphy also remained resolutely opposed to playing chess for money, reportedly due to family pressure, although the Creole culture he was from did not have any stigma against gambling.|$|E

500|$|A {{description}} {{in the book}} cover flap reads, [...] "In this tender, sensitive and blackly comic novel, Sebastian Shaw, the distinguished Shakespearean actor, explores areas of sexual and emotional encounter that are rarely seen and, unfortunately, too rarely understood." [...] Shaw originally planned to call the novel The Godfather, but later said he was glad he did not due to the popularity of Mario Puzo's book of that name. He was said to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> another novel shortly after The Christening was completed, but no others were ever published.|$|E
500|$|In May 2016, {{the band}} {{launched}} a countdown website, prophetsofrage.com, with a clock counting down to June 1. Accompanying the clock was {{an image of}} a broken slash through a circle with silhouettes of five people all extending their arms and clenched fists with the hashtag [...] "#takethepowerback" [...] underneath the timer. This led to speculation of the return of the band later in the year. However, a source close to Rage Against the Machine told Rolling Stone that the Prophets of Rage website had nothing do with the announcement of a [...] "Rage-specific reunion", but added that [...] "some of the members" [...] of the band <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> a project that will include live shows.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{began work}} on her third studio album Speak Now two years prior to its release in 2010. [...] "Sparks Fly" [...] was written by Swift when she was sixteen years old, prior the release of her eponymous album in 2006. She {{performed}} the song live during several bar shows [...] "of forty and fifty people". A recorded live performance of the song during one of her concerts made its way onto the internet in 2007. The song became a favorite among Swift's fans, leading Swift to rework the song and include it on Speak Now after having so many requested {{for it to be}} included on the album. Of the song, Swift said that: [...] "This is a song I wrote {{a few years ago and}} I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> it ever since. It's been awesome to see it change over the years. The fans have heard it before in concert, but there have been some really cool changes that I am very proud of and can't wait for them to hear." ...|$|E

500|$|When Ryu reaches Castle Rock fortress, he {{encounters}} {{the stranger}} {{whom he met}} after his trip to the laboratory, who reveals his name as Clancy. He tells Ryu about a project he and Foster <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> called the [...] "Biohazard plan". Clancy says that {{he can no longer}} work with Foster. He said Foster was designing creatures called [...] "bio-noids"– transformed superhumans that are infused with [...] "life energy" [...] that flows from an interdimensional rift that appeared after the demon from the first Ninja Gaiden game was defeated. He explained that this rift appeared {{at the site of the}} Castle Rock ruins, in which Foster rebuilt in order to harness this power. Clancy reveals that it was a bio-noid that killed Irene, and that Foster controls the bio-noids; he pleas to Ryu to stop Foster. After making his way into the fortress, he encounters Foster and the look-alike. Foster vows to eliminate Ryu and use the life energy from the rift and Ryu's secrets of the Dragon Clan to make him into an all-powerful bio-noid. Just as Foster and the look-alike advance on Ryu, Irene appears, to the amazement of both Ryu and Foster, and is armed with a machine gun; she was working with the army with regards to Foster's plan. The look-alike then transmutes into a bio-noid, which Ryu defeats.|$|E
500|$|Sora {{was planned}} as an {{artificial}} intelligence from the start, but because Uchikoshi thought robots seemed cliche, and holograms {{could not move}} around to different places, {{he came up with}} the idea of her being an image shot onto people's eyes with a laser; thinking that if a layman like himself could come up with the idea of such technology, an expert in the field could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> developing it already, so he researched it and found out about retinal scanning display technology, and made use of it in the game's story. The full names of both the original You and her clone were taken from a name dictionary, and were initially challenged by KID's marketing team, who thought they sounded [...] "lame"; they relented after Nakazawa explained that the names had a meaning and could not be changed. Because Uchikoshi liked the film Interview with the Vampire, he conceived Tsugumi as being a vampire; the staff did not like this idea, so it was scrapped, but the concept of her being immortal was kept, which led to the introduction of the Curé Virus in the story, as Uchikoshi considered the spreading of vampirism similar to a virus. Another remnant of the vampire concept was kept in Sara, who has infrared vision and can see in the dark. Sara was noted by Uchikoshi as being the otherwise single [...] "normal" [...] person in the cast, offsetting the balance; because of this, she was made into the Kid's twin sister.|$|E
