25|$|Every {{person with}} a Swedish {{national}} identification number must register a valid address, even if living abroad, since sent letters are considered to have been delivered to that person once they reach the registered address. As an example, Swedish astronaut Christer Fuglesang got a Betalningsanmärkning since a car he had ordered, and therefore owned, passed a toll station for the Stockholm congestion tax. At the time, {{he was living in}} the USA training for his first Space Shuttle mission and <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> invalid address registered for the car. Letters with payment requests did not reach him on time. The case was appealed and retracted, but the non-payment record remained for three years since it could not be retracted according to the law.|$|E

25|$|Injuries {{affected}} {{the selection of}} the two sides for the final Test. Mike Hendrick was still suffering from his hamstring, Bob Willis from his troubled knees, so Peter Lever was brought in for Willis and Chris Old's good form was finally rewarded with a Test place instead of the veteran Fred Titmus. David Lloyd <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> football injury to his neck flare up and Colin Cowdrey took his place as makeshift opener. John Edrich had now recovered from his broken ribs and was recalled to the team in place rather than the out of form Brian Luckhurst. Jeff Thomson was out with his tennis shoulder and Australia brought in Geoff Dymock, a fast-medium left-arm bowler who had taken a wicket with his second ball the previous year at Adelaide. After top-scoring at Sydney the leg-spinner Terry Jenner was dropped for the return of batsman Ross Edwards. Despite the hot weather a thunderstorm wetted the covers before the match and the groundsmen spilled water on the wicket when removing them in the morning, which would drastically affect play. Ian Chappell won the toss for the fifth time in the series and chosen to bat, probably as he underestimated the amount of water on the wicket which was otherwise excellent for batting.|$|E
500|$|In June, Major General René Cogny, the {{commander}} of the Tonkin Delta, proposed Điện Biên Phủ, which <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> airstrip built by the Japanese during World War II, as a [...] "mooring point". In another misunderstanding, Cogny envisioned a lightly defended point from which to launch raids; however, Navarre believed that he intended a heavily fortified base capable of withstanding a siege. Navarre selected Điện Biên Phủ for the location of Berteil's [...] "hedgehog" [...] operation. When presented with the plan, every major subordinate officer protested: Colonel Jean-Louis Nicot (commander of the French Air transport fleet), Cogny, and generals Jean Gilles and Jean Dechaux (the ground and air commanders for Operation Castor, the initial airborne assault on Điện Biên Phủ). Cogny pointed out, presciently, that [...] "we are running the risk of a new Nà Sản under worse conditions". Navarre rejected the criticisms of his proposal and concluded a November 17 conference by declaring that the operation would begin three days later, on 20 November 1953.|$|E
500|$|Although Churchill's, {{described}} by Lewington as [...] "the worst club {{that has ever}} been in Reading", tolerated such behaviour, the town's fashionable Sindlesham Mill nightclub did not, regularly barring Friday for his bizarre activities, including a dance he invented called [...] "the elephant" [...] which consisted of turning {{the pockets of his}} jeans inside out and undoing his flies to expose himself. He and his friends would regularly drink all day, though he was able to exert some self-control; according to his friend Syd Simmonds, Friday would obey Hurley's instruction not to drink for 48 hours before each game. However, he would play his prized heavy metal records very loudly at any time of the day or night and take LSD with casual indifference. Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club's elderly ex-groundsman, but to no avail: [...] "Even if it was three in the morning, the first thing would be to get the music playing", Simmonds later said. [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> boy living below us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a dog's life in the flat. Pounding music, people knocking on the door, girls throwing stones at the windows. Poor old sod." ...|$|E

500|$|Coon {{proposed}} that Erickson {{should be a}} rival to Kirk, a genetic superman who had once ruled part of Earth. Roddenberry and Justman were still unhappy with the script, and Roddenberry revised it once more a week before filming was due to begin, after Montalbán had been cast. In this draft the blond Nordic character of Erickson became closer to the version seen on screen. In Roddenberry and Coon's script, the character was renamed Sibahl Khan Noonien. The name Govin Bahadur Singh was suggested by the DeForest Research company, who checked scripts for potential errors {{on behalf of the}} production company; the Singh name was suggested in part because it was closer to actual Sikh names. Coon and Roddenberry settled on Khan Noonien Singh; Roddenberry <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> Chinese friend named Noonien Wang that he had lost touch with, and hoped that Wang would see the episode and contact him. In the final draft, Roddenberry listed himself as the primary writer, Coon as co-writer and Wilber was absent, but the Writers Guild of America turned down Roddenberry's request to be credited; Coon received the main credit; Wilber was given co-writer and [...] "story-by" [...] credits. Wilber did not often watch his own work, and nearly thirty years later had never seen [...] "Space Seed". Coon was later credited as Lee Cronin for his part in production of the script.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell and Webb's {{next project}} came in 2003, with {{starring}} {{roles in the}} Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show, as flatmates Mark Corrigan and Jeremy Usbourne respectively. The show originated from writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain's failed attempt to complete a team-written sitcom for the BBC; they <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> script {{that they wanted to}} revive and Mitchell and Webb helped out, with it eventually evolving into Peep Show. Despite low viewing figures (which almost got the show cancelled after series three) the show was received to wide critical acclaim. The British Sitcom Guide called it [...] "without a doubt one of the best sitcoms of the decade." [...] Ricky Gervais has been cited as saying [...] "the last thing I got genuinely excited about on British TV was Peep Show, which I thought was the best sitcom since Father Ted". The BBC hailed Mitchell's performance in the series, citing that [...] "As Mark Corrigan, David reached out to all those middle-aged men in a twentysomething's body, who believe drugs are boring and systems are necessary if society is to function at all." [...] Mitchell has stated that he empathises with Mark and enjoys playing him and that he [...] "agrees with many of [...] opinions." [...] Peep Show has aired nine series, making it the longest-running sitcom in Channel 4 history.|$|E

Điện Biên Phủ had a number of advantages: it was on a Viet Minh supply route into Laos on the Nam Yum River, it <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> airstrip for supply, and it was situated in the Tai hills where the Tai tribesmen, still loyal to the French, operated.|$|E

2500|$|Henry {{lost the}} woman {{reputed to be}} his great love, Rosamund Clifford, in 1176. He had met her in 1166 and had began his liaison in 1173, {{supposedly}} contemplating divorce from Eleanor.

[...] The king had many mistresses, but although he treated earlier liaisons discreetly, he flaunted Rosamund. He may have done so to provoke Eleanor into seeking an annulment, but if so, the queen disappointed him. Nevertheless, rumours persisted, perhaps assisted by Henry's camp, that Eleanor had poisoned Rosamund. It is also speculated that Eleanor placed Rosamund in a bathtub and <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> woman cut Rosamund's arms.
