25|$|For any integer n, n ≡ 1 (mod 2) iff (3n+1)/2≡2(mod3). Equivalently, (2n−1)/3≡1(mod2) iff n≡2(mod3). Conjecturally, this <b>inverse</b> <b>relation</b> forms a tree {{except for}} a 1–2 loop (the inverse of the 1–2 loop of the {{function}} f(n) revised as indicated above).|$|E
25|$|As the {{curvature}} increases, the amplitude {{of the wave}} alternates between positive and negative more rapidly, and also shortens the wavelength. So the <b>inverse</b> <b>relation</b> between momentum and wavelength {{is consistent with the}} energy the particle has, and so the energy of the particle has a connection to a wave, all in the same mathematical formulation.|$|E

25|$|So, {{instead of}} proving that all {{positive}} integers {{eventually lead to}} 1, {{we can try to}} prove that 1 leads to all positive integers. For any integer n, n ≡ 1 (mod 2) iff 3n+1≡4(mod6). Equivalently, (n−1)/3≡1(mod2) iff n≡4(mod6). Conjecturally, this <b>inverse</b> <b>relation</b> forms a tree except for the 1–2–4 loop (the inverse of the 1–4–2 loop of the unaltered function f defined in the Statement of the problem section of this article).|$|E
25|$|The <b>inverse</b> <b>relation</b> in Western {{cultures}} between {{alcohol consumption}} and cardiovascular disease {{has been known}} for over 100 years. Many physicians do not promote alcohol consumption, however, given the many health concerns associated with it, some suggest that alcohol should be regarded as a recreational drug, and promote exercise and good nutrition to combat cardiovascular disease. Others have argued that the benefits of moderate alcohol consumption may be outweighed by other increased risks, including those of injuries, violence, fetal damage, liver disease, and certain forms of cancer.|$|E

25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae {{was long}} {{believed}} to be non-pathogenic to humans. However, an increasing incidence of S.dysgalactiae infections has been documented, and in some geographic regions, the rate of invasive infection has even surpassed that of Streptococcus pyogenes. The age distribution of invasive cases among humans is clearly skewed towards the elderly, whereas the healthy carrier state appears to have the <b>inverse</b> <b>relation</b> to age. People with chronic maladies, including cancer and diabetes, are also especially susceptible to infection. These opportunistic traits have been proposed {{as one of the}} mechanisms underlying the observed increasing frequency of invasive disease. Furthermore, a male predominance has been noted, presumably due to a higher burden of comorbidity. The incidence of non-invasive disease in human {{does not appear to be}} increasing.|$|E
25|$|Aggressiveness also {{arises from}} a need of space. Young pike {{tend to have}} their food robbed by larger pike. Pike are {{aggressive}} if not given enough space because they are territorial. They use a form of foraging known as sit-and-wait. Unlike species such as perch, pike undergo bursts of energy instead of actively chasing down prey. As such, {{a fair amount of}} inactive time occurs until they find prey. Hunting efficiency decreases with competition; the larger the pike, the larger the area controlled by that particular pike. An <b>inverse</b> <b>relation</b> to vegetation density and pike size exists, which is due to the possibility of cannibalism from the largest pike. This makes sense, as the smaller pike need more vegetation to avoid being eaten. Large pike do not have this worry and can afford the luxury of a large line of sight. They prefer a tree structure habitat.|$|E
500|$|Young {{suggests}} that the cantatas The May Queen and The Woman of Samaria enjoyed in their hey-day [...] "a popularity that was in <b>inverse</b> <b>relation</b> to their intrinsic merit". Caldwell notes that The Woman of Samaria shows that [...] "Bennett was a good craftsman whose only fault was a dread of the operatic... One would probably tolerate the narrative recitative more readily if the inserted movements showed any spark of life." [...] As regards The May Queen, Caldwell praises the overture (a Mendelssohn-style work originally written as a concert piece in 1844) [...] "but {{the rest of the}} work is tame stuff". He comments that [...] "both works received immense longstanding popularity and may be considered as the narrative prototype for the later Victorian secular and sacred forms... conforming to the current standards of taste and respectability", anticipating such works as Arthur Sullivan's Kenilworth (1864).|$|E
