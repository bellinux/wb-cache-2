5|$|The 18th century saw {{major changes}} in Newfoundland: {{population}} growth, beginnings of government, establishment of churches, reinforcement of commercial ties with North America {{and development of the}} seal, salmon and Grand Banks fisheries. St. John's population grew slowly. Although it was primarily a fishing station, it was also a garrison, a centre of <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> commercial hub. St. John's served as a naval base during the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|The {{complaint}} to Turkey had a desired effect locally, with an apology from the country's <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> commitment to breaking diplomatic ties to Germany if required. However, {{it failed to}} elicit a response from Germany. The Allies' request to the Spanish government was relayed to the Germans, but identified almost immediately as deception and misdirection.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw {{sustained}} pro-democracy protests, centered at Pearl Roundabout in {{the capital}} of Manama, as part of the wider Arab Spring. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later known as Bloody Thursday), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured. Protests continued for a month reaching over 100,000 participants in a nation of about 500,000 citizens, until more than a thousand troops and police from the Gulf Cooperation Council arrived at the request of <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> three-month state of emergency was declared. Authorities then cracked down on the protests. However, smaller-scale protests and clashes continued to occur almost daily, mostly in areas outside Manama's business districts, with some rare marches {{in the center of the}} capital city. As of April 2012, more than 80 people had died since the start of the uprising and as of January 2013, near-daily clashes between protesters and police are ongoing.|$|E

5|$|Bids for {{construction}} were forwarded to the Australian Government by Reid on 7 March 1910, and Prime Minister Alfred Deakin approved the submission by John Brown & Company {{to construct the}} hull and machinery, with separate contracts awarded to Armstrong and Vickers for the battlecruiser's armament. The total cost of construction was set at £2million. Contracts were signed between the Admiralty and the builders to avoid the problems of distant supervision by the Australian <b>Government,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> close watch on proceedings was maintained by Reid and Captain Francis Haworth-Booth, the Australian Naval Representative in London.|$|E
5|$|Carpender was {{replaced}} by Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid on 26 November 1943. For his services in the Southwest Pacific, {{he was awarded the}} Army Distinguished Service Medal by MacArthur, and the Legion of Merit by the Navy. He was also appointed an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire on the recommendation of the Australian <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Grand Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau by the Netherlands. He returned to the United States, where he commanded the Ninth Naval District from 3 January 1944 until 31 August 1945, for which he was awarded a second Legion of Merit.|$|E
5|$|Demonstrations {{occurred}} at Spain's embassy and consulates in France. The Spanish embassy in Brussels was fire-bombed. A day of national demonstration was organised by the Dutch <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> protest in Utrecht {{was led by}} Prime Minister Joop den Uyl. In Britain, the governing Labour Party passed a resolution condemning the executions. Poland and Hungary withdrew their commercial representatives in Spain, and 15 European countries (West Germany, East Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Portugal, Austria, Sweden, Ireland, Luxembourg and Italy) withdrew their ambassadors to Spain in protest. In response, Spain withdrew its ambassadors from Norway, East Germany, The Vatican, West Germany and The Netherlands for consultations, with its ambassador to Portugal unconditionally withdrawn in protest at the embassy attack. Spain's central bank also suspended trade in the Portuguese escudo.|$|E

5|$|Historian Ron Chernow is of {{the opinion}} that his frustrations in dealing with {{government}} officials during this conflict led him to advocate the advantages of a strong national <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> vigorous executive agency that could get results; other historians tend to ascribe Washington's position on government to his later American Revolutionary War service. He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia, who seemed too unreliable, too undisciplined, and too short-term compared to regulars. On the other hand, his experience was limited to command of at most 1,000 men and came only in remote frontier conditions that were far removed from the urban situations that he faced during the Revolution at Boston, New York, Trenton, and Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, Ippolito Rosellini, who {{had first}} met Champollion during his 1826 stay in Florence, went to Paris {{for a year}} {{in order to improve}} his {{knowledge}} of the method of Champollion's system of decipherment. The two philologists decided to organize an expedition to Egypt to confirm the validity of the discovery. Headed by Champollion and assisted by Rosellini, his first disciple and great friend, the mission was known as the Franco-Tuscan Expedition, and was made possible by the support of the grand-duke of Tuscany, Leopold II, and the King of France, Charles X. Champollion and his second-in-command Rossellini were joined on the expedition by Charles Lenormant, representing the French <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> team of eleven Frenchmen including the egyptologist and artist Nestor L'Hote and Italians including the artist Giuseppe Angelelli.|$|E
5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E

5|$|Manila, {{being the}} seat of {{political}} power of the Philippines, has several national government offices headquartered at the city. Planning for the development for being the center of government started {{during the early years}} of American colonization when they envisioned a well-designed city outside the walls of Intramuros. The strategic location chosen was Bagumbayan, a former town which is now the Rizal Park to become the center of <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> design commission was given to Daniel Burnham to create a master plan for the city patterned after Washington, D.C. These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of Manuel L. Quezon.|$|E
5|$|New {{industry}} {{came from}} iron ore, {{discovered in the}} north, mined relatively easily from open pits, and shipped to Great Lakes steel mills from the ports at Duluth and Two Harbors. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> population shift from rural areas to cities. The Great Depression brought layoffs in mining and tension in labor relations but New Deal programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early computer companies Sperry Rand, Control Data and Cray. The Twin Cities also became a regional center for the arts with cultural {{institutions such as the}} Guthrie Theater, Minnesota Orchestra, and the Walker Art Center.|$|E
5|$|Senator Powell favored Kentucky's {{neutrality}} policy {{during the}} Civil War, but nationally, the conflict {{put him in}} a tenuous political situation. On one hand, he favored a strong national <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states that refused to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E

5|$|The A1 was a showpiece {{project of}} the Croatian <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> symbol of uniting the country. The first attempt to revive the project in earnest {{occurred}} in the 1993, when the excavation of Sveti Rok Tunnel began. More comprehensive construction work started in 2000 and Karlovac–Vukova Gorica section opened in 2001. In 2003, the first sections not shared with the Zagreb–Rijeka Motorway were completed: Vukova Gorica–Mala Kapela Tunnel and Gornja Ploča–Zadar2. Mala Kapela Tunnel–Gornja Ploča, Zadar2–Pirovac and Vrpolje–Dugopolje sections opened in 2004 and Mala Kapela Tunnel itself and Pirovac–Vrpolje section opened in 2005 marking completion of the Zagreb–Split Motorway, culminating with the grand opening of Karlovac— Split section on 26 June 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution prohibits {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures. It requires governmental searches and seizures {{to be conducted}} only upon issuance of a warrant, judicially sanctioned by probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing {{the place to be}} searched and the persons or things to be seized. It is part of the Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the British <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789. By December 15, 1791, the necessary three-fourths of the states had ratified it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment.|$|E
5|$|The Wallachian Revolution of 1848 was a Romanian {{liberal and}} {{nationalist}} uprising in the Principality of Wallachia. Part of the Revolutions of 1848, and closely {{connected with the}} unsuccessful revolt in the Principality of Moldavia, it sought to overturn the administration imposed by Imperial Russian authorities under the Regulamentul Organic regime, and, through many of its leaders, demanded the abolition of boyar privilege. Led {{by a group of}} young intellectuals and officers in the Wallachian Militia, the movement succeeded in toppling the ruling Prince Gheorghe Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional <b>Government</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Regency, and in passing a series of major progressive reforms, first announced in the Proclamation of Islaz.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} Scotland {{developed}} slowly {{in this period}} and a population of perhaps a little under a million {{by the middle of}} the 14th century began to decline after the arrival of the Black Death, falling to perhaps half a million by the beginning of the 16th century. Different social systems and cultures developed in the lowland and highland regions of the country as Gaelic remained the most common language north of the Tay and Middle Scots dominated in the south, where it became the language of the ruling elite, <b>government</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> new national literature. There were significant changes in religion which saw mendicant friars and new devotions expand, particularly in the developing burghs.|$|E
5|$|The largely free {{elections}} of 1950 were {{won by the}} popular Árbenz, and represented the first transfer of power between democratically elected leaders in Guatemala. Árbenz had personal ties to {{some members of the}} communist PGT, which was legalized during his <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> couple of members played a role in drafting the new president's policies. Nonetheless, Árbenz did not try to turn Guatemala into a communist state, instead choosing a moderate capitalist approach. The PGT too committed itself to working within the existing legal framework to achieve its immediate objectives of emancipating peasants from feudalism and improving workers' rights. The most prominent component of Árbenz's policy was his agrarian reform bill. Árbenz drafted the bill himself, having sought advice from economists across Latin America. The focus of the law was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to poor laborers, who would then be able to begin viable farms of their own.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the period}} of the Cold War, {{titanium}} was considered a strategic material by the U.S. <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> large stockpile of titanium sponge was maintained by the Defense National Stockpile Center, which was finally depleted in the 2000s. According to 2006 data, the world's largest producer, Russian-based VSMPO-AVISMA, was estimated to account for about 29% of the world market share. As of 2015, titanium sponge metal was produced in six countries: China, Japan, Russia, Kazakhstan, the USA, Ukraine, and India. (in order of output).|$|E
