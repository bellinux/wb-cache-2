5|$|Among {{the more}} {{original}} castings was Anette Sagen, the world's leading female ski jumper, {{in her first}} film role. Sagen, 22 at the time, played the part of 70-year-old Owe's ski jumping mother, although in a younger incarnation. Hamer had already considered Sagen for the role, when he ran into her by chance at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum. Without knowing to whom <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking,</b> Hamer mentioned that he was shooting a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen to be in it. The reason the theme of ski jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed the sport, and the film {{has been described as}} a tribute to all female ski jumpers. Sagen herself had also earlier been involved in a controversy over women's access to professional venues and competitions. Incidentally, Sagen and Owe are also both from the Norwegian town of Mosjøen.|$|E
5|$|When Raghavan {{is about}} to leave his house for a {{marriage}} proposal, Sundaram comes there and describes the girl <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about to Raghavan. Raghavan realises that Radha, whom he intends to marry, is the same girl Sundaram is in love with. Raghavan, believing that Radha loves Sundaram, decides to help Sundaram attain his love and {{get a chance to}} act in films, which he does successfully. Sundaram becomes a star after his debut film Appavi Kanavan ("Innocent Husband") becomes a success and believes that his stardom and popularity will help him in attaining his love. When Radha comes to Sundaram's house to congratulate him, he introduces her to Raghavan, who is present at that time. As Sundaram goes to prepare snacks for the two, Radha asks Raghavan why he did not show up for the marriage proposal. Raghavan states that he thought Radha loved Sundaram. Shocked, Radha informs Raghavan that she likes Sundaram for his innocence, although she does not love him. Raghavan is pleasantly surprised, but to ensure that Sundaram's film career does not suffer from discovering the truth, he asks Radha to keep it a secret.|$|E

60|$|Yet this {{universal}} language has not succeeded, {{at a moment}} of crisis, in imposing itself on the whole world. Nay, it has not, at the moment of crisis, succeeded in imposing itself on its own principal champions. Herve <b>is</b> not <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> French. Bebel <b>is</b> not <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> German. Blatchford <b>is</b> not <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> English, and jolly good English, too. I do not know whether French or Flemish was Vandervelde's nursery speech, but I <b>am</b> quite certain <b>he</b> will know more of it after this struggle than he knew before. In short, whether or no there be a new union of hearts, there has really and truly been a new division of tongues.|$|R

According to the scientist, Black Angels would save the world; the Ravens thought that Dee was referring to their organization, but the Prepper believed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about something worse.|$|E
25|$|According to an {{internal}} police report leaked in 2007, Fantino, as superintendent of detectives in 1991, had ordered a wiretap of lawyer Peter Maloney a police critic and friend of Susan Eng, chair of the Toronto Police Services Board, the body overseeing the Toronto Police service. Conversations between Maloney and Eng were illegally recorded despite a court order that only the first minute of Maloney's conversations were to be monitored so as {{to determine whether the}} individual who <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to was on the list of those being investigated.|$|E

25|$|The first {{televised}} debate, held on 14 March, {{was broadcast}} live on Rai Uno, and moderated by Clemente Mimun, Director of TG1. It featured questions from journalists Roberto Napoletano of Il Messaggero and Marcello Sorgi of La Stampa. It was watched by over 16 million people, {{a record for}} a political TV show. During his final speech, Berlusconi, who often overran his intervention times, attacked {{the rules of the}} debate, in his opinion too strict, whereas Prodi praised them, pointing out {{the fact that they are}} used in US debates this way, as well. Some observers commented that Berlusconi had been disappointing in this debate, scribbling nervously while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> and at a point confusing Iran and Iraq; while all politicians claimed their candidate had won the debate, it was generally agreed that Berlusconi had not dealt a strong blow to Prodi.|$|E
25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E

25|$|In 1903 {{a number}} {{of members of the}} NUWSS broke away and, led by Emmeline Pankhurst, formed the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). As the {{national}} media lost interest in the suffrage campaign, the WSPU decided it would use other methods to create publicity. This began in 1905 at a meeting in Manchester's Free Trade Hall where Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, a member of the newly elected Liberal government, was speaking. As <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking,</b> Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney of the WSPU constantly shouted out, 'Will the Liberal Government give votes to women?'. When they refused to cease calling out, police were called to evict them and the two suffragettes (as members of the WSPU became known after this incident) were involved in a struggle which ended with them being arrested and charged for assault. When they refused to pay their fine, they were sent to prison for one week, and three days. The British public were shocked and took notice at this use of violence to win the vote for women.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, Blue Horse {{became friends}} with the noted artist Elbridge Ayer (E.A.) Burbank while he was visiting the Pine Ridge Agency. Burbank painted sitting portraits of the {{greatest}} Native American leaders, including Geronimo, Sitting Bull, Red Cloud and Chief Joseph. Burbank painted more than 1200 portraits of Native Americans from 125 tribes. At the time, Blue Horse was eighty {{years of age and}} rode each day on his horse to pose for Burbank, who he called “Son of the Shadow-Maker.” Burbank was also an historian and his fond recollections illuminate Blue Horse. “Hardly a day passed without Blue Horse coming to my studio to visit me. He would sit down and smoke a little, short, strong pipe and gossip with the other Indians present; all the time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> he would be fanning himself with the wing of a turkey. His face usually was painted red, and he wore all the Indian clothes he had, with a single feather on his head. He was a thorough Indian, and extremely kind-hearted. His principal object in life was to try to make others happy around him.” Burbank recorded his stories of Blue Horse.|$|E
500|$|Following the game, the Canadians {{complained that}} Josef Kompalla and Franz Baader, the German referees {{of the match}} (the same ones who {{refereed}} a controversial Canada-Sweden game), were biased, since Canada was handed 31 minutes in penalties during the game, while the Soviets only received four minutes. Phil Esposito complained that one goal by the Soviets was directly {{the result of the}} referee dropping the puck while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to a teammate.

500|$|The {{day after}} oral arguments, writer Gilad Edelman criticized the Court's {{assumption}} that Heffernan never exercised his First Amendment rights, saying, [...] "the Supreme Court may miss {{an opportunity to}} make sure that cases like his really are rare." [...] Edelman interpreted Heffernan's actions as being well within the existing First Amendment precedent. Though Heffernan was not necessarily supporting the candidate, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> and associating with people connected to the candidate, actions already protected under existing precedent. Edelman suggested that, {{regardless of whether or not}} Heffernan intended to be identified as supporting the campaign, he was still punished by the city for associating.|$|E
