500|$|This {{care for}} balance was an {{important}} feature of Boult's music-making.

His BBC principal violist wrote in 1938, [...] "If a woodwind player has to complain that he has already been blowing 'fit to burst' there is trouble for somebody." [...] The trombonist Ray Premru wrote forty years later, [...] "One of the old school, like Boult, is so refreshing because he will reduce the <b>dynamic</b> <b>level</b> – 'No, no, pianissimo, strings, let the soloist through, less from everyone else.'

40|$|Climate {{change has}} the {{potential}} to influence global mean sea level through a number of processes including (but not limited to) thermal expansion of the oceans and enhanced land ice melt. In addition to their contribution to global mean sea level change, these two processes (among others) lead to local departures from the global mean sea level change, through a number of mechanisms including the effect on spatial variations in the change of water density and transport, usually termed <b>dynamic</b> sea <b>level</b> changes. In this study, we focus on the component of <b>dynamic</b> sea <b>level</b> change that might be given by additional freshwater inflow to the ocean under scenarios of 21 st-century land-based ice melt. We present regional patterns of <b>dynamic</b> sea <b>level</b> change given by a global-coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model forced by spatially and temporally varying projected ice-melt fluxes from three sources: the Antarctic ice sheet, the Greenland Ice Sheet and small glaciers and ice caps. The largest ice melt flux we consider is equivalent to almost 0. 7 m of global mean sea level rise over the 21 st century. The temporal evolution of the <b>dynamic</b> sea <b>level</b> changes, in the presence of considerable variations in the ice melt flux, is also analysed. We find that the <b>dynamic</b> sea <b>level</b> change associated with the ice melt is small, with the largest changes occurring in the North Atlantic amounting to 3 cm above the global mean rise. Furthermore, the <b>dynamic</b> sea <b>level</b> change associated with the ice melt is similar regardless of whether the simulated ice fluxes are applied to a simulation with fixed CO 2 or under a business-as-usual greenhouse gas warming scenario of increasing CO 2...|$|R

50|$|As a soloistic instrument, the snare drum has {{certainly}} found {{its place in}} classical music. A fantastic example of this use of the snare drum would be the opening of Sergei Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kijé suite. After an opening trumpet solo, the snare drum plays a rather short, military-style solo at a pianissimo dynamic marking, designed to create a march-like feel. This particular part presents {{a number of problems}} for the orchestral percussionist, but its main difficulty lies in keeping the various rudiments (flams, four stroke ruffs, etc.) consistent at such a soft <b>dynamic</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
