5|$|As M-37 crosses into Lake County, {{the highway}} crosses the Pere Marquette River. US10 follows M-37 through Baldwin. The Marquette Rail line turns westward {{on the edge}} of town, and north of Baldwin, the highway forms the {{dividing}} line between the Manistee National <b>Forest</b> <b>to</b> the west and the Pere Marquette State <b>Forest</b> <b>to</b> the east.

5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, {{orangutan}} habitat has decreased rapidly due to logging and forest fires, {{as well as}} fragmentation by roads. A major factor in {{that period of time}} has been the conversion of vast areas of tropical <b>forest</b> <b>to</b> palm oil plantations in response to international demand. Palm oil is used for cooking, cosmetics, mechanics, and biodiesel. Hunting is also a major problem as is the illegal pet trade.|$|E

5|$|The {{prevailing}} lowland {{forest ecosystem}} was transformed from <b>forest</b> <b>to</b> grassland; {{some of this}} change {{was caused by the}} use of fire, but the prevailing cause of forest ecosystem collapse and avian extinction on Hawaii appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian (or Pacific) rat.|$|E

Koṇḍañña kissed the Buddha's feet and stroked them with his hands. He advised his disciples not to mourn him before returning to the <b>forest</b> <b>to</b> pass away the following morning. He was cremated on a large sandalwood pyre which was constructed {{with the help of the}} elephants, and the ceremony was presided over by Anuruddha, one of the ten chief disciples and five hundred other monks. The ashes were later taken to Veluvana, where they were enshrined in a silver stupa.|$|E

5|$|After King John's death, however, St Briavels Castle {{became the}} primary centre for English quarrel manufacture. The {{crossbow}} {{was an important}} military advance on the older short bow and was the favoured weapon {{by the time of}} Richard Imany crossbows and even more quarrels were needed to supply royal forces. Crossbows were primarily built at the Tower of London, but St Briavels Castle, with the local <b>forest</b> <b>to</b> provide raw materials, became the national centre for quarrel manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous <b>forest</b> <b>to</b> other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E
5|$|As league champions, Arsenal contested the 1991 FA Charity Shield against local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who {{had beaten}} Nottingham <b>Forest</b> <b>to</b> win the 1991 FA Cup Final.

These forests are known for their rich diversity of plants and animals, which is due to several contributing factors, especially that the area was an unglaciated refugium for many species. It shares species with the high elevation Appalachian-Blue Ridge <b>forests</b> <b>to</b> the east, the hardwood <b>forests</b> <b>to</b> the west, and the mixed hardwood/conifer <b>forests</b> <b>to</b> the south.|$|R
