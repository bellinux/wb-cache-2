500|$|With {{the success}} of albums by Hill, Badu, and Maxwell, D'Angelo's second album Voodoo served as a further {{alternative}} to excesses of late 1990s R and hip hop, as neo soul reached its apex in 2000. A production of the Soulquarians, it was an exemplary creative milestone of neo soul. Ben Ratliff of The New York Times called the album [...] "the succes d'estime that proves the force of this new music: it is a largely unslick, stubbornly idiosyncratic and genuinely great album that has already produced two hit singles". By {{the time of her}} second album Mama's Gun (2000), Erykah Badu had been dubbed by writers as [...] "the queen of neo-soul". She said of the honorific title, [...] "I hated that because what if I don’t <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>anymore?</b> What if I change? Then that puts me in a penitentiary." [...] Subsequently, other artists attained success in the early 2000s, including Bilal, Musiq Soulchild, India.Arie, and Alicia Keys, who broke through to broader popularity with her debut album Songs in A Minor (2001). Hip hop artists such as The Roots and Common, associated with the Soulquarians, released albums that incorporated neo soul, Phrenology (2002) and Electric Circus (2003).|$|E

I want to make records, I still love making records, but the touring part... I don't know if we can continue. I mean, three of us are 54 years old – Anthony, me and Flea. Josh is 38 or 39, so he's a young man. But I don't know if {{we can continue to}} do the long tours – the year, year-and-a-half we normally do. That's a good question. We all have families and different things, your priorities shift a little bit. You kinda see that what's gonna work for you maybe doesn't necessarily work for other bands. But again, we're just so grateful that people want to come and see us play, and we love to perform. I don't know in the future how that's gonna look. We pride ourselves in putting out a really amazing performance. You want people to just walk away and be like, 'Wow, I haven't seen anything like that!' and when you can't <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>anymore,</b> you gotta really stop and go, 'We're not gonna be sitting on stools up there playing our songs.'"On July 18, 2017 in an {{interview with}} TMZ, Flea said of the band possibly retiring [...] "that's just silly talk. We never look past the immediate future but um, were on tour right now, we're rockin' out, we're feeling the spirit, letting the music move us and to be honest since the day we started this band nearly 35 years ago, i've never ever known what's next or what's around the corner or anything and I think that the power of the band lies in that kinda just staying in the moment and staying with the energy that's moving.|$|E

50|$|Gautham and Devika are the lovebirds of the group, with Gautham’s {{talent in}} western music being the spark {{kindling}} the relationship. While Gautham {{is no longer}} interested in western music and wish to pursue Hindustani classical music; he is forced to mask {{that part of his}} identity from Devika for the fear of how her reaction will be. Diya with her lovely nature had been the fascination of Akshay’s dreams for a long time, which is known to everyone, except her. The lively nature of Diya had attracted many others in the past (including Varun, known only to Kuppi), who obviously confess their feelings only to get turned down as she never adds a different colour to her friendships. Akshay, being apprehensive, never wishes to do the same and hopes that she likes him on her own terms. He never even talks to her and his friends recommend that he can never pray for a better chance than their first year IV. Akshay is also hunted by many fears including fear of water, fear of height, among others; but the worst one being his fear of future, as he is often being compared with his successful elder brother, Akash, who set the standards too high. Varun had earlier confessed his feelings to Diya, who rejected the proposal hoping to remain friends. With a feeling of insult, he couldn’t <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>anymore,</b> leading him to his familiar trait of anger and distant nature. He even remains hostile to another classmate who has a crush on him. The girl, on various occasions tries to approach him, but each time he dispassionately avoids her. In spite of his cold attitude, he is respected among his friends and classmates alike for his discipline and efficiency. He is often too detached from the group carrying on with his responsibilities, that it comes to the notice of even their bus driver, Josettan. Diya, whose parents just got divorced joins the trip as an escape from her distress. She doesn’t reveal about the divorce to her dear friends - Devika and Darshana or any others for the fear of their sympathy, which can make the situation even more difficult on her. She easily manages to hide her secrets in her cheerful semblance. Kuppi’s only intention coming for the IV was {{to have a good time}} with his three best friends, which is often denied due to the occurrences around him. Darshana, a reserved person by nature, thinks the world of her friends, being a silent partner in all their activities and a curious observer to all the happenings around them. Her only outlet of emotions is her sketchbook that she holds dear and private.|$|E
