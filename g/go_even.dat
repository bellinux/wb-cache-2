5|$|Having {{misunderstood}} {{the news}} about an upsurge of piracy in the Indian Ocean, Cartman excitedly tells his friends the classic era of piracy has returned, and asks the boys {{to join him in}} becoming a pirate in what he describes as a responsibility-free life in a warm tropical paradise. Sensing an opportunity to get rid of Cartman once and for all, Kyle encourages him to <b>go,</b> <b>even</b> offering to help pay for his ticket. Although Butters, Ike, Clyde and Kevin are the only students who agree to join his crew, an undaunted Cartman uses his mother's credit card to book a trip to Somalia. After a long flight and a 49-hour bus ride, the boys arrive in Mogadishu dressed as stereotypical pirates. Once there, however, they are shocked to find themselves in a desolate land, the complete opposite of their expectations.|$|E
5|$|In the Ashvamedhika Parva {{the tale}} is narrated with some variation. Uttanka is {{described}} as a brahmin who belonged to the Bhrigu race that lived in a hermitage in the Maru desert. Uttanka was the disciple of the sage Gautama, whom he served for a hundred years. Uttanka was very dear to Gautama, who did not let him <b>go</b> <b>even</b> after Uttanka had completed his education. Uttanka grew old over time. One day Uttanka collapsed while carrying a huge bundle of firewood. Gautama's daughter cried looking at the sight. When called by his guru, Uttanka accosted Gautama, and with tears in his eyes asked him why he alone had been retained in the hermitage when thousands of other disciples had been discharged after training. Gautama restored Uttanka's youth, gave his daughter in marriage to Uttanka and then permitted him to leave.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held; {{there were two}} 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Since Singapore was a night race, the practice sessions started at a later local time; 18:00 {{for the first and}} 21:30 for the second session on Friday. This meant that the gap between the first two practice sessions was half an hour shorter than in other races. The two Mercedes cars were fastest in the first session on Friday, with Nico Rosberg topping the time sheets at 1:47.995. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton was second, 0.319 seconds behind, while Daniel Ricciardo was 0.017 seconds slower in third, ahead of the two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen, even though Vettel briefly left the track in turn five {{towards the end of the}} session. While Ricciardo felt he could <b>go</b> <b>even</b> faster, his teammate Daniil Kvyat was able to put in only eight laps due to a fuel system problem, and he finished the session eighteenth, just ahead of the two Manor Marussia drivers. Manor's Alexander Rossi placed last, albeit close to teammate Will Stevens, before crashing out at turn 18, ending the last timed runs of all other drivers left on track.|$|E

25|$|Medicare Part B {{premiums}} {{are commonly}} deducted automatically from beneficiaries' monthly Social Security checks. They {{can also be}} paid quarterly via bill sent directly to beneficiaries. This alternative is becoming more common because whereas the eligibility age for Medicare has remained at 65 per the 1965 legislation, the so-called Full Retirement Age for Social Security has been increased to 66 and will <b>go</b> <b>even</b> higher over time. Therefore, many people delay collecting Social Security and have to pay their Part B premium directly.|$|E

However, even in relatively noncompetitive residencies, politics can come into play when considering a resident's transfer. A notable case has been that of Dr. Eugene Gu who has been subpoenaed by two separate Tennessee Congresswomen, Marsha Blackburn and Diane Black, while pursuing a general surgery residency at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Dr. Gu has attempted for over a year to transfer into a general surgery program in California or on the West Coast but so far remains in Tennessee.|$|E

25|$|Flight of the Migrator {{continues}} {{the story of}} the final living human being, the colonist on Mars, and his decision to <b>go</b> <b>even</b> further back in time. Using the Dream Sequencer machine, he travels {{all the way back to}} just before the Universe was formed, theoretically before the Big Bang, when there was nothing but chaos. The colonist observes the creation of the very first soul, known as the Universal Migrator. It is from this soul that all others are formed, through a division of the original soul. Each resulting soul then travels off into the Universe to bring life in some form to the planet they inhabit.|$|E
25|$|Zechariah 1–8, {{sometimes}} referred to as First Zechariah, was written in the 6th century BC. Zechariah 9–14, often called Second Zechariah, contains within the text no datable references to specific events or individuals but most scholars give the text a date in the fifth century BCE. Second Zechariah, in the opinion of some scholars, appears {{to make use of the}} books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, the Deuteronomistic History, and the themes from First Zechariah. This has led some to believe that the writer(s) or editor(s) of Second Zechariah may have been a disciple of the prophet Zechariah. There are some scholars who <b>go</b> <b>even</b> further and divide Second Zechariah into Second Zechariah (9–11) and Third Zechariah (12–14) since each begins with a heading oracle.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholic Angie {{shares a}} stormy {{marriage}} with her womanising husband, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), {{and refuses to}} let him <b>go</b> <b>even</b> during their rockiest times. They run and live in The Queen Victoria pub on Albert Square. Angie and Den dote on their spoilt teenage adopted daughter, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), who carries on loving them despite her resentment of Den's affairs and Angie's binge drinking. Angie is good at putting on a front for the customers, dressing to kill, screeching outrageously with the girls, but inside she is a mess. Despite all her bravado, all she really wants is a happy marriage with Den, {{despite the fact that}} he treats her terribly and has endless affairs with other women.|$|E

25|$|Greg Madden {{is found}} dead weeks later. In {{the months that}} follow, Zach and Kendall enjoy their time with the newborn child. Problems arise here and there, but none {{like that of the}} Satin Slayer, a serial killer murdering the women of Fusion, a {{cosmetics}} company run by Kendall and her friends who helped to define it. The Satin Slayer takes Kendall hostage, and when it is revealed that the Satin Slayer is actually Zach's estranged father, Alexander Cambias, Sr., thought to be dead, but obviously still very much alive and that all he wanted is for Zach to have followed in his footsteps, Zach does everything in his power to save Kendall, as it all culminates on a balcony outside of a hotel room. Zach's father sets a contraption around Kendall's neck, which will kill her if its detonator goes off. Zach and Alexander struggle as Zach gets a hold of the detonator and will not let it <b>go,</b> <b>even</b> as he is shot in the arm by Alexander. Zach is able to sneak a spare knife from the sheath at his ankle and throw it hard enough at Alexander so that Alexander drops his gun. Zach rescues Kendall. He is determined to kill his father, but help soon arrives, and Alexander is sent to jail.|$|E

It was, {{according}} to Goddard, his duty to advise her to withdraw her divorce petition. Simpson refused, but they both telephoned the King to inform {{him that she was}} willing to give him up so that he could remain king. It was, however, too late; the King had already made up his mind to <b>go,</b> <b>even</b> if he could not marry Simpson. Indeed, as the belief that the abdication was inevitable gathered strength, Goddard stated that: [...] " [...] client was ready to do anything to ease the situation but {{the other end of the}} wicket [...] was determined".|$|E
500|$|A {{year later}} in Planica, {{in front of}} a 50,000-strong crowd, Steiner finally {{achieved}} the world record he had been striving for, landing a jump of 169m to equal that of Wossipiwo in 1973. Spectators were astonished and the event organisers momentarily bewildered, as Steiner had landed well beyond the markers used to indicate distance alongside the hill, which only went as far as the existing K-point of 165m. For the first time since their respective hills had been built, the competition was levelled between Oberstdorf and Planica. On the next day of the event in the latter, Steiner tried to <b>go</b> <b>even</b> further: he landed at [...] but fell down on what was almost flat ground, although this time he managed to walk away (albeit on unsteady legs) with only cuts to his face.|$|E
