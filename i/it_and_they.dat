5|$|In a Christianized version, the duel {{involves}} the Christian St.Elijah and the ala, {{but there is}} a belief that the saint and the dragons in fact cooperate: as soon as St.Elijah spots an ala, he summons the dragons, either takes them aboard his chariot or harnesses them to <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> jointly shoot the ala with lightning. Arrow-shaped stones, like belemnites or stone-age arrowheads, are regarded as materialized lightning bolts imbued with a beneficial magical power, and finding one is a good omen.|$|E
5|$|Lactose is the {{naturally}} occurring sugar found in milk. A molecule of lactose is {{formed by the}} combination of a molecule of galactose with a molecule of glucose. It is broken down when consumed into its constituent parts by the enzyme lactase during digestion. Children have this enzyme but some adults no longer form <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> are unable to digest lactose.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of season two, Shannon loses Vincent in the jungle. While searching for him, she is shocked to find Walt {{standing}} before her, dripping wet. However, when Sayid finds her, Walt disappears. Over the next few days, Sayid builds Shannon a shelter on the beach. He brings her to <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> soon decide to sleep {{together for the first}} time. Sayid leaves to get a bottle of water for Shannon and in his absence, Shannon again sees a vision of Walt, standing in the shelter with her. Sayid brushes off her experience as a dream. She uses Vincent to try to find Walt, only for him to lead her to Boone's grave. After a while, she takes Vincent into the jungle again, with Sayid in pursuit. As it starts to rain, Sayid and Shannon admit their feelings for each other before both seeing Walt. Shannon runs after him, only to be accidentally shot by Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), who mistakes her for an Other. She dies moments later in Sayid's arms. Shannon's death not only left Sayid heartbroken, but also caused a rift between the survivors and the Tailies. Throughout the rest of the season, Ana Lucia is shown to be guilt-ridden over killing Shannon.|$|E

5|$|Before going {{hunting the}} next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain {{whatever}} he catches {{on the condition that}} Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, Lady Bertilak visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die {{the next day}}, Gawain accepts <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> exchange three kisses. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses – but Gawain says nothing of the girdle.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, Armstrong was {{involved}} in a second incident, when he flew for the only time with Chuck Yeager. Their job, flying a Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As they attempted a touch-and-go, the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. Armstrong tells a different version of events, where Yeager never tried {{to talk him out of}} <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> made a first successful landing on the east side of the lake. Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower. On the second landing, they became stuck and according to Armstrong, Yeager was in fits of laughter.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

5|$|The Seinfeld Chronicles {{was written}} as the pilot {{for the show}} that would {{eventually}} be called Seinfeld, though earlier versions of the script would refer to the program as Stand Up and The Jerry Seinfeld Show. The idea for the show started on November 2, 1988, after NBC executives had approached comedian Jerry Seinfeld to do a project with the network, upon a suggestion by George Shapiro, Seinfeld's manager at the time. Seinfeld enlisted fellow comedian Larry David to help him develop <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> wrote a concept for a special about where comedians get their material. However, upon further discussion, Seinfeld felt that the concept could not be sustained for 90 minutes, upon which the two decided that the project {{was to become a}} pilot for a TV-series, rather than a special. Developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life.|$|E
5|$|The vessels {{have four}} decks, upon {{which there are}} cabins and saloons for merchants. Several of these 'mysria' contain {{cupboards}} and other conveniences; they have doors which can be locked, and keys for their occupiers. (The merchants) take with them their wives and concubines. It often happens that a man can be in his cabin without others on board realizing <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> do not see him until the vessel has arrived in some port. The sailors also have their children in such cabins; and (in {{some parts of the}} ship) they sew garden herbs, vegetables, and ginger in wooden tubs. The Commander of such a vessel is a great Emir; when he lands, the archers and the Ethiops (i.e. black slaves, yet in China these men-at-arms would have most likely been Malays) march before him bearing javelins and swords, with drums beating and trumpets blowing. When he arrives at the guesthouse where he is to stay, they set up their lances {{on each side of the}} gate, and mount guard throughout his visit.|$|E

25|$|The film {{is notable}} for its avant-garde style, shot on stark high-contrast {{black-and-white}} film, using the spherical cinematographic process with allusions to French New Wave cinema. The striking black-and-white photography of the film's cinematographer, Stephen H. Burum, lies in two main sources: the films of Orson Welles and German cinema of the 1920s. When {{the film was}} in its pre-production phase, Coppola asked Burum how he wanted to film <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> agreed {{that it might be}} the only chance they were ever {{going to have to make}} a black-and-white film.|$|E
25|$|Told {{partly in}} flashback, {{it is the}} story of Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) and Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford). Their {{differences}} are immense: she is a stridently vocal Marxist Jew with strong anti-war opinions, and he is a carefree WASP with no particular political bent. While attending the same college, she is drawn to him because of his boyish good looks and his natural writing skill, which she finds captivating, although he does not work very hard at it. He is intrigued by her conviction and her determination to persuade others to take up social causes. Their attraction is evident, but neither of them acts upon <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> lose touch after graduation.|$|E
25|$|When a baby {{chimpanzee}} or gorilla dies, {{the mother}} {{will carry the}} body around for several days before it may finally {{be able to move}} on without it; this behavior has been observed in other primates, as well. Jane Goodall has described chimpanzees as exhibiting mournful behavior toward the loss of a group member with silence and by showing more attention to <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> <b>they</b> will often continue grooming it and stay close to the carcass until the group must move on without it. Another notable example is Koko, a gorilla that uses sign language, who expressed sadness and even described sadness about the death of her pet cat, All Ball.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the Confederated Tribes {{were given}} a {{reservation}} east of the Columbia River. Three months later, it was taken away (because white settlers wanted <b>it)</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> {{were given a}} comparably large tract {{on the west side}} of the river on inferior land. Initially, this reservation extended all the way to the Canada–US border, but the northern half was taken away in 1892, which separated it from Sinixt traditional territory in British Columbia; in addition, as more tribes lost their land, the shrinking reservation had to absorb yet more people. Even then, they had to deal with incursions of miners, homesteaders, and settlers such as the Doukhobors, who arrived from Russia in 1912.|$|E
25|$|After his {{retirement}} from the bench, Innes was free {{once again to}} express his political views, and especially his staunch Cape liberal commitments. In 1929, when Prime Minister J. B. M. Hertzog was intensifying plans to strip black Africans of their rights, Innes founded the Non-Racial Franchise Association to protect the beleaguered Cape Qualified Franchise and extend it {{to the rest of}} the country. At the Association's opening function he said:"In a comparatively short time, we shall have to deal with a great body of Natives whose education has enabled them to appreciate the value of the political status denied them, and has stimulated their determination to obtain <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> will be embittered by the grievances, economic and administrative which are bound to accumulate when one section of the people is deprived of those voting rights which its fellow citizens enjoy.|$|E
25|$|A new Latina group, called Soluna, {{had just}} lost a member and {{was looking for a}} replacement. T Lopez quickly auditioned, and was whisked away on tour. T Lopez {{explained}} that touring with Marc Anthony and Enrique Iglesias was a crazy roller coaster ride for her because everything happened so fast. But she had a great time, T Lopez said. Latina group Soluna released their 2002 debut album, For All Time, under the Dreamworks Records label. Paramount and UPN quickly took interest in the group and developed a TV pilot based on their lives, co-starring Mario Lopez & Tony Plana. After filming the pilot, Soluna reconvened for a second album but realized they had grown apart musically.
