In Mexico, New Zealand and Norway, the album <b>just</b> <b>missed</b> the top ten of the charts. The commercial success in Europe enabled the album to debut at position two on Billboards European Top 100 Albums chart, behind Norah Jones' studio album Not Too Late. The DVD of The Confessions Tour has sold more than 1.2 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|When the {{competition}} was revived in the 1990s, {{for the first two}} seasons all English sides playing in the First Division (2nd level) participated, but in the last two tournaments only 8 English teams played. In 1994/95, two of the clubs relegated from the Premiership were joined by six teams that had <b>just</b> <b>missed</b> out on promotion. For 1995/96, only one relegated Premiership team competed – most of the remaining teams had finished in mid-table or lower table in the previous First Division campaign, and Birmingham City had just been promoted from Division Two.|$|E
5|$|A statewide {{review by}} {{emergency}} management officials recorded 249 fatalities in Alabama, 23 {{of which were}} not tornado-related. Damage and power outages in the Huntsville area were so widespread {{that at one point}} over 650,000 people were out of power in the Tennessee Valley Authority system. The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged main power lines coming from Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant further to the northeast. These towers were the main supply of electrical power to much of North Alabama and some were without power for two weeks. The tornado <b>just</b> <b>missed</b> the Limestone Correctional Facility, which {{less than a year later}} would be struck by another tornado.|$|E

5|$|Albion {{had spent}} the {{majority}} of their history in the top-flight of English football, but when the FA Premier League was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier, which had been renamed Division Two. In 1992–93, Albion finished fourth and entered the playoffs for the first time, having <b>just</b> <b>missed</b> out the previous year. Albion's first appearance at Wembley for over 20 years – and their last ever at the original stadium – saw them beat Port Vale 3–0 to return to the second level – now renamed the First Division. Manager Ossie Ardiles then joined Tottenham Hotspur, however, and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without ever mounting a serious promotion challenge.|$|E
5|$|Robertson's stellar play led the Bearcats to a 79–9 overall record {{during his}} three varsity seasons, {{including}} two Final Four appearances. However, a championship eluded Robertson, {{something that would}} become a repeated occurrence in his professional career. When Robertson left college he was the all-time leading NCAA scorer until fellow Hall of Fame player Pete Maravich topped him in 1970. It {{is interesting to note}} that Robertson took Cincinnati to national prominence during his time there, but the university's greatest success in basketball took place immediately after his departure, when the team won national titles in 1961, 1962, and <b>just</b> <b>missed</b> a third title in 1963.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013 Van Dijk {{announced}} that she signed a three-year contract with Boels Dolmans Cycling Team. She is a teammate of among others Lizzie Armitstead, Katarzyna Pawłowska and Christine Majerus. The time trial at the 2016 Summer Olympics will be her big goal. She will keep her focus on time trials, world cup races and flat short stage races. Due to her focus on road cycling, she will not compete on the track. Van Dijk {{was not able to}} start in the Ladies Tour of Qatar because she did not recover in time from an illness after riding mountainbikerace Egmond-pier-Egmond. She got back her shape during the first races and <b>just</b> <b>missed</b> the podium in the GP Le Samyn.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1778, George Washington ordered Major Benjamin Tallmadge to form the Culper Ring. This group was {{composed}} of a select few trustworthy individuals whose purpose was to collect information about the British movements and activities in New York City. The Ring is famous for uncovering Benedict Arnold's intentions of treason, which shocked Washington because Arnold was someone who had {{contributed significantly to the}} war effort. Arnold was embittered by his dealings with Congress over rank and finances, as well as the alliance with France, so he conspired with the British in a plan to seize the post that he commanded at West Point. Washington <b>just</b> <b>missed</b> apprehending him, but did capture his co-conspirator Major John André, a British intelligence officer under Clinton who was hanged by order of a court-martial called by Washington.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} few {{noteworthy}} performances in later-season single-day races. Sánchez held the Clásica de San Sebastián {{as a target}} for his season, hoping {{to be the first}} Euskaltel-Euskadi rider to win the race. Sánchez rode {{at the front of the}} race most of the day, until the winner Philippe Gilbert made his signature solo attack to earn victory. Sánchez finished near the back of the chase pack 14 seconds down the road, for eighth place on the day. Izagirre <b>just</b> <b>missed</b> the podium at the Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia, finishing fourth in a five-man escape that decided the race. Near the end of the season, the team did obtain a podium finish. Trainee rider Peio Bilbao finished second in October's Tour de Vendée. He was just edged out by 's Marco Marcato in a five-man sprint finish. Only 14 riders officially completed this race due to race organizers strictly enforcing the time cut.|$|E
5|$|Brazil's {{substitution}} of Paulinho for Fernandinho and Ramires for Hulk {{resulted in an}} improvement in their play after the restart; Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer saved shots in quick succession from Oscar, Paulinho and Fred. By the 60th minute, though, the Germans came close to scoring again, with Júlio César denying Müller twice. Another German goal indeed came in the 69th minute – Lahm's low cross found substitute André Schürrle, who side-footed {{the ball into the}} net from close range. 10 minutes later, Schürrle ran onto Müller's cross from the left and hit a powerful shot over Júlio César at the near post. At this point with the score at 7–0, the remaining home fans gave the Germans a standing ovation, applauding both Schürrle's goal and Germany's overall performance. Close to the end, Özil received a through ball but <b>just</b> <b>missed</b> the chance to make it eight. Seconds later, Oscar received a long ball and scored in the 90th minute to make it 7–1. The final score matched Brazil's worst ever loss (6–0 to Uruguay in 1920) and ended a run of 62 competitive home matches unbeaten for Brazil. The Brazilian players left the pitch in tears to a chorus of boos.|$|E

5|$|The team secured several high {{placings}} in {{the later}} season, but did not obtain any victories. In late July, the team took two of the top six placings at the Polynormande, with El Fares in second and Gallopin in sixth. El Fares {{had been part of}} a breakaway, and Gallopin first from the peloton four and a half minutes back. The result put Gallopin into the lead in the French Road Cycling Cup, the year-long competition among French single-day races where French riders, and those on French teams, can earn points. Cusin came eighth at the Tour du Doubs in September. Petit <b>just</b> <b>missed</b> out on the podium at the Grand Prix de Fourmies, finishing fourth in a large field sprint. He made the podium in a similar finish at Binche–Tournai–Binche in October, finishing third. Also in October, Dumoulin took ninth place at Paris–Bourges, from a selective sprint of ten riders. Duque was seventh in a leading group of thirteen at the Grand Prix de la Somme. Though he won only the one race, Gallopin's consistent high finishes in the French single-day races made him the overall victor of the season-long French Road Cycling Cup, which he clinched after the Tour de Vendée.|$|E
5|$|Linois {{had escaped}} so swiftly that his anchors and boats {{had been left}} in the bay, where he had {{abandoned}} them rather than draw attention to his movements by drawing them in. He had also <b>just</b> <b>missed</b> the transport Côte d'Or with its 326 soldiers, which arrived {{on the evening of}} 13 July and was swiftly surrounded by Centurion and Concorde. Detaching most of his squadron to Madras, Rainier waited off Pondicherry for further French movements and on 15 July spotted Belle Poule just off the coast. Linois had detached the frigate to investigate the anchorage at Madras, but she had been intercepted and followed by the frigate , whose insistent shadowing had forced Captain Alain-Adélaïde-Marie Bruilhac to return to Pondicherry. Belle Poule and Côte d'Or exchange signals during the morning, and at 11:00 the transport suddenly raised sails and departed the anchorage, Terpsichore pursuing closely. Early on 16 July, Terpsichore overtook the transport and fired several shots across her bow, forcing her captain to surrender. Bruilhac had used the distraction to sail Belle Poule to Isle de France without pursuit. Côte d'Or was returned to Pondicherry and, since there was no news of war from Europe, released on 24 July on condition that she only sail to Isle de France and no other destination. Dedaigneuse was detached to ensure that the transport followed these conditions and Rainier returned to Madras, joined by Dedaigneuse the following day once the transport's course was ensured. Rainier immediately ordered his ships to take on military supplies in preparation for military operations, although news of the declaration of war, made on 18 May, did not reach him until 13 September.|$|E
