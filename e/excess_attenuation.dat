50|$|In {{the absence}} of strong mode-mixing, high order mode {{filtering}} is the primary remaining mechanism for potential change of an input mode power distribution. If a well-aligned laser is the optical source, the mode power distribution is highly concentrated in the lowest order modes, and remains essentially unchanged with distance {{due to the lack}} of mode-mixing. If an optical source that overfills the fibre is used, only the highest order guided mode group experiences <b>excess</b> <b>attenuation,</b> and the mode power distribution becomes slightly filtered as a result. (Mandrel wrapping is a viable method to artificially create this state.) Such mode power distributions are stationary; neither changes with fibre length, but equilibrium does not exist in either case because the distributions remain dependent on the input power distribution.|$|E
50|$|When {{optical fibers}} {{are exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation such as energetic electrons, protons, neutrons, X-rays, Ƴ-radiation, etc., they undergo 'damage'. The term 'damage' primarily refers to the additional loss of the propagating optical signal leading to decreased power at the output end {{which could lead to}} premature failure of the component and or system. In the professional literature, the effect is often named Radiation Induced Attenuation (RIA). The loss of power or 'darkening' occurs because the chemical bonds forming the optical fiber core are disrupted by the impinging high energy resulting in the appearance of new electronic transition states giving rise to additional absorption in the wavelength regions of interest. Once radiation source is removed, the fiber returns to its original state to some extent (a process called recovery). The extent of damage is governed by the balance between defect generation (<b>excess</b> <b>attenuation)</b> on one hand and defect annihilation (recovery) on the other hand. If the dose rate is low, an equilibrium state (between attenuation and recovery) is reached with some degree of darkening. On the contrary if the dose rate is high, the utility of fiber depends on the overall induced attenuation and the recovery time. Understanding these radiation induced effects is important particularly for space based applications where optical fibers are being considered for use in increasing number of applications.|$|E

The top edge of the sound barrier is divided into many infinitesimal segments with different heights {{to act as a}} series of sound sources. Asymptotic approximations are developed for predicting the diffraction field on the hard ground in the shadow zone of these three types of barriers from the theory of Menounou's. 26 Based on the theory, the <b>excess</b> <b>attenuation</b> vs. the diffracted field by the straight barrier with the maximum height is simulated. Laboratory measurements are reported for comparison with the <b>excess</b> <b>attenuation</b> of triangle-wave form and randomly jagged-edged barriers by the present approximations. Differences between the present approximations, current existing models and the experimental data are very small. It is shown that the barrier with the triangle-wave form or randomly jagged edge can perform better to reduce the diffraction field over a wide frequency range even if the referenced sound field is taken as the diffracted field by the straight barrier with the maximum height. Moreover, by simple simulations, it is found that the randomly jagged barrier behaves just like a straight one when the source or the receiver is far away from the barrier, and almost the same <b>excess</b> <b>attenuation</b> can be observed as long as the horizontal width of each segment is made small enough for the barrier with a triangle-waveform edge or a randomly jagged edge.

The vegetation attenuation models considered here are the lateral wave attenuation model, the maximum attenuation (MA) model, and the foliage attenuation model which were recommended by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU-R). The following well-known propagation loss models that involve only the direct wave, or the direct wave and the ground effect are considered: Free space model, plane earth model, modified Okumura-Hata model for open area (or shortly: modified Hata), Lee model for free space area, and Lee model for open area.

Their radiation sensitivity is very high with losses exceeding 10 dB m− 1 for doses larger than 10 Gy and wavelengths shorter than 550 nm.

Cases with acoustically hard façades and absorption and diffusion façade treatments were in vestigated. To correct for <b>excess</b> air <b>attenuation</b> of the measurements, a wavelet-based method has been applied.
