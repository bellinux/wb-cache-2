5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the <b>delta</b> <b>wing.</b> The <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|The Avro Vulcan (later Hawker Siddeley Vulcan from July 1963) is a jet-powered {{tailless}} <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> high-altitude strategic bomber, {{which was}} {{operated by the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1956 until 1984. Aircraft manufacturer A.V. Roe and Company (Avro) designed the Vulcan in response to Specification B.35/46. Of the three V bombers produced, the Vulcan was considered the most technically advanced and hence the riskiest option. Several scale aircraft, designated Avro 707, were produced to test and refine the <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> design principles.|$|E

For round-edged <b>delta</b> <b>wings</b> and for coarse grids, the solution depends {{on the level of}} dissipation, the accuracy of the surface boundary condition, and the type of Euler equations set. For round-edged <b>delta</b> <b>wings</b> and for fine grids, attached flow solutions are obtained. Also presented were three dimensional flow solutions and asymmetric flow solutions including unsteady flow for sharp-edged <b>delta</b> <b>wings.</b> Euler equations should be restricted to sharp-edged wings for real flow solutions.

40|$|The leading-edge-suction {{analogy of}} Polhamus {{has been used}} to develop the {{longitudinal}} load distribution of the vortex lift for <b>delta</b> <b>wings.</b> This distribution is shown to be similar in shape to that of the potential-flow longitudinal loading for <b>delta</b> <b>wings</b> having aspect ratios of 2 or less. The totals of the two theoretical distributions for <b>delta</b> <b>wings</b> with an aspect ratio near 1 are in good agreement with the experimentally determined loadings over the angle-of-attack range from 0 to 30 deg. The corresponding predicted pitching moments show slightly more stability than those measured, because of loss of lift near the wing tips...|$|R

5|$|The Valkyrie was {{designed}} to be a high-altitude Mach3 bomber with six engines. Harrison Storms shaped the aircraft with a canard surface and a <b>delta</b> <b>wing,</b> which was built largely of stainless steel, sandwiched honeycomb panels, and titanium.

5|$|Aware of the {{problems}} revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and <b>delta</b> <b>wing.</b> McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below the turbulent air under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.|$|E
5|$|Further {{proposals}} {{based on}} the <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> resulted in {{two versions of the}} design known as C104: the single engine C104/4 and twin-engined C104/2. The designs were otherwise similar, using a low-mounted delta-wing; the primary advantages of the C104/2 were a larger overall size which offered a much larger internal weapons bay, at the time a cutting-edge feature in a fighter, and gave it twin-engine reliability. The proposals were submitted to the RCAF in June 1952.|$|E

5|$|In {{order for}} the Tornado to perform well as a {{low-level}} supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed flight characteristics. To achieve high-speed performance, a swept or <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing. This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft, such as the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The F-111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado; however, the Tornado differs in being a multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.|$|E
5|$|The TSR-2 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} two Bristol-Siddeley Olympus reheated turbojets, {{advanced}} variants of those used in the Avro Vulcan. The Olympus would be further developed and would power the supersonic Concorde. The design featured a small shoulder-mounted <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> with down-turned tips, an all-moving swept tailplane and a large all-moving fin. Blown flaps were fitted across the entire trailing edge of the wing to achieve the short takeoff and landing requirement, something that later designs would achieve with the technically more complex swing-wing approach. No ailerons were fitted, control in roll instead being implemented by differential movement of the slab tailplanes. The wing loading was high for its time, enabling the aircraft to fly at very high speed and low level with great stability without being constantly upset by thermals and other ground-related weather phenomena. The EE Chief Test Pilot, Wing Commander Roland Beamont, favourably compared the TSR-2's supersonic flying characteristics to the Canberra's own subsonic flight characteristics, stating that the Canberra was more troublesome.|$|E
5|$|Required {{to tender}} {{by the end}} of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by {{technical}} director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US, they investigated German Second World War swept wing research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the <b>delta</b> <b>wing,</b> Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb-bays.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the aerodynamics of sharp leading-edge <b>delta</b> <b>wings</b> at supersonic speeds has been conducted. The supporting experimental data for this investigation were taken from published force, pressure, and flow-visualization data in which the Mach number normal to the wing leading edge is always less than 1. 0. The individual upper- and lower-surface nonlinear characteristics for uncambered <b>delta</b> <b>wings</b> are determined and presented in three charts. The upper-surface data show that both the normal-force coefficient and minimum pressure coefficient increase nonlinearly with a decreasing slope with increasing angle of attack. The lower-surface normal-force coefficient was shown to be independent of Mach number and to increase nonlinearly, with an increasing slope, with increasing angle of attack. These charts are then used to define a wing-design space for sharp leading-edge <b>delta</b> <b>wings...</b>|$|R

Mission requirements discussed include tactical and strategic penetration, maneuverability, load-carrying capability, low detectability, low cost, and ease of carriage and storage. In general, delta configurations offer high speed and good load-carrying ability at low altitudes; parasol configurations give high lift and low drag at high altitude and speed; and monoplanar-elliptical configurations have high lift and low drag with good maneuvering and stability...|$|R
5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or <b>delta</b> <b>wing.</b> This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had {{been found to be}} a small, straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch (25mm) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, Fairey Aviation, a British {{aircraft}} manufacturer, had {{become interested in}} <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> technology and proceeded to submit multiple submissions based on the <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> concept to the Ministry of Supply. The Ministry, being interested in these proposals, issued orders for models to test the envisioned <b>delta</b> <b>wing,</b> {{the first of which}} being built in 1947; testing was performed by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). The program was succeeded multiple times, including an investigation into potential VTOL operations, leading to further flight tests of the <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> models to be conducted in Cardigan Bay, Wales and Woomera, Australia. In 1947, Air Ministry Specification E.10/47 was issued for a full-scale piloted <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> aircraft, resulting in the Fairey Delta 1, which conducted its maiden flight at RAF Boscombe Down on 12 March 1951.|$|E

25|$|The Javelin was the RAF's first {{purpose-built}} all-weather interceptor aircraft. Aerodynamic {{features of}} the type included its adoption of the new <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> and a large tailplane. Fuel and armaments were housed in the <b>delta</b> <b>wing,</b> while the engines and crew were contained within the fuselage. The <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> and tailplane combination had been deemed necessary by Gloster for effective manoeuvrability at high speed and for the aircraft to be controllable at low landing speeds. In one instance during testing, when both elevators had been torn off by elevator flutter, the Javelin remained controllable {{in part due to}} the aerodynamic qualities of the large tailplane. Changes from the prototypes included alterations to the rear fuselage and lengthened engine jet exhausts, to eliminate buffeting of the rudder by the jet exhaust and increased sweepback of the wing's leading edge to improve high-speed handling.|$|E

25|$|Early on, IAI {{decided to}} adopt a <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> configuration, of which the company was already {{familiar}} with through its work on the earlier Kfir, which was paired with large, steerable canards situated forward of the wing. The <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> arrangement was relatively low-weight, provided space for considerable fuel capacity, a smooth low-altitude fight attitude, {{and high levels of}} directional stability while flown at high angles of attack (AOA). The canard generated additional lift and positive control when at high AOAs. While this configuration afforded excellent maneuverability, it also exhibited natural instability during flight. To compensate, the Lavi was fitted with a sophisticated digital fly-by-wire system which allowed the aircraft {{to take advantage of this}} particular wing design while eliminating this shortcoming. The Lavi was one of the first aircraft to feature this type of configuration, which has since become more commonplace amongst fighter aircraft.|$|E
