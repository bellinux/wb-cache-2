5000|$|On 28 August 1852, fifty {{prominent}} Memphis citizens each contributed $500 <b>for</b> <b>stock</b> <b>certificates</b> {{in order}} to purchase 40 acre of land for the cemetery; they envisioned that this land would be a park for the living {{as well as the}} dead, where family outings, picnics, and social gatherings could occur. It {{was meant to be a}} place where beautiful gardens were tended and individual monuments celebrated both life and death. The name for the place was chosen in a drawing: several proposed names were put into a hat and Elmwood was drawn by animators, with the stockholders stating they were [...] "well pleased" [...] with the selection. Ironically, they had to hurriedly order some elms trees from New York to place among the native oaks of Memphis, since there were no elms in the area. After the American Civil War, the property was expanded to 80 acre for another $40,000. In the 1870s, the original corporation controlling the cemetery was dissolved and it became one of the oldest nonprofits in Tennessee.|$|E
40|$|An artifact-metric system using {{magnetic}} fibers can {{be applied}} <b>for</b> authentications of <b>stock</b> <b>certificate,</b> bill, passport, plastic cards and other documents. Security {{of the system is}} guaranteed by its feature of difficulty in copy. This authentication system is based on randomly dispersed magnetic fibers embedded in documents. In this paper, a theoretical analysis was performed in order to evaluate this system. The position of the magnetic fibers was determined by a conventional function of random number generator. By measuring output waveforms by a magnetoresistance (MR.) sensor, a false match rate (FMR) could be calculated. Optimizations of the density of the magnetic fibers and the dimension of the MR sensor were achieved. ...|$|R
50|$|During the 1700s the Amsterdam stock {{exchange}} had close {{links with the}} London {{stock exchange}}, and the two would often list each other's stocks. To clear the trades, time was required <b>for</b> the physical <b>stock</b> <b>certificate</b> or cash to move from Amsterdam to London and back. This led to a standard settlement period of 14 days, which was the time it usually took for a courier to make the journey between the two cities. Most exchanges copied the model, which {{was used for the}} next few hundred years. With the advent of the computer in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a move to reduce settlement times in most exchanges, leading to a new standard of three days, known as T+3.|$|R

To clear the trades, time was required <b>for</b> the physical <b>stock</b> <b>certificate</b> or cash to move from Amsterdam to London and back.

Most exchanges continued {{to use the same}} model over the next few hundred years. With the advent of new technology in the 1970s and 1980s there was a move to reduce settlement times, and settlement dates in most exchanges reduced to five days (known as T+5) then down to three days (known as T+3 or Trade date plus three days).|$|R
50|$|<b>Stock</b> <b>certificates</b> are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} forms: registered <b>stock</b> <b>certificates</b> and bearer <b>stock</b> <b>certificates.</b> A registered <b>stock</b> <b>certificate</b> is normally only evidence of title, and {{a record of the}} true holders of the shares will appear in the stockholder's register of the corporation.|$|R
40|$|Diplomas {{are like}} <b>stock</b> <b>certificates.</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>certificates</b> are possessed by people to prove partial {{ownership}} through corporate shares.

Paraphrased from Our University: <b>Stock</b> <b>Certificates,</b> February 14, 2008 Walter V.

50|$|The Odee Company in the 1930s-1960s was {{the largest}} legal form {{publisher}} in Texas. It became the Southwest distributor for Goes Lithography in 1924 <b>for</b> its <b>stock</b> and border blank printing. The region included the states of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Louisiana, Colorado, Arkansas, Mississippi and Kansas. Goes Litho was established in 1879 and printed many of the <b>stock</b> <b>certificates</b> of the time, many of which became collector's items. Although untrackable, many <b>stock</b> <b>certificates</b> sold in the aforementioned states were bought from the Odee Company. All of the artwork from the borders is copyrighted, and all Goes Lithography artwork bore an embedded, very small and unobtrusive, Goes insignia.|$|R

50|$|A bearer <b>stock</b> <b>certificate,</b> as {{its name}} implies is a bearer instrument, and {{physical}} possession of the certificate entitles the holder to exercise all legal rights associated with the <b>stock.</b> Bearer <b>stock</b> <b>certificates</b> are becoming uncommon: they were popular in offshore jurisdictions for their perceived confidentiality, and as a useful way to transfer beneficial title to assets (held by the corporation) without payment of stamp duty. International initiatives have curbed the use of bearer <b>stock</b> <b>certificates</b> in offshore jurisdictions, and tend to be available only in onshore financial centres, although they are rarely seen in practice.|$|R
