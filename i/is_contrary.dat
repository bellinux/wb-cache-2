5|$|Developments in AspectJ have {{revealed}} {{the potential to}} incorporate just-in-time compilation into the execution of aspect-oriented code to address performance demands. At run-time, an aspect weaver could translate aspects in a more efficient manner than traditional, static weaving approaches. Using AspectJ on a Java Virtual Machine, dynamic weaving of aspects at run-time {{has been shown to}} improve code performance by 26%. While some implementations of just-in-time virtual machines implement this capability through a new virtual machine, some implementations can be designed to use features that already exist in current virtual machines. The requirement of a new virtual machine <b>is</b> <b>contrary</b> to one of the original design goals of AspectJ.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of partial sequences of 16S rDNA of 18 distinct species {{carried out by}} Sutcharit and colleagues (2007) indicate that Amphidromus is a monophyletic group. In their study, different cladograms obtained through distinct methods such as maximum parsimony, neighbor joining and maximum likelihood were congruent among themselves. Though the topology obtained for the subgenus Amphidromus was fairly consistent with current taxonomy, the phylogeny of sinistral Syndromus species showed no such correspondence. Also according to their results, enantiomorphy {{seems to be the}} ancestral state of shell coiling in the genus Amphidromus, which <b>is</b> <b>contrary</b> to the general expectation of dextrally coiled shells as an ancestral condition.|$|E

5|$|Some {{people have}} opposed {{feminism}} {{on the grounds}} that they believe it <b>is</b> <b>contrary</b> to traditional values or religious beliefs.

5|$|Due to the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, the exercise of the subjectively worded powers in the ISA is not judicially reviewable by the courts, except when {{there has been some}} non-compliance with the procedures set out in the Act. On the other hand, the objective test laid down in Chng Suan Tze continues to be the law governing judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under subjectively worded provisions in statutes other than the ISA. In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal opined that the 1989 legislative amendments did not completely reverse Chng Suan Tze. Apart from restricting the courts' supervisory jurisdiction to reviewing decisions made under the ISA for procedural impropriety, Parliament did not disturb the principle laid down in Chng Suan Tze that the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion– that is, power without legal limits– <b>is</b> <b>contrary</b> to the rule of law, which demands that courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. Since Parliament did not undermine this principle when it legislatively reversed Chng Suan Tze, it should be taken to have implicitly endorsed the principle.|$|E
