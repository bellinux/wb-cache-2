40|$|Learners {{sometimes}} have incoherent and fragmented intuitive prior {{knowledge that is}} (partly) ‘incompatible’ with the to-be-learned contents. Such knowledge in pieces can cause conceptual disorientation and cognitive overload while learning. We hypothesized that a pre-training intervention providing a generalized schema as a structuring framework for such knowledge in pieces would support (re) organizing-processes of prior knowledge and thus reduce unnecessary cognitive load during subsequent learning. Fifty-six student teachers participated in the experiment. A <b>framework</b> <b>group</b> underwent a pre-training intervention providing a generalized, categorical schema for categorizing primary learning strategies and related but different strategies as a cognitive framework for (re-) organizing their prior knowledge. Our control group received comparable factual information but no framework. Afterwards, all participants learned about primary learning strategies. The <b>framework</b> <b>group</b> claimed to possess higher levels of interest and self-efficacy, achieved higher learning outcomes, and learned more efficiently. Hence, providing a categorical framework can help overcome the barrier of incorrect prior knowledge in pieces...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model integrating Schneider’s Attraction-Selection-Attrition (ASA) <b>framework,</b> <b>group</b> personality composition, and group performance is presented. The proposed model focuses on three operationalizations of group composition {{based on the}} Big Five personality traits. This model suggests that for certain types of teams group minimum scores vary more than group mean scores, resulting in more robust predictors of group effectiveness. Results indi-cate that group minimum Agreeableness and Conscientiousness correlate pos-itively with supervisor ratings of performance, group average scores correlate positively with performance, and variance of Conscientiousness correlate inversely with group performance. Minimum scores for both Agreeableness and Conscientiousness vary more than mean scores, and teams with increased levels of both Agreeableness and Conscientiousness receive higher perfor-mance ratings than other types of teams. Initial support for the proposed model is presented, practical and research implications are discussed, and future directions for research are suggested...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In component-based {{software}} development, {{object-oriented design}} (OOD) frameworks are increasingly recognised as better units of reuse than objects. This is because OOD <b>frameworks</b> are <b>groups</b> of interacting objects, {{and as such}} they can better reflect practical systems in which objects {{tend to have more}} than one role in more than one context. In this paper, we show how to formally specify OOD frameworks, and briefly discuss their implementation and configuration management.

40|$|International audienceWith {{the ability}} to study brain anatomy in vivo using {{magnetic}} resonance imaging, studies on regional brain atrophy suggest possible improvements for differential diagnosis of movement disorders with parkinsonian symptoms. In this study, we investigate effects of different parkinsonian syndromes on the cortical gray matter thickness and the geometric shape of the cerebral cortex. The study consists {{of a total of}} 24 patients with a diagnosis of probable progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple systems atrophy (MSA) or idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). We examine dense estimates of cortical gray matter thickness, sulcal depth, and measures of the curvature in a surface-based cortical morphometry analysis <b>framework.</b> <b>Group</b> difference results indicate higher cortical atrophy rate in the frontal lobe in PSP patients when compared to either MSA or IPD. These findings are indicative of the potential use of routine MRI and cortical morphometry in performing differential diagnosis in PSP, MSA and IPD...|$|E

Indeed the design framework for the selected type shows strong influence of group creativity on the individual creativity which in turns singles out a particular architectural historical preference...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to: - identify information requirements of potential user groups of IIASA's Sustainable Boreal forest Resources (FOR) Project; and, - discuss critical aspects of remote sensing technology transfer. An internal workshop, including researchers of the Institutional <b>Framework</b> <b>Group</b> (Case Study I) and the Carbon Group (Case Study II), was designed as a platform to identify information requirements specific to these groups. The critical aspects of remote sensing technology transfer that were identified served as guidelines for the workshop design. the workshop is evaluated using the results of a questionnaire provided to the participants. The results of this study could be as a decision-support with regard to future remote sensing activities within the FOR project. The critical aspects of remote sensing technology transfer that were identified could serve as guidance for the remote sensing community to improve the potential for remote sensing applications. The author conducted this work during a three-month period as a participant of IIASA's 1999 Young Scientists Summer Program. ...|$|E
