40|$|Organizational control, {{defined as}} efforts to {{increase}} the chances that employees of an organization work toward achieving organizational goals, {{is believed to have}} positive effects on performance. However, few studies have tested this assumption. This research draws on theories of control and coordination to investigate the relationship between control and information systems (IS) development performance. It consists of analyses of two research models, one at the individual level of analysis, and the other at the team level of analysis. The individual-level model investigates how control affects individual <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> task and individual coordination success, and proposes that these relationships are moderated by controlees' perceptions of how effectively a controller can monitor their work behaviors and outcomes. The team-level model investigates two mediators through which control may affect IS development performance: team <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> task, and team coordination success. A field survey was conducted, and completed matched survey responses from 106 managers and team members involved in 36 different IS development projects were used to test the hypotheses. The results suggest that control does have a positive relationship with <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> task and coordination success. Specifically, clan control was positively associated with coordination success at the individual and team levels, and with team <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> task. Outcome control was positively associated with individual <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> task. In addition, the relationship between outcome control and individual <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> task was moderated by team member perceptions of the difficulty of observing outcomes. At high levels of difficulty of observing outcomes, high levels of outcome control resulted in higher effort than at low levels of difficulty of observing outcomes. Control was also positively related to performance outcomes. Behavior control was associated with reduced overruns of resources such as time, budget, and systems and programming effort. Outcome control was positively associated with product performance, which represents the quality, ease-of-use, and functionality of the system developed or enhanced by the project. Clan control was associated with both improved product performance and reduced resource overruns. No support was found for mediation of the effects of control on performance by <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> task or coordination success...|$|R

40|$|Current {{methods in}} {{assessing}} a person’s receptivity to feedback are inherently biased. First, these methods are founded upon differing assumptions about feedback availability. Feedback seeking, operationalized as <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> acquiring feedback, assumes feedback must be actively sought, also thus assumes feedback is not imminent. Feedback avoidance, operationalized as <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> delaying or avoid receipt of feedback, assumes feedback must be actively avoided, and thus also assumes feedback is imminent. Second, {{implicit in the}} methods’ definitions of <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> or away from feedback {{is the assumption that}} feedback receptivity results from a motivated state rather than being influenced by default feedback availability. This research provides a more comprehensive account of feedback receptivity by systematically varying both motivations and feedback availability and examining their relative effects on receptivity. The data supported the influence of motivated factors on receptivity but failed to support the influence of defaulted feedback availability on receptivity. Further, coping resources, perceived utility, and perceived feedback recommendation influenced receptivity. These results may help managers leverage this knowledge to maximize feedback receptivity behaviors in the workplace. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the problem faced by two regulators in providing incentives {{to a common}} (privately informed) regulated firm under various degrees of coordination. In the model, the firm exerts <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> cost reduction and self-dealing, and incentives can be input-based (monitoring) and output-based (demanded cost targets). Full coordination between the regulators leads to the second best allocation. A setting in which the regulators do not fully coordinate leads to (i) higher overall monitoring (more aggressive input-based incentives) and (ii) higher demanded cost targets (i. e., more lenience in terms of output-based incentives). As a consequence of (i), in all possible equilibria, the <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> cost reduction will be smaller when the agent reports to two regulators who do not coordinate. (i) and (ii) imply that {{the impact on the}} <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> self-dealing activities is ambiguous. In our leading example, self-dealing will be larger if the regulators coordinate on monitoring levels but smaller if they choose monitoring levels independently.

For both managers and subordinates, higher quality LMX relationships were reported and expectations were met when the other member of the dyad put forth effort into relationship development. One’s own higher effort coupled with lower effort by the other {{was associated with a}} lower quality LMX relationship. Examination of the 4 dimensions of LMX (R. C. Liden 2 ̆ 6 J. M.

In addition, LMX and relationship tenure interacted, showing that future <b>effort</b> <b>toward</b> relationship development was greatest when individuals had been in higher quality relationships for longer periods of time...|$|R
