5|$|Also, third <b>eyelid.</b> A {{transparent}} or translucent third <b>eyelid</b> that {{is drawn}} across the eye for protection, to moisten it while maintaining vision. The nictitating membrane also covers {{the eye and}} acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. With the exception of pigeons {{and a few other}} species, most birds blink only with their nictitating membrane, and when not sleeping, use the eyelids chiefly only when the eye is threatened with some foreign matter.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} {{differentiation}} of snake scales is a transparent scale called the brille or spectacle which covers {{the eye of}} the snake. The brille {{is often referred to as}} a fused <b>eyelid.</b> It is shed as part of the old skin during moulting.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{also have}} a third <b>eyelid</b> known as a nictitating membrane, whereas most other {{primates}} have a lesser developed plica semilunaris. The nictitating membrane keeps the cornea moist and clean by sweeping across the eye.|$|E
50|$|One special {{detail about}} adipose <b>eyelids</b> is {{their ability to}} filter out {{specific}} wavelengths of light. For example, different fish have a different concentration of epithelial tissue in their <b>eyelids.</b> However, there is a range {{that most of the}} <b>eyelids</b> will filter. Most adipose <b>eyelids</b> can filter out light that has a wavelength shorter than 305 nanometers. Another fact is that these <b>eyelids</b> can also reflect light and this level of reflection corresponds to polarization of the light and the angle at which it is shone. To test for these ranges, different fish <b>eyelids</b> were exposed to light generated from photometers and polarizing microscopes.|$|R
40|$|The {{anatomy and}} {{development}} of the <b>eyelids</b> in squamate reptiles are still relatively unknown, considering its variation within the group. The neotropical Gymnophthalmini are traditionally characterized by having lost the <b>eyelids,</b> but their structure is not well described. In this study, the embryonic development and the adult morphology of the gymnophthalmid eye, with special attention to the <b>eyelids,</b> the nictitating membrane, and the spectacle are described. The eye in some Gymnophthalmini is covered by a spectacle, formed by the embryonic fusion of the dorsal and ventral <b>eyelids,</b> a character possibly synapomorphic to the tribe. The genus Tretioscincus, which floats either as sister to all other Gymnophthalmini, or is nested within the group, is unique in showing functional and movable <b>eyelids.</b> Thus, the presence of functional <b>eyelids</b> can be either considered as the primitive condition for the gymnophthalmini or as a re-acquisition of the character, showing the importance of a well-established phylogenetic hypothesis for understanding morphological evolution...|$|R
5000|$|Periorbital {{dermatitis}} (also {{known as}} [...] "periocular dermatitis") is a skin condition, {{a variant of}} perioral dermatitis, occurring on the lower <b>eyelids</b> and skin adjacent to {{the upper and lower}} <b>eyelids.</b>|$|R
5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} entropion, which is a {{disorder}} that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against {{the surface of the}} eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the lower <b>eyelid</b> on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper <b>eyelid</b> can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the <b>eyelid</b> along with wetness on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for entropion, and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the Chow Chow, Great Dane, Golden Retriever and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Ectropion is {{the outward}} rolling of the <b>eyelid,</b> which {{abnormally}} exposes the eye, resulting in irritation. Because {{of the increased}} exposure, the dog can develop allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca also known as dry-eye syndrome. It is most commonly found in breeds with exaggerated facial features such as the Boxer, Bloodhound, Gordon Setter {{as well as the}} English and American Cocker Spaniels, and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Entropion is the inward rolling of the <b>eyelid,</b> {{commonly}} {{the lower}} lid. This in turn irritates the cornea {{of the eye}} and can cause visual impairment. It is a hereditary disorder seen in both English and American Cocker Spaniels, King Charles Spaniels, English Springer Spaniels plus a variety of non spaniel breeds.|$|E

5|$|Stone's tears first {{roll down}} her face in micro-gravity, and are later seen {{floating}} off her face. After being pushed from her eye by her <b>eyelid,</b> the surface tension is not sufficient for the tears to continue adhering to her jawline. However, the movie correctly portrays the spherical nature of drops of liquid in a micro-gravity environment.|$|E
5|$|The eyes {{can focus}} independently, and are {{specialized}} with a duplex retina that contains {{two types of}} visual cells for both day and night vision, and a tapetum lucidum which reflects onto the retina to enhance vision in the dark. There is also a third <b>eyelid</b> on each eye, the nictitating membrane.|$|E
50|$|A sage, finding {{sleep to}} be an unwelcome {{obstruction}} to his pursuit of enlightenment, cuts off his <b>eyelids</b> and throws them away. At the spot where his <b>eyelids</b> land grows a shrub whose leaves look like his <b>eyelids.</b> Later, during a famine, the shrub is rediscovered and {{used to make a}} potion that soon becomes famous enough to catch the attention of the emperor, who subsequently bestows great honors on Wan.|$|R
50|$|Eye problems: The <b>eyelids</b> can {{be pulled}} {{down by the}} {{tightness}} of the skin and this can make <b>eyelids</b> (but usually just the lower one) very red and they are prone to drying and irritation.|$|R
50|$|The orbital septum (Palpebral fascia) is a {{membranous}} {{sheet that}} acts as the anterior boundary of the orbit. It extends from the orbital rims to the <b>eyelids.</b> It forms the fibrous portion of the <b>eyelids.</b>|$|R
5|$|Damage to the {{oculomotor nerve}} (III) can cause double vision (diplopia) and {{inability}} {{to coordinate the}} movements of both eyes (strabismus), also <b>eyelid</b> drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis). Lesions may also lead to inability to open the eye due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to alleviate symptoms due to paralysis {{of one or more}} of the eye muscles it controls.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the type}} of tumor, paraneoplastic phenomena—symptoms not due to the local {{presence}} of cancer—may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies). Tumors {{in the top of the}} lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the <b>eyelid</b> and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial plexus.|$|E
5|$|Maeda {{wrote the}} episode after being {{inspired}} by the situation of a real-life French journalist, Jean-Dominique Bauby, who had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left <b>eyelid.</b> The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and was created by Maeda {{in the hopes that}} he would go on to be a memorable villain. Effects expert Mat Beck created the unique visual sequence that showed Doggett and Lukesh traveling between the different universes. To create the effect of a parallel universe, every scene in the episode's teaser was flipped so that the mirror image was shown.|$|E

5|$|Meibomian glands, in the <b>eyelids,</b> secrete {{a form of}} sebum called meibum {{onto the}} eye, that slows the {{evaporation}} of tears. It also serves to create an airtight seal when the eyes are closed and its lipid quality also prevents the <b>eyelids</b> from sticking together. The meibomian glands are also known as tarsal glands, Zeis glands and palpebral glands. They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the <b>eyelids.</b>|$|R
5|$|Many birds show plumage {{patterns}} in ultraviolet that are {{invisible to the}} human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar {{to the naked eye}} are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. With the exception of pigeons and a few other species, the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third <b>eyelid</b> that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten.|$|E
5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the <b>eyelid,</b> conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E
5|$|The muzzle is {{narrow and}} long. The lower <b>eyelid</b> {{contains}} a large, transparent disk. The head is olive-brown.

The tail is light brown above, but has two rows of darker spots, and yellowish white below. Snout-to-vent length is 83mm (3.3in), head length 10mm (0.39in), head width 6.5mm (0.26in), length of the body 33mm (1.3in), length of the forelimb 15mm (0.59in), length of the hindlimb 23mm (0.91in), and length of the (incomplete) tail 40mm (1.6in).|$|E

40|$|We used lid bracing sutures, buried sutures, {{and skin}} {{resection}} operations to correct epiblepharon in Japanese children. Epiblepharon and ocular irritation in 103 children (254 <b>eyelids)</b> were treated first with lid bracing sutures. Postoperatively the inversion of eyelashes resolved in 73 patients (196 <b>eyelids).</b> Of these 103 patients 30 (58 <b>eyelids)</b> developed recurrences, which included 11 who also complained of foreign body sensation and ocular pain. These 11 patients (22 <b>eyelids)</b> underwent a second surgical procedure (buried sutures or skin resection) {{before they became}} free of symptoms. No severe complications were noted {{in any of the}} 103 patients. We believe that lid bracing sutures correct most cases of mild epiblepharon in children and that buried sutures or skin resection are valuable for more severe conditions...|$|R
40|$|Most {{types of}} {{epithelial}} tumour of the <b>eyelids,</b> conjunctiva, and cornea occur in all species; {{the most common}} type occurring in any species is bovine squamous cell carcinoma. Iridociliary epithelial tumours and malignant melanomas are the most important intraocular tumours. The histological features of the tumours are described under the following main headings: epithelial tumours of the <b>eyelids,</b> conjunctiva, and cornea; mesenchymal tumours (extraocular, optic nerve and nerve sheath, and uveal tract); neuroectodermal tumours; and melanogenic tumours of the <b>eyelids</b> and conjunctiva and of the uveal tract...|$|R
5|$|The night shark has {{a slender}} build with an elongated, pointed snout. The nares are flanked by {{moderately}} developed flaps of skin. The eyes are large, circular, and green in life, with irregularly shaped pupils and a nictitating membrane (protective third <b>eyelid).</b> The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows {{at the corners}} and usually bears 15 tooth rows {{on either side of}} both jaws, plus 12 upper and 1 lower symphysial (jaw midline) tooth rows. Each upper tooth has a smooth to serrated edge, a narrow cusp becoming more oblique towards the corner of the mouth, and 25 coarse serrations {{at the base of the}} trailing margin. The number and size of serrations on the leading margin of the tooth cusp increase relative to those on the trailing margin as the animal grows older. The lower teeth are upright and smooth-edged. The five pairs of gill slits are rather short.|$|E
5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of {{part of the brain}} supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies {{the part of the brain}} that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss (on one side of the visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping <b>eyelid,</b> constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face.|$|E
5|$|The puffadder shyshark is more slender {{than other}} shysharks, with a short, broad, dorsally {{flattened}} {{head and a}} narrowly rounded snout. The large, oval-shaped eyes have cat-like slit pupils, a simple nictitating membrane (a protective third <b>eyelid),</b> and a prominent ridge underneath. The nostrils are very large, {{with a pair of}} greatly expanded, triangular flaps of skin in front that are fused together and reach the mouth. There is a deep groove connecting the excurrent (outflow) opening of each nostril to the mouth, obscured by the nasal flaps. The mouth is short with furrows at the corners on both jaws. There are 26–30 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 27–33 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Tooth shape is sexually dimorphic: those of males are longer and three-pointed, while those of females are shorter and five-pointed. Unusually, the two halves of the lower jaw are connected by a special cartilage, which allows a more even distribution of teeth and may increase bite strength.|$|E
50|$|The Meibomian glands (often {{written with}} a small m, and also called tarsal glands) are {{a special kind of}} sebaceous gland at the rim of the <b>eyelids</b> inside the tarsal plate, {{responsible}} for the supply of meibum, an oily substance that prevents evaporation of the eye's tear film. Meibum prevents tear spillage onto the cheek, trapping tears between the oiled edge and the eyeball, and makes the closed lids airtight. There are approximately 50 glands on the upper <b>eyelids</b> and 25 glands on the lower <b>eyelids.</b>|$|R
