40|$|Abstract- We {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} optical network designs using relatively few switch nodes at which wavelength conversion and electronic regeneration is possible. A simple heuristic for placing the fewest such nodes to reach a given blocking probability {{is based on the}} ranked frequency of shortest-path routes transiting each node. This strategy is found to be efficient in designing a “translucent ” optical network with sparse <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> placement that performs very close in blocking to that of an “opaque ” optical network. In addition, we apply a new 2 -D Dijkstra’s algorithm for routing and wavelength assignment in the resultant translucent optical network. Simulation results indicate that a translucent optical network with sparse <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> placement based on the heuristic has much lower blocking than a fully transparent optical network when the constraint of the maximum transparent distance before regeneration is also considered. Moreover by placing the switches according to the heuristic, lightpath blocking can approach that of a fully opaque network with significantly fewer <b>electronic</b> <b>switches</b> in total. In our results, lightpath blocking as low as the fully opaque network case was obtained with <b>electronic</b> <b>switches</b> selectively placed at approximately 1 node in 3 on average.
