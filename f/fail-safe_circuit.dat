25|$|Many gas-fed heating {{appliances}} such as ovens and water heaters {{make use of}} a pilot flame to ignite the main gas burner when required. If the pilot flame goes out, unburned gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>circuit</b> to sense when the pilot light is burning. The tip of the thermocouple {{is placed in the}} pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply valve which feeds gas to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and the pilot gas valve is held open. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.|$|E
5000|$|A push {{to break}} switch does the opposite, i.e. when the button is not pressed, {{electricity}} can flow, {{but when it}} is pressed the circuit is broken. This type of switch {{is also known as}} a Normally Closed (NC) Switch. (Examples: Fridge Light Switch, Alarm Switches in <b>Fail-Safe</b> <b>circuits)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Low-voltage {{differential}} signaling (LVDS) is {{a widely}} used differential signaling technology for highspeed digital-signal interconnections. In many applications, the LVDS receiver needs a fail-safe function to avoid an uncertain output state when the input is connected improperly. In this application note, we will examine the circuit design and performance characteristics of three popular fail-safe functions. Comparative analysis of circuit designs will guide readers {{in the use of}} <b>fail-safe</b> <b>circuits</b> for high-speed data-transfer applications...|$|R
40|$|ISBN: 0080375359 Presents briefly {{the theory}} of {{generalized}} fail-safe systems which includes new, more general definitions, construction conditions and basic properties for fail-safe systems. Then, {{in order to take}} into account the problem of undetectable faults, we define strongly <b>fail-safe</b> <b>circuits</b> who achieve the totally fail-safe goal. As an application the authors propose a fail-safe integrated interface which transforms the outputs of self-checking systems into signal adequate to drive electromechanical actuators and such that the whole system, self checking processing part and interface, implemented in VLSI is strongly fail-safe. Therefore this system can be used for safe drive of complex critical processes...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "battleshort" [...] mode ("melt-before-fail") {{prevented}} <b>fail-safe</b> <b>circuits</b> such as fuses from deactivating {{the machine}} e.g., during a missile launch. The last Athena-controlled launch was a Thor-Agena missile launched in 1972 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, {{the last of}} over 400 missile flights using the Athena. The 26 Athena computers, when declared surplus by the Federal Government, went to various United States universities. The one at Carnegie {{was used as an}} undergraduate project until 1971, when the former electrical engineering undergraduate students (Athena Systems Development Group) orchestrated its donation to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|R
40|$|Hard Over Monitoring Equipment (HOME) {{has been}} {{designed}} to complement and enhance the flight safety of a flight research helicopter. HOME is an independent, highly reliable, and fail-safe special purpose computer that monitors the flight control commands issued by the flight control computer of the helicopter. In particular, HOME detects the issuance of a hazardous hard-over command for any of the four flight control axes and transfers the control of the helicopter to the flight safety pilot. The design of HOME incorporates certain reliability and fail-safe enhancement design features, such as triple modular redundancy, majority logic voting, <b>fail-safe</b> dual <b>circuits,</b> independent status monitors, in-flight self-test, and a built-in preflight exerciser. The HOME design and operation is described with special emphasis on the reliability and fail-safe aspects of the design...|$|R
40|$|Remote power {{controllers}} (RPCs) {{are solid}} state devices that combine in one unit {{the capability to}} perform all the needed functions of load switching, overload protection, and a direct indication of whether the load is on or off. They provide total system protection of equipment and wires. RPCs {{are designed to be}} located near the load and communicate control and status information remotely via low level signals of a few milliwatts. The design and operation of the RPC are considered, taking into account the operation of an RPC, the RPC power switch and drive circuits, control and trip <b>circuits,</b> <b>fail-safe</b> devices, and RPC overcurrent protection. Attention is given to the RPC development status, RPC applications, and RPC perspectives...|$|R
40|$|A plot of radioiodines {{produced}} by thermal fission of U/sup 235 / {{as a function}} of time after fission is presented, and a high-expansion fire control system for glove boxes using argon [...] aqueous ammonium lauryl sulfate foams is described. In development of analytical and measuring methods, an infrared spectrophotometric analysis of vapors in calibration bottles is reported along with modification of the Davis halide meter for continuous atmospheric monitoring of methyl chloroform and development of arc sensitivity conversion factors for use with a 3. 4 -meter spectrograph in the case of 33 elements. In other work a long-service sprayable polyurethane flooring material was developed which provides safety in high-explosive handling areas. Shielding for the proposed increased Cockcroft-Walton ion accelerator beam power level is discussed. Results of floor finish evaluations are given in which three were selected as superior in regard to antislip qaalities, lasting appearance, and cost. The description of a method to convert from <b>fail-safe</b> fire detection <b>circuit</b> to a fully supervised circuit is included along with nomographs for simplification of air-sampling calculations.

25|$|The Automatic Train Protection {{sub-system}} uses coded {{track circuit}} technology originally supplied by Rochester, New York-based General Railway Signal when {{the line was}} constructed in the 1970s. It is a life-critical system that provides a continuous stream of information to the train regarding the maximum safe speed via the running rails. Speed commands are designed to ensure trains maintain a safe stopping distance from any obstruction and do not exceed the speed limit for any segment of track. The system stops trains in advance of any other train traffic, and before stop signals at interlockings. The cab signalling system relies on track circuits to detect track occupancy, and thus send the appropriate speed code. Although the ATP system {{was designed to be}} <b>fail-safe,</b> the track <b>circuit</b> control equipment on which it relies has been prone to parasitic oscillations which can cause the system intermittently to fail to detect the presence of a train. This resulted in the 2009 collision, after which Metro began to operate all trains manually. In September 2014, Metro began reintroducing its computerized control system after taking a number of measures to avoid accidents similar to the 2009 accident.|$|R
