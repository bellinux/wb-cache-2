25|$|Electrical wiring {{distributes}} {{electric power}} inside residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, mobile homes, recreational vehicles, boats, and substations at voltages up to 600 V. The {{thickness of the}} wire is based on amperage requirements in conjunction with safe operating temperatures. Solid wire is used for smaller diameters; thicker diameters are stranded to provide flexibility. Conductor types include non-metallic/non-metallic corrosion-resistant cable (two or more insulated conductors with a nonmetallic outer sheath), armored or BX cable (cables are surrounded by a flexible metal enclosure), metal clad cable, service entrance cable, underground <b>feeder</b> <b>cable,</b> TC cable, fire resistant cable, and mineral insulated cable, including mineral-insulated copper-clad cable. Copper is commonly used for building wire because of its conductivity, strength, and reliability. Over {{the life of a}} building wire system, copper can also be the most economical conductor.|$|E
2500|$|Non-fatal {{incidents}} {{have also}} occurred. The May 2013 Fairfield train crash resulted in 72 injuries after two trains collided following a derailment near Fairfield. On September 25, 2013, a main <b>feeder</b> <b>cable</b> from Con Edison that provided electricity to an [...] {{segment of the}} New Haven Line failed, causing electric train service over the line to halt between Mount Vernon and Harrison, New York. Metro-North used diesel locomotives and alternative bus service to carry passengers until full service was restored after 12 days of disruption.|$|E
2500|$|NEMA L21 are four-pole {{and ground}} {{connectors}} rated for 120/208V. [...] Intended for wye three-phase circuits with both neutral and ground. The pin {{in the middle}} is ground, and the blade with a right angle on the tab is neutral. [...] These connectors are common in live event power distribution. Many event production companies use power distributors with camlock connectors for <b>feeder</b> <b>cable,</b> and 12 or more L21-30 connectors which can each be broken out to three individual 120v circuits via {{the use of a}} stringer box.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{the system}} was tested to carry an up to 800 m high vlf-antenna for {{communication}} to submerged submarines. The 3 power <b>feeder</b> <b>cables</b> doubled as radiators for frequencies from 15 to 60 kHz.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the outages - which was {{undetermined}} for five days - {{appeared to be the}} company's decision to continue supplying power to the 400,000 people serviced by twenty-two <b>feeder</b> <b>cables</b> after ten of them had failed, overloading the remaining twelve. After these were repaired, a manhole-to-manhole inspection and repair of smaller cables which had also burned took place. Consolidated Edison was due to make an initial status report, regarding the outage, on August 2, 2006. Data submitted by Con Edison in August, 2006 indicated that the failed <b>feeder</b> <b>cables</b> had been in service an average of 16 years, with the oldest failed cable 59 years old.|$|R

2500|$|Circuit {{breakers}} {{are manufactured}} in standard sizes, using {{a system of}} preferred numbers to cover a range of ratings. Miniature circuit breakers have a fixed trip setting; changing the operating current value requires changing the whole circuit breaker. Larger circuit breakers can have adjustable trip settings, allowing standardized elements to be applied but with a setting intended to improve protection. For example, a circuit breaker with a 400 ampere [...] "frame size" [...] might have its overcurrent detection set to operate at only 300 amperes, to protect a <b>feeder</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E

5000|$|SMG, the Superdome's {{management}} company, recently upgraded electrical {{systems at}} the facility. In an October 15, 2012 memo, Louisiana officials {{expressed concern that}} the equipment bringing electricity into the stadium from utility company Entergy had a [...] "chance of failure". Authorities subsequently spent nearly $1 million on upgrades to the stadium, more than half of that paid to Allstar Electric to upgrade electrical <b>feeder</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{arrangement of}} equipment is evident. Floor ducting {{for the power}} supply {{is located in the}} west end of the space but has been filled in. The high tension switchgear and 1100 KVA transformer have been removed. The upper level has a concrete platform, supported on brick piers, where the rotary converter was located. The original location of the relay panel can be seen against the south wall, and the control and feeder panel against the east wall which supplied power to the <b>feeder</b> <b>cables</b> located either end {{at the top of the}} east wall. A toilet cubicle is located in the southeast corner of the space, over which an air compressor was once situated. An overhead gantry crane is still intact. A low exit door has been cut in the south wall, at a later date, and has an external timber access stair. The <b>feeder</b> <b>cables</b> were supported externally by large curved brackets on the east wall which remain intact with insulators. An AC transformer is located externally to the west.|$|R
25|$|The National Grid {{was not as}} {{developed}} {{as it is now}} and so the Corporation set out to generate the required current - the Corporation became the local domestic and industrial electricity supplier. A power station was built for Sheffield Corporation Tramways on Kelham Island by the river Don between Mowbray Street and Alma Street. <b>Feeder</b> <b>cables</b> stretched from there to the extremities of the system, covering over 40 miles of route.|$|R
50|$|The Paddington {{substation}} was automatic, {{equipped with}} an 1100 KVA transformer, a British-Thomson-Houston 1000 kW rotary converter, switchgear, support services, and an overhead crane (designed by the Tramways Department). The substation received 11000 volts AC electricity from the New Farm Power station, via an underground <b>feeder</b> <b>cable.</b> The transformer reduced this supply, which the rotary converter then converted to 600 volts DC for the tramways network.|$|E
50|$|In {{systems with}} poor {{line of sight}} or spectrum/bandwidth {{limitations}} a larger than anticipated number of transponders {{may be required to}} enhance the service. This is usually more of an issue with applying CBTC to existing transit systems in tunnels that were not designed from the outset to support it. An alternate method to improve system availability in tunnels is the use of leaky <b>feeder</b> <b>cable</b> that, while having higher initial costs (material + installation) achieves a more reliable radio link.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to steam service disruption to 15-20 buildings, telephone service and Internet connectivity were disrupted in the area. Although an underground electrical transformer and <b>feeder</b> <b>cables</b> were also damaged, {{there were no}} significant power outages reported, but customers in the affected area were asked to reduce demand. Cellular telephone service was overloaded in the immediate aftermath, and blocked calls were reported as many people in the area tried to make calls at the same time.|$|R

50|$|A balise transmits telegrams at a {{specific}} site. To allow a continuous transmission the telegrams may be sent along leaky <b>feeder</b> <b>cable</b> being up to 1000 metres long. The Euroloop cable is always connected with a balise at its end which serves as the End of Loop Marker (EOLM). The telegram structure {{is the same as}} for the balise it is connected to. Originally the Euroloop used the same frequency as the Eurobalises but that was changed for specification 2.0.1 in September 2004. Euroloops had been used in Switzerland which completed the change in July 2010.|$|E
50|$|Some {{limitations}} of the Woodhead electrification became apparent, especially {{with the advent of}} the double-headed, double-banked merry-go-round unit trains previously mentioned. Whilst such a train was climbing Worsborough Incline, all other electric trains were prohibited from entering or moving within the power section between Strafford Crossing and Aldam Junction, lest the substations at these two locations tripped out from the high current draw. Heavy current loads also caused flashovers in the oil-impregnated paper-insulated lead-covered 33kV ground-level <b>feeder</b> <b>cable</b> at locations where cable segments were joined together in sealed boxes; such loads were not present in the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway and Great Eastern 1.5kV DC schemes, both of which served only electric multiple units, not locomotive-hauled trains.|$|E
50|$|This {{inductive}} {{system was}} prone to frequent damage to the underground <b>feeder</b> <b>cables,</b> overhead cables, and the loops themselves. Later the MW transmitter {{was replaced by a}} freely radiating, low-power FM transmitter. But the last time I tuned in, an audio signal ground had dropped off somewhere, so you could only hear the difference between the left and right channel (i.e. the stereo bit, on the music). The irony was that the presenter was in mono, and was therefore completely inaudible on the broadcast.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1982. The antenna towers took {{three months to}} assemble. Smedjebacken-Boxholm made the {{drawings}} and Wibe assembled them. They weigh 70 tonnes each. In the ground around the towers, 8 km of copper wire were dug down which ends up in large copper plates to get optimal grounding. Two 350-metre-long <b>feeder</b> <b>cables</b> isolated by compressed air go from the station building {{to each of the}} antennas. The transmitter is a Telefunken S4006. Major parts of the transmitter are cooled by water with forced ventilation on some exposed parts. The efficiency lies around 73%, which is almost as high as theoretically possible.|$|R
25|$|After 1948 the Inner Circle {{line was}} used {{exclusively}} for freight trains serving sidings {{along the line}} itself, and the goods yard {{at the end of}} the Fitzroy branch. The overhead wiring for electric trains was dismantled in 1961. Only the main <b>feeder</b> <b>cables</b> needed for Epping (now South Morang) line trains, and for shunting at the Royal Park end, were retained. Significant changes occurred in 1965, when the line was singled and both legs of the triangle at the eastern end of the line were closed. This left just a single line from Royal Park to Fitzroy remaining for goods services. The line was officially closed on 31 July 1981.|$|R
