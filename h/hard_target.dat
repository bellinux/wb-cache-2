5|$|After 65 days of filming in New Orleans, Woo {{had trouble}} with the Motion Picture Association of America to secure the R rating that Universal wanted. Woo made dozens of cuts to the film until the MPAA allowed it an R rating. On its initial release, <b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> was a {{financial}} success but received mixed reviews from film critics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> was Woo's first American {{film and}} {{was also the first}} major Hollywood film made by a Chinese {{director}}. Universal Pictures was nervous about having Woo direct a feature, and sent in director Sam Raimi to look over the film's production and to take Woo's place as director if he were to fail. Woo went through several scripts finding mostly martial arts films with which he was not interested. After deciding on Chuck Pfarrer's script for <b>Hard</b> <b>Target,</b> Woo wanted to have actor Kurt Russell in the lead role, but found Russell too busy with other projects. Woo then went with Universal's initial choice of having Jean-Claude Van Damme star. Woo got along with Van Damme during filming and raised the amount of action in the film as he knew that Van Damme was up for it.|$|E
5|$|The film premiered in cinemas on August 20, 1993, in wide release {{throughout}} the U.S.. During its opening weekend, the film opened {{in second place}} grossing $10,106,500 in business showing at 1,972 locations. The film The Fugitive, came in first place during that weekend grossing $18,148,331. <b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> 's revenue dropped by 50% in its second week of release, earning $5,027,485. For that weekend, the film fell to third place, even with an increased screening count of 1,999 theaters. The Fugitive, remained unchallenged in first place grossing $14,502,865 in box office revenue. During its final week in release, <b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> opened in a distant eleventh place with $1,270,945 in revenue. For that particular weekend, Striking Distance starring Bruce Willis made its debut, opening in first place with $8,705,808 in revenue. The film went on to top out domestically at $32,589,677 in total ticket sales through a 5-week theatrical run. Internationally, the film took in an additional $41,600,000 in box office business for a combined worldwide total of $74,189,677.

5000|$|In the 1960s, Paul Kopsch (an Ohio coroner), Daniel Turcos (a police sergeant), and Donald Ward (Kopsch's special investigator), began {{experimenting with}} special purpose handgun ammunition. Their {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} law enforcement round capable of improved penetration against <b>hard</b> <b>targets,</b> such as windshield glass and automobile doors. Conventional bullets, made primarily from lead, often become deformed and less effective after striking <b>hard</b> <b>targets,</b> especially when fired at handgun velocities. The inventors named their company [...] "KTW," [...] after their initials.|$|R
5|$|Woo {{draws on}} animal {{symbolism}} throughout the film. He filled {{the church with}} doves and pigeons, employing doves to represent {{the spirits of the}} people. This was the first film where Woo used the dove symbolism and he has used it to similar effect in <b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> and Face/Off. A cat appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home, and secondarily when Li's partner Tsang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie's apartment. In Chinese culture, a cat coming into a home is an omen of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants. Both Tsang and Jennie meet negative outcomes in the film.|$|E

5000|$|The terms [...] "soft target" [...] and [...] "hard target" [...] are {{flexible}} {{in nature and}} {{the distinction between the}} two is not always clear. However, typical [...] "soft targets" [...] are civilian sites where people congregate in large numbers; examples include national monuments, hospitals, schools, sporting arenas, hotels, cultural centers, movie theaters, cafés and restaurants, places of worship, nightclubs, shopping centers, transportation sites (such as railway stations, buses, rail systems, and ferries), and farmers' cooperatives. Soft targets are contrasted with <b>hard</b> <b>targets,</b> which typically restrict access to the public and are well-protected. Examples of <b>hard</b> <b>targets</b> include airports, government buildings, military installations, foreign embassies, and nuclear power plants.|$|R
25|$|More {{successful}} was <b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> (1993) for Universal, {{the first}} American film from director John Woo. Van Damme {{did not appear}} in the sequel. Also for Universal he did Timecop (1994), playing a time-traveling cop, who tries to prevent the death of his wife. Directed by Peter Hyams, the film was a huge success, grossing over $100 million worldwide, and remains his highest-grossing film in a lead role to date.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Claude Camille François Van Varenberg (born 18 October 1960), professionally {{known as}} Jean-Claude Van Damme and {{abbreviated}} as JCVD, is a Belgian actor, martial artist, screenwriter, film producer, and director {{best known for}} his martial arts action films. The most successful of these films include Bloodsport (1988), Kickboxer (1989), Lionheart (1990), Double Impact (1991), Universal Soldier (1992), <b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> (1993), Street Fighter (1994), Timecop (1994), Sudden Death (1995), JCVD (2008) and The Expendables 2 (2012).|$|E
25|$|Ancient authors {{seemed to}} believe, incorrectly, that sling-bullets could {{penetrate}} armour, and that lead projectiles, heated by their {{passage through the}} air, would melt in flight. In the first instance, {{it seems likely that}} the authors were indicating that slings could cause injury through armour by a percussive effect rather than by penetration. In the latter case we may imagine that they were impressed by the degree of deformation suffered by lead sling-bullet after hitting a <b>hard</b> <b>target.</b>|$|E
30|$|This makes {{soft target}} {{training}} {{very easy to}} implement requiring little modification to existing cross-entropy minimization code. Furthermore, hyperparameter values that work well for cross-entropy training with <b>hard</b> <b>targets</b> also work well for soft targets, in our experience. One other slight modification is that early stopping is performed by monitoring the cross-entropy cost with soft targets from the teacher on a development set, rather than the frame classification rate or cross-entropy cost with <b>hard</b> aligned <b>targets.</b>|$|R
50|$|With its guns in a {{retracted}} position (down behind the parapet), the battery was {{much harder to}} spot from the sea, making it a much <b>harder</b> <b>target</b> for attacking ships. Flat trajectory fire tended simply to fly over the battery, without damaging it.|$|R

Rampart-T is aimed at China, Russia, and Eastern European countries, there are around 20 nations targeted.|$|R
25|$|Face/Off was a spec script which writers Mike Werb and Michael Colleary {{tried to}} sell to a studio from as early as 1990. The first actors who were chosen to play Sean Archer and Castor Troy were Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger {{respectively}} but John Woo instead hired John Travolta and Nicolas Cage to play those characters. It took numerous studios, producers and rewrites before John Woo became attached several years later. For the Archer character, Woo considered casting either Michael Douglas or Jean-Claude Van Damme whom he had worked with in <b>Hard</b> <b>Target.</b> When the film was eventually made, Douglas served as an executive producer. Werb and Colleary have cited White Heat (1949) and Seconds (1966) as influences on the plot.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increasing}} U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia in the 1960s, {{the need for}} increased emphasis on conventional weapons development made Eglin's mission even more important. On 1 August 1968, the Air Proving Ground Center was redesignated the Armament Development and Test Center to centralize responsibility for research, development, test and evaluation, and initial acquisition of non-nuclear munitions for the Air Force. On 1 October 1979, the Center was given division status. The Armament Division, redesignated Munitions Systems Division on 15 March 1989, placed into production the precision-guided munitions for the laser, television, and infrared guided bombs; two anti-armor weapon systems; and an improved <b>hard</b> <b>target</b> weapon, the GBU-28, used in Operation Desert Storm during the Persian Gulf War. The Division was also responsible for developing the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), an Air Force-led joint project with the U.S. Navy.|$|E
500|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> had 74 days of {{production}} {{time and was}} shot on location in New Orleans, including sequences shot in the French Quarter. <b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> was put on a tight schedule by Universal that allowed only 65days of shooting time. This {{put a lot of}} pressure on Woo.|$|E
50|$|Mortars today, while {{substantially}} {{similar in}} design to the Stokes mortar, are greatly improved versions; these offer a weapon that is light, adaptable, easy to operate, and yet possesses enough accuracy and firepower to provide infantry with quality close fire support against soft and <b>hard</b> <b>targets</b> {{more quickly than}} any other means.|$|R
50|$|Syntech is {{designed}} with indoor range shooters in mind. In {{addition to being}} cleaner than conventional ammunition, Federal Premium claims that Syntech is also safer due to decreased splash and fragmenting when hitting <b>hard</b> <b>targets.</b> The company says its studies show that what little spray there is stays close to the target.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the fast}} burning propellant, gun barrels were short, and {{accuracy}} still relatively low. Experience had shown that guns could be put out of action by collapsing their casemates around them by bombardment. The gun in its open emplacement was a much <b>harder</b> <b>target</b> to hit than the massive face of a casemate.|$|R
500|$|On {{his arrival}} in the United States, Woo went through several scripts before {{deciding}} on <b>Hard</b> <b>Target.</b> Describing the scripts he received, Woo stated that [...] "Some of them were good—some of them were very good—but the rest were simply martial-arts movies and I told producers that I {{had no interest in}} doing those kinds of films anymore. I'd done a lot of them already." [...] One of the scripts offered to Woo at this period was for Face/Off, which he turned down at the time, turned off by the science fiction aspect of the story. The script for <b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> was written by Chuck Pfarrer. Director Andrew Davis was interested in the script, but ultimately turned it down. Woo read Pfarrer's script for <b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> appreciating that it was a [...] "simple but powerful story, with a lot of feeling underneath. For a good action film you need a solid structure. Chuck gave me that". Woo also stated that the story is [...] "less John Woo" [...] but the visual aspect would be [...] "very John Woo". Pfarrer wrote the script originally basing it on the film The Naked Prey. After the script did not turn out Pfarrer worked on a script influenced by the film Aliens that became the basis for his comic Virus. The final attempt was a script based on the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game. Pfarrer had the story take place in New Orleans to give an explanation of Jean-Claude Van Damme's accent.|$|E
500|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} on its initial release praising the film's action scenes but noting the poor story and Jean-Claude Van Damme's acting abilities. On the film review television show Siskel & Ebert, Roger Ebert stated that <b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> is [...] "not very smart and it's not very original, {{but it is}} well made on a technical level. The stunts are impressive... as an action picture, it's well made, but it never becomes more than competent action and I just can't recommend it for that". Gene Siskel also gave the film a thumbs down on the show stating that [...] "John Woo is a good filmmaker... Van Damme is pretty wooden... You notice the style in the film because {{there is not much}} substance". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Van Damme has still not broken the habit of his own blank-faced posturing, although Mr. Woo films him in the most aggrandizing style imaginable". In Variety, Emanuel Levy wrote that <b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> was [...] "a briskly vigorous, occasionally brilliant actioner starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. However, hampered by a B-script with flat, standard characters, and subjected to repeated editing of the violent sequences to win an R rating, pic doesn't bear the unique vision on display in Woo's recent [...] "The Killer" [...] and [...] "Hard-Boiled." [...] Van Damme and the director's reputation should ensure initial commercial kick on the way to solid if not spectacular box office". Desson Thompson of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "When Van Damme isn't duking it out with the English language, scriptwriter Chuck Pfarrer is filling Henriksen's mouth with villainous pseudo-profundities. Even in a second-rate action picture like this, and despite Henriksen's commendable efforts, they're painful to listen to... Woo's creative presence is practically stifled. There are some flashes of his deliriously wild style—a slow-motion moment here, a well-chosen freeze-frame there. He also introduces American audiences to his taste for unique motorcycle stunts and very, very loud car explosions. But these Wooisms are disappointingly minimal". Lance Henriksen received a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Emil Fouchon in the film. In 1997, Woo looked back on <b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> stating that it was [...] "in some ways, quite a troublesome movie to make, but I'm rather happy with the way the action scenes turned out". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of [...] "B" [...] on an A+ to F scale.|$|E
500|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>Target</b> is a 1993 American action film {{directed}} by Hong Kong film director John Woo in his American debut. The film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as Chance Boudreaux, an out-of-work Cajun merchant seaman who saves a young woman, named Natasha Binder (Yancy Butler), from {{a gang of}} thugs in New Orleans. Chance learns that Binder is searching for her missing father (Chuck Pfarrer), and agrees to aid Binder in her search. Boudreaux and Binder soon learn that Binder's father has died {{at the hands of}} wealthy sportsman Emil Fouchon (Lance Henriksen) who hunts homeless men as a form of recreation. The screenplay was written by Chuck Pfarrer and is based on the 1932 film adaptation of Richard Connell's 1924 short story [...] "The Most Dangerous Game".|$|E
50|$|Two {{variants}} {{of the round}} were developed, one with a soft core and another with a hard core, the former being intended for use against personnel, the latter against <b>hard</b> <b>targets</b> and to penetrate cover. Both were full-metal-jacketed rounds, the soft-cored bullet having a lead core while that of the hard-cored bullet was made from tungsten carbide.|$|R
30|$|We {{also studied}} a new {{application}} for soft target training, VAD for a mobile voice search system. We found that transfer across architectures {{was very successful}} when training a MLP for classifying speech and non-speech frames with soft targets from a CNN. Relative reductions in EER of 7.2 – 11.5 % were obtained compared to training with <b>hard</b> <b>targets</b> from Viterbi alignment.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} the permanent bases and other {{infrastructure of the}} Cold War, the pivot will use rotational deployments to host nation facilities. James F. Amos has said that by avoiding a few large bases, the American forces will be a <b>harder</b> <b>target</b> for ballistic missiles. The power of the pivot will be boosted by American arms sales to the region.|$|R
