40|$|We {{introduce}} a local method based on radial basis function-generated finite differences (RBFFD) for interpolation and the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The method uses polyharmonic spline (PHS) RBFs together with polynomials to derive differentiation weights on different node configurations. The formulation is explored in three directions: (i) Interpolation and approximation of differential operators, (ii) Elliptic PDEs, and (iii) Hyperbolic PDEs. In particular, the novel RBF-FD methodology {{is applied to}} standard test cases in numerical weather prediction, modeled by the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in 2 D. Furthermore, {{the evaluation of the}} method on different node layouts, Cartesian, hexagonal, and scattered, is studied.

40|$|Feedback {{systems have}} been {{commissioned}} for the PEP-II B factory to control orbit drifts from thermal and other transients, and to optimize the transverse overlap of the stored beams at the interaction point. BPM-based feedback loops correct the orbit at several points around both the low- and the high-energy ring. The beams are kept centered in collision by an optimization feedback that "dithers " the transverse position {{of one of the}} beams at the interaction point to maximize the readout of a radiative-Bhabha luminosity monitor. Luminosity-optimization dithering is also used to stabilize the relative vertical angle of the two beams, and to keep the positron beam aimed at the luminosity monitor. The current <b>implementation</b> <b>acts</b> on the beams at a rate of up to 2 Hz, and can compensate for changes within 10 seconds or less. This paper outlines the implementation of the feedback loops, and highlights the main improvements inspired by the first year of physics running at PEP-II. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{implementation}} of a parallel ScaLAPACK-style solver for the general Sylvester equation, op(A) X − Xop(B) = C, where op(A) denotes A or its transpose A T, is presented. The parallel algorithm is based on explicit blocking of the Bartels-Stewart method. An initial transformation of the coefficient matrices A and B to Schur form leads to a reduced triangular matrix equation. We use different matrix traversing strategies to handle the transposes in the problem to solve, leading to different new parallel wave-front algorithms. We also present a strategy to handle the problem when 2 x 2 diagonal blocks of the matrices in Schur form, corresponding to complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues, are split between several blocks in the block partitioned matrices. Finally, {{the solution of the}} reduced matrix equation is transformed back to the originally coordinate system. The <b>implementation</b> <b>acts</b> in a ScaLAPACK environment using 2 -dimensional block cyclic mapping of the matrices onto a rectangular grid of processes. Real performance results are presented which verify that our parallel algorithms are reliable and scalable. Keywords: Sylvester matrix equation, continuous-time, Bartels–Stewar...|$|E
40|$|Two outline {{schemes for}} {{the course of the}} 2 nd track on the railway line Ljubljana-Jesenice for {{estimating}} the land market value of the individual corridor or territory are presented and analyzed in the Bachelor degree. A relevant legislation in the area of acquisition of real estates for the public interest is analyzed. A surface analysis of the land use in the area defined is {{made on the basis of}} the applicable spatial <b>implementation</b> <b>acts</b> and a type of use according to the cadastral classification on the basis of information of land cadastre is formed. Land prices, contractual and advertised land price, were analyzed for the purpose of estimating the land market value planned for the purchase inside and the remaining surface outside the defined corridor. The analysis represents the baseline for land classifications for the purpose of estimating the land within a framework of the pre-investment study. All land is evaluated with the method of direct price comparison of similar real estates. For this purpose the currently available information about the functioning of the real estate market is used. In the conclusion of the Bachelor degree we found out that we lack a suitable number of specified types of data to formulate the right evaluation methodology, especially information on contractual land prices at some stage of land development. On the basis of the estimated land market value for the potential construction of the public railway infrastructure on two different variants we found out that the most favorable variant of the planned route is next to the existing railway line. The second variant would require a purchase of more surface land, which would be more expensive. In the process of acquiring land for the construction of the 2 nd track on the railway line Ljubljana-Jesenice a more detailed separate estimation of land will be required, which would be carried out by the competent experts - appraiser...|$|E
40|$|The thesis numerically {{investigates the}} {{stability}} and convergence properties of the Parareal algorithm when it is run on the unsteady Stokes equations. The Parareal algorithm offers a parallel-in-time scheme for solving time dependent differential equations. The strategy of the algorithm follows the principles of domain decomposition. The unsteady (or time dependent) Stokes equations are a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe creeping flow. They are an important simplification of the more complex Navier-Stokes equations central to fluid dynamics. The motivation for wanting to use Parareal with the unsteady Stokes equations is to obtain faster computations in the temporal domain. The stability and convergence are tested by using variations of the theta-rule for discretizing the temporal domain. The results were compared to similar numerical tests of the algorithm used with the heat equation. Prior analyses show that the algorithm will display proper convergence and stability traits for this equation. For stiff systems of ODEs the Parareal analysis states that the algorithm is stable when the coarse propagator uses theta in the range [2 / 3, 1]. The unsteady Stokes equations are parabolic PDEs, and when semi-discretized in space they become systems of stiff ODEs. We therefore believe that the Parareal algorithm will remain stable and convergent when run on this problem. Our numerical {{results indicate that the}} Parareal algorithm is indeed stable for [2 / 3, 1] when it is used to solve the unsteady Stokes equations, although some uncertainty on its convergence rate is experienced at 2 / 3. The thesis also numerically investigates the common estimate of the current error in the algorithm, which is used to determine convergence. We have performed numerical tests that indicate that the ratio of the true error and the approximative error is constant, which suggests that this is indeed a good estimate of the error at iteration k. The thesis was solved using a combination of Python and the C++ library Diffpack, where all governing code is written in Python. Through its successful usage in this project, the thesis <b>implementation</b> <b>acts</b> as a proof-of-concept to that such a combination is indeed possible for solving problems like the unsteady Stokes equations...|$|E
