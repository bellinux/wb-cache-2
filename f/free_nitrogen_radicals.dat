Ultraviolet C (UVC) -irradiated microvessels {{isolated}} from rat skin release <b>free</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals,</b> i. e. nitric oxide (NO), peroxynitrite (ONOO–) and nitrosocompounds formed from L-arginine. During UVC radiation of microvessels, heme (Fe 3 +) is released from hemoglobin and reacts with NO to form nitrosyl-heme (Fe 2 +-NO). The hydroxyl radical (OH) produced {{is attached to}} heme-iron (Fe 3 +) to form hematin. ONOO – then binds to Fe(OH) and the complex Fe[(OH) ONOO–] 2 – is formed. Thus, in cases of increased oxidative stress, the free heme can act as an endogenous scavenger of OHand ONOO–. Furthermore, Fe-NO and Fe[(OH) ONOO–] 2 – can act as NO donor and as antioxidant in redox cyclic iron-centered heme reactions, respectively. The scavenging-antioxidant properties of heme complexes, which allow it to protect the cells from th...|$|E

This similarity reveals common mechanisms of energy transfer and relaxation. The correlation of the luminescence intensity and the electron cur-rent in both systems points to the important role of ionic species in relaxation cascades. A sublimation of solid helium shells isolating nitrogen nanoclusters is a trigger for the initiation of thermostimulated luminescence and electron emission in these nitrogen–helium condensates...|$|R
40|$|Hypothermia is a {{condition}} in which core temperature drops below the level necessary to maintain bodily functions. The decrease in temperature may disrupt some physiological systems of the body, including alterations in microcirculation and reduction of oxygen supply to tissues. The lack of oxygen can induce the generation of reactive oxygen and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> (RONS), followed by oxidative stress, and finally, apoptosis and/or necrosis. Furthermore, since the hypothermia is inevitably followed by a rewarming process, we should also consider its effects. Despite hypothermia and rewarming inducing injury, many benefits of hypothermia have been demonstrated when used to preserve brain, cardiac, hepatic, and intestinal function against ischemic injury. This review gives an overview of the effects of hypothermia and rewarming on the oxidant/antioxidant balance and provides hypothesis for the role of reactive oxygen species in therapeutic hypothermia...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of water}} stress on {{plants have been}} well-documented. However, the {{combined}} responses to drought and rewatering and their underlying mechanisms are relatively unknown. The present study attempts to describe spatiotemporal alterations in the physiology and cellular status of Medicago truncatula tissues that result from and subsequently follow a period of moderate water deficit. Physiological processes and cellular damage levels were monitored in roots and leaves by determining lipid peroxidation levels, as well as nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide content, further supported by stomatal conductance and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements in leaves. During water stress, cells in both organs displayed increased damage levels and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species content, while leaves showed reduced stomatal conductance. Furthermore, both tissues demonstrated increased proline content. Upon rewatering, plants recovered displaying readings similar to pre-stress control conditions. Furthermore, molecular analysis of antioxidant gene expression by quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed differential spatiotemporal regulation {{in a number of}} genes examined (including catalase, cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase, copper/zinc and iron superoxide dismutase and alternative oxidase). Overall, M. truncatula plants demonstrated increased sensitivity to drought-induced oxidative damage; however, this was reversed following rewatering indicating a great elasticity in the plant's capacity to cope with <b>free</b> oxygen and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{performances}} {{of a number}} of theoretical methods in the calculation of N-H bond dissociation energies and radical stabilization energies associated with the X-NH ¥ radicals were examined. It was found that the UHF, UMP 2, and UMP 4 methods were not reliable for the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals</b> because of the spin contamination suffered by them. Surprisingly, the ROHF, ROMP 2, and ROB 3 LYP methods were not found to be reliable for the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals</b> either, because they could lead to unrealistic spin-localization of the radical. This unrealistic spin-localization was even seen with the UCCSD(T) method. The only credible modest-level method for the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radical</b> was found to be UB 3 LYP, which could provide at least qualitatively correct radical stabilization energies for the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals.</b> The basis set effect on the UB 3 LYP calculation was also found to be very small. Nevertheless, G 3 and CBS-Q methods were found to be able to provide fairly accurate bond dissociation energies and radical stabilization energies for the substituted <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals.</b> According to G 3 and CBS-Q results, CH 3, NH 2, OH, F, Cl, and CN were assigned to be stabilizing substituents for the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radical,</b> as these groups could effectively delocalize the odd electron on the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radical.</b> By contrast, COCH 3, CONH 2, COOH, and CHO were assigned to be destabilizing substituents for the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radical,</b> although these groups could also delocalize the odd electron on the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radical.</b> The origin of the destabilization effect was found to be the loss of the conjugation between the NH 2 lone-pair electrons and the substituent from the neutral X-NH 2 molecule to the X-NH ¥ radical. 1...|$|R

40|$|Principal ways of {{generation}} {{and function of}} <b>free</b> oxygen and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radical</b> metabolites, {{as well as the}} ways of their bio-neutralization in rats treated with potential anticancer drugs have been discussed. Three isatin-pyrazoline 4 -thiazolidinone conjugates – Les- 3288, Les- 3833 and Les- 3882 – were selected as the most perspective antineoplastic agents. Since the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species are responsible for negative side effects of many anticancer drugs, we measured the indicators of the oxidative and nitrosative stress and the activity of enzymes of the nitric oxide metabolism in blood of rats treated with such compounds. It was found that both Les- 3833 and doxorubicin used as a positive control increased the level of specific indicators of the oxidative and nitrosative stress, while Les- 3288 and Les- 3882 did not cause a significant elevation in ROS content. There were no big changes in the activity of either iNO-synthase or NO-reductase under the action of doxorubicin, while Les- 3288 and Les- 3882 induced a decrease in the activi­ty of iNO-synthase, and Les- 3288 induced a decrease in the activity of NO-reductase. Thus, the content of low molecular weight indicators of the oxidative and nitrosative stress in blood of rats is of higher informative value than the level of activity of enzymes of the nitric oxide metabolism at the action of such toxic agents as anticancer drugs. These indicators should be used for assessment of toxic damage of tissues and organs by the anticancer drugs...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: One of {{the great}} {{challenges}} in pancreas transplantation is the ischemia reperfusion injury. It is mentioned that <b>free</b> oxygen and/or <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals</b> play {{a prominent role in}} this phase. To minimize this problem, a modified histidine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate (HTK) solution that contains modified antioxidants has been developed. Our aim was to evaluate this solution in improving the viability of the pancreas in comparison with standard HTK and University of Wisconsin (UW) solutions in a porcine model of pancreas transplantation. Materials and methods: Twenty-three Landrace pigs were divided into three identical groups. After a 10 -hour preservation time at 4 °C, the pancreas was implanted in the organs of the recipients in a standardized manner. Serum parameters were assessed prior to and after implantation on the 1 st postoperative day, 3 rd postoperative day, and 7 th postoperative day. Furthermore, three biopsies were taken: prior to and after reperfusion, and on Day 7 to assess the grafts. Results: An analysis of serum glucose among the three groups showed no significant differences. Evaluation of the insulin levels showed {{no significant difference between the}} modified and standard HTK groups; however, differences between HTK and UW were significant (p =  0. 004 in favor of UW solutions). The histopathological results showed a trend of a higher grade of rejection of pancreas tissue in the UW group compared to both HTK groups. Conclusion: The modified HTK solution could preserve the pancreas for the preservation of the graft with similar results to those observed for standard solutions without any significant difference. The trend showed that the pathological finding in the UW group was not as good as that in the modified HTK and standard HTK groups...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In vitro {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that interleukin (IL) - 1 beta decreases insulin and DNA contents in pancreatic islet beta cells, causing structural damage, that it is toxic to cultured human islet beta cells and that it is able to induce apoptosis in these cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolated rat islets of Langerhans were exposed in vitro to interleukin (IL) - 1 beta and either the imidazoline compound RX 871024 (RX) or/and M 40403, an Mn-containing superoxide dismutase mimetic (MnSODm). RESULTS: Insulin secretion, on days 1, 2 and 3 after challenge with 3 ng/ml of IL- 1 beta, was almost abolished and this was accompanied by an early increase in MnSOD activity. By days 2 and 3, SOD activities were lower than those of untreated controls and NO significantly increased by day 2. Moreover, IL- 1 beta induced a significant increase in MnSOD transcripts, while iNOS mRNA appeared by days 2 and 3 when MnSOD mRNA was absent. RX blocked all toxic effects of IL- 1 beta by maintaining insulin secretion and islet beta cell phenotype, including the inhibition of nonspecific proteins and of iNOS induction. In contrast, the MnSODm, failed to counteract iNOS induction as well as the reduced insulin secretion. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our findings stress that IL- 1 beta-induced suppression of insulin secretion may be related to iNOS induction in beta cells and that RX can reverse this effect, by maintaining insulin secretion. Oppositely, the MnSODm is not able to restore IL- 1 beta-suppressed insulin secretion. Hence, imidazoline compounds may protect beta cells against damage caused by IL- 1 beta-induced <b>free</b> oxygen and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>radicals...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to show the {{importance}} of the antioxidants in human nutrition, their functioning and effects on human health. Special attention is recently paid to antioxidants due to their positive effects on the human body. Antioxidant activity is variable which evaluates the ability of the body to capture the free radicals, to prevent their occurrence or to convert them to unreactive or less reactive forms. Free radicals are formed in the human body as a byproduct of metabolism in the cells, where they play a positive role in immunity. On the other hand, their excessive production may be detrimental to the organism, they disrupt cell membranes, destroy DNA. Excessive formation of reactive oxygen and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> arises oxidative stress. Oxidative stress significantly contributes to the development of various degenerative diseases and tumors, it causes DNA mutation and it damages macromolecules and tissues. Human organism has developed its own antioxidant activity in the form of endogenous antioxidants which are produced by the body. Exogenous antioxidants are received from food and they are mainly of plant origin. The antioxidant enzymes (SOD, catalase, peroxidase), vitamins, carotenoids and phenolic compounds are the most important. Antioxidants perform important functions in the food industry, in which they prevent oxidation of fats and proteins, maintain the taste and colour of the food and also increase their durability...|$|R

The amount of nitrite produced in this reaction (ca. 1 equiv with respect to Fe) was determined by ESI mass spectrometry after addition of N-I 5 -enriched NaNO 2. In contrast to oxygen atom transfer to PPh 3, the NO reaction of [FeO(tmc) (OAc) ](+) proceeds through an Fern intermediate that was identified by UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry and whose decay {{is dependent on the}} concentration of methanol. The observations are consistent with a mechanism - involving oxide(o 1 -) ion transfer from [Fe (tmc) (OAc) ](+) to NO to form an Fe-III complex and NO 2 -, followed by reduction of the Fe-III complex. Competitive binding of AcO- and NO 2 - to Fe-II then leads to an equilibrium mixture of two Fe-II(tmc) complexes. Evidence for the incorporation of oxygen from the oxoiron(IV) complex into NO 2 - was obtained from an O- 18 -labeling experiment. The reported reaction serves as a synthetic example of the NO reactivity of biological oxoiron(IV) species, which has been proposed to have physiological functions such as inhibition of oxidative damage, enhancement of perorddase activity, and NO scavenging. close 8...|$|R

40|$|Reactive {{oxygen and}} {{nitrogen}} species (ROS/RNS) {{are important for}} skeletal muscle function under both physiological and pathological conditions. ROS/RNS induce long-term and acute effects and the latter {{are the focus of}} the present review. Upon repeated muscle activation both oxygen and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> likely increase and acutely affect contractile function. Although fluorescent indicators often detect only modest increases in ROS during repeated activation, there are numerous studies showing that manipulations of ROS can affect muscle fatigue development and recovery. Exposure of intact muscle fibres to the oxidant hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) affects mainly the myofibrillar function, where an initial increase in Ca 2 + sensitivity is followed by a decrease. Experiments on skinned fibres show that these effects can be attributed to H 2 O 2 interacting with glutathione and myoglobin, respectively. The primary RNS, nitric oxide (NO•), may also acutely affect myofibrillar function and decrease the Ca 2 + sensitivity. H 2 O 2 can oxidize the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + release channels. This oxidation has a large stimulatory effect on Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release of isolated channels, whereas it has little or no effect on the physiological, action potential-induced Ca 2 + release in skinned and intact muscle fibres. Thus, acute effects of ROS/RNS on muscle function are likely to be mediated by changes in myofibrillar Ca 2 + sensitivity, which can {{contribute to the development of}} muscle fatigue or alternatively help counter it...|$|R

Procyanidin B 2 (PB 2) is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound found in high concentrations in cocoa, apples, and grapes. Here, we examine the neuroprotective effects of PB 2 in primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) exposed to various stressors. CGNs were pre-incubated with PB 2 and then neuronal stress was induced as described below. Mitochondrial oxidative stress was triggered with HA 14 - 1, an inhibitor of the pro-survival Bcl- 2 protein which induces glutathione-sensitive apoptosis. Glutamate and glycine were used to induce excitotoxicity. Sodium nitroprusside, a nitric oxide generating compound, was used to induce nitrosative stress. We observed significant dose-dependent protection of CGNs with PB 2 {{for all of the}} above insults, with the greatest neuroprotective effect being observed under conditions of nitrosative stress. Intriguingly, the neuroprotective effect of PB 2 against nitric oxide was superoxide-dependent, as we have recently shown for other catechol antioxidants. Finally, we induced neuronal stress through the removal of depolarizing extracellular potassium and serum (5 K conditions), which is a classical model of intrinsic apoptosis in CGNs. PB 2 did not display any significant protection against 5 K-induced apoptosis at any concentration tested. We conclude that PB 2 offers neuronal protection principally as an antioxidant by scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species instead of through modulation of pro-survival cell signaling pathways.
