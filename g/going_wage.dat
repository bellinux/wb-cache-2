Approximately five hundred slaves were killed in total: 207 during the revolt and somewhere in the range between 310 and 340 slaves were killed through [...] "various forms of judicial executions" [...] after the rebellion was concluded, at times, for quite minor offences (one recorded execution indicates the crime being the theft of a pig; another, a cow). An 1853 account by Henry Bleby described how three or four simultaneous executions were commonly observed; bodies would be allowed to pile up until workhouse slaves carted the bodies away at night and bury them in mass graves outside town. The brutality of the plantocracy during the revolt is thought to have accelerated the process of emancipation, with initial measures beginning in 1833.|$|E
40|$|Since, WWII, it {{has been}} the stated policy of the U. S. {{government}} to simultaneously pursue high employment and stable prices. Paradoxically, neither accepted economic theory nor practical experience appears to indicate that high or full employment is even possible with stable prices. In this paper, we argue that stable prices and truly full employment are indeed possible. In fact, the Humphrey-Hawkins Act sets the goalpost too low; we argue that the government can guarantee a zero unemployment rate, defined as all who are ready, willing, and able to work at the <b>going</b> <b>wage</b> will {{be able to find a}} job [...] only those unwilling (or unable) to work at the <b>going</b> <b>wage</b> would be left without work (which are not normally counted as unemployed). The government does this by acting as the employer of last resort, offering to hire all who show up to work at a fixed wage. In doing so, the government ensures that all who are ready, willing, able to work at that wage will be provided a job. At the same time, by setting this wage, the government will provide a price anchor that will impart price stability to the system, that is, we will show that a true full employment policy is not, in itself, "inflationary" and indeed could reduce inflationary pressures under some conditions. Further, the full employment policy would help to reduce economic fluctuations (the "business cycle") through a powerful built-in automatic stabilizer feature. ...|$|E

40|$|Unemployment, {{as defined}} by the U. S. Government. is the number of people seeking work who cannot find it during the period of study, usually a month. This {{definition}} reflects a neoclassical economic theory which links total employment with aggregate demand. In other words the higher the Gross National Product (ONP) the higher the employment.

40|$|The {{unemployed}} {{are those}} who are looking to work or are willing to work but cannot find it at the <b>going</b> <b>wage.</b> This notion of unemployment is motivated by the neo-classical conception of the labour market where wages clear the market and the failure to get work is voluntary. Deviations from this ideal are measured by the above definition of involuntary unemployment. Other definitions have also been used. The influential two-sector development models (Lewis, 1954, Rannis and Fei, 1964) theorised non-neoclassical labour markets in the sectors dominated by subsistence family enterprise (such as agriculture). As output was shared among the family members, the family enterprise aimed to produce as much as possible without regard to the marginal productivity of labour. This led to the concepts of `labour surplus ’ and `disguised unemployment ’ both of which referred to people who were employed with low productivity in the subsistence sector and could therefore be transferred to the modern high productivity sector without output loss in the subsistence sector. The early literature on unemployment in India attempted to measure such unemployment through measures that were defined with respect to low productivity or low incomes. However, the...|$|E
40|$|The {{scenario}} of perfect competition, as augmented by human capital theory, yields {{a large body}} of testable hypotheses concerning labor market outcomes. These hypotheses, overviewed in the first chapter of this volume, might all be understood as applications of three more fundamental implications of perfectly competitive equilibrium conditions: no unemployment or vacancies, the law of one wage, and compensating wage differentials. The hypothesis of no equilibrium unemployment or job vacancies (NUV) follows immediately from the assumption that wage rates flexibly adjust to clear markets, so that the only reason for actors not to be engaged as employees or employers is because they choose not to participate in labor markets at <b>going</b> <b>wage</b> rates. The law of one wage (LOW) asserts that employees with equal (marginal) productivities facing identical working conditions receive the same wage rates, and follows from the assumption of frictionless exchange. Complementarily, the hypothesis of compensating wage differentials (CWD) asserts, broadly speaking, that variations in wage rates across workers are explained by either variations in labor productivity arising from costly investments by workers or variations in working conditions that are costly for employers to modify. These fundamental implications of competitive theory are challenged by both casua...|$|E
3000|$|... 12 The Family {{expenditure}} data we {{have access}} to contains hours of work, and for those with zero hours of work, {{whether or not they}} are unemployed (i.e. seeking work). We model hours of work as a choice between four discrete alternatives: non-participation, low hours part-time, high hours part-time and full time work. For those who are not unemployed, we assume that they are observed in their most preferred labour market state. For those with zero hours who are unemployed, we assume they reveal themselves to not be in their most preferred labour market state. Note that we are not introducing a new discrete alternative. We use the information on unemployment to distinguish among the preference orderings of those working zero hours: that the unemployed would rather be working at the <b>going</b> <b>wage</b> rate, so zero hours is not the most preferred labour market state for the unemployed. In doing this we follow Blundell et al. (1987) and others who use this information to discriminate between non-participation and unemployment. This is important because women who are unemployed are not observed to be in their most preferred state, and must be classified appropriately in a choice model. For the purposes of labour supply modeling this group is assumed to reveal, by stating that they are searching for work, that some positive hours state is preferred to zero. Furthermore, individuals observed in any positive hours labour market state are assumed to prefer their observed state to all alternatives and are not rationed in exercising this preference. They are distinguished by the following reduced form latent and observed unemployment rationing equations [...]...|$|E

The results indicate that people who are healthy in the current year but have a longer spell of sickness in previous years have lower earnings than persons who have no record of long-term sickness, and that the effect goes through hours of work rather than the wage rate.
