60|$|In {{the five}} generations before the sixth, the crossed plant of each pair {{was taller than}} its self-fertilised opponent; but in the sixth <b>generation</b> (<b>Table</b> 2/7, Pot 2) the Hero appeared, which after a long and dubious {{struggle}} conquered its crossed opponent, though by only half an inch. I was so much surprised at this fact, that I resolved to ascertain whether this plant would transmit its powers of growth to its seedlings. Several flowers on Hero were therefore fertilised with their own pollen, and the seedlings thus raised were put into competition with self-fertilised and intercrossed plants of the corresponding generation. The three lots of seedlings thus all belong to the seventh generation. Their relative heights are shown in Tables 2/14 and 2/15.|$|E
60|$|Some {{flowers on}} a crossed plant {{of the last}} or second {{generation}} were fertilised, without being castrated, by pollen taken from a plant of the same variety, but not related to my plants, and brought from a nursery garden (whence my seeds originally came) having a different soil and aspect. The flowers on the self-fertilised plants of the last or second <b>generation</b> (<b>Table</b> 4/29) were allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously under a net, and yielded plenty of seeds. These latter and the crossed seeds, after germinating on sand, were planted in pairs on the opposite sides of six large pots, which were kept at first in a cool greenhouse. Early in January their heights were measured to the tips of their leaves. The thirteen crossed plants averaged 13.16 inches in height, and the twelve (for one had died) self-fertilised plants averaged 13.7 inches, or as 100 to 104; so that the self-fertilised plants exceeded by a little the crossed plants.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{specific}} goal of {{this study}} was quality assessment the educational programs of basic and clinical sciences of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) according to the graduates ’ viewpoints. Methods: We obtained the list of all 1200 graduates of TUMS in 2007. Using a random <b>generation</b> <b>table,</b> 350 subjects were selected from the seven faculties of TUMS in proportion to the number of graduates from each faculty. The data collection device was a 15 item researcher-made questionnaire according to the existing prob-lems in the educational system of the university. All the items of the questionnaire were constructed and stan-dardized in terms of validity and reliability based on the latest reliable sources and textbooks on educational assessment (Likert indices). Cronbach alpha was estimated to be 0. 85. Results: The most satisfaction from educational programs in basic sciences and clinical sciences was related to practical skills (4. 36 ± 1. 22) versus satisfaction with education (4. 76 ± 1. 66). The quantity indices in basic sci-ences were 68. 44 % (3. 42) which is in a fairly optimal range; for clinical sciences it was 77. 2 % (3. 86), being also in an optimum range. Conclusion: TUMS must make an attempt to reach the optimal point in every educational aspect...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Combined thermal {{and fluid}} {{modeling}} {{is useful for}} design and optimization of cyclotron water targets. Previous heat transfer models assumed either a distribution of void under saturation conditions [1] or a static volumetric heat distribution [2]. This work explores the coupling of Monte Carlo radiation transport and Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software in a computational model of the BTI Targetry visualization target [3]. In a batch water target, as the target medium is heated by energy deposition from the proton beam, a non-uniform density distribution develops. Production target operation is ultimately limited by the range thickness of the target un-der conditions of reduced water density. Since proton range {{is a function of}} target density, the system model must include the corresponding change in the volumetric heat distribution. As an initial attempt to couple the radiation transport and fluid dynamics calculations, the scope of this work was limited to subcooled target conditions. With the increasing availability of multi-phase CFD capabilities, this work provides the basis for extending these calculations to boiling targets where the coupling of the radiation transport and fluid dynamics is expected to be much stronger. Material and Methods The Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNPX was used to create energy deposition data tallies from proton interaction with the target water and beam window. The beam was modeled as a Gaussian distribution with 50 % transmission through a 10 mm diameter collimator. The energy deposition tally was translated into a 3 -dimensional, point-wise heat <b>generation</b> <b>table</b> and supplied as an input to the CFD code ANSYS CFX. An iterative method was developed to couple the volumetric heat distribution from MCNPX to the fluid density distribution computed within ANSYS CFX. A 3 -dimensional table of water density was exported from ANSYS CFX and imported into MCNPX. MCNPX was then used to calculate the heat generation rate (due to proton interactions) based on the assumed density profile. Applying the new heat generation profile to the ANSYS CFX model resulted in changes to the beam shape and penetration depth. The iterative scheme continued until converged values for density and heat generation rate were achieved. Monte Carlo methods are computationally ex-pensive due to the large number of particle histories needed to generate accurate results. CFD simulations are also computationally expensive due to the large number of mesh elements needed. Optimization methods were used for both MCNPX and ANSYS CFX to result in achievable solution times and memory requirements. Local mesh refinement in the beam strike area was necessary for convergence. This was achieved by extending the boundary layer of the mesh within the target water domain deeper into the fluid. This allowed for better resolution within the beam strike area without significantly increasing the expense in the remainder of the fluid domain. Additionally, direct simulation of the cooling water domain was decoupled from the computational model during the iterative process. Heat transfer coefficients from the first iteration were applied as a boundary condition for subsequent iterations. Once the beam and density distributions reached convergence, the beam data was applied to a high fidelity “full” model, which included the cooling water domain as well as increased particle histories in MCNPX. Results and Conclusions The target was initially modeled assuming a 10 μA beam of 18 MeV protons into uniform density target water with operating pressure of 400 psi. These conditions resulted in predicted maximum temperatures below the saturation temperature. The final converged beam data was compared to the original (uniform density) beam data. As expected, the density-dependent beam penetrates farther into the target water than when a uniform density is assumed. The density-dependent beam has a broader Bragg peak region with a lower maximum heat generation rate than the original beam. A line plot of the volumetric heat generation rate {{through the center of the}} beam is shown in FIG. 2. Even though the maximum volumetric heat generation rate was lower, the density-dependent beam resulted in a higher maximum fluid temperature. Experiments were performed with the visualization target on an IBA 18 / 9 cyclotron, and video was recorded for a range of target operating conditions. Analysis of the video recordings from the experiment gives a peak fluid velocity in the target chamber of roughly 5 – 10 centimeters per second with a 10 A beam current. The velocities predicted by the CFD model are within the same range. There is also good agreement be-tween proton beam range between the experiment and model. The effective proton range can be seen in FIGURES 3 and 4. Future work will include applying the coupling technique for two-phase boiling conditions and to gas targets. If successful, this method should be a powerful tool for design and optimization of liquid and gas targets...|$|E
