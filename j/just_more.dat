5|$|Little {{has changed}} in the general sweep of the plot from Boccaccio. Things are <b>just</b> <b>more</b> detailed, with Pandarus, for example, {{involving}} Priam's middle son Deiphobus during his attempts to unite Troilus and Cressida. Another scene that Chaucer adds was to be reworked by Shakespeare. In it, Pandarus seeks to persuade Cressida of Troilus' virtues over those of Hector, before uncle and niece witness Troilus returning from battle to public acclaim with much damage to his helmet. Chaucer also includes details from the earlier narratives. So, reference is made not just to Boccaccio's brooch, but to the glove, the captured horse and the battles of the two lovers in Benoît and Guido.|$|E

25|$|The species {{within the}} {{hymenopteran}} order commonly sting or bite others {{with which they}} interact. After a man was stung by a European hornet, he experienced tingling {{at the site of}} contact, as well as headaches and shortness of breath. In the hospital, he was found to have a fast, irregular heartbeat with a blood pressure of 111/63. His subsequent ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. V. crabro toxin contains neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenalineneurotoxin apamin, as well as enzymes phospholipase A and hyaluronidase, the compound histamine, and proteins melittin and bradykinin. These compounds have been shown to cause tachycardia episodes in smaller animals. The mechanism of this attack is still undetermined, but this man possibly was <b>just</b> <b>more</b> susceptible to vespine stings than other humans. Currently, the two most effective treatments are electrical cardioversion or propafenone. The man in this case study was given an oral dose of propafenone (150mg) and his atrial fibrillation resolved.|$|E

25|$|T. mauritianus {{does not}} display an {{abundance}} of visual sexual dimorphism concerning their size or coloration. Outside of the breeding season, the male reproductive organs are held in the abdominal cavity. During the breeding season, the genitals appear and become darker in color. The males possess a gular sac {{that lies at the}} base of the jaw. This gland releases secretions that help males mark their territories and attract females during the mating season. The gular sac is present in some females, depending on which region Africa the bat is found. In areas such as Nigeria and Mozambique, the sac is absent in females, in West Africa it is reduced to a vestigial pouch, and in the Sudan it is fully present in both sexes, <b>just</b> <b>more</b> developed in males. In females, the genitals are located on the ventral side of the abdomen and are marked by two pigmented patches. During the mating season, they become deeply pigmented and extend out, becoming more prominent before and just after mating.|$|E
