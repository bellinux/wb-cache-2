Although both trader groups lose to market makers, institutional traders perform better than retail traders.

Their empirical study detects leverage related pricing biases. The magnitudes of these biases correspond to those predicted by their model.

Within the sample of banned stocks with CDS traded and using their one-day percentage change in CDS spreads as a signal, we find cross-sectional predictability CDS signal for future stock returns. Again, the predictability is asymmetric, driven mostly by stocks with more positive percentage change in CDS spreads, and therefore more negative information according to the CDS market.

There are {{no known}} exact {{formulas}} for the valuation {{of a number}} of exotic options, and this is particularly true for options under discrete monitoring and for American style options.

The problem of exotic options valuations There are two main types of options.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Applied Mathematics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Barrier {{options are}} {{becoming}} more popular, mainly due to the reduced cost to hold a barrier option when compared to holding a standard call/put options, but exotic options are difficult to price since the payoff functions depend on the whole path of the underlying process, rather than on its value at a specific time instant. It is a path dependent option, which implies that the payoff depends on the path followed by {{the price of the}} underlying asset, meaning that barrier options prices are especially sensitive to volatility. For basic <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>options,</b> analytical prices, based on the Black-Scholes formula, can be computed. These prices are influenced by supply and demand. There is not always an analytical solution for an exotic option. Hence it is advantageous to have methods that efficiently provide accurate numerical solutions. This study gives a literature overview and compares implementation of some available numerical methods applied to barrier options. The three numerical methods that will be adapted and compared for the pricing of barrier options are: • Binomial Tree Methods • Monte-Carlo Methods • Finite Difference MethodsMaster...|$|R

40|$|Structured {{products}} are investment vehicles that combine basic financial instruments to provide private investors with packaged solutions to more advanced investment strategies in financial markets. This paper investigates the pricing of 22 index-linked notes examined during their full life cycles between January 12, 2005 and January 17, 2007. The selected products constitute some 40 % of the structured products issued by Swedbank in 2005, {{which at the}} time of the study is the second largest issuer of structured products to private investors in Sweden. Quoted prices on secondary markets are compared with duplication strategies using <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>options</b> in order to calculate price differences. The pricing results show that quoted prices deviate very little from their theoretical values in secondary markets. The price deviations are surprisingly low in an international comparison. Some indications have been found that the market maker is able to influence prices on secondary market by orienting the pricing towards the relative life cycle and moneyness of the structured products. The importance of patterns in price deviations can, however, be questioned since the absolute level of pricing errors is low. There is little evidence to suspect that the issuer, Swedbank, systematically quotes prices that are not in line with their theoretical values. Sophisticated investors are thus likely to be able to judge the attractiveness of the structured product issue by comparing the transaction costs of the instruments in a duplication strategy with the transaction costs of the structured product. The author welcomes further research that includes multiple issuers to determine whether these findings apply for the Swedish market as a whole...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this article}} we give a review of regression-based Monte Carlo methods for pricing American options. The methods require in a first step that the {{generally}} in continuous time formulated pricing problem is approximated by a problem in dis-crete time, i. e., the number of exercising times of the considered option {{is assumed to be}} finite. Then the problem can be formulated as an optimal stopping problem in discrete time, where the optimal stopping time can be expressed by the aid of so-called continuation values. These continuation values represent the price of the option given that the option is exercised after time t conditioned on the value of the price process at time t. The continuation values can be expressed as regression functions, and regression-based Monte Carlo methods apply regression estimates to data generated by the aid of artificial generated paths of the price process in order to approximate these conditional expectations. In {{this article we}} describe various methods and corresponding results for estimation of these regression functions. 1 Pricing of American Options as Optimal Stopping Problem In many financial contracts it is allowed to exercise the contract early before expiry. E. g., many <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>options</b> are of American type and allow the holder any exercise date before expiry, mortgages have often embedded prepayment options such that the mortgage can be amortized or repayed, or life insurance contracts allow often for early surrender. In this article we are interested in pricing of options with early exercise features. It is well-known that in complete and arbitrage free markets the price of a deriva-tive security can be represented as an expected value with respect to the so called martingale measure, see for instance Karatzas and Shreve (1998).
