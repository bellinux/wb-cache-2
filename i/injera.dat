5|$|The Shabbat and festival breads of the Yemenite Jews {{have become}} popular in Israel {{and can be}} bought frozen in supermarkets. Jachnun is very thinly rolled dough, brushed with oil or fat and baked {{overnight}} at a very low heat. It is traditionally served with a crushed or grated tomato dip, hard boiled eggs and skhug. Malawach is a thin circle of dough toasted in a frying pan. Kubaneh is a yeast dough baked overnight and traditionally served on Shabbat morning. Lahoh is a spongy, pancake-like bread made of fermented flour and water, and fried in a pan. Jews from Ethiopia make a similar bread called <b>injera</b> from millet flour.|$|E
25|$|In making <b>injera,</b> teff flour {{is mixed}} with water and allowed to ferment for several days, as with sourdough starter. As {{a result of this}} process, <b>injera</b> has a mildly sour taste. The <b>injera</b> is then ready to be baked into large, flat pancakes. Unusual for a yeast or sourdough bread, the dough's {{viscosity}} allows it to be poured onto the baking surface, rather than rolled out.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to ensete, a few cash crops are maintained (notably coffee and khat) and livestock is raised (mainly for milk and fertilizer). Some Gurage also plant teff and eat <b>injera</b> (which the Gurage also call <b>injera).</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} shape, <b>injera</b> compares to the French crêpe and the Indian dosa as a flatbread cooked {{in a circle}} and used as a base for other foods. The taste and texture, however, are unlike the crêpe and dosa, and more similar to the South Indian appam. The bottom surface of the <b>injera,</b> which touches the heating surface, will have a {{relatively}} smooth texture, while the top will become porous. This porous structure allows the <b>injera</b> to be a good bread to scoop up sauces and dishes.|$|E

25|$|The clay plate can be {{difficult}} to use, produces large amounts of smoke, and can be dangerous to children. Because of this inefficient cooking method, much of the area's limited fuel resources are wasted. However, in 2003, an Eritrean research group designed a stove, which uses available fuel sources (including dung, locally called kubet) for cooking <b>injera</b> and other foods efficiently, saving the heat from the fuel. This cooking method was intended for designing a new type of stove. Several parts are made in the central cities of Ethiopia and Eritrea while other parts are molded from clay by women in local areas.|$|E
25|$|Griddles {{are flat}} plates of metal used for frying, {{grilling}} and making pan breads such as pancakes, <b>injera,</b> tortillas, chapatis and crepes. Traditional iron griddles are circular, with a semicircular hoop fixed to opposite {{edges of the}} plate and rising above it to form a central handle. Rectangular griddles that cover two stove burners are now also common, as are griddles that have a ribbed area {{that can be used}} like a grill pan. Some have multiple square metal grooves enabling the contents to have a defined pattern, similar to a waffle maker. Like frypans, round griddles are generally measured by diameter (20–30cm).|$|E
25|$|Breakfast (quraac) is an {{important}} meal for Somalis, who often start the day with some style of tea (shahie) or coffee (qaxwa). The tea is often {{in the form of}} haleeb shai (Yemeni milk tea) in the north. The main dish is typically a pancake-like bread (canjeero or canjeelo) similar to Ethiopian <b>injera,</b> but smaller and thinner. It might also be eaten with a stew (maraqe) or soup. Qado or lunch is often elaborate. Varieties of bariis (rice), the most popular probably being basmati, usually serve as the main dish alongside goat or lamb. Spices like cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and garden sage are used to aromatize these different rice delicacies. Somalis eat dinner as late as 9 pm. During Ramadan, supper is often served after Tarawih prayers; sometimes as late as 11 pm.|$|E
2500|$|In Ethiopia and Eritrea, {{a variety}} of stews, or {{sometimes}} salads (during Ethiopian Orthodox fasting, for which believers abstain from most animal products) and simply more <b>injera</b> (called <b>injera</b> firfir), are placed upon the <b>injera</b> for serving. Using one's hand (traditionally only the right one), small pieces of <b>injera</b> are torn and used to grasp the stews and salads for eating. The <b>injera</b> under these stews soaks up the juices and flavours of the foods, and after the stews and salads are gone, this bread is also consumed. <b>Injera</b> is thus simultaneously food, eating utensil, and plate.

2500|$|In Ethiopia and Eritrea, <b>injera</b> is eaten {{daily in}} {{virtually}} every household. Outside of the Horn of Africa, <b>injera</b> {{may be found in}} grocery stores and restaurants specializing in [...] Ethiopian and Eritrean cooking.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{many women}} in urban areas now use {{electric}} <b>injera</b> stoves, which are topped with a large metal plate. In the United States, <b>injera</b> is most often made on an electric Bethany lefse grill, now marketed as [...] "Heritage grill".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Injera</b> {{is usually}} {{made from the}} tiny, iron-rich teff. However, teff {{production}} is limited to certain middle elevations and regions with adequate rainfall, so it is relatively expensive for the average household. As many farmers in the Ethiopian highlands grow their own subsistence grains, wheat, barley, corn, and/or rice flour are sometimes used to replace {{some or all of}} the teff content. Teff flour is gluten free, therefore <b>injera</b> that is made only with teff flour has higher demand. There are also different varieties of <b>injera</b> in Ethiopia, such as tekore [...] (black), nech [...] (white), and sergegna (mixed).|$|E

2500|$|The best-known Ethiopian cuisine {{consists}} {{of various types}} of thick meat stews, known as wat in Ethiopian culture, and vegetable side dishes served atop <b>injera,</b> a large sourdough flatbread made of teff flour. This is not eaten with utensils, but instead one uses the <b>injera</b> to scoop up the entrées and side dishes. Almost universally in Ethiopia, {{it is common to}} eat from the same dish {{in the center of the}} table with a group of people. It is also a common custom to feed others in your group with your own hands—a tradition referred to as [...] "gursha". Traditional Ethiopian cuisine employs no pork or shellfish of any kind, as they are forbidden in the Islamic, Jewish, and Ethiopian Orthodox faiths.|$|E
2500|$|Typical foods {{eaten by}} the Nuer tribe include beef, goat, cow's milk, mangos, and sorghum {{in one of}} three forms: [...] "ko̱p" [...] finely ground, handled until balled and boiled, [...] "walwal" [...] ground, lightly balled and boiled to a solid porridge, and <b>injera</b> / Yɔtyɔt, a large, pancake-like yeast-risen flatbread.|$|E
2500|$|A typical {{traditional}} Eritrean dish {{consists of}} <b>injera</b> {{accompanied by a}} spicy stew, which frequently includes beef, chicken, lamb or fish. [...] Overall, Eritrean cuisine strongly resembles those of neighboring Ethiopia, Eritrean cooking tend to feature more seafood than Ethiopian cuisine on account of their coastal location. Eritrean dishes are also frequently [...] "lighter" [...] in texture than Ethiopian meals. They likewise tend to employ less seasoned butter and spices and more tomatoes, as in the tsebhi dorho delicacy.|$|E
2500|$|Tigrayan food {{characteristically}} {{consists of}} vegetable and often very spicy meat dishes, {{usually in the}} form of tsebhi (...) , a thick stew, served atop <b>injera,</b> a large sourdough flatbread. As the vast majority of Tigrayans belong to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (and the minority Muslims), pork is not consumed because of religious beliefs. Meat and dairy products are not consumed on Wednesdays and Fridays, and also during the 7 compulsory fasts. Because of this reason, many vegan meals are present.|$|E
2500|$|Broad beans (Amharic: baqella) {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular legumes in Ethiopia. They are tightly coupled with every aspect of Ethiopian life. They are mainly used as an {{alternative}} to peas to prepare a flour called shiro, which is used to make shiro wot (a stew almost ubiquitous in Ethiopian dishes). During the fasting period in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church tradition called Tsome Filliseta, Tsome arbeå, Tsome Tahsas, and Tsome Hawaria (which are in August, end of February–April, mid-November–beginning of January and June–July), two uncooked spicy vegetable dishes are made using broad beans. [...] The first is Hilibet, a thin, white paste of broad bean flour mixed with pieces of onion, green pepper, garlic, and other spices based on personal taste. The second is siljo, a fermented, sour, spicy thin yellow paste of broad bean flour. Both are served with other stews and <b>injera</b> (a pancake-like bread) during lunch and dinner.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, <b>injera</b> is {{made with}} Eragrostis tef: an ancient grain from the {{highlands}} of Ethiopia.

There is debate about this among those who are writing about the subject, but it has been stated by some that the production of tef dates back as far as 4,000 B.C. When tef is not available, in both Ethiopia and outside of its native country, <b>injera</b> can be made by fermenting a variety of different grains. <b>Injera</b> has been known to be made with barley, millet, and sorghum when tef is not available, usually because of location or financial limitations.
