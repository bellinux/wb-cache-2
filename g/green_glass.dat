5|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry, dressed with freestone. It {{measures}} 45 feet by 14 feet 6inches (14 by 4.4metres). The building is largely 12th-century in construction, with {{the walls and}} a narrow lancet window in the south wall dating from that time; another window at {{the east end of}} the south wall is rectangular and dates from the late 14th or early 15th centuries, with a more modern window in between. The east wall and window, with stone tracery and an ogee-topped light in a pointed arch, are from the 14th century. Some of the windows use atypical <b>green</b> <b>glass,</b> and some have frames made out of wood.|$|E
5|$|Being one of {{the tallest}} {{buildings}} in Singapore in the early 20th century, the Great Southern Hotel was an important landmark of Chinatown. Designed by Swan and Maclaren, the architectural style of the Nam Tin Building {{was that of the}} Modern Movement. The building was designed to be strictly functional. The grey-coloured façade of the Great Southern Hotel seemed to consist only of the bare essentials, with ordinary designs like strong horizontal lines with angular arches and simple cornices. The building was fitted with steel frame windows, with metal railings and grills, which were considered fashionable in the 1930s. The loggia on the uppermost floor was a little lighter in colour with the use of cast iron balustrades and brackets, and there was extensive use of <b>green</b> <b>glass.</b> The building was {{one of the}} first in Singapore to be built as an integral structure of reinforced concrete slab and beam with infill brick wall.|$|E

40|$|Systematic {{chemical}} analyses of individual Apollo 15 <b>green</b> <b>glasses</b> were performed {{in order to}}: (1) study chemical variations among them; (2) understand their petrogenesis and source region; and (3) study their possible relationships with mare basalts in general. Brown glasses were also analyzed in order to study their chemical variations and their petrogenetic relationships to <b>green</b> <b>glasses</b> and mare basalts. The chemical composition of <b>green</b> and brown <b>glasses</b> is shown and variation diagrams of Sc, Cr 2 O 3, FeO, and Co abundances in <b>green</b> <b>glasses</b> are presented. Igneous fractionation, two component magma mixing, and partial melting of heterogeneous source materials are alternate scenarios to explain strong observed correlations. The composition of <b>green</b> <b>glasses</b> indicates that they were derived by partial melting of the fractionated cumulate source materials formed from a magma ocean which had experienced certain degrees of olivine and plagioclase fractional crystallization...|$|R

25|$|Certain regions have {{difficulty}} using or exporting {{as much of}} a material as they recycle. This problem is most prevalent with glass: both Britain and the U.S. import large quantities of wine bottled in <b>green</b> <b>glass.</b> Though much of this glass is sent to be recycled, outside the American Midwest there is not enough wine production to use all of the reprocessed material. The extra must be downcycled into building materials or re-inserted into the regular waste stream.|$|E

25|$|World War II brought rationing, and {{the company}} briefly had to drop cans {{altogether}} and resort to using <b>green</b> <b>glass</b> in its bottles, rather than the standard amber color which offered better protection from light.

A premium beer, called Grain Belt Premium, entered production in 1947. Conetop cans sealed with caps disappeared in the 1950s in favor of flat-top steel cans.|$|E
25|$|During {{renovation}} by W.W. Martin of Ramsgate, {{the original}} cast iron panels were shotblasted and the teak window frames dipped and stripped. New public lavatories were installed. Interior glass screens {{could not be}} saved but were reproduced in clear and <b>green</b> <b>glass.</b> Side doors were opened to allow the seafront promenade to continue through the open-air centre of the building. The 1924 stage area was restored to original condition with screened windows looking out to sea, and the wooden cupolas rebuilt with additional copper panels on top. The building was reopened for entertainment on 3 July 1999, followed by the official opening on 8 October.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Common Era glass was being used for ornaments and casing in the region. Contact with the Greco-Roman world added newer techniques, and local artisans learnt methods of glass molding, decorating and coloring by the early centuries of the Common Era. The Satavahana period further reveals short cylinders of composite glass, including those displaying a lemon yellow matrix covered with <b>green</b> <b>glass.</b> Wootz originated in the region before {{the beginning}} of the common era. Wootz was exported and traded throughout Europe, China, the Arab world, and became particularly famous in the Middle East, where it became known as Damascus steel. Archaeological evidence suggests that manufacturing process for Wootz was also in existence in South India before the Christian era.|$|E

25|$|At last, Prospero and Roger are reunited at {{the actual}} site called Five Dials, a lone inn {{on the edge}} of the country. Here they discuss why Melichus is after Prospero: they once created a magical item together, a kind of crystal ball {{resembling}} a <b>green</b> <b>glass</b> paperweight. Since neither one can fully possess it without the other’s cooperation, Prospero will have some share in Melichus’ power until he is dead. They also determine that Melichus is using the mysterious book mentioned early in the story to create a permanent winter over the world. While staying the night at Five Dials they meet a small armed force that intends to attack a village across the border. Roger and Prospero thwart the army by destroying a necessary bridge and begin traveling to the village where the paperweight is kept, and where, they presume, Melichus is now. As they travel, unseasonably cold weather gradually sets in. Though the way to their destination is blocked, they find a monk herbalist who lets them in through a back entrance. Once in the village they do find Melichus studying the book. Prospero attempts to steal the paperweight, only to be transported to a different world. Melichus follows him there, but Prospero meets another wizard who takes the magical item and defeats Melichus. In the end, Prospero returns home to find that the early winter has subsided.|$|E

500|$|The east {{window of}} the choir is a broad, seven-light window dating from 1340–45. It depicts the Tree of Jesse (the {{genealogy}} of Christ) and demonstrates the use of silver staining, a new technique that allowed the artist to paint details on the glass in yellow, as well as black. The combination of yellow and <b>green</b> <b>glass</b> {{and the application of}} the bright yellow stain gives the window its popular name, the [...] "Golden Window". It is flanked by two windows each side in the clerestory, with large figures of saints, also dated to 1340–45. In 2010 a major conservation programme was undertaken on the Jesse Tree window.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the largest}} {{decorative}} marble remains of the site is the niche-head pieces. These massive pieces of marble consist of a concave segment with a large frontal peacock carved in the center, tail fanned out proud. The epigram runs along the semicircle of the carving. Surrounding the peacocks are the spandrels filled with grape vines and leaves. The inscription's letters are raised 11cm high, and surrounded by realistic grape vines. The detail involved in every individual leaf is remarkable. Each leaf has visible veins, some edges of the leaves are frayed and torn, and the artist even {{took the time to}} layer the design, pulling some leaves forward, and carving others in the background, giving the sense of depth. Martin Harrison notes that this workmanship is all done by the artist’s eye, and with no use of a constant measure, as indicated by the marks made by the chisel, minute irregularities, and slight bends in the lattice work. This area was originally painted [...] in vibrant colors. The primary colors used were blues, greens, and some purples. These colors are difficult to find or make and show Anicia Juliana’s power in the decorative aspect of the structure. The background to vines and letters was a bright blue. The peacocks—associated with the goddess Hera and royalty in Antiquity and symbolizing renewal and rebirth for Christians —adorned with carved necklaces, were painted in blues, greens and gold. Due to the empty cavities {{in the eyes of the}} remaining bird head pieces, <b>green</b> <b>glass</b> was used for the pupils. They also held chains to suspend something. Connor suggests due to their location, a lamp is a believable use for the chains in their beaks.|$|E
