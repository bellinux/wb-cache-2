5|$|Tales of love often involve incest, or the {{seduction}} or rape of a mortal woman {{by a male}} god, resulting in heroic offspring. The stories generally suggest that relationships between gods and mortals are something to avoid; even consenting relationships rarely have <b>happy</b> <b>endings.</b> In a few cases, a female divinity mates with a mortal man, as in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, where the goddess lies with Anchises to produce Aeneas.|$|E

5|$|The Queen {{is one of}} {{the four}} Disney Villains that appear in 1999 video game Disney's Villains' Revenge, voiced by Louise Chamis.

50|$|The {{series was}} widely known in South Korea as {{director}} Yoon Seok-ho's pet project, dealing with four different seasons of love. In Korea, however, {{it is not}} totally put together as a series but is arranged as four separate shows. All the seasons run 20 episodes except for the first which ran only 16 as they were shown on KBS2, in more than 76 episodes. The show's endings not only have evolved with the times (tragedy {{used to be the}} trend, but now lighter, <b>happier</b> <b>endings</b> are preferred), but have kept with the theme, getting progressively more positive as 'spring' approaches. A few of the actors who portray the show's supporting characters return in different roles as the series progressed, such as Kim Hae-sook, but only Song Seung-heon played two different characters, both as leads for Autumn and Summer.|$|R
40|$|J. R. R. Tolkien was {{not only}} an author of fantasy but also a philologist who theorized about myth. Theorists have {{employed}} various methods of analyzing myth, and this thesis integrates several analyses, including Tolkien’s. I address the roles of doctrine, ritual, cross-cultural patterns, mythic expressions in literature, the literary effect of myth, evolution of language and consciousness, and individual invention over inheritance and diffusion. Beyond Tolkien’s English and Catholic background, I argue for eclectic influence on Tolkien, including resonance with Buddhism. Tolkien views mythopoeia, literary mythmaking, in terms of sub-creation, human invention {{in the image of}} God as creator. Key mythopoetic tools include eucatastrophe, the <b>happy</b> <b>ending’s</b> sudden turn to poignant joy, and enchantment, the realization of imagined wonder, which is epitomized by the character of Tom Bombadil and contrasted with modernist techno-magic seeking to alter and dominate the world. I conclude by interpreting Tolkien’s mythmaking as a form of mysticism...|$|R
5|$|To {{support their}} {{categorization}} of certain films as noirs and their rejection of others, many critics {{refer to a}} set of elements they see as marking examples of the mode. The question of what constitutes the set of noir's identifying characteristics is a fundamental source of controversy. For instance, critics tend to define the model film noir as having a tragic or bleak conclusion, but many acknowledged classics of the genre have clearly <b>happy</b> <b>endings</b> (e.g., Stranger on the Third Floor, The Big Sleep, Dark Passage, and The Dark Corner), while the tone of many other noir denouements is ambivalent. Some critics perceive classic noir's hallmark as a distinctive visual style. Others, observing that there is actually considerable stylistic variety among noirs, instead emphasize plot and character type. Still others focus on mood and attitude. No survey of classic noir's identifying characteristics can therefore be considered definitive. In the 1990s and 2000s, critics have increasingly turned their attention to that diverse field of films called neo-noir; once again, there is even less consensus about the defining attributes of such films made outside the classic period.|$|E

500|$|Attanasio, Levinson and Fontana {{strove to}} make Homicide more {{realistic}} than other police dramas, even in minor details. For example, Levinson specifically asked that {{a dead body}} found by detectives in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] be badly decomposing and attracting flies because he felt other shows did not portray corpses in a realistic way. Some episodes, like [...] "Ghost of a Chance", focus on murders {{that take place in}} wealthy rural settings, rather than an urban or predominantly poorer location as most police dramas did. Homicide was noted for demonstrating better than most American television police shows that murders can take place in various socioeconomic circumstances. In striving for realism, some cases in Homicide remain unsolved and murderers go free, most notably in the Adena Watson case. This theme often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives, who wanted <b>happier</b> <b>endings</b> with more closure. Fontana said of the Watson investigation, [...] "We never solved it because we felt {{that it would be a}} disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." ...|$|R
5000|$|In August, 1940, protagonist Thomas Lloyd daily {{visits the}} Thames Bridge in Richmond, London, England. He spots [...] "{{freezers}}" [...] around the park; freezers is his term for people from an unknown future who, for unknown reasons, will occasionally use {{a device to}} freeze people out of time. These frozen people remain visible only to the freezers and to others, like Thomas, who were once frozen. In June, 1903, Thomas was frozen {{at the very moment}} of proposing to a lovely young lady, Sarah, who accepted him. Thomas remained frozen in this tableau until 1935, after which he finds that the frozen are considered, by their contemporaries, to have vanished. He is now disinherited and poor; he learns that freezing may [...] "erode" [...] after minutes or years; and he finds what work he can in the vicinity so that he may visit Sarah, in her radiant immobility, every day. [...] "Thomas Lloyd, of neither the past nor the present, saw himself as a product of both, and as a victim of the future." [...] After long, patient waiting, he sees Sarah unfreeze during The Blitz. The freezers have watched Thomas; when Sarah awakes, blissful but baffled by the bombing, they restore their tableau, presumably so that the lovers will wake again in a kinder future. If so, this is one of Priest's <b>happier</b> <b>endings.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The tale's {{narrative}} setting has itself {{been subject}} to critical scrutiny. According to literary historian and critic Garabet Ibrăileanu, it is [...] "a projection into the fabulous of the peasant world, captured in its archaic stage, organized in Homeric fashion." [...] The definitive version, which localizes dialectical patterns and bases the interactions between characters on the hierarchies of a village, allows critics to identify the setting as being the writer's native region of Moldavia, and probably even the rural area around Târgu Neamţ. The effect is underlined by Ion Creangă's recourse to orality and its samples of Romanian humor: the narrative technique is enriched by descriptions, dialogue, the narrator's self-interrogation, interjections, jokes, fragments of folk poetry and various other picturesque elements. George Călinescu makes special note of {{the manner in which}} Creangă's narrative relies on peasant speech, and how its nuances serve to distinguish individual characters, all of which, he believes, exists within the framework of [...] "playful realism". George Bădărău sees the writer's [...] "pleasure of recounting , verve and optimism" [...] as instrumental contributions, likening Creangă's style to that of his predecessors François Rabelais and Anton Pann. Among the generic stylistic traits identified by Bădărău is the story's repeated and diverse use of [...] "Homeric" [...] hyperbole, from the presence of supernatural beings to the <b>happy</b> <b>ending's</b> transformation into an eternal feast. Another defining element of the account is the pause for effect, visually marked by the ellipsis and possibly originating from oral tradition, where it may also have allowed narrators to rest their voices. According to French academic Michel Moner, [...] "Harap Alb" [...] is one of the tales illustrating such techniques [...] "to perfection".|$|R

50|$|The {{novel was}} very well-received {{as it was}} being released. However, many readers began to push Richardson for a happy ending with a wedding between Clarissa and Lovelace. At the novel's end, many readers were upset and some {{individuals}} even wrote alternate endings for the story with a happier end. Some of the most well-known ones included <b>happier</b> alternate <b>endings</b> written by two women called Lady Bradshaigh and Lady Echlin. Richardson felt as though the morals and messages of the story were not getting across to his audience properly. As such, in later editions of the novel, he attempted to make Clarissa's character appear purer while also making Lovelace's character more sinister in hopes of making his audience see what his intentions were with writing the novel.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} {{to many of}} his fellow Centauri, who often appear to be arrogant and egotistical, Vir is a truly modest, even humble, figure who initially wants only to make his family proud of him and to hold a respectable, personally satisfying job. As his boss and mentor, Londo Mollari, says, Vir [...] "has a good heart". He is genuinely kind and will {{go to great lengths}} to help those in need, or who have been oppressed or persecuted. This even extends to the Narn, the Centauri's bitter enemies and rivals for galactic influence. When the Narn are utterly defeated and re-enslaved by the Centauri after the Narn-Centauri War, Vir uses his post as the Centauri Ambassador to Minbar to help Narn refugees. When Londo discovers this he is furious, but his affection for his faithful aide is such that he protects Vir. Indeed, although Londo frequently ridicules Vir and verbally criticizes him throughout the course of the series, he privately comes to admire Vir's pureness of heart and basic decency; he finally admits this to Vir in the series' fourth season. In return, Vir loyally supports Londo even when he strongly disagrees with his actions and decisions. In many ways Vir emerges as Londo's conscience throughout the series, and Vir is often far more wise and perceptive than Londo and the other Centauri. Unfortunately, he is usually ignored by them until it is too late. In the end Vir represents the good and innocent person who has been placed into a difficult position of moral ambiguity, and his struggle to deal with this situation is a running theme for the series' five seasons. Fittingly, Vir has one of the <b>happiest</b> <b>endings</b> of any of the series major characters, as he becomes a popular and successful Centauri Emperor who helps to rebuild his homeworld from the vicious Drakh occupation.|$|R

The network also struggled to establish new comedies to support the previous year's debuts, with only late-season premiere <b>Happy</b> <b>Endings</b> earning a second season.

40|$|A {{distinctive}} and recurring topic in Cervantes, {{especially in the}} plots {{of many of the}} interpolated stories of Don Quixote and the Exemplary Novels, is the matter of marriage. The importance of marriage in these stories is buttressed by the close attention paid to the decrees passed by the Council of Trent in 1563 regarding this newly-proclaimed sacrament of the Roman Church. A close analysis of these stories reveals that although Cervantes often alludes to Tridentine norms and regulations, they tend to be overlooked when social or economic problems complicate the path to the altar. Cervantes provides his readers with open-ended stories that do not portray marriage as having a conciliatory and integrative function. Often there is no final resolution. Such inconclusive endings nevertheless provide the reader an opportunity to appreciate the many conflicts that typified the society of that day. In theory, Cervantes establishes the importance of marriage and its significance as an indissoluble union. However, in the actual implementation of these unions, he demonstrates their deficiencies as a means to achieve <b>happy</b> and satisfactory <b>endings.</b> He offers the reader contradictory views of marriage, thus implicitly challenging Tridentine orthodoxy...|$|R
40|$|The {{spaces of}} the city and its {{periphery}} have always been central themes in cinema. From its origins, throughout the silent era (Lumière, Ruttman, Vertov, Murnau, Vidor, etc.), and with the advent of sound, and the establishment of cinematic genres, the city remained a central subject, which the spectator followed throughout the course of the 20 th century. In a certain sense, audiences watched cities grow and transform before them on the film screen. Italian cinema was no different. It had chosen the city as its semantic and iconic space, explicitly, at least, from Roma città aperta (1945). The question now, in the 3 rd millennium becomes: How are the neometropoli and neoperipheries of Southern Italy, poised between Mediterranean modernity and post modernity, reflected in contemporary Italian cinema? This article focuses on three cities (and their provinces and peripheries) of this new South: Napoli, Bari and Palermo, examining the poetics of directors that straddle two generations of Italian filmmaking (Beppe Cino, Sergio Rubini), alongside members of the new wave (Matteo Garrone, Alessandro Piva, Andrea and Antonio Frazzi, Franco Capuano). The films that are examined at length are: Mio cognato (A. Piva); Certi Bambini (A. and A. Frazzi), La terra (S. Rubini), La guerra di Mario (A. Capuano), Gomorra (M. Garrone). This critical interdisciplinary work (between sociology and cinema) follows the development of a general theme, that of the new mediterraneità or meridianità (F. Cassano). At the connotative level, throughout the new Italian cinema of “the South” there is also an internal aesthetic of a new, neorealism. This article traces certain recurring themes— streets, walls, land and sea— that are often represented as complementary to, or in opposition to the city. And despite whether these films propose, at the level of conspiracy or plot, two opposing <b>endings</b> (<b>happy</b> and sad), between faith (Miracolo a Palermo, La terra) and resignation (Mio cognato, Certi Bambini, Gomorra), it seems that the search for a new mediternaneità underscores every narrative, demonstrating the need to weave a sense of meridianità (indigenous or foreign) that is open to mediation and negotiation...|$|R

The Snow Queen is later revealed to Elsa's aunt and one of Emma's foster mothers; she plans on making them her new sisters, despite their obvious hatred of her. The Snow Queen enacts the spell of Shattered Sight to make everyone kill each other; however, she is given a letter written by Elsa and Anna's mother that shows how much she was loved. Seeing she let herself become a monster, the Snow Queen ends the spell by killing herself. At the same time, Mr. Gold plots to free himself of the Dark One dagger's control by crushing Hook's heart in a ceremony; however, Belle uses the dagger to force Gold to leave Storybrooke. Gold reunites the Queens of Darkness (Ursula, Cruella De Vil and Maleficent) to find the Author responsible for writing their stories and force him to give them <b>happy</b> <b>endings.</b> Emma also learns that her old friend Lily is Maleficent's daughter, helping the two reunite.

40|$|F or {{the past}} several years, my {{research}} associate, Robert Buchheit, and I have collected recordings of German dialects spoken by people advanced in years who immigrated to the United States and settled in the Great Plains region decades ago. Our purpose has been to acquire aural records of folk languages, to study the linguistic transformations {{that have occurred in}} them, and to preserve permanently languages that will soon disappear. In the course of our research, we have encouraged our informants to speak freely of their personal experiences, family histories, customs, and culture. The numerous recordings that we have made also include many folktales 2 ̆ 7 from Europe. A large proportion of our informants, most of whom reside on farms or in small towns in Nebraska, Kansas, and the Dakotas, are Germans from Russia. The ancestors of these people emigrated originally from Germany to Russia beginning in 1764 during the reign of Catherine the Great, who was herself a princess of German birth. Thousands of Germans were encouraged by the Russian government to form virtually autonomous colonies in the then sparsely populated districts north of the Black Sea and in the region of the Volga River. The migration to Russia continued into the nineteenth century until approximately 1860. Meanwhile the German colonies in Russia grew and prospered until the 1870 s, when the government undertook a program of Russianization aimed at breaking down the cultural exclusiveness of the German colonies and integrating the people into Russian society. Objecting strongly to this cultural imperialism, more than one hundred thousand Russian Germans chose to emigrate to the United States, where they settled chiefly in the Great Plains region. RUSSIAN-GERMAN FOLKTALES Among the folktales that these Germans brought ·to the Great Plains are wolf stories, dozens of which Buchheit and I have recorded in recent years. They fall into two distinct groups: folktales with <b>happy,</b> often humorous, <b>endings</b> and those that end tragically as packs of famished wolves ferociously attack and devour human beings. A typical example of the first type is the story of Fritz and the wolf, told to me in German dialect by an informant in Henderson, Nebraska: On the way home Fritz encountered a wolf. What to do? He had been told that wolves do not attack dead people. And so he lay down absolutely still. The wolf stood over him, and its saliva dropped down on his head. He grabbed the wolf 2 ̆ 7 s front paws and held them so that the wolf could not bite him, and so he walked home, carrying the wolf on his back. When he came home, he banged the wolf against the door and called out: 2 ̆ 2 Father, open up, I 2 ̆ 7 ve got a live wolf on my back! 2 ̆ 2 Then they turned the wolf and the dogs loose, and they chased the wolf away...|$|R
