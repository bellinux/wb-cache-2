40|$|The {{development}} of a new <b>fishery</b> <b>for</b> <b>sprat</b> off the south coast is reviewed. The fishery during 1976 and 1977 produced over 1, 600 tons of sprat, valued at over £ 92, 000. The quality of sprat landed was excellent throughout the fishing period. While it is difficult to estimate the size of the stock in the area, it would appear that landings could be substantially increased. This, together with the quality of the sprat, could make this fishery a valuable alternative to the Celtic Sea herring fishery...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{management}} {{of natural resources}} requires an in-depth understanding of the interplay between social and ecological change. Linked social-ecological systems (SES) {{have been described as}} complex adaptive systems (CAS), which mean that they are irreducible, exhibit nonlinear dynamics, have interactions across scales and are uncertain and unpredictable. These propositions have however rarely been tested empirically, in part {{due to a lack of}} methodological approaches and suitable datasets. In this thesis, I address this methodological and empirical gap in a study of long-term change of Baltic Sea fisheries. In Paper I, we develop the concept of fishing style through integrating multivariate statistical analysis and in-depth interviews. We thereby identify an intermediate level of detail for analyzing social-ecological dynamics, embracing the case specific and context dependent approaches of the social sciences with the generalizable and quantifiable approaches from the natural sciences. In Paper II we ask: How has the Baltic Sea fishery been regulated over time, and can we identify a way to quantify regulations in order to be able to analyze their effects? We analyze all regulatory changes in Sweden since 1995 with a new methodology and conclude that there is a clear trend towards increased micro-management. In Paper III, we use the fishing styles developed in Paper I and examine how they have changed over time. We relate these changes to the dynamics of regulation (Paper II), as well as to the dynamics of fish stocks and prices. We conclude that regulation has been the main driving force for observed changes, but also that regulation has prompted significant specialization and decline in flexibility for fishers over time. These changes are unintended consequences and may represent a looming risk for the long-term sustainability of this social-ecological system. Paper IV zooms in on a particular fishery, the pelagic trawl <b>fishery</b> <b>for</b> <b>sprat</b> Sprattus sprattus and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus, mainly targeted for the production of fishmeal and fish oil. Suspicions of non-compliance in this fishery motivated us to apply a statistical approach where we used socioeconomic data to re-estimate the historical catches in this fishery (a novel approach to catch-reconstruction estimates). We found that catches had been significantly underreported over several years, with consequences for the quality of stock assessments and management. The study underlines the importance of understanding linked social, economic and ecological dynamics for sustainable outcomes. Finally, Paper V takes a longer historical look at the Baltic Sea fishery, using regionally disaggregated data from 1914 - 2009 (96 years), which were analyzed with a novel type of nonlinear statistical time-series methods (Empirical Dynamical Modeling). Our analysis explicitly recognized the potential nonlinear dynamics of SES and showed high predictability across regions of catches and prices of cod Gadus morhua and herring. The signal was generally nonlinear and predictability decreased strongly with time, suggesting that the dynamics of this SES are ever-changing. To our knowledge, this is the first long-term analysis of a SES using empirical data and methods developed from the CAS field of research. The main contributions of this thesis are the integrated analysis of social and ecological data, the development of novel methods for understanding SES dynamics, insights on the ever-changing nature of CAS and the quantitative analysis of management outcomes. Future work should focus on assessing the generality of these findings across a broad range of SES and evaluate alternative governance approaches given the complexity and uncertainty of SES suggested by this thesis.

5000|$|Sprat {{are highly}} {{selective}} in their diet and are strict zooplanktivores that do not change their diet with fish size like some herring, but include only zooplankton in their diet. [...] They eat various species of zooplankton in accordance {{to changes in the}} environment, as temperature and other such factors affect the availability of their food. During autumn, sprat tend to have a diet high in Temora longicornis and Bosmina maritime. During the winter, their diet includes Pesudocalanus elongates. Pseudocalanus is genus of the order calanoida and subclass copepoda that is important to the predation and diet of fish in the Baltic Sea. [...] In both autumn and winter, there has been a tendency <b>for</b> <b>sprat</b> to avoid eating Acartia spp. The main reason <b>for</b> <b>sprat</b> not including Acartia spp. in their diet is that they tend to be very small in size and have a high escape response to predators such as the herring and sprat. Although Acartia spp. may be present in large numbers, they also tend to dwell more towards the surface of the water, whereas the sprat, especially during the day, tend to dwell in deeper waters.|$|R
40|$|As {{condition}} {{is a key}} variable in population dynamics (especially for survival, growth and reproduction), the use of well-defined and accurate fish condition indices is capital. In particular, condition indices (morphometric, bioenergetic and biochemical) have never been compared and validated for the European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, the European pilchard Sardina pilchardus and the European sprat Sprattus sprattus. The accuracy of two indirect methods, the morphometric relative condition index Kn and the bioenergetics index determined with the Distell Fish Fatmeter was investigated by comparing with a direct measure of relative lipid content carried out with a thin layer chromatography-flame ionization detector. Estimations from the fatmeter correlated quite well with the relative lipid contents of all species, regardless of the reproductive period (R 2 = 0. 69 for anchovy, R 2 = 0. 75 <b>for</b> <b>sprat</b> and R 2 = 0. 48 for sardine). Kn correlated more poorly with relative lipid content (R 2 = 0. 22 for anchovy and R 2 = 0. 41 for sardine, ns <b>for</b> <b>sprat),</b> especially during the reproductive period, pointing out the difficulty for such an index to precisely reflect changes in fat allocation. During the reproductive period, changes in Kn could reflect other processes, such as changes in protein content. Therefore, these different types of commonly used indices do not reflect exactly {{the same type of}} energy stores. The high repeatability of the fatmeter was brought to light, so that only one measurement on each fish side may be necessary to evaluate the relative lipid content of a small pelagic fish. Finally, fatmeter measurements were not affected by freezing storage up to one month for anchovy (R 2 = 0. 66) and sardine (R 2 = 0. 90), making it possible to use frozen samples of both commercial and scientific survey. In contrast, the freezing storage <b>for</b> <b>sprat</b> should be avoided. Based on this study, the Fatmeter appears to be a suitable indirect method to assess condition and fat content of sardine and anchovy on a large number of individuals...|$|R

40|$|The {{recruitment}} {{processes of}} Baltic cod and sprat were analysed and critical periods {{were identified by}} addressing the major impact factors on individual early life history stages separately and relating observed abundance data between successive stages. For cod, recruitment appeared {{to be dependent on}} egg survival, with low oxygen concentration in dwelling depths and predation by clupeids as the major causes for egg mortality. Surviving egg production and larval abundance were weakly correlated, whereas larval abundance was significantly related to year class strength. This indicated that the period between the late egg and the early larval stage is critical for cod recruitment. A potential variable identified to affect this life stage was prey availability <b>for</b> larvae. <b>For</b> <b>sprat,</b> early and late egg stage production as well as late egg stage production and larval abundance were significantly related. However, year class strength was largely independent of larval abundance. Thus, the period between the late larval and early juvenile stage appeared to be critical <b>for</b> <b>sprat</b> recruitment. Potential variables identified to affect this life stage were ambient temperature and wind stress. Environmental factors showing statistically significant covariance with the survival of one of these critical life stages were incorporated into stock-recruitment models for individual spawning areas separately and for the Central Baltic combined...|$|R
