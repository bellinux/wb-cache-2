5|$|Kanye West {{began working}} on Graduation {{immediately}} after releasing his second studio album Late Registration. By late September 2005, West had already completed three songs for the album, which he intended to contain a total of twelve tracks. Around {{the time of the}} recording of the third studio album, West would often listen to songs written by folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his word play and storytelling abilities. The former musician had been recommended to West by multiple of his friends, including English disc jockey Samantha Ronson, all of whom claimed his music and the way he dealt with the press reminded them of Dylan. Kanye also listened to his most favorite alternative rock bands, including The Killers, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, and Keane, in order to gain new ideas on how to make his hip-hop production style more stadium-friendly. Additionally, West would often test his new songs on his iPod, in his office, in dance clubs and <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anywhere</b> people might listen to his music. He would then make adjustments to the tracks based on feedback he received, repeating the process as many times as necessary.|$|E

The {{situation}} of the show allows it to be set <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anywhere,</b> much like Doctor Who. The plot is enticing and you really care about the characters." [...] He also commented: [...] "One intriguing thing about the series so far {{is that some of}} the scenarios have been rather adult for a show broadcast at 6pm. One episode, set in a Roman world featured a scene in a sex dungeon. Another featured Cerberus doing what all dogs do (no matter how many heads they have) and urinate on a motorbike – well, half man-half motorbike." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C+", calling it [...] "a messy episode". He {{argued that it}} is an example of [...] "magnificently bad television". This in turn, makes it {{somewhat}} entertaining; VanDerWerff argued that he would [...] "rather watch this episode several times than I would some of those season seven outings where everybody seemed like they would rather be <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anywhere</b> else." [...] However, he did compliment the episode's gross-out scares, noting that the beginning was [...] "a pretty great cold open". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, was extremely critical of the episode. Referring to it as the series' [...] "nadir", he ridiculed the plot and sarcastically labeled the main villain [...] "Butt Munch". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris, sardonically referring to the episode as [...] "The X(enophobic)-Files", noted that while [...] "the butt-crawler is new, the plot is pure [...] "X-Files generic Monster-of-the-Week." [...] Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles noted in their book The Complete X-Files that the episode soon became known as the [...] "'Butt Genie' episode" [...] among fans.|$|E

40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s postmodern Western world, {{there is}} a greater {{propensity}} toward consumerism. Mass-market production coupled with international trade means that you can buy <b>just</b> <b>about</b> anything made <b>anywhere</b> with the simple click of a mouse. Not only are we seeing the commoditization of things (i. e., material objects), but also businesses and industries are capitalizing on this consumerist mentality, studying individuals? buying habits to demographically target their market. This data mining is done through a multiplicity of ways, such as through technological monitors called sensors. Sensors capture humancentric data at discrete intervals, generating big data that draws out patterns. Behavior can actually be seen as a type of commoditization, not of the product or service but rather of the consumers themselves. And yet, despite these trends toward mass consumption of material goods and monitoring consumer behavior, sociologists are grappling with how Western civility is radically turning from the accumulation of external commodities, such as goods and services, to viewing one 2 ̆ 7 s own body as a form of human capital-to utilize as an outer expression of the self-whether in part or in whole...|$|R
