25|$|When {{digitising}} continuous signals, {{for example}} images or sound, {{the overall effect}} {{of a number of}} measurements {{is more important than the}} accuracy of each individual measurement. In these circumstances dithering, and a related technique, error diffusion, are normally used. A related technique called pulse-width modulation is used to achieve analogue type output from an inertial device by rapidly pulsing the power with a variable <b>duty</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{waveform}} generator {{is a fundamental}} module in a sound synthesis system. A {{waveform generator}} usually produces a basic geometrical waveform with a fixed or variable timbre and variable pitch. Common waveform generator configurations usually included two or three simple waveforms and often a single pseudo-random-noise generator (PRNG). Available waveforms often included pulse wave (whose timbre can be varied by modifying the <b>duty</b> <b>cycle),</b> square wave (a symmetrical pulse wave producing only odd overtones), triangle wave (which has a fixed timbre containing only odd harmonics, but is softer than a square wave), and sawtooth wave (which has a bright raspy timbre and contains odd and even harmonics). Two notable examples of systems employing this technology comprise the Nintendo Game Boy portable game console, and the Commodore 64 personal computer. The Game Boy uses two pulse channels (switchable between 12.5%, 25%, 50% and 75% wave <b>duty</b> <b>cycle),</b> a channel for 4-bit PCM playback, and a pseudo-random-noise generator. The Commodore 64, however, used the MOS Technology SID chip which offered 3 channels, each switchable between pulse, saw-tooth, triangle, and noise. Unlike the Game Boy, the pulse channels on the Commodore 64 allowed full control over wave duty cycles. The SID was a very technically advanced chip, offering many other features including ring modulation and adjustable resonance filters.|$|E

In particular, ORW overlooks the effect of the distribution pattern of forwarder’s active times on the single-hop delay.

25|$|Switching {{regulators}} rapidly switch {{a series}} device on and off. The <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> of the switch sets how much charge {{is transferred to}} the load. This is controlled by a similar feedback mechanism as in a linear regulator. Because the series element is either fully conducting, or switched off, it dissipates almost no power; this is what gives the switching design its efficiency. Switching regulators are also able to generate output voltages which are higher than the input, or of opposite polarity — something not possible with a linear design.|$|E
25|$|Ion {{mobility}} spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS/MS or IMMS) is {{a technique}} where ions are first separated by drift time through some neutral gas under an applied electrical potential gradient before being introduced into a mass spectrometer. Drift time {{is a measure of}} the radius relative to the charge of the ion. The <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> of IMS (the time over which the experiment takes place) is longer than most mass spectrometric techniques, such that the mass spectrometer can sample along the course of the IMS separation. This produces data about the IMS separation and the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions in a manner similar to LC/MS.|$|E
25|$|Auto-gating is {{a feature}} {{found in many}} image {{intensifier}} tubes manufactured for military purposes after 2006, though it {{has been around for}} some time. Autogated tubes gate the image intensifier within so as to control the amount of light that gets through to the microchannel plate. The gating occurs at high frequency and by varying the <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> to maintain a constant current draw from the microchannel plate, it is possible to operate the tube during brighter conditions, such as daylight, without damaging the tube or leading to premature failure. Auto-gating of image intensifiers is militarily valuable as it allowed extended operational hours giving enhanced vision during twilight hours while providing better support for soldiers who encounter rapidly changing lighting conditions, such as those assaulting a building.|$|E

An ExAblate&# 8482; 4000 HIFU headsystem (InSightec, Inc., Israel) was used. Artificial blood clots were placed into test tubes inside a human calvarium and exposed to pulsatile flow. Four different <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> were tested against four different pulse widths.

40|$|Abstract—Negative bias {{temperature}} instability (NBTI) {{has been a}} significant reliability concern in current digital circuit design due to its effect of increasing the path delay with time and in turn degrading the circuit performance. NBTI degradation has strong dependence on input pattern and <b>duty</b> <b>cycles.</b> Based on this observation, we propose to apply multiple input vectors to the combination circuit in a non-uniform way during standby mode. Multiple input vectors can enhance the capability to control the circuit nodes, achieve smaller <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> to reduce the stress time of gates and thus mitigate static NBTI. A constrained multi-object optimization model is formalized to find the optimal combination of <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> for timing-critical paths, which in turn minimizes the increase of path delay.

25|$|Tandem mass {{spectrometry}} enables {{a variety of}} experimental sequences. Many commercial mass spectrometers are designed to expedite the execution of such routine sequences as selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and precursor ion scanning. In SRM, the first analyzer allows only a single mass through and the second analyzer monitors for multiple user-defined fragment ions. SRM is most often used with scanning instruments where the second mass analysis event is <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> limited. These experiments are used to increase specificity of detection of known molecules, notably in pharmacokinetic studies. Precursor ion scanning refers to monitoring for a specific loss from the precursor ion. The first and second mass analyzers scan across the spectrum as partitioned by a user-defined m/z value. This experiment is used to detect specific motifs within unknown molecules.|$|E
25|$|A further {{advantage}} of PHEVs {{is that they}} have potential to be even more efficient than conventional hybrids because a more limited use of the PHEV's internal combustion engine may allow the engine to be used at closer to its maximum efficiency. While a Prius is likely to convert fuel to motive energy on average at about 30% efficiency (well below the engine's 38% peak efficiency) the engine of a PHEV-70 would be likely to operate far more often near its peak efficiency because the batteries can serve the modest power needs at times when the combustion engine would be forced to run well below its peak efficiency. The actual efficiency achieved depends on losses from electricity generation, inversion, battery charging/discharging, the motor controller and motor itself, the way a vehicle is used (its <b>duty</b> <b>cycle),</b> and the opportunities to recharge by connecting to the electrical grid.|$|E
25|$|In a dual {{resonant}} solid-state Tesla coil (DRSSTC), {{the electronic}} switching of the solid-state Tesla coil {{is combined with}} the resonant primary circuit of a spark-gap Tesla coil. The resonant primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series tank circuit with a resonant frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional resonant circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an interrupter is usually used to reduce the <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than bipolar transistors or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be significantly greater than a spark-gap Tesla coil operating at the same input power.|$|E

Flywheel storage systems are not considered because they are still under development, mechanically complex and some safety issues are still open [19]. The main advantages of double layer capacitors are high power density and {{a great number of}} load cycles. The disadvantages are limited energy density and therefore high costs for high energy applications. Batteries on the other hand can store more energy but are more expensive concerning power. The main disadvantage of batteries is lifetime in terms of <b>duty</b> <b>cycles.</b> While double layer capacitors provide up to 1 million <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> batteries only last for up to 5000 <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> when the full capacity is used [20, 21].

In most ovens, the magnetron is driven by a linear transformer which can only feasibly be switched completely on or off. As such, the choice of power level {{does not affect the}} intensity of the microwave radiation; instead, the magnetron is cycled on and off every few seconds, thus altering the large scale <b>duty</b> <b>cycle.</b> Newer models have inverter power supplies that use pulse-width modulation to provide effectively continuous heating at reduced power, so that foods are heated more evenly at a given power level and can be heated more quickly without being damaged by uneven heating.|$|E

Engine emissions certification level had the dominant effect on NOx; kinetic intensity was the secondary driving factor. The biodiesel effect on NOx emissions was not statistically significant for most buses and <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> for blends with certification diesel, except for a 2008 model year bus.

30|$|Among these prior works, ORW [14, 16] was {{designed}} to improve the path delay by opportunistically forwarding packets in sensornets with unreliable links. Even though ORW is a prominent opportunistic routing protocol, it does not consider the heterogeneous <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> and especially the network throughput in its routing metric. EoR [4] is another opportunistic routing protocol recently proposed for heterogeneously duty-cycled sensornets, aimed at further reducing the path delay. The authors of EoR preliminarily illustrated the inadequateness of ORW with heterogenous duty cycles; EoR only achieves the path delay performance slightly better than ORW. In sensornets with heterogeneous <b>duty</b> <b>cycles,</b> the heterogeneity of <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> and unreliable links collectively impact the network performance in terms of path delay, delivery ratio, and energy efficiency, in a sophisticated way.
