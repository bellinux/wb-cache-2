5|$|Paddington's {{ownership}} {{was transferred}} to Great Western Trains in 1996, two years after Britain's railways were privatised. The company was renamed <b>First</b> <b>Great</b> Western in 1998, and merged with <b>First</b> <b>Great</b> Western Link and Wessex Trains to form the Greater Western franchise in 2006. In 2015, the operating company was renamed Great Western Railway.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{privatisation}} of British Rail in 1997, {{services at}} Bristol Parkway were franchised to several different train operating companies. South Wales Main Line services {{were provided by}} Great Western Trains, which was later rebranded as <b>First</b> <b>Great</b> Western; services from Bristol to Birmingham and the north were operated by Virgin CrossCountry; and local services were franchised to Wales & West, which was in turn succeeded in 2001 by Wessex Trains, a subsidiary of National Express. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to <b>First</b> <b>Great</b> Western, which was later rebranded as Great Western Railway. Virgin CrossCountry services were taken over by Arriva CrossCountry in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The station roof {{is to be}} {{refurbished}} as part of {{a scheme}} to transform the station over the next 25 years. On 1 April 2014, Network Rail took over management of the station from <b>First</b> <b>Great</b> Western.|$|E

5|$|As a naturalistic writer, he was {{amongst the}} first English-language authors {{to absorb the}} lessons of the French realists, and was {{particularly}} influenced by the works of Émile Zola. His writings influenced James Joyce, according to the literary critic and biographer Richard Ellmann, and, although Moore's work is sometimes seen as outside the mainstream of both Irish and British literature, he is as often regarded as the <b>first</b> <b>great</b> modern Irish novelist.|$|E
5|$|During the 1730s and 1740s, the Presbyterian Church {{was divided}} over {{the impact of}} the <b>First</b> <b>Great</b> Awakening.

5|$|<b>First</b> <b>Great</b> Western {{declined}} a {{contractual option}} {{to continue the}} Greater Western passenger franchise beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to {{the fallout from the}} collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019.|$|E
5|$|<b>First</b> <b>Great</b> Western {{exercised}} a {{break clause}} in the Greater Western franchise thus avoiding large premium payments to the Department for Transport. With the franchise to now conclude in March 2013, it was put out to tender, but the process was scrapped {{as part of the}} fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition.|$|E

5|$|Plymouth railway station, {{which opened}} in 1877, is managed by Great Western Railway and also sees trains on the CrossCountry network. Smaller {{stations}} are served by local trains on the Tamar Valley Line and Cornish Main Line. <b>First</b> <b>Great</b> Western have come under fire recently, due to widespread rail service cuts across the south-west, which affect Plymouth greatly. Three MPs from the three main political parties {{in the region have}} lobbied that the train services are vital to its economy.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently a new {{contract}} until September 2015 was negotiated between <b>First</b> <b>Great</b> Western and the Department for Transport and subsequently extended until March 2019. The coming years will see the High Speed Trains replaced with new Class 800/801 Intercity Express Trains, capacity enhancements and smart ticketing.|$|E

5|$|The {{names for}} the {{locomotives}} came {{from a variety of}} sources. The <b>first,</b> <b>Great</b> Northern, was named after its parent company. Others were given the names of high-ranking railway officials, but most were given the names of famous racehorses. One was named after the company's most famous long-distance passenger train, the Flying Scotsman. Flying Scotsman is the sole survivor of the class to be preserved.|$|E

5|$|Women were {{admitted}} to the Order in 1971. In the 1971 New Year Honours, Jean Nunn {{became the first woman}} {{admitted to the}} order. In 1975, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, an aunt of Elizabeth II, became the first (and to date only) woman to reach the highest rank, Dame Grand Cross. Princess Alice (née Douglas-Montagu-Scott) was a direct descendant of the Order's <b>first</b> <b>Great</b> Master, and her husband, who had died the previous year, had also held that office.|$|E
5|$|About 40 {{years after}} {{nationalisation}} British Rail was privatised {{and the old}} name was revived by Great Western Trains, the train operating company providing passenger services on the old GWR routes to South Wales and the South West, which subsequently became <b>First</b> <b>Great</b> Western {{as part of the}} FirstGroup but in September 2015 changed its name to Great Western Railway in order to 'reinstate the ideals of our founder'. The operating infrastructure, however, was transferred to Railtrack and has since passed to Network Rail. These companies have continued to preserve appropriate parts of its stations and bridges so historic GWR structures can still be recognised around the network.|$|E
