Examples are the orange roughy and Patagonian toothfish. Because these fish were once abundant, and because their robust bodies are <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> these fish have been commercially harvested.|$|E
500|$|Although venerated and {{protected}} by Indians, these birds were hunted {{during the colonial}} period. It was noted that killing a bird would lead to its surviving partner trumpeting for many days and it was traditionally believed that the other would starve to death. Even sport hunting guides discouraged shooting these birds. According to 19th-century British zoologist Thomas C. Jerdon, young birds were <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> while older ones were [...] "worthless for the table".

500|$|The similar {{colouration}} {{may cause}} confusion with Boletus projectellus, but the latter species is usually more robust, {{and has a}} reticulated stipe. [...] Additionally, B.projectellus has the largest spores in the Boletaceae, up to about 30µm in diameter. Another lookalike is Austroboletus gracilis, but this species {{does not have a}} blue bruising reaction, and its pore surface is initially white before turning pinkish. Compared to I.badia, B.subtomentosus fruit bodies have narrower stipes, paler brown, dry caps, and wider pores that do not stain blue on bruising. This latter species is not as <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> In western North America, I.badia is replaced by the similar B.zelleri, which also grows both on the ground and on rotten wood. The European species Xerocomus bubalinus can be mistaken for I.badia, but it has a paler yellow-brown cap flushed with pinkish-red, and is not sticky when wet.|$|E

2500|$|Recollecting the Nez Perce {{encounter}} with the Lewis and Clark party, in 1889 anthropologist Alice Fletcher wrote that [...] "the Lewis and Clark explorers were the first white men {{that many of the}} people had ever seen and the women thought them beautiful." [...] She wrote that the Nez Perce [...] "were kind to the tired and hungry party. They furnished fresh horses and dried meat and fish with wild potatoes and other roots which were <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> and the refreshed white men went further on, westward, leaving their bony, wornout horses for the Indians to take care of and have fat and strong when Lewis and Clark should come back on their way home." [...] On their return trip they arrived at the Nez Perce encampment the following spring, again hungry and exhausted. [...] The tribe constructed a large tent for them and again fed them. [...] Desiring fresh red meat, the party offered an exchange for a Nez Perce horse. [...] Quoting from the Lewis and Clark diary, Fletcher writes, [...] "The hospitality of the Chiefs was offended at the idea of an exchange. He observed that his people had an abundance of young horses and that if we were disposed to use that food, we might have as many as we wanted." [...] The party stayed with the Nez Perce for a month before moving on.|$|E
