Some process experiments were conducted to reveal {{the influence of the}} speed of the <b>grinding</b> <b>disc</b> and <b>grinding</b> time and grinding pressure during the machining process. The results indicate that the speed of the <b>grinding</b> <b>disc</b> influences definitively on grinding effect of this planarization grinding method {{based on the}} cluster MR-effect. When the speed of the <b>grinding</b> <b>disc</b> is 110 r/min, better machining effect can be achieved. Furthermore, the influence of the grinding time on machining effect is obviously, and the proper machining time is 6 mins. However, under the experiment condition in this paper, the influence of grinding pressure on machining effect is unobvious...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{quantity}} of metallic contaminants extracted from grinded millet was evaluated. The millet was grinded in three different forms; wet, paste, and dry forms for up to 3 minutes using locally fabricated grinding machine with cast <b>grinding</b> <b>discs.</b> Separate <b>grinding</b> <b>discs</b> were used for different millet forms, while the same quantity of millet, 1 kg, was used throughout the experiments. The millet was soaked for 24 hours before grinding {{in order to obtain}} wet and paste forms of the millet. Metallic contaminants were carefully extracted from the grinded millet using magnetic bed along with sedimentation and decantation. The extracted materials were then quantified to ascertain the food form that produces the highest amount of metallic contaminants. Also, the wear rate of the <b>grinding</b> <b>disc</b> was also determined with respect to the grinding time. The results show that the wet form has the highest amount of metallic contaminants of about 1. 397 g followed by the paste form with 1. 075 g. The dry form has the least value corresponding to 0. 945 g. The grain sizes of the metallic contaminants were calculated to be 12. 095 nm for the wet form, 8. 056 nm for paste form while the dry form has the smallest grain size of 3. 124 nm. The results revealed that metallic contaminants are always contained in grinded food processed with local <b>grinding</b> <b>discs.</b> Thus, materials with better wear resistance should be selected for production of <b>grinding</b> <b>discs</b> to be used for food processing...|$|R

E 335 GC (11600), X 20 Cr 1 3 (19436) a 102 Cr 6 (14109) materials were machined in hardened and non-hardened condition. Abrasive (grinding) material affects the size of the cutting forces and thus flexibility of technological system and the repeatability of products. High cutting forces are generated when using sintered corundum, and white electrocorundum. Due to the geometry of the abrasive grain is more advantageous to use diamond or cubic boron nitride material. The porosity of the grinding wheel also affects the resulting machine tool load and technological areas. The greater the porosity is, the lower the value of cutting forces is. Unfortunately, with the porosity increases significantly an average roughness. These grinding wheels are suitable for roughing. The higher value of porosity ensures colder cut and smaller heat affected surfaces. Surface quality, while maintaining other process conditions are best when using white electrocorundum, slightly is impaired for other abrasive materials.

The stem, leaves and fruit stalks are covered with hard, black spines that can reach over 20 cm in length, complicating fruit harvesting.

The seed’s hard shell is only separable from the kernel when dry. In general, 100 kg of dry seeds (12%- 15% water) yields 27 kg to 29 kg of kernels, which must be further dried to prevent deterioration during storage. These kernels then yield 40% to 42% oil.

A typical grinding sequence for ceramics is one minute on a 240-grit metal-bonded diamond wheel rotating at 240 rpm and lubricated by flowing water, followed by a similar treatment on a 400-grit wheel. The specimen is washed in an ultrasonic bath after each step.|$|R

Tolerances comprehended pluralism mark sense thinking manner, religion, culture, civilization etc [...] Pluralism is gone upon on one wish to smooth away truth. Plurasme is looked on as its appearance trigger extreme attitude, radicaal martial on behalf religion, <b>horizontal</b> conflict, and <b>grind</b> on behalf religion.

40|$|In this study, the {{response}} surface methodology {{was used to}} optimize the process parameters of constant speed <b>horizontal</b> spindle surface <b>grinding.</b> The experiments were conducted based on the design expert software. The surface roughness characteristics were investigated in AISI 1080 steel plates using A 60 V 5 V grinding wheels. The optimum parameters for minimum surface roughness were found using Design Expert software. The parameters for a particular surface roughness value can also be determined using {{the results of this}} experiment. This results shows that feed has a greater effect on surface roughness and feed has medium effect on surface roughness. While dressing depth of cut has a very minimal effect on surface roughness...|$|R
