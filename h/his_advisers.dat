5|$|Jon Snow, Sansa Stark, Tormund Giantsbane and Davos Seaworth {{meet with}} Ramsay Bolton and <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> before the battle. Ramsay offers to pardon Jon for {{breaking}} his Night's Watch vows if he hands Sansa over. Jon offers to settle their dispute with single combat; Ramsay refuses, {{saying that he}} may be unable to defeat Jon but the Bolton army can beat the Stark loyalists. When Smalljon Umber proves that Rickon Stark is captured by presenting Shaggydog's head, Sansa tells Ramsay that he will die the next day and rides off. Ramsay gloats that he has been starving his hounds in anticipation of feeding them Jon and <b>his</b> <b>advisers.</b>|$|E
5|$|On April 29 at 8:20a.m. EDT, Obama conferred with <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> {{and gave}} the final go-ahead. The raid would take place the {{following}} day. That evening the president was informed that the operation would be delayed one day due to cloudy weather.|$|E
5|$|After Dutch forces massacred 10,000 ethnic Chinese in Batavia (now Jakarta), a {{group of}} {{survivors}} led by Khe Pandjang headed east for Semarang. Despite being warned of the impending uprising, {{the head of the}} Dutch East India Company's military Bartholomeus Visscher ignored <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> and did not prepare reinforcements. As the situation developed, the court of , Sunan of Mataram, decided to tentatively support the Chinese while seemingly helping the Dutch.|$|E

5|$|On 24 September, Souchon {{was made}} vice admiral and {{commander-in-chief}} of the Ottoman Navy. Two days later Enver ordered {{the closing of}} the Dardanelles to foreign shipping without the consultation of <b>his</b> <b>advisers.</b> This had an immediate effect on the Russian economy, as nearly half of the country's exports traveled through the straits.|$|E
5|$|The bombing {{prompted}} {{debate within}} the administration of United States President Lyndon B. Johnson. Most of <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> favored retaliatory bombing of North Vietnam {{and the introduction of}} American combat troops, while Johnson preferred the existing strategy of training the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to protect South Vietnam from the Vietcong. In the end, Johnson decided not to take retaliatory action.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{seems to}} have {{received}} Luther's letter with the Theses {{around the end of}} November. He requested the opinion of theologians at the University of Mainz and conferred with <b>his</b> <b>advisers.</b> <b>His</b> <b>advisers</b> recommended he have Luther prohibited from preaching against indulgences in accordance with the indulgence bull. Albert requested such action from the Roman Curia. In Rome, Luther was immediately perceived as a threat. In February 1518, Pope Leo asked the head of the Augustinian Hermits, Luther's religious order, to convince him to stop spreading his ideas about indulgences. Sylvester Mazzolini was also appointed to write an opinion which would be used in the trial against him. Mazzolini wrote A Dialogue against Martin Luther's Presumptuous Theses concerning the Power of the Pope, which focused on Luther's questioning of the pope's authority rather than his complaints about indulgence preaching. Luther received a summons to Rome in August 1518. He responded with Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences, in which he attempted to clear himself of the charge that he was attacking the pope. As he set down his views more extensively, Luther {{seems to have}} recognized that the implications of his beliefs set him further from official teaching than he initially knew. He later said he might not have begun the controversy had he known where it would lead. The Explanations have been called Luther's first Reformation work.|$|E

40|$|After {{his first}} {{semester}} at the University of Illinois, freshman Don Beitz walked into <b>his</b> <b>adviser</b> 2 ̆ 7 s office {{to register for}} second-semester classes. <b>His</b> <b>adviser</b> pointed a finger at him and said, 2 ̆ 2 Beitz! You 2 ̆ 7 re going to graduate school! 2 ̆ 2 Beitz, who {{described himself as a}} rather timid new college student, said: 2 ̆ 2 What 2 ̆ 7 s graduate school? 2 ̆ 2 <b>His</b> <b>adviser</b> told him; it meant he 2 ̆ 7 d be taking a lot more math, chemistry and physics. Beitz liked the sound of that; he excelled in all those. Then <b>his</b> <b>adviser</b> pointed <b>his</b> finger again. He pointed down the hallway, where he told Beitz to go see a colleague and ask for a job working in his research lab. Beitz listened and took both suggestions. He also learned a lesson in advising students that he 2 ̆ 7 s used many times in his 45 years on the Iowa State faculty...|$|R
5|$|Henry assumed {{formal control}} of his {{government}} in January 1227, although some contemporaries argued that he was legally still a minor until his 21st birthday the following year. The King richly rewarded Hubert de Burgh for his service during his minority years, making him the Earl of Kent and giving him extensive lands across England and Wales. Despite coming of age, Henry remained heavily influenced by <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> {{for the first few}} years of his rule and retained Hubert as his justiciar to run the government, granting him the position for life.|$|E
5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of <b>his</b> <b>advisers,</b> heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E
5|$|During Bush's second term, a {{controversy}} arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys. The White House {{maintained that the}} U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other {{senior members of the}} Justice Department. The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush maintained that all of <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{had been}} invited to stay at Tranby Croft, Yorkshire, the home of Arthur Wilson and his family. Among Edward's party were <b>his</b> <b>advisers,</b> Lord Coventry and Lieutenant-General Owen Williams; Gordon-Cumming, a friend of the prince, was also invited. On the first night the guests played baccarat, and Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming {{illegally}} adding to his stake. Stanley informed other members of the Wilson family, and they agreed to watch him on the following evening. Gordon-Cumming was again seen to be acting in a suspicious manner. The family members asked the advice of the royal courtiers who, with the agreement of the prince, confronted Gordon-Cumming and pressured him into signing a document that declared he would never play cards again, in exchange for the silence of the guests.|$|E
5|$|He {{would have}} tried to reconquer the {{province}} if he had the resources, but now he had neither the men nor the money to defend the province any more. Instead he retreated to the cathedral of Antioch, where he observed a solemn service of intercession. He summoned a meeting of <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> at the cathedral and scrutinized the situation. He was told almost unanimously, and accepted the fact, that the defeat was God's decision and a result of the sins {{of the people of the}} land, including him. Heraclius took to the sea on a ship to Constantinople in the night.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Stephen's siege, Henry returned to England {{again at the}} start of 1153, braving winter storms. Bringing only a small army of mercenaries, probably paid for with borrowed money, Henry was supported in the north and east of England by the forces of Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod, and had hopes of a military victory. A delegation of senior English clergy met with Henry and <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> at Stockbridge shortly before Easter in April. Details of their discussions are unclear, but it appears that the churchmen emphasised that while they supported Stephen as king, they sought a negotiated peace; Henry reaffirmed that he would avoid the English cathedrals and would not expect the bishops to attend his court.|$|E

5|$|In the Mahabharata retelling, when Sugriva re-challenges Vali, Tara dissuades Vali {{from going}} to the fight and points out that Sugriva may have found a protector. Tara, {{described}} as lustrous like the moon, is praised by Vali as one who understands the language of all creatures and is astute to clarify her statement. Tara warns him about Sugriva's alliance with Rama and the plotting of Vali's death {{at the hands of}} Sugriva and <b>his</b> <b>advisers.</b> Vali not only disregards Tara's advice, but also suspects Tara of cheating on him with Sugriva. Vali leaves, speaking harshly to Tara.|$|E
5|$|In the confusion, Whitlam and <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> did not {{immediately}} tell any Senate members of the dismissal, {{with the result that}} when the Senate convened at 2.00pm, the appropriation bills were rapidly passed, with the ALP senators assuming the Opposition had given in. The bills were soon sent to Kerr to receive Royal Assent. At 2.34pm, ten minutes after supply had been secured, Fraser rose in the House and announced he was prime minister. Whitlam immediately moved a no confidence motion against the new prime minister in the House, which instructed the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to advise Kerr to reinstate Whitlam.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 1553, {{at the age}} of 15, Edward VI {{died from}} a lung infection, {{possibly}} tuberculosis. He did not want the crown to go to Mary, because he feared she would restore Catholicism and undo his reforms {{as well as those of}} Henry VIII, and so he planned to exclude her from the line of succession. <b>His</b> <b>advisers,</b> however, told him that he could not disinherit only one of his sisters: He would have to disinherit Elizabeth as well, even though she was a Protestant. Guided by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and perhaps others, Edward excluded both of his sisters from the line of succession in his will.|$|E

5|$|The King and <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> were {{concerned}} about the rise of socialism and the growing labour movement, which they mistakenly associated with republicanism. The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready {{to come to terms with}} the monarchy if it took the first step. George adopted a more democratic, inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class—a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. He cultivated friendly relations with moderate Labour party politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter.|$|E
5|$|A meeting {{among the}} party leaders, {{including}} Whitlam and Fraser, {{to resolve the}} crisis {{on the morning of}} 11 November came to nothing. Kerr and Whitlam met at the Governor-General's office that afternoon at 1.00pm. Unknown to Whitlam, Fraser was waiting in an ante-room; Whitlam later stated that he would not have set foot in the building if he had known Fraser was there. Whitlam, as he had told Kerr by phone earlier that day, came prepared to advise a half-Senate election, to be held on 13December. Kerr instead told Whitlam that he had terminated his commission as prime minister, and handed him a letter to that effect. After the conversation, Whitlam returned to the Prime Minister's residence, The Lodge, had lunch and conferred with <b>his</b> <b>advisers.</b> Immediately after his meeting with Whitlam, Kerr commissioned Fraser as 'caretaker' Prime Minister, on the assurance he could obtain supply and would then advise Kerr to dissolve both houses for election.|$|E
5|$|Customs, {{traditions and}} moral {{principles}} based on Buddhism {{were used as}} the bases of law. Specific laws were eventually developed and adopted. Samantapasadika, a 5th-century commentary, gives details of complex regulations on the theft of fish. The chief judicial officer was known as viniccayamacca and there were several judicial officers under him, known as vinicchayaka. Apart from them, village headmen and provincial governors were also given the power to issue judgments. The king was the final judge in legal disputes, and all cases against {{members of the royal}} family and high dignitaries of the state were judged by him. However, the king had to exercise this power with care and after consulting with <b>his</b> <b>advisers.</b> Udaya I recorded judgments that were regarded as important precedents in the royal library in order to maintain uniformity in judicial decisions.|$|E
