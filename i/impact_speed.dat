5|$|The major {{application}} of uranium {{in the military}} sector is in high-density penetrators. This ammunition consists of depleted uranium (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements, such as titanium or molybdenum. At high <b>impact</b> <b>speed,</b> the density, hardness, and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates. The use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after {{the use of such}} munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil (see Gulf War Syndrome).|$|E
5|$|Though Kentrosaurus likely {{stood with}} forelimbs erect like in other dinosaurs, it is {{hypothesised}} {{that the animal}} adopted a sprawling posture when defending itself. Its neck was flexible enough {{to allow it to}} keep sight of predators, as it could reach the sides of its body with its snout and look over the back. In addition, the posterior position of the center of mass may not have been advantageous for rapid locomotion, but meant that the animal could quickly rotate around the hips by pushing sideways with the arms, keeping the tail pointed at the attacker. Kentrosaurus was nevertheless not invulnerable. A quick predator could have made it to the tail base (where the <b>impact</b> <b>speed</b> would be much lower) when the tail passed and the neck and upper-part of the body would have been unprotected by the tail swings. A successful predation of Kentrosaurus may have required group hunting. Compared to the more robust spikes of Stegosaurus, the thinner spikes of Kentrosaurus were at greater risk of bending.|$|E

Abaqus Explicit finite element code {{was used to}} simulate the response of this structure subjected to varying <b>impact</b> <b>speeds.</b> A comparative study with the standard plain square column was carried out and {{it was found that}} the slotted column exhibited lower initial peak force (IPF) as compared to the plain column. Mean forces for both types of columns remained the same. Both types of columns exhibited different IPFs with different <b>impact</b> <b>speeds.</b> The number of slots on the slotted column also influenced the formation of folds during the progressive crushing. The low IPF is an important feature when designing for occupant and critical goods safety.

40|$|AbstractA {{baseball}} {{consists of}} a spherical cork core that is wrapped with two layers of rubber, three layers of wool, one layer of cotton, cement glue and one layer of cowhide. The respective nonlinear and time-dependent material properties of these layers make it challenging to capture {{the behavior of a}} baseball accurately over a range of <b>impact</b> <b>speeds.</b> As a result of this challenge, finite element models (FEMs) of the baseball typically treat the baseball as a single viscoelastic material where the respective material properties have been homogenized. These single-material models do not necessarily possess the same hyperelastic and viscoeleastic qualities as a real baseball, and these missing behaviors limit the applicability of these baseball models to simulate a bat-ball collision over a very narrow range of <b>impact</b> <b>speeds.</b> In the current work, a layer-by-layer approach is used to create a robust baseball FEM. The pill, which is a cork core wrapped in two layers of rubber, were subjected to bounce and compression testing at a wide range of <b>impact</b> <b>speeds</b> and compression rates. These data are used to tune the pill properties and ensure close agreement between experimental and FEM results. The remaining layers are added individually until the complete baseball is modeled and agrees closely with experimental results over a wide range of <b>impact</b> <b>speeds.</b> Possible applications for a new and improved baseball FEM include accurate simulations of baseball testing and bat-ball collisions. The improved ball model {{can also be used to}} predict performance of future bat designs not yet manufactured...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} non-nuclear {{diversion}} of near Earth asteroids have largely ignored {{the use of}} pure kinetic energy impacts, partly due to apparent limits on <b>impact</b> <b>speeds</b> of 10 - 15 km s− 1.

Such high-energy orbits increase the energy liberated during impact by a factor of 40 or more, while reducing the required projectile mass by at least 95 %.

50|$|Vehicle speed {{within the}} human {{tolerances}} for avoiding serious injury and {{death is a}} key goal of modern road design because <b>impact</b> <b>speed</b> affects the severity of injury to both occupants and pedestrians. For occupants, Joksch (1993) found the probability of death for drivers in multi-vehicle accidents increased as the fourth power of <b>impact</b> <b>speed</b> (often referred to by the mathematical term δv ("delta V"), meaning change in velocity). Injuries are caused by sudden, severe acceleration (or deceleration); this is difficult to measure. However, crash reconstruction techniques can estimate vehicle speeds before a crash.

30|$|From the {{experimental}} results presented here, we observed {{differences in the}} response of the target to low-velocity impacts in reduced gravity (∼ 10 − 2 g) and microgravity (< 10 − 4 g). Figure  5 shows that compared to the total number of impacts in reduced gravity (∼ 10 − 2 g), only a few of them did not produce ejecta: the vast majority of impacts generated an ejecta curtain. In addition, none of the reduced-gravity impacts lead to a rebound of the projectile (no red triangles or diamonds). In particular, when no ejecta was produced around the lowest <b>impact</b> <b>speeds</b> observed (∼[*] 20 cm/s), only projectile embedding in the target could be seen. For the same <b>impact</b> <b>speeds,</b> a microgravity environment (< 10 − 4 g) lead to the rebound of the projectile.

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{consensus is}} that tektites were produced by impacts on the Earth, but the exact mechanism by impacts might form tektites is still unclear.

50|$|Therefore, {{an ideal}} helmet liner is stiff enough to {{decelerate}} the impacting head {{to an abrupt}} stop in a smooth uniform manner just before it completely crushes the liner and no stiffer. The required stiffness depends on the <b>impact</b> <b>speed</b> of the head, which is unknown {{at the time of}} manufacture of the helmet. The result is that the manufacturer must choose a likely speed of impact and optimize the helmet for that <b>impact</b> <b>speed.</b> If the helmet is in a real impact that is slower than the one for which it was designed, it will still help but the head will be decelerated a little more violently than was actually necessary given the available space between the inside and outside of the helmet, although that deceleration will still be much less than what it {{would have been in the}} absence of the helmet. If the impact is faster than the one the helmet was designed for, the head will completely crush the liner and slow down but not stop in the process. When the crush space of the liner runs out, the head will stop suddenly which is not ideal. However, in the absence of the helmet, the head would have been brought to a sudden stop from a higher speed causing more injury. Still, a helmet with a stiffer foam that stopped the head before the liner crush space ran out would have done a better job. So helmets help most in impacts at the speeds they were designed for, and continue to help but not as much in impacts that are at different speeds. In practice, motorcycle helmet manufacturers choose the <b>impact</b> <b>speed</b> they will design for based on the speed used in standard helmet tests. Most standard helmet tests use speeds between 4 and 7 m/s.|$|E
40|$|Prediction of the {{interaction}} between expanded vaporized debris and target materials for applications such as meteorite impact on space vehicles, ballistic penetration of armors, debris shield design, etc. demands an accurate treatment of the melting and vaporization process and the kinetics of liquid-vapor propagation. Historically, experimental efforts to understand high-pressure melting and vaporization have been hindered by unavailability of experimental launchers that are capable of speeds needed to induce vaporized states. Here, record-high <b>impact</b> <b>speeds</b> achieved using the Sandia HyperVelocity Launcher have permitted a systematic study of shock-induced full vaporization of zinc. Pressures up to 5. 5 Mbar and temperatures as high as 39, 000 K ({approximately} 3. 4 eV) are induced in a thin zinc plate by impacting it with a tantalum flier at speeds up to 10. 1 km/s. Such high pressures produce essentially full vaporization of the zinc because the thermodynamic release isentropes pass into the vapor dome near the critical point. To characterize vapor flow, the velocity history produced by stagnation of the zinc expansion products against a witness plate is measured with velocity interferometry. For each experiment, the time-resolved experimental interferometer record is compared with wavecode calculations using an analytical equation of state, called ANEOS, that is known to have performed quite well at lower <b>impact</b> <b>speeds</b> (less than {approximately} 7 km/s) where vaporization is negligible.
