40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{description}} of the characteristics and flow properties of powder materials. The study of powder material’s flow properties is demanding and hard. For a correctly designed technologic process it is necessary to know the flow behaviour of powder materials. Measuring {{is the best way to}} study flow properties. The aim of this thesis is to acquaintance the instruments which measure flow properties. Theoretical part of the thesis describes particular materials, ring shear tests with Jenike Shear Cell and evaluation using Mohr’s circles. Experiments were performed on two samples from the industrial practice. These samples are <b>instant</b> <b>teas</b> of various flavour. Attention was paid to the influence of humidity on the flowability of the materials. Results demonstrate that surface characteristics and humidity changes the flow behaviour of bulk properties. Consequently it is necessary to pay attention to these factors when technologic process is designed...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to develop optimal {{conditions}} for decaffeination and spray drying procedures to produce decaffeinated and high caffeine powders from green tea (Camellia sinensis). Blanching the tea leaves with water at 100. °C for 4. min at a water-to-tea ratio of 20 : 1. mL/g removed 83 % of the caffeine while retaining 94 % of the catechins. The optimal spray drying conditions, which gave the highest yield of green tea powder and the highest concentrations of the naturally occurring epistructured catechins were found to be 180. °C for the inlet temperature and 115. °C for the outlet temperature. Using these optimal conditions, a decaffeinated green tea powder (7 mg/g caffeine) and a high caffeine powder (95. mg/g) were produced. These two green tea powders had excellent physical properties and could be used as <b>instant</b> <b>teas</b> by consumers or utilized in the food, cosmetic and nutraceutical industries...|$|R

50|$|<b>Instant</b> <b>tea</b> is {{a powder}} that water {{is added to}} in order to be reconstituted into a cup of tea. The {{earliest}} form of <b>instant</b> <b>tea</b> was developed in the United Kingdom in 1885. A patent was granted for a paste made of concentrated tea extract, sugar, and evaporated milk, which became tea when hot water was added. However, no notable developments were made until spray drying technology allowed for drying the tea concentrates at a temperature which did not damage the flavors of the product.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, Tata Tea {{decided to}} take its brands into the global markets. It formed an export joint venture with Britain's Tetley Tea in 1992.

5000|$|In 1946, Nestle USA {{introduced}} the first <b>instant</b> <b>tea,</b> Nestea. [...] Instant teas are produced from black tea by extracting the liquor from processed portion of tea typically from offgrade black teas; green tea {{in a smaller}} proportion has traditionally {{been used by the}} <b>instant</b> <b>tea</b> makers as a [...] "clarification agent" [...] - again, in effort to maximize the clarity of color and minimize off-colors created by certain teas that cloud. The extract is concentrated under low pressure, and drying the concentrate to a powder by freeze-drying, spray-drying, or vacuum-drying. Low temperatures tend to be used to minimize loss of flavor. The American market for <b>instant</b> <b>tea</b> powders, which developed quickly following Nestle's introduction, has slackened off considerably over the past quarter century, as Americans have more and more turned to naturally icing their favorite loose teas, as well as preparing iced tea from tea bags, and to ready-to-drink iced teas where the smaller sizes are found in the supermarkets' refrigerated drinks sections and the larger gallon sizes are found in the supermarkets' non-refrigerated drinks sections.|$|E

In 1963, the {{production and}} exports of <b>Instant</b> <b>Teas</b> was introduced, and in 1966 the first International Tea Convention was held to commemorate 100 years of the tea industry in Sri Lanka. During the 1971-1972 period, the government of Sri Lanka nationalized estates owned by Sri Lankan and British companies, taking over some 502 privately held tea, rubber and coconut estates, and in 1975 it nationalized the Rupee and Sterling companies. Land reform in Sri Lanka meant that no cultivator was allowed to own more than 50 acre for any purpose. In 1976, the Sri Lanka Tea Board was founded as were such other bodies as the Janatha Estate Development Board (JEDB), Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation (SLSPC) and the Tea Small Holding Development Authority (TSHDA) to supervise the estates thus appropriated by the state. In 1976, the export of tea bags commenced.|$|R

50|$|<b>Instant</b> <b>tea</b> powder {{by itself}} is the {{dehydrated}} flavor, aroma, and color compounds found in tea. When marketed, other ingredients can be added, such as sugar for taste, citric acid for tartness, and other flavors that would not normally be found in tea leaves, {{such as those of}} raspberry or lemon. Physically speaking, the reconstituted tea is mostly water with compounds dissolved within it to give a certain taste. This means that the tea falls under the classification of a Newtonian fluid. The fact that the flavor and color compounds are evenly distributed when water is added indicates that the reconstituted tea is a homogeneous mixture. While traditional tea prepared using tea leaves and hot water has insoluble compounds that would cause it to be a suspension as well, <b>instant</b> <b>tea</b> is manufactured with the intent of being dissolved in water.|$|E
