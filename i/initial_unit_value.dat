40|$|It {{is often}} the case that the value of a number of {{somewhat}} similar units (e. g., automobiles of a certain general type) is divided by the number of units in order to form a <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> price and these <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> prices are compared over two periods in order to form a <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> price index. This <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> price index or Drobisch price index can then be compared with other standard index number formulae and the bias in the index can be determined. The present paper presents most of the known results on this bias (and derives some new ones) in a coherent framework using a simple identity from the statistics literature. A related question first considered by Pa´ rniczky (1974) is also considered: does disaggregation of a <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> into more homogeneous subgroups reduce the <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> bias? The answer seems to be: probably yes.

40|$|Trade <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> are {{commonly}} used as proxies for trade prices in empirical research in international economics. Existing datasets providing international trade <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> for {{a large number of}} countries typically suffer from a number of statistical biases, due to the aggregation of <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> and the harmonization of quantity information. These biases reduce the reliability of <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> as a proxy for trade prices. This paper presents the Trade <b>Unit</b> <b>Values</b> dataset, a new database developed to circumvent these statistical issues. Bilateral trade <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> are computed at a very high level of disaggregation before aggregation into Harmonized-System 6 -digits categories to allow for cross-country comparability. Our processing strategy improves the differentiation of trade prices within product categories, as compared to existing worldwide datasets.

40|$|Household surveys {{frequently}} record only expenditure information. The lack {{of information}} about quantities purchased precludes the possibility of deriving household specific <b>unit</b> <b>values.</b> The aggregate price indexes derived from sources exogenous to the household survey are often not sufficient to identify all parameters and to provide plausible estimates. We use a theoretical result developed by Lewbel (1989) to construct "pseudo" <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> by 1) reproducing the variability of crosssectional price variation using the variability of the budget shares, and 2) adding the variability to the aggregate price indexes published by the national statistical institute. The study estimates a complete quadratic demand system using a time series of cross-sections of Italian household budgets including, in turn, aggregate price indexes and "pseudo" <b>unit</b> <b>values.</b> The {{results show that the}} matrix of compensated price elasticities is negative semidefinite only if "pseudo" <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> are used. In order to have a counterfactual experiment, we then consider a household survey with actual <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> and compare them with "pseudo" <b>unit</b> <b>values.</b> The experiment shows that in most cases "pseudo" values maintain the relevant characteristics of the distribution of actual <b>unit</b> <b>values.</b> Overall, we conclude that "pseudo" <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> are better than aggregate price indexes for sound demand and welfare analysis. <b>Unit</b> <b>values,</b> Cross-section prices, demand analysis, Slutsky matrix properties...|$|R

3000|$|Only a few {{household}} expenditure surveys collect price data. In the literature, {{there are two}} main methods for retrieving price data from expenditure and quantity variables: using <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> as proxy for market prices, as Abdulai ([2002]) or Akbay et al. ([2007]) did by dividing the expenditure by the quantity consumed. The other method of quality-adjusted <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> was originally introduced by Cox and Wohlgenant ([1986]) and is frequently applied in the literature (e.g., in Lazaridis [2003]; Thiele [2010]; Zheng and Henneberry [2010]). Despite the nomenclature, <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> still have a quality aspect, because of the heterogeneity of products within a given category (e.g., wine). The consumer can select between different quality levels, leading to different <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> among households; differences in <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> can be attributed to quality and price variations (Chung et al. [2005]). An increase in the <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> could be induced by a price increase or by a shift in the household’s demand for more expensive products within this particular product category. Thus, taking <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> as proxies for market prices could lead to biased parameter estimates. This is particularly true for composite commodities (Chung et al. [2005]), such as the beverage product groups used in this study, which contain products of varying qualities. As McKelvey ([2011]) notes, <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> will be an [...] "error-ridden indicator of prices".|$|R

The UVI {{may be viewed as}} a Paasche index compiled in two stages where <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> instead of prices are used in the low level aggregation stage. <b>Unit</b> <b>values</b> are average prices referring to an ag-gregate of (more or less homogeneous) commodities. The focus of the paper is on the decom-position of the discrepancy between UVIs and PIs (the "unit value bias") into a (well known) Laspeyres (or substitution) effect or "L-effect" and a structural component or "S-effect" due to substituting <b>unit</b> <b>values</b> for prices. It is shown that amount and sign of S depends on the corre-lation between the change of quantities of those goods that are included in the aggregate and their respective base period prices.

As a population of interest, San Francisco County was chosen since it is known as a region having well-organized transportation systems including bus, light rail and commuter rail systems. According to the correlation results, for mixed zone, an appraised <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> increases as the number of LEED qualified transit stops increases (bus, light rail, and commuter rail). In addition, the appraised <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> increases as the distance to LEED qualified bus stops light rail stops decreases. For residential zone, the appraised <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> increases as the number of LEED qualified bus and light rail stations increases. Furthermore, the appraised <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> increases as the distance to LEED qualified bus stops decreases. When it comes to the predictive regression model for mixed zone, the adjusted R-square of the transformed model was 0. 713, which indicates that 71. 3 percent variability in transformed <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> of parcels could be explained by these variables. In addition, for the predictive model of residential zone, the adjusted R-square for the model was 0. 622 thus the independent variables together accounted for 62. 2 percent variability in the transformed <b>unit</b> <b>value</b> of parcels.
