50|$|The <b>four-spot</b> <b>megrim</b> (Lepidorhombus boscii) is {{a species}} of {{flatfish}} in the Scophthalmidae family. It is found a depths between 7 and 800 m in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean. It can be separated from its close relative, the megrim or whiff (L. whiffiagonis), by the dark spots towards {{the rear of the}} fins. It reaches a length of 40 cm.|$|E
50|$|It {{can grow}} up to 60 cm in length. It is left-eyed, has a {{slightly}} larger head than usual in flatfish, and with a narrower body than usual. The dorsal and anal fins are relatively short and start far back on the body. The colouration is usually light brown with dark spots across the body and dark grey fins. It lacks the highly distinct dark spots found on the fins in its close relative, the <b>four-spot</b> <b>megrim</b> (L. boscii).|$|E
40|$|Since 2003 {{when the}} DCF started at European level by countries, {{discards}} {{data are available}} for many stocks. <b>Four-spot</b> <b>megrim</b> is traditionally assessed with XSA (extended survivor analysis) which does not include discards. For this species, discards in number are very important, being around the 60 % of total catch. A Bayesian model incorporating discards was realized for the hake stock in ICES Divisions VIIIc and IXa by Fernández et al. (2010). This model was also designed to produce a complete time-series of discard estimates. Final run of the model is compared with results from XSA performed in the working group of 2010, showing that mayor differences are in the fishing mortality for younger ages, being higher incorporating discards data...|$|E

40|$|Marine {{species with}} {{relatively}} low migratory capacity {{are threatened by}} habitat alterations derived from human activities. In November 2002 the tanker Prestige sank off the Spanish northwest coast releasing 70, 000 tons of fuel and damaging biota in the area. Despite efforts to clean the damaged areas, fuel remnants have affected marine species over the last nine years. This study is focused on two flatfish, Lepidorhombus boscii (<b>four-spotted</b> <b>megrim)</b> and L. whiffiagonis (megrim), whose spawning areas are located {{at the edge of}} the continental platform. We have analyzed megrim samples from North Spanish and French waters obtained before and after the oil spill. Genotypes at the nuclear marker 5 S rDNA indicate a significant increase in interspecific hybridization after the Prestige accident, likely due to forced spawning overlap. The mitochondrial D-Loop region was employed for determining the direction of hybrid crosses, which were most frequently L. boscii female x L. whiffiagonis male. Reduced ability of L. boscii females to select conspecific mates would explain such asymmetric hybridization. To our knowledge this is the first time that increased hybridization between fish species can be associated to an oil spill. These results illustrate the potential long-term effect of petrol wastes on wild fish species...|$|R

DF and OA acknowledge two doctoral fellowships from the Portuguese Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT) (SFRH/BD/ 6123 / 2001) and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Education (BES- 2003 - 0163), respectively. Muscle concentrations of organochlorinated compounds as well as biliary levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and alkylphenols (APEs) were determined in two different fish species, the <b>four-spotted</b> <b>megrim</b> (Lepidorhombus boscii) and the pouting (Trisopterus luscus) collected along the Northern Iberian coast. Additionally, a set of biochemical markers namely, 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and catalase (CAT) were measured in liver subcellular fractions. Chemical analysis indicated geographical differences in pollutant loads that were further reinforced by biomarker responses. Thus, EROD activity showed a good correlation with the amount of PCBs bioaccumulated in muscle tissue of both fish species. Elevated UGT activity was observed in those individuals highly exposed to APEs and 1 -naphthol. The study reinforces the need to select representative sentinel species from different habitats for biomonitoring purposes and provides further support for the use of biomarkers in assessing the health of coastal areas.

40|$|The {{report is}} based on work {{conducted}} in a workshop that was held in Brest, France on 13 – 16 October 2015, and describes the preparatory work {{in response to the}} EC longterm management plans for western EU waters (ICES Subareas V to X). Specifically Art. 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1380 / 2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy, which requires a multiannual plan including quantifiable target. In this context ICES was requested to provide plausible values around FMSY for some stocks inhabiting western EU waters. Estimates of reference points Blim, Bpa, Flim and Fpa are provided for the stocks considered, and the FMSY ranges [Flower, Fupper] are estimated by ICES to be precautionary, and deliver no more than 5 % reduction in long-term yield compared with MSY.

40|$|Total {{mercury and}} {{methylmercury}} concentrations were {{measured in the}} muscle tissue of different fish species from the Adriatic Sea to ascertain whether the concentrations exceeded the maximum level fixed by the European Commission. Large species-dependent variability was observed. The highest total mercury mean concentrations were in benthic (0. 20 - 0. 76 microg g(- 1) wet wt) and demersal fish (0. 22 - 0. 73 microg g(- 1) wet wt), while pelagic species showed the lowest levels (0. 09 - 0. 23 microg g(- 1) wet wt). In 15 % of frost fish, in 42 % of skate and in 30 % of angler fish samples total mercury concentrations exceeded the maximum level fixed by the European Commission (Hg = 1 microg g(- 1) wet wt); for the species for which the maximum level was set to 0. 5 microg g(- 1) wet wt, concentrations exceeding the prescribed legal limit were observed in 6. 4 % of bokkem, in 6. 6 % of pandora, in 20 % of megrin, in 12. 5 % of <b>four-spotted</b> <b>megrim,</b> in 16 % of striped mullet, in 5. 0 % of forkbeard and in 5. 3 % of picarel samples. In all the different species, mercury was present almost completely in the methylated form, with mean percentages between 70 and 100 %. Weekly intake was estimated and compared with the {{provisional tolerable weekly intake}} recommended by the FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. A high exposure was associated with the consumption of only skates, frost fish and angler fish, thought the consumption of the other species, such as, megrim, four spotted megrim, red fish striped mullet and forkbeard, resulted in a weekly intake slightly below the established provisional tolerable weekly intake.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the potential {{role of the}} crinoid Leptometra phalangium {{as an indicator of}} highly productive areas along the shelf break that can sustain large biomasses of benthopelagic fish and recruits. The structure of fish assemblages in the central Mediterranean Sea (central-western coast of Italy), analysed on the basis of surveys carried out in summer and autumn from 1997 to 2001, revealed the presence of a well-defined group of species on the shelf break. This area, occurring at a depth of between 120 and 170 m, is characterised by detritic organogenic sediments colonised by the crinoid L. phalangium, a suspension-feeding macro-epibenthic species confined in the Mediterranean to the shelf-break area. Its abundance in the studied area can reach 12 - 15 ind. m(- 2). A total of 121 species belonging to 66 families of demersal organisms (crustacean decapods and stomatopods, cephalopods, selaceens and teleosteens) were caught at shelf-break stations from September to October. The species which typified the assemblage were the fishes Trisopterus minutus capelanus, Merluccius merluccius, Glossanodon leioglossus, Argentina sphyraena, Capros aper, Macroramphos scolopax and Lepidotrigla cavillone, the crustacean decapod Parapenaeus longirostris and the cephalopods Illex coindetii and Todaropsis eblanae. Detritic shelf-break stations showed a higher abundance of demersal organisms than stations distributed on muddy bottoms in the same depth range (100 - 200 m). Such differences appeared to be significant in September - October, when a clear increase in benthopelagic zooplanktivorus species, such as Glossanodon leioglossus, Trachurus trachurus, Trachurus picturatus, was found. The length structure of species occurring on the shelf break showed that for some of them the selection of this area is related to specific phases of their life cycle. Significant highest abundance of recruits and juveniles was observed for Merluccius merluccius, Helicolenus dactylopterus, Phycis blennoides, Parapenaeus longirostris and Capros aper in {{at least one of the}} two seasons. Similarly, an increased abundance of spawners of red mullet Mullus barbatus and <b>four-spotted</b> <b>megrim</b> Lepidorhombus boscii was observed on the shelf break. Results of this study may have important consequences for management of fish stocks and assemblages in the central Mediterranean. The cooccurrence of high densities of L. phalangium and benthopelagic fish, occurring mainly with juveniles and spawners, strongly indicates a potential role of L. phalangium as an indicator of highly productive areas around the shelf break. Such areas appear to play a major role in the production of some of the most abundant and commercially important fish species, such as the Mediterranean hake and red mullet...|$|R
