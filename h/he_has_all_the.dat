5|$|Finding himself totally {{alone in}} a {{shattered}} world with food to last him a lifetime but no one to share it with, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees {{the ruins of the}} public library in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and readable; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) learns that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time in the world to read them without interruption.|$|E
25|$|I am {{sent here}} as a peace chief; all here is to be peace, but north of the Arkansas is General Sheridan, the great war chief, and I do not control him; and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{soldiers}} who are fighting the Arapahoes and Cheyennes. Therefore, you must {{go back to your}} country, and if the soldiers come to fight, you must remember they are not from me, but from that great war chief, and with him you must make peace.|$|E
25|$|In true Robin and Patrick fashion, they cannot get on {{the same}} page - just when Robin realizes she does want to marry him, Patrick has finally {{accepted}} the fact that she does not. Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes. They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time in the world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin {{is the only one who}} had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he would be there. Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas.|$|E

500|$|Watts {{announced}} in October {{that he would}} nominate for the 2008 draft, with he, Naitanui and another West Australian, Daniel Rich, touted as the most likely players to be recruited with the first selection in the 2008 AFL draft. He furthered his claim as the potential number one pick when he recorded the second fastest time by a non-Indigenous player in the twenty metre sprint with 2.82 seconds at the AFL draft camp, in addition to placing second in the agility test, fifth in the standing vertical jump and seventh in the repeated sprints. His rise during the year saw The Age journalist, Emma Quayle, describe him as the [...] "most complete prospect in [...] draft, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> athletic qualities you could want in a key forward—he's quick, agile, he's a good kick and he can mark". In {{the weeks leading up}} to the draft, it was widely accepted by the media that he would be the first pick in the draft.|$|E
500|$|In 1856, Bizet {{competed for}} the prestigious Prix de Rome. His entry was not successful, but nor were {{any of the}} others; the musician's prize was not awarded that year. After this rebuff, Bizet entered an opera {{competition}} which Jacques Offenbach had organised for young composers, with a prize of 1,200 francs. The challenge was to set the one-act libretto of Le docteur Miracle by Léon Battu and Ludovic Halévy. The prize was awarded jointly to Bizet and Charles Lecocq, a compromise which years later Lecocq criticised {{on the grounds of}} the jury's manipulation by Fromental Halévy in favour of Bizet. As a result of his success, Bizet became a regular guest at Offenbach's Friday evening parties, where among other musicians he met the aged Gioachino Rossini, who presented the young man with a signed photograph. Bizet was a great admirer of Rossini's music, and wrote not long after their first meeting that [...] "Rossini is the greatest of them all, because like Mozart, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> virtues".|$|E

500|$|On {{the last}} day of the 2013 January {{transfer}} window, Morison signed for Championship side Leeds United as part of a swap deal. The transfer involved Luciano Becchio moving to Norwich, as well as Norwich paying Leeds a [...] "further undisclosed sum". On signing Morison, the then-Leeds manager Neil Warnock said that – [...] "Steve meets all the requirements of the striker we've been looking to bring in. For me, he is a player who has everything. He can score goals from anywhere – whether it's 25 yards or a tap-in – he has pace, and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> attributes you want". He made his Leeds debut on 9 February 2013, playing the whole match in the club's 2–2 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux. Morison scored his first goal for the club on his home debut on 20 February, netting the second goal in a 2–0 victory over Blackpool. He scored twice for Leeds in the club's 2–2 draw against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on 9 March. The two goals proved to be Morison's last of the season; he scored three goals in 16 appearances during the second half of the 2012–13 campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Gullit's {{brilliance}} prompted George Best {{to comment}} in 1990, [...] "Ruud Gullit {{is a great}} player by any standards. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> skills. He's not afraid to do things with the ball. And he looks as if he's enjoying every second of it. By my reckoning that's what makes him an even better player than Maradona. Both have the key quality you will find in all the best players: balance. You just can't knock them off the ball. It was the same with Pelé, Beckenbauer and Cruyff." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buller was {{impressed}} with Findlay's performance, and stated that he considered [...] "Major Findlay {{one of the best}} Officers I met. [...] He was an admirable commander of an Ammunition Column, loaded with ammunition of many different natures. [...] His batteries were complete every night, and he never made a mistake. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> qualifications for the staff and for high command, and I desire to bring his name most prominently to your notice as deserving of all consideration." [...] Shortly after this commendation was published in the London Gazette on 8 February 1901 Findlay was appointed a staff officer (on 5 March).|$|E

2500|$|However, by 20 September, Bellini {{told his}} Neapolitan friend Francesco Florimo {{that he did}} not think the {{performance}} could take place as scheduled due to Romani being ill. In addition, he was concerned about who would sing the tenor role when he had been unable to obtain Rubini's release from his Naples contract. [...] Fortunately, having received good reports of the young tenor Domenico Reina, he was able to secure his services, describing him in a letter to Florimo as [...] "one who will want to do himself honour; everyone tells me that his voice is beautiful, and that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> acting and spirit one could wish for." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Navarro later {{stated that}} Queen had tricked him, {{and that she}} owed him money from the sales and {{production}} of the album [...] No legal action was taken, however. Navarro was invited by Jorge Guadalupe, Ivy Queen's manager to take legal action, as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> papers stating {{that there was no}} deception with the album. Guadalupe called Navarro [...] "someone who misses the money and the high-life" [...] he had while he was married to Queen. Navarro would also go on national television and accuse Queen of being unfaithful in their relationship on the television program Escándalo TV (Telefutura). He would also mention the accusations that Queen owed him money from the album as well on the program.|$|E

In addition, he was concerned about who would sing the tenor role when [...] he had been unable to obtain Rubini's release from his Naples contract. Berardo Calvari (known as Winter) was rejected because audiences had disliked him the previous July when he appeared in both a Pacini and a Donizetti opera at La Scala. Fortunately, having received good reports of the young tenor Domenico Reina, he was able to secure his services, describing him in a letter to Florimo as [...] "one who will want to do himself honour; everyone tells me that his voice is beautiful, and that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> acting and spirit one could wish for." ...|$|E

2500|$|In some cases, the killer's {{arrogance and}} dismissive {{attitude}} allow Columbo to manipulate his suspects into self-incrimination. While the details, {{and eventually the}} motivation(s), of the murderers' actions are shown to the viewer, Columbo's true thoughts and intentions are almost never revealed until {{close to the end}} of the episode. (Often he begins to whistle the tune [...] "This Old Man" [...] once <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> loose ends of his case tied up.) Columbo generally maintains a friendly relationship with the murderer until the end. The point at which the detective first begins to suspect the murderer is generally not revealed, although it is often fairly early on. In some instances, such as Ruth Gordon's avenging elderly mystery writer in [...] "Try and Catch Me", Janet Leigh's terminally ill and deluded actress in [...] "Forgotten Lady", Donald Pleasence's elegant vintner in [...] "Any Old Port in a Storm", and Johnny Cash's enserfed singer in [...] "Swan Song", the killer is more sympathetic than the victim.|$|E
2500|$|Gabbidon {{had made}} 17 {{appearances}} for the Welsh Under-21 team, when an unexpected call {{up for the}} Welsh senior squad in the World Cup qualifier against Belarus in October 2001 prevented him from making his final appearance for the under 21 side. He was an unused substitute in that match and was again called into the senior squad for a friendly game against Argentina in February 2002 {{but it was not}} until the next month that he made his debut in a 0–0 home draw against the Czech Republic on 27 March 2002. He became a regular in the team despite a back problem that caused him to miss a large part of the 2002–03 season, and was part of the squad that narrowly missed out on a place at Euro 2004, losing to Russia in the play-offs, and the squad that did not qualify for the 2006 World Cup. Roy Evans, the Wales assistant coach, tipped Gabbidon to be a future captain of the national side, saying, [...] "I see him as potential captain material even if it is not my decision. But <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> qualities. You do not always have to be vocal, you need to lead by example." [...] Gabbidon captained the side in place of the injured Ryan Giggs in 1–0 away defeat against Cyprus in November 2005 and again in place of Craig Bellamy in a 1–0 win against Bulgaria in August 2007.|$|E
2500|$|So in {{love with}} praise, both popular and in the highest circles, is Wilberforce, observes Hazlitt, that he was even half {{inclined}} {{to give up his}} favorite cause, abolition of the slave trade, when William Pitt, the Prime Minister, was set to abandon it, and he sided with Pitt in approval of the repressive measures then imposed by the government in Britain and the government's later severe measures during the period of the Napoleonic Wars and afterward. [...] "He has no mercy on those who claim a property in negro-slaves as so much live-stock on their estates ... but not a word has he to say, not a whisper does he breathe against the claim set up by the Despots of the Earth over their Continental subjects, but does every thing in his power to confirm and sanction it! He must give no offence. ... He preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages; and tolerates its worst abuses in civilized states." [...] To [...] "render signal services to mankind" [...] requires greater moral strength than Wilberforce possesses: what is needed is [...] "a severity, a sternness, a self-denial, and a painful sense of duty" [...] that in Wilberforce's case vanish in exchange for a nod of approval from the king or the Prime Minister. Even in Wilberforce's acts of independence from his party's political standpoint, Hazlitt notes a subtle balancing of motives. In the words of Wilberforce biographer William Hague, who quotes Hazlitt's Spirit of the Age criticism, [...] "Hazlitt considered that Wilberforce meant well, but would never risk becoming unpopular with the ruling establishment: 'He ... reaps the credit of independence without the obloquy ... <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> air of the most perfect independence, and gains a character for impartiality and candour, when he is only striking a balance between the éclat of differing from a Minister on some vantage ground, and the risk or odium that may attend it.|$|E
