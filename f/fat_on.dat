This thick coat of hair insulates their bodies {{so well that}} they have a minimal outer layer of <b>fat</b> <b>on</b> their bodies, which would otherwise create waste at slaughter.

Despite the animal's usual use in beef production, there is evidence of Galloway herds being milked in Cumberland for cheese production.|$|E
5|$|Several {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} that MFGM could positively affect circulating lipids. A single-blind RCT in overweight adults has shown that the effects of milk <b>fat</b> <b>on</b> plasma lipids were modulated by the MFGM content; compared to butter oil (control diet), consumption of whipping cream (MFGM diet) for 8 weeks did not impair the lipoprotein profile. Another double-blind RCT in overweight and obese adults has also shown that MFGM attenuated the negative effects of a high-saturated fats meal by reducing postprandial cholesterol, inflammatory markers and insulin response. A double-blind RCT in normal healthy adults has indicated that one month consumption of buttermilk rich in MFGM led to reduction in serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels as well as blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The poetic {{versions}} of the story allude to additional matter within the tradition of Mac Da Thó's pig, including the names of Mac Da Thó's wife Maine Athrai, of his two sons, and of his grandson Léna. According to these accounts, Léna first found the pig in Slieve Bloom, and was responsible for its nourishment until it had seven inches of <b>fat</b> <b>on</b> its snout. Maine Athrai needed the pig for her husband's great feast; Léna refused, but he was killed when the pig grubbed up earth with its snout, burying him alive in his sleep. In {{this version of the}} tale, which shows how much may have been omitted from the narrow version of the saga, Mac Da Thó's swineherd Follscaide dutifully delivers the pig to his master's feast.|$|E
40|$|Four emulsion-filled gelatin gels varying in {{fat content}} (5 and 15 %) {{and type of}} {{emulsifier}} (whey protein isolate: fat droplets bound to matrix; Tween 20 : fat droplets unbound to matrix) were studied. We investigated (1) the formation and clearance dynamics of <b>fat</b> deposition <b>on</b> the tongue using in vivo fluorescence during oral processing; (2) influence of <b>fat</b> droplet characteristics <b>on</b> <b>fat</b> deposition <b>on</b> tongue and fatty mouthfeel; and (3) effect of follow-up consumption (water or gelatin gel) on the removal of <b>fat</b> deposition <b>on</b> the tongue. We conclude that <b>fat</b> fraction deposited <b>on</b> tongue and fatty perception increased with increasing mastication time, and decreased after expectoration with increasing clearance time. <b>Fat</b> fraction deposited <b>on</b> tongue and fatty perception are higher in gels with unbound droplets compared to bound droplets, {{as well as in}} gels with 15 % fat compared to 5 % fat. Water removed deposited fat from the tongue faster than gelatin gel...|$|R

Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) are about to get married. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), after being humiliated with his talent show audition tape going viral on the internet, has found a job at his alma mater Cornell University in the Admissions Office. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) has helped expand Athlead, now named Athleap, opening a branch in Austin, Texas.

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{saturated}} <b>fat</b> <b>on</b> risk of disease is controversial.

25|$|The {{distribution}} of adipose (fat) tissue changes slowly over months and years.

The body begins to burn old adipose tissue in the waist, shoulders, and back, making those areas smaller.|$|E
25|$|The TUG flap (also the TMG flap) {{consists}} of the gracilis muscle and a transversely-oriented island of skin and <b>fat</b> <b>on</b> the superior inner thigh. Sacrifice of the gracilis muscle does not result in functional impairment. The TUG flap is nourished by the ascending branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery with two venae comitantes, which come from the profunda femoris vessels. The vessels are routinely anastomosed to the internal mammary vessels, instead of to the thoraco-dorsal vessels in the axilla, because the blood vessels of the TUG flap are relatively short.|$|E
25|$|A cold-process soapmaker first {{looks up}} the {{saponification}} value for each unique <b>fat</b> <b>on</b> an oil specification sheet. Oil specification sheets contain laboratory test results for each fat, including the precise saponification {{value of the}} fat. The saponification value for a specific fat varies by season and by specimen species. This value {{is used to calculate}} the exact amount of sodium hydroxide to react with the fat to form soap. The saponification value must be converted into an equivalent sodium hydroxide value for use in cold process soapmaking. Excess unreacted lye in the soap results in a very high pH and can burn or irritate skin, whereas not enough lye leaves the soap greasy. Most soap makers formulate their recipes with a 2–5% deficit of lye, to account for the unknown deviation of saponification value between their oil batch and laboratory averages.|$|E

25|$|Other {{high-level}} mechanisms may read in {{and process}} larger parts or the complete <b>FAT</b> <b>on</b> startup or on demand when needed and dynamically build up in-memory tree {{representations of the}} volume's file structures different from the on-disk structures. This may, on volumes with many free clusters, occupy even less memory than {{an image of the}} FAT itself. In particular on highly fragmented or filled volumes, seeks become much faster than with linear scans over the actual FAT, even if an image of the FAT would be stored in memory. Also, operating on the logically high level of files and cluster-chains instead of on sector or track level, it becomes possible to avoid some degree of file fragmentation in the first place or to carry out local file defragmentation and reordering of directory entries based on their names or access patterns in the background.|$|E
25|$|After Baartman's death, Geoffroy Saint Hilaire applied {{on behalf}} of the Muséum d' Histoire Naturelle to retain her corpse {{on the grounds that it}} was of {{singular}} specimen of humanity and therefore of special scientific interest. The application was approved and Baartman's skeleton and body cast were displayed in Muséum d'histoire naturelle d’Angers, where she entertained visitors until her skull was stolen in 1827, and subsequently returned a few months later. The restored skeleton and skull continued to arouse the interest of visitors until the remains were moved to the Musée de l'Homme, when it was founded in 1937, and continued up until the late 1970s. Her body cast and skeleton stood side by side and faced away from the viewer which emphasized her steatopygia (accumulation of <b>fat</b> <b>on</b> the buttocks) while reinforcing that aspect as the primary interest of her body. The Baartman exhibit proved popular until it elicited complaints from feminists who believed the exhibit was a degrading representation of women. The skeleton was removed in 1974, and the body cast in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Hatshepsut had the {{expedition}} commemorated in relief at Deir el-Bahri, {{which is also}} famous for its realistic depiction of the Queen of the Land of Punt, Queen Ati. The Puntite Queen is portrayed as relatively tall and her physique was generously proportioned, with large breasts and rolls of <b>fat</b> <b>on</b> her body. Due to the fat deposits on her buttocks, it has sometimes been argued {{that she may have}} had steatopygia. However, according to the pathologist Marc Armand Ruffer, the main characteristic of a steatopygous woman is a disproportion in size between the buttocks and thighs, which was not the case with Ati. She instead appears to have been generally obese, a condition that was exaggerated by excessive lordosis or curvature of the lower spine. Hatshepsut also sent raiding expeditions to Byblos and Sinai shortly after the Punt expedition. Very little is known about these expeditions. Although many Egyptologists have claimed that her foreign policy was mainly peaceful, it is possible that she led military campaigns against Nubia and Canaan.|$|E

25|$|The stanza {{begins with}} a celebration of divine power, and then {{abruptly}} shifts to a darker, more allusive train of thought, featuring condemnation of a renowned poet, Archilochus, Grown <b>fat</b> <b>on</b> the harsh words of hate. Archilochus was an iambic poet, working within a genre that licensed abusive and scurrilous versea regrettable tendency {{from the viewpoint of}} Pindar, whose own persona is intensely earnest, preaching to Hieron the need for moderation (wealth with wisdom) and submission to the divine will. The reference to the embittered poet appears to be Pindar's meditative response to some intrigues at Hieron's court, possibly by his rivals, condemned elsewhere as a pair of ravens (Olympian 2). The intensity of the stanza suggests that it is the culmination and climax of the poem. In fact, the stanza occupies the middle of Pythian 2 and the intensity is sustained throughout the poem from beginning to end. It is the sustained intensity of his poetry that Quintilian refers to above as a rolling flood of eloquence and Horace below refers to as the uncontrollable momentum of a river that has burst its banks. Longinus likens him to a vast fire and Athenaeus refers to him as the great-voiced Pindar.|$|E

500|$|In late 1977, {{while in}} {{rehearsal}} {{for their next}} album, and {{just days before the}} band was set to enter the studio, Osbourne abruptly quit the band. Iommi called vocalist Dave Walker, a longtime friend of the band, who had previously been a member of Fleetwood Mac and Savoy Brown, and informed him that Osbourne had left the band. Walker, who was at that time fronting a band called Mistress, flew to Birmingham from California in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with Black Sabbath. On 8 January 1978, Black Sabbath made their only live performance with Walker on vocals, playing an early version of the song [...] "Junior's Eyes" [...] on the BBC Television programme [...] "Look! Hear!" [...] Walker later recalled that while in Birmingham he had bumped into Osbourne in a pub and {{came to the conclusion that}} Osbourne was not fully committed to leaving Black Sabbath.
