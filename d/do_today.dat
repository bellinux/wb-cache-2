5|$|Fish {{may have}} {{evolved from a}} {{creature}} similar to a coral-like sea squirt, whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways.

5|$|Lemurs {{and humans}} are both {{primates}}. Ancestral primates had brown eyes, as most primates <b>do</b> <b>today.</b> The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans {{has been studied}} in detail and much is known about it. It {{is not the case}} that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue eye color. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of the variation. In lemurs, the difference(s) between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.|$|E
5|$|One temnospondyl, the dvinosaur Trimerorhachis, {{may have}} brooded young {{in an area}} between the gills called the {{pharyngeal}} pouch. Small bones belonging to younger Trimerorhachis individuals {{have been found in}} these pouches. The living Darwin's Frog is also a mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to Trimerorhachis if it cared for its young in this way. An alternative possibility is that Trimerorhachis was cannibalistic, eating its young like many amphibians <b>do</b> <b>today.</b> If this was the case, the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the pharyngeal pouch as the animal fossilized.|$|E

5|$|The three {{orangutan}} {{species are}} the only extant members of the subfamily Ponginae. This subfamily also included the extinct genera Lufengpithecus, which lived in southern China and Thailand 2–8mya, and Sivapithecus, which lived India and Pakistan from 12.5mya until 8.5mya. These apes likely lived in drier and cooler environments than orangutans <b>do</b> <b>today.</b> Khoratpithecus piriyai, which lived in Thailand 5–7mya, {{is believed to have}} been the closest known relative of the orangutans. The largest known primate, Gigantopithecus, was also a member of Ponginae and lived in China, India and Vietnam from 5mya to 100,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|Georgian English {{landscape}} gardens, such as West Wycombe and Stowe, {{are arranged}} as a walk or series of walks {{that take the}} visitor through a range of locations, {{each with its own}} specific character and separate from the last. Planting and the shape of the landscape is used, alongside follies and man-made water features, to create pleasant vistas and set pieces centred on a building, straight avenue, serpentine walk, or viewpoint. In the later years of the 18th century, the 5,000acres (20km²) of grounds were extended to the east, towards the nearby town of High Wycombe, and Humphrey Repton completed the creation of the gardens, until they appeared much as they <b>do</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
5|$|The reasons Paraceratherium became extinct after {{surviving}} {{for about}} 11 million years are unknown, {{but it is}} unlikely that there was a single cause. Theorised reasons include climate change, low reproduction rate, and invasion by gomphothere proboscideans from Africa in the late Oligocene. Gomphotheres may have been able to considerably change the habitats they entered, {{in the same way that}} African elephants <b>do</b> <b>today,</b> by destroying trees and turning woodland into grassland. Once their food source became scarce and their numbers dwindled, Paraceratherium populations would have become more vulnerable to other threats. Large predators like Hyaenaelurus and Amphicyon also entered Asia from Africa during the early Miocene; these may have predated Paraceratherium calves. Other herbivores also invaded Asia during this time.|$|E

5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to correct for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they <b>do</b> <b>today.</b> Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E

25|$|In Japan, {{temperate}} deciduous forests rapidly spread {{onto the}} main island of Honshu and caused an adaption away from hunting megafauna (Naumann’s elephant and Yabe’s giant deer) to hunting the quicker sika deer and wild boar in dense forest.

A study of the Jōmon people that lived on the Pacific coast of Honshu during the early Holocene shows that they were conducting individual dog burials and were probably using dogs as tools for hunting sika deer and wild boar, as hunters in Japan still <b>do</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
