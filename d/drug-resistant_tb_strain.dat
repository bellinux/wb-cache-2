40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) is an {{infectious}} disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which currently presents an immense global health challenge. It {{ranks as the}} second {{leading cause of death}} from {{an infectious}} disease worldwide. An estimated one third of the world’s population is infected with the tubercle bacilli; with 95 % of TB cases occur in developing countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that there were 9 million new cases of TB and 1. 4 million TB deaths globally in 2011. TB normally affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) and can affect other sites as well (extrapulmonary TB). The disease is spread by the air when people who are sick with pulmonary TB spout bacteria during coughing, sneezing and speaking. In general, infection by the pathogen does not necessarily result in the development of clinical symptoms and relatively small proportion (5 - 10 %) of these individuals will progress to active disease each year. The remaining proportion (90 - 95 %) of infected individuals will initially be asymptomatic and undergo latent infection, from which reactivation may occur when immune system of the patient becomes weakened. If patients are not treated properly, TB can be fatal. New cases of drug-susceptible TB are treated with a 6 -month regimen of four first-line drugs: isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide (PZA). RIF is a broad spectrum rifamycin derivative that interferes the synthesis of mRNA by binding to the ß subunit of RNA polymerase (RpoB) in bacterial cells. INH is a prodrug that requires activation by M. tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase (KatG), to generate a range of reactive oxygen species and reactive organic radicals, which then attack multiple targets in the tubercle bacillus. The primary target of the inhibition is the cell wall mycolic acid synthesis pathway (Figure 1). EMB inhibits the formation of mycobacterial membrane. The mechanism of action of PZA is poorly understood. The only known mechanisms are it disrupts membrane energetics and inhibits membrane transport function in M. tuberculosis. Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are considered to be important second-line drugs recommended for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). They act by inhibiting DNA supercoiling, thus preventing replication and cell division. They block a type II topoisomerase (called DNA gyrase) of M. tuberculosis, a heterotetramer consisting of two A and B subunits coded by the gyrA and gyrB genes. Among second-line anti-TB drugs, aminoglycosides (kanamycin [KAN] and amikacin [AMK]) and cyclic peptides (capreomycin [CAP] and viomycin) inhibit protein synthesis by inhibiting the normal function of ribosomes (Figure 1). The emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis throughout the world possess a serious threat to TB control. Resistance to anti-TB drugs arises due to a variety of reasons, such as the failure to detect resistance to TB drugs, interrupting treatment, omitting one or more drugs from the recommended prescription and suboptimal dosage. Thus, M. tuberculosis can become resistant to multiple drugs in the period of a few months. Essentially, drug resistance arises in areas with improper TB control programmes. A patient who develops active disease with a <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> <b>strain</b> can transmit this form of TB to other individuals. MDR-TB, which is caused by bacteria that are resistant to least two first-line drugs including INH and RIF and, extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB), which is caused by bacteria that are resistant to INH and RIF as well as any FQs and any of the second-line anti-TB injectable drugs (AMK, KAN or CAP). WHO estimates that from 220, 000 to 400, 000 of MDR-TB cases occur among TB cases notified in the world in 2011. About 60 % of these drug-resistant TB cases occur in Brazil, China, India, the Russian Federation and South Africa (that are referred as BRICS countries) (Figure 2). By the end of 2010, 68 countries had reported at least one case of XDR-TB (Figure 3). Genotyping of M. tuberculosis plays an increasing role for understanding the epidemiology and biology of TB. Genotyping techniques are important for molecular epidemiological investigations of TB such as defining chains of ongoing transmission and differentiating patient relapse from exogenous re-infection, and defining the evolutionary background of clinical isolates. Over the past years, several methods have been developed to discriminate M. tuberculosis strains: insertion sequence 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism, spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping), variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR), single-nucleotide polymorphisms and large sequence polymorphisms. Nepal is a landlocked country in South East Asia, bounded to the north by China and to the south by India, sharing an open border with India. In Nepal, TB is a major public health problem. The incidence of all forms of TB was estimated to be 173 / 100, 000 population while the incidence of new smear-positive cases was at 77 per 100, 000 in 2008. The four surveillances conducted between 1996 and 2007 have indicated the fluctuating prevalence of MDR-TB among new cases of between 1. 1 % and 3. 7 % (1. 1 % in 1996, 3. 7 % in 1999, 1. 4 % in 2001 and 2. 9 % in 2007). The latest estimate of MDR-TB is 2. 9 % and 11. 7 % among new and recurrent cases, respectively. Rapid determination of the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis is important for the early administration of appropriate therapeutic agents for the prevention of additional resistance development. In this context, the molecular characterization of drug resistance by identifying mutations in associated genes will be applicable for developing a potential rapid molecular drug susceptibility test as an alternative to conventional methods. The present thesis consists of two chapters; in chapter I, I have investigated the type and frequency of drug resistance-conferring mutations that occurred among M. tuberculosis clinical isolates that were phenotypically MDR by DNA sequencing. I have also compared the frequency of different mutations with those in isolates circulating in the surrounding countries. In chapter II, I have described drug resistance-associated mutations in XDR isolates and analyzed the genetic background of these isolates by using a molecular approach...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of review: Drug resistance, {{particularly}} through {{multidrug-resistant tuberculosis}} (<b>TB)</b> and extensively <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> <b>strains,</b> poses {{a real threat}} to TB control worldwide. Recent reports from the WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease demonstrate that the emerging epidemic of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> is a global problem, although emphasis {{has been placed on}} several 'hot spots' because of lack of good global data.

Summary: <b>Drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> originates from different human errors, including misuse of anti-TB drugs and other reasons related to prescribers, patients and drug producers.

We report treatment outcomes for adult XDR TB patients in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Initial data were obtained retrospectively, and outcomes were obtained prospectively during 24 months of treatment. A total of 114 XDR TB patients were treated (median 6 drugs, range 3 – 9 drugs); 82 (73 %) were HIV positive and 50 (61 %) were receiving antiretroviral therapy. After receiving treatment for 24 months, 48 (42 %) of 114 patients died, 25 (22 %) were cured or successfully completed treatment, 19 (17 %) defaulted from the study, and 22 (19 %) showed treatment failure.

40|$|In 1993, the World Health Organization (WHO) has {{declared}} tuberculosis (TB) a global emergency. Since then, more than 30 million {{lives have been}} claimed by that world-wide epidemic. In 2011, 8. 7 million people â€œfelt illâ€ because of TB and not all TB cases were reported to clinicians. Therefore, {{it is important to}} accurately identify TB patients by developing a diagnostic method that is sensitive, fast, and cost-effective. However, conventional methods have not met those criteria because they either require lengthy procedures or may misdiagnose TB cases.

40|$|Extensively <b>drug-resistant</b> (XDR) {{tuberculosis}} (<b>TB),</b> {{which is}} resistant to both first- and second-line antibiotics, is an escalating problem, {{particularly in the}} Russian Federation. Molecular fingerprinting of 2348 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates collected in Samara Oblast, Russia, revealed that 72 %belonged to the Beijing lineage, a genotype associated with enhanced acquisition of drug resistance and increased virulence. Whole-genome sequencing of 34 Samaran isolates, plus 25 isolates representing global M. tuberculosis complex diversity, revealed that Beijing isolates originating in Eastern Europe formed a monophyletic group. Homoplasic polymorphisms within this clade were almost invariably associated with antibiotic resistance, indicating that the evolution of this population is primarily driven by drug therapy. Resistance genotypes showed a strong correlation with drug susceptibility phenotypes. A novel homoplasic mutation in rpoC, found only in isolates carrying a common rpoB rifampicin-resistance mutation, {{may play a role}} in fitness compensation. Most multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates also had mutations in the promoter of a virulence gene, eis, which increase its expression and confer kanamycin resistance. Kanamycin therapy may thus select for mutants with increased virulence, helping preserve bacterial fitness and promoting transmission of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> <b>strains.</b> The East European clade was dominated by two MDR clusters, each disseminated across Samara.

40|$|With {{the spread}} of multidrug-resistant {{tuberculosis}} (MDR-TB) strains there is an increasing need for new accurate and cost-effective methods for a rapid diagnostic and drug susceptibility testing (DST), particularly in low-income countries where tuberculosis is hyperendemic. A colorimetric assay using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) has been suggested as a promising method for DST, especially to rifampicin. In this study, we standardized and evaluated the MTT assay for a rapid direct detection of rifampicin and isoniazid resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from sputum specimens using Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture medium as a gold standard. The MTT assay sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for rifampicin were 100 %, 86 %, 100 %, 99 %, respectively. For isoniazid, the MTT assay had a 100 % sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values. Interestingly, the MTT assay gave interpretable results within two weeks for 94 % of the samples compared to 7 - 14 weeks for LJ media. Overall, an excellent agreement was observed between MTT assay and LJ proportion method (Kappa, 0. 91 for rifampicin and 1. 00 for isoniazid). In conclusion, the direct colorimetric MTT assay simultaneously detects susceptible and resistant strains of M. tuberculosis within three weeks. It significantly shortens {{the time required to}} obtain a DST result and could be a reliable alternative method for rapid detection of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> <b>strains</b> in high-TB-burden resource-limited settings...|$|R
40|$|An immunocompetent {{patient was}} dually {{infected}} with a resistant and a multidrugresistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (<b>TB).</b> The multidrug-resistant <b>strain,</b> which {{belongs to the}} W-strain/Beijing family, was first isolated after 3 months of therapy. Inappropriate treatment led to further drug resistance and unsuccessful therapy. Thus, additional infections with resistant M. tuberculosis strains should be considered when tuberculosis therapy fails. During the last decade, <b>drug-resistant</b> Mycobacterium tuberculosis (<b>TB)</b> <b>strains</b> have emerged, posing {{a major threat to}} global TB control efforts. The incidence of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> has increased {{in many parts of the}} world, not only in developing countries but also in industrialized countries, where the prevalence of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> had been low (1). The emergence of drug resistance during antituberculosis therapy results mainly from inadequate therapy, i. e., improper prescription of treatment regimens, addition of single drugs to failing treatment regimens, and patient noncompliance.

Here we describe the first production, purification and low resolution solution structure of subunit γ (γ(1 - 204), Mtγ(1 - 204)) of the M. tuberculosis F-ATP synthase. Mtγ(1 - 204) is a pear-like shaped protein with a molecular weight of 23 ± 2 kDa. Protein sequence analysis of Mtγ revealed differences in the amino acid composition to γ subunits from other sources, in particular the presence of a unique stretch of 13 amino acid residues (Mtγ(165 - 178)). NMR studies showed that Mtγ(165 - 178) forms a loop of polar residues. Mtγ(165 - 178) has been aligned at the bottom of the globular domain of the Escherichia coli subunit γ, being in close vicinity to the polar residues R 41, Q 42, E 44 and Q 46 (M. tuberculosis nomenclature) of the c-ring.

40|$|The {{global spread}} of multidrug-resistant <b>strains</b> of {{tuberculosis}} (<b>TB)</b> mycobacteria {{was one of}} the main reasons leading the World Health Organisation to launch the Stop TB program worldwide. In spite of a slow decline of TB incidence and mortality worldwide, multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) has increased in several countries. MDR-TB is caused by organisms that are resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. The most <b>drug-resistant</b> forms of <b>TB</b> are the extensively <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> (XDR-TB) <b>strains</b> caused by organisms that are resistant also to fluoroquinolones and any of the second-line anti-TB injectable drugs. XDR-TB can take 2 years or more to treat with drugs that are less effective, more toxic, and more expensive. Mortality for XDR-TB is very high, and the risk of the transmission between persons of XDR-TB strains is a matter of concern for health systems. Major issues associated with enhanced XDR-TB are non-implementation of DOT (directly observed therapy) and DOT expansion strategies, the insufficient supply or the poor quality of the anti-tuberculosis drugs, and the inadequate intake of the anti-tuberculosis medicines. Nevertheless, prior treatment of MDR-TB with second-line drugs is the strongest associated factor increasing the risk for XDR tuberculosis more than fourfold. Specialized rapid, effective diagnostic methods, including drug-sensitivity testing, are essential for a precise diagnosis of XDR-TB, and subsequent proper treatment. The global rise and spread of XDR-TB have serious effects on TB-control programs, and urge effective health policy responses. National TB control programmes working with all health services can prevent XDR-TB by ensuring that all the physicians and professionals caring for people with TB adhere to the International Standards for TB Care.

South African Medical Journal, 104 :(8) : 583, doi: 10. 7196 /SAMJ. 8645. The original publication is available at [URL] assessment reports suggest that climate change patterns are threatening social and ecological vulnerability and resilience, with the strong potential of negatively affecting human health. Persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have weakened physiological responses and are immunologically vulnerable to pathogens and stressors in their environment, putting them at a health disadvantage in climate-based rising temperatures, water scarcity, air pollution, potential water- and vector-borne disease outbreaks, and habitat redistributions. These climatic aberrations may lead to increased surface drying and decreased availability of arable land, threatening food/nutrition security and sanitary water practices. Coupled with HIV/AIDS, climate change threatens ecological biodiversity via a larger-scale socioeconomic recourse to natural resources. Corresponding human and environmental activity shape conditions conducive to exacerbating high rates of HIV/AIDS. In South Africa, this epidemic is forming a ‘syndemic’ with tuberculosis (TB), which has come to include multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> (XDR-TB) <b>strains.</b> Because of high convergence rates, one epidemic cannot be addressed without understanding the other. Concurrent climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies are becoming increasingly important to curb changes that negatively affect the biospheres on which civilisation is ultimately dependent – from an agricultural, a developmental, and especially a health standpoint. Mitigation strategies such as reducing carbon emissions are essential, but may be only partially effective in slowing the rate of surface warming.

And to identify medical, social and demographic factors associated {{with the development of}} <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> DESIGN: <b>Strains</b> isolated from 144 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were studied for susceptibility to anti-tuberculosis drugs by the BACTEC method. Data collection forms were filled, to identify factors associated with drug resistance. RESULTS: Twenty-seven strains (50 %) were resistant to at least one anti-tuberculosis drugs. Thirty-one (22 %) were multi-drug resistant. With exception of only 2 cases, all MDR were found among previously treated cases. The highest rate of mono-drug resistance was observed for streptomycin in both groups of patients (new and previously treated patients). 22 (23. 6 %) strains collected from new and 8 (15. 6 %) of strains collected from previously treated patients were resistant to streptomycin respectively. Resistance to ethambutol was only seen in multi-drug resistance strains. With the exception of only one strain, all strains resistant to rifampicin were multi-drug resistant. In Khartoum 24 (26. 4 %) were multi-drug resistant, in Gazira 4 (16 %) and in the camps for displaced people 3 (10. 7 %) were multi-drug resistant. A history of previous treatment for tuberculosis, being more than 40 years of age, having long duration of symptoms, low weight and household contact of a TB patient were significantly associated with resistance to at least one anti-tuberculosis drug and multidrug resistance. CONCULUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of M. tuberculosis strains resistant to streptomycin also in new patients; drug resistance except for streptomycin among new cases is a rare phenomenon in Sudan, which indicates a low rate of transmission of resistant strains.

Of 128 patients with <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> diagnosed during January 2003 –November 2005, a total of 77 had multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, 26 had pre–extensively <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> (XDR TB), and 5 had XDR TB. Genotyping suggested ongoing transmission of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB,</b> and contact tracing among case-patients in the largest cluster demonstrated multiple possible points of contact. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated stepwise evolution of drug resistance, despite stringent treatment adherence. These fi ndings suggested that existing TB control measures were inadequate to control the spread of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> in this HIV co-infected population. Diagnosis delay and inappropriate therapy facilitated disease transmission and drugresistance. These data call for improved infection control measures, implementation of rapid diagnostics, enhanced active screening strategies, and pharmacokinetic studies to determine optimal dosages and treatment regimens.

5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a resistant <b>strain</b> of <b>TB.</b> A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. <b>Drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India.

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of death worldwide. Over the last decades, TB has also emerged in the {{pediatric}} population. Epidemiologic data of childhood TB are still limited and there is an urgent need of more data on very large cohorts. A multicenter study was conducted in 27 pediatric hospitals, pediatric wards, and public health centers in Italy using a standardized form, covering the period of time between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2012. Children with active TB, latent TB, and those recently exposed to TB or recently adopted/immigrated from a high TB incidence country were enrolled. Overall, 4234 children were included; 554 (13. 1 %) children had active TB, 594 (14. 0 %) latent TB and 3086 (72. 9 %) were uninfected. Among children with active TB, 481 (86. 8 %) patients had pulmonary TB. The treatment of active TB cases was known for 96. 4 % (n = 534) of the cases. Overall, 210 (39. 3 %) out of these 534 children were treated with three and 216 (40. 4 %) with four first-line drugs. Second-line drugs where used in 87 (16. 3 %) children with active <b>TB.</b> <b>Drug-resistant</b> <b>strains</b> of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were reported in 39 (7 %) children. Improving the surveillance of childhood TB is important for public health care workers and pediatricians. A non-negligible proportion of children had <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> and was treated with second-line drugs, most of which are off-label in the pediatric age. Future efforts should concentrate on improving active surveillance, diagnostic tools, and the availability of antitubercular pediatric formulations, also in low-endemic countries...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study are to predict the future trend of drug-sensitive and resistant tuberculosis (TB) in Thailand, and {{to assess the impact of}} different control strategies on the generation of drug resistant TB, through the use of mathematical analysis. We assume that the present status of TB and the emergence of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> in Thailand are the consequence of past epidemics. Control strategies in the model are defined by specifying the value of the effective treatment rate (baseline value = 0. 74) and the relative treatment efficacy (baseline value = 0. 84). It is predicted that the total number of new TB cases would continue to decrease at the current level of intervention. Although a dramatic decline in the incidence rate of drug-sensitive cases is expected, drug-resistant cases are predicted to increase gradually, so that more than half of the <b>TB</b> <b>strains</b> would not be drug-sensitive after 2020. The prediction is not greatly altered by improving the interventions. They could, however, delay the emergence of drug-resistant strains for a few years. Our study demonstrates it would be impossible to avoid the continued emergence of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> in the future. It is pointed out that there are urgent needs to ensure adequate supervision and monitoring, to insure treatment of 100 % of the targeted population with Directly Observed Therapy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the prevalence and identify the risk factors for the development of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in a tertiary care center in Oman. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional review of culture-confirmed tuberculosis (TB) cases diagnosed at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital between August 2006 and March 2015. We compared <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> cases with drug-sensitive cases to identify predictors of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the 260 TB cases reviewed, 73. 1 % were confirmed by culture. The proportion of multi-drug resistant TB was 1. 8 %. TB isolates resistant to any of the first-line TB drugs comprised (7. 5 %) of cases. Pyrazinamide monoresistance was the most frequently reported drug monoresistant pattern (3. 5 %). Previous treatment for TB (odds ratio (OR) 14. 81; 95 % CI 3. 09 − 70. 98, p < 0. 001), female gender (OR 3. 85; 95 % Cl 1. 07 − 13. 90, p < 0. 039), and younger age (OR 6. 80; 95 % Cl 1. 61 − 28. 75, p < 0. 009) were found to be risk factors for development of first-line antituberculosis <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Our results show that the rate of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> in our population is a public health issue of great concern. Previous treatment with antituberculosis drugs, female gender, and younger age are risk factors for the development of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB.</b> These findings are useful adjuvants to guide clinicians and public health professionals in the early detection and appropriate treatment of cases of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{yield of}} mycobacterial blood {{cultures}} for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) among <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> suspects {{has not been}} described. Methods We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis to determine the yield of mycobacterial blood cultures for MDR-TB and XDR-TB among patients suspected of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> from rural South Africa. Secondary outcomes included risk factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteremia and the additive yield of mycobacterial blood cultures compared to sputum culture. Results From 9 / 1 / 2006 to 12 / 31 / 2008, 130 patients suspected of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> were evaluated with mycobacterial blood culture. Each patient had a single mycobacterial blood culture with 41 (32 %) positive for M. tuberculosis, of which 20 (49 %) were XDR-TB and 8 (20 %) were MDR-TB. One hundred fourteen (88 %) patients {{were known to be}} HIV-infected. Patients on antiretroviral therapy were significantly less likely to have a positive blood culture for M. tuberculosis (p = 0. 002). The diagnosis of MDR or XDR-TB was made by blood culture alone in 12 patients. Conclusions Mycobacterial blood cultures provided an additive yield for diagnosis of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> in patients with HIV from rural South Africa. The use of mycobacterial blood cultures should be considered in all patients suspected of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> in similar settings. </p...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) is {{a serious}} {{respiratory}} disease caused by bacteria that are spread {{from person to person}} through the air. In most cases, TB is treatable and curable; however, TB can be deadly without proper treatment. TB bacteria can become resistant to the drugs used for treatment. When this occurs, treatment is often still possible, but it is complex, long, challenging, and expensive. Rates of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> remain relatively low in the United States, though nearly half a million cases are estimated to occur globally each year. 1 These cases underscore the need for ongoing vigilance and action, especially given the ease with which TB can spread through international travel and migration. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention works with state and local health departments and other health care providers {{to prevent the spread of}} <b>TB,</b> track <b>drug-resistant</b> cases, assist with diagnosis as needed, and help ensure that patients with <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> receive effective treatment and care.
