50|$|Introduced in 1931 as a {{four-stroke}} {{single cylinder}} motorcycle, this model {{was the first}} to feature the Bullet name. It differed {{in a number of ways}} from its successors (which are now familiar): it had an <b>inclined</b> <b>engine</b> with exposed valve gear featuring four valves per cylinder with 350 cc and 500 cc options. In 1933, a 250 cc option was also added to the range. Its frame was also considerably different, having centre-spring girder front forks, being among a new range of models from Royal Enfield that featured them, along with a saddle-type fuel tank. However, common to motorcycles of this period, it had a rigid rear-end, necessitating a 'sprung' seat for the rider, which resulted in the iconic look of the motorcycle that is much replicated today, even though the sprung seat is unnecessary in modern models.|$|E

5000|$|In 1861, Stevens bought Naugatuck as a {{test-bed}} for innovations {{intended for}} the Stevens Battery, still unfinished in the shipyard. During 1861 and early 1862, Stevens reinforced the deck to support one 100-pound Parrott gun amidships trained forward, later augmented with two 12-pounder howitzers. Stevens replaced the original engine with a twin propeller arrangement, driven by two <b>inclined</b> <b>engines</b> with one boiler [...] He also added interior ballast tanks fore and aft. The New York Times reported on March 22, 1862, that “The Naugatuck {{is not intended to}} be a model of Mr. Stevens’ iron-clad battery, but is designed to illustrate one or two novel ideas connected with that monstrous engine of war, viz: The ability to sink and raise a vessel with great rapidity; to turn and manage her by means of two propellers located one {{on each side of the}} stern; also, taking up the recoil of the gun by means of India-rubber.” ...|$|R

5000|$|Notes on the Locomotives [...] The {{first two}} {{locomotives}} were outside cylinder 0-4-0 tank engines. They proved {{not to be}} powerful enough for the severe <b>inclines</b> so <b>engines</b> 3 to 10 were 0-6-0 inside cylinder saddle tanks {{from a wide range}} of builders. Some poorly researched historical sources often get this fact wrong and describe the larger saddle tank engines as outside cylinder engines.|$|R

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, New Zealand Railways awarded 20,850 pounds to John McGregor and Co shipbuilders of Dunedin to build a steamship for Lake Wakatipu at their Otago Foundry and Engineering Works. [...] The Earnslaw was designed by naval architect Hugh McRae and was based on a Siemens-Martin steel hull design and using Kauri for the decking. Propulsion was provided by twin coal-fired triple-expansion, jet-condensing, vertically <b>inclined</b> <b>engines.</b> The keel was laid on 4 July 1911. The ship was named after Mount Earnslaw, a 2889-metre peak at the head of Lake Wakatipu. She was to be 51.2 metres long, the biggest boat on the lake, and the largest steamship built in New Zealand. Transporting the Earnslaw [...] was no easy task. When construction was finally completed, she was dismantled. All the quarter-inch steel hull plates were numbered for reconstruction much like a jig-saw puzzle. Then the parts were loaded on to a goods train and transported across the South Island from Dunedin to Kingston at the southern end of Lake Wakatipu.|$|R

5000|$|The second Water Witch was a {{modification}} of the hull of the first [...] She entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard late in 1845; had her hull lengthened by some 30 feet; and had all her machinery removed and replaced with a new power plant to drive a Loper propeller. However, that configuration, after some months of experimentation, also proved unsatisfactory and; in 1847, she again traded her propulsion plant for an <b>inclined</b> condensing <b>engine</b> driving conventional side-wheels. She probably was not finally commissioned until 21 August 1847, Lt. George M. Totten in command.|$|R
50|$|The L113 {{was largely}} a cross between the N113 and K113, with the front section of its chassis of a similar height {{to that of the}} N113, and an 11-litre engine that was mounted {{longitudinally}} as per the K113. However, it differed from both models by having this <b>engine</b> <b>inclined</b> to the side.|$|R
50|$|The work of {{improving}} the E&DR {{seems to have been}} done without suspending trains. In 1846 a two-hourly passenger service was more or less maintained over the former E&DR main line until June 1847. Locomotives began working from St Leonards to Niddrie on 15 February 1847, the <b>incline</b> winding <b>engines</b> being taken out of use. Steam hauled services to Dalkeith from St Leonards and from North Bridge station started on 14 July 1847, along with those from General to Gorebridge on the uncompleted Hawick line. St Leonards was closed to passenger traffic on 1 November 1847.|$|R

50|$|Melrose was {{the first}} San Francisco Bay ferry {{designed}} to carry automobiles. Southern Pacific Transportation Company and predecessor railroads had been operating ferries between San Francisco and Oakland, California since 1862. Some ferries were equipped to carry team-drawn wagons, but {{the increasing number of}} automobiles requiring transport encouraged building of a ferry with an unobstructed lower deck for automobiles and 400 seats on an upper deck for passengers. Melrose was launched without engines on 11 April 1906. Installation of engines being built at San Francisco's Union Iron Works was delayed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake a week after launching. The ferry was not completed until 1909. The side wheels were powered by two <b>inclined</b> tandem <b>engines</b> to avoid main deck obstruction by a traditional walking beam engine.|$|R
