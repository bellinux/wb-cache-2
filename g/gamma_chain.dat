40|$|Drosophila laminin alphabetagamma trimer {{assembly}} in Kc 167 cells was perturbed by chain-specific RNA interference (RNAi). The intracellular pool of alpha and <b>gamma</b> <b>chains</b> remained unchanged under beta-chain RNAi by lipofection of double-stranded RNA encoding a beta-chain partial sequence. This {{was also the}} case for the intracellular pool of alpha and beta chains under gamma-chain-specific RNAi.

Non-reducing SDS/PAGE revealed that some of the increased beta and <b>gamma</b> <b>chains</b> migrated as disulphide-linked betagamma dimers but that the rest migrated as monomers. Since the monomeric beta and gamma bands detected under alpha-chain RNAi were denser than the beta band under gamma-chain RNAi and the gamma band under beta-chain RNAi, respectively, beta and gamma also appeared to accumulate by forming betagamma dimers without the disulphide linkage. We suggest that interconversion of these betagamma dimers is crucial for the replaceable and selective assembly of the alpha chain for alphabetagamma trimer formation...|$|R

50|$|The {{gene that}} encodes the common <b>gamma</b> <b>chain</b> in these {{interleukin}} receptors is mutated in X-SCID.

Normally, when the interleukin binds to the trimeric receptor protein containing the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, the common gamma subunit activates Janus Kinase 3 (JAK3), which leads to the phosphorylation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5, STAT5. The STAT5 proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, controlling subsequent downstream signalling. Due {{to the fact that the}} common <b>gamma</b> <b>chain</b> is absent or abnormal, this downstream pathway is inhibited.

40|$|When aggregated, cell surface {{proteins}} become {{resistant to}} solubilization by detergents, presumably because of aggregation-induced or -stabilized {{interactions between the}} membrane protein and the cytoskeleton or plasma membrane skeleton. We genetically engineered variants of the tetrameric high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI) to identify a site on its alpha, beta, or <b>gamma</b> <b>chains</b> that mediates such putative interactions. Using flow cytofluorometry, we studied rat basophilic leukemia cells, transiently transfected COS cells, and stably transfected P 815 cells bearing wild-type and mutated receptors. We observed that (i) solubilization was markedly dependent {{on the degree of}} aggregation, the extent varying somewhat with the cell type and, particularly at lower levels of aggregation, with the time after addition of detergent; (ii) truncation of no single cytoplasmic domain of the alpha, beta, or <b>gamma</b> <b>chains</b> ablated the insolubilization effect; and (iii) incomplete receptors were also efficiently insolubilized by aggregation. Thus receptors consisting only of alpha and <b>gamma</b> <b>chains,</b> a "receptor" consisting of only the ectodomain of the alpha chain attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol anchor, and "receptors" consisting only of minimally modified <b>gamma</b> <b>chains</b> were resistant to solubilization after aggregation. We conclude that no unique subunit or domain of Fc epsilon RI mediates the insolubilization phenomenon.

However, a synthetic peptide mimicking the <b>gamma</b> 2 <b>chain</b> C-terminus did not interfere with 0 l integrin binding or cell adhesion and spreading on laminin- 332 as measured by protein interaction assays and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. Nor was the soluble peptide able to restore the loss of integrin-mediated cell adhesiveness to mini-laminin- 332 after deletion of the <b>gamma</b> 2 <b>chain</b> C-terminus.

The presence of mu- and gamma-mRNAs in these tumors was determined by Northern blot analyses of the total cell poly(A) + mRNA, using the appropriate 32 P-labeled recombinant plasmid probes. In four out of the five lymphomas examined, both mu- and gamma-mRNAs were detected. The mu-mRNA appeared as multiple discrete bands of 1. 9 - 3. 0 kb. In three out of the four lymphomas, the gamma-mRNA appeared as two bands, a major one of 1. 9 and a minor one of 3. 9 kb. Three myelomas examined by similar methods did not contain more than one class of heavy chain mRNA. Reexamination of the Ig chains produced by the B-lymphomas which expressed both mu- and gamma-mRNAs revealed that two of them preserved their original phenotype and expressed mu (38 C- 13) or <b>gamma</b> <b>chains</b> only (A 20).
