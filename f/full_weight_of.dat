When enemy counterattacks threatened, Kesselring threw the <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> his force against them. Now that the Army was {{convinced of the}} value of air support, units were all too inclined to call for it. Kesselring now had to convince the Army that air support should be concentrated at critical points. He strove to improve army–air cooperation with new tactics and the appointment of Colonel Martin Fiebig as a special close air support commander. By 26 July, Kesselring reported the destruction of 165 tanks, 2,136 vehicles and 194 artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|Along the coast, the 2/28th Infantry Battalion was {{assigned}} {{the task of}} leading the Australian advance along with a troop from the 1st Tank Battalion and engineers from the 2/7th Field Company. Commencing in the afternoon of 27 November, they began clearing operations between Bonga and North Hill along the coast with a secondary task of sending a company towards Pabu to facilitate the relief of the 2/32nd. In the vicinity, the Japanese 20th Division, consisting of {{the remnants of the}} 79th, 80th and 238th Infantry Regiments, numbered 4,670 men, of which 2,500 were combat effective. The lead company of the 2/28th Infantry Battalion moved off shortly after midday, passing through the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion's lines. Initially there was no opposition and by the afternoon they established a defensive position near a waterfall. The following morning, the advance continued. The ground astride the coastal track, although flat, was covered in dense jungle, which was not suitable for tracked vehicles to move across. The result of this was that the Australian tanks had to remain on the track, advancing behind the infantry, which limited the rate of their advance and prevented them from being able to apply the <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> their firepower.|$|E
5|$|As {{infantry}} disembarked {{from the}} landing craft, they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards (45 to 90m) out. To reach the beach {{they had to}} wade through water sometimes neck deep, and they still had 200 yards (180m) or more to go when they did reach shore. Those that {{made it to the}} shingle did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden. Most sections had to brave the <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> fire from small arms, mortars, artillery, and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire. Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning, as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint, the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders. Some sections of G/116 and F/116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed, though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers. G/116 was able to retain some cohesion, but this was soon lost {{as they made their way}} westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives. The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front, where parts of E/16, F/16 and E/116 had intermingled, making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis-landings. Those scattered sections of E/116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties, although, having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank, they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore.|$|E
40|$|The goal of limit feeding is {{to reduce}} {{variability}} in rumen fill at weighing. The amount of rumen fill varies by diet. Cattle {{included in this study}} were grazing cornstalks, smooth bromegrass pasture, or in a drylot and fed a forage and modified distillers grains (MDGS) mix.

40|$|In coding theory, a very {{interesting}} problem (but at the same time, a very difficult one) {{is to determine the}} <b>weight</b> distribution <b>of</b> a given code. This problem is even more interesting for cyclic codes, and this is so, mainly because they possess a rich algebraic structure, which can be utilized in a variety of ways.

In this note, we are going to use a characterization of all semiprimitive two-weight irreducible cyclic codes over any finite field, recently presented in [8], {{in order to determine the}} <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> distribution <b>of</b> any irreducible cyclic code over any finite field of dimension two.

40|$|Background: The {{problems}} of prescribing a prosthesis {{for a young}} girl with severe congenital vascular malformation deformity leading to a transtibial amputation. Case description and methods: Due to the high risk of recurrent bleeding and limitations regarding <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> bearing <b>of</b> the stump, a normal socket fitting process was not possible. Using a multidisciplinary approach, a prosthesis was designed to enable <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> bearing in a flexed knee position with ischial tuberosity support to prevent <b>full</b> <b>weight</b> bearing on the tibial part of the stump. Findings and outcomes: After training and adjustments to the design, a definitive prosthesis with a free motion mechanical knee joint could be used. During the training with this prosthesis, no skin problems were observed, {{and at the end}} of the rehabilitation, the patient had a high level of activities of daily living and sports. Conclusion: The above prosthetic solution with an adjusted socket design proved to be successful in this case.

25|$|When General Wrangel's White Army {{forces were}} decisively {{defeated}} in November 1920, the Communists immediately turned on Makhno and the anarchists once again. After refusing a direct order by the Bolshevik government to disband his anarchist army, Makhno intercepted three messages from Lenin to Christian Rakovsky, {{the head of}} the Bolshevik Ukrainian Soviet based in Kharkiv. Lenin's orders were to arrest all members of Makhno's organization and to try them as common criminals. On November 26, 1920, less than two weeks after assisting Red Army forces to defeat Wrangel, Makhno's headquarters staff and many of his subordinate commanders were arrested at a Red Army planning conference to which they had been invited by Moscow, and executed.

To the mockery of his fellow engineers, he suggested that the vehicle could be used to take him around the world, supposedly remarking: [...] "with a bit of titivation, you could go around the world in one of those things". This idea remained with Carlin after his marriage, and he proposed to his wife that the couple honeymoon by crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a modified GPA. After a considerable amount of trouble, the Carlins finally managed to purchase a 1942 Ford GPA (serial number 1239) from a government auction in Washington, D.C., for US$901. The vehicle had originally been manufactured at Ford's plant in River Rouge, Michigan, one of 12,778 built during the war. He originally tried to convince Ford to sponsor his proposed trip, but the company refused, believing the craft would not make the journey. The vehicle required a number of modifications to make it seaworthy, including the addition of a more boat-like bow, a rudder, a larger cabin, and two extra fuel tanks – one at the bow and one under the [...] "belly" [...] of the craft, at the stern. Inside the cabin, a bunk was installed, and the dash was modified to include aircraft instruments, as well as a two-way radio (including a 19-set transmitter and receiver). In total, the vessel's length was extended by three feet to , and the fuel capacity to 200 gallons (760 L) from the original 12 gallons (45 L).
