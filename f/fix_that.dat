Teddy Sears who's character Jay Garrick uses the drug, which temporarily restores his speed said while his character is not fixated on restoring his speed, Velocity 6 presents an interesting <b>fix</b> <b>that</b> will tempt him due to his [...] "haunting memories" [...] of his previous life with powers.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Dragon Quest I & II was {{released}} for Game Boy Color; {{the game is}} also compatible with Game Boy. A year later, it was localized in America as Dragon Warrior I & II. This remake {{is similar to the}} Super Famicom version, bit with 8-bit graphics. Compared with the NES version, it featured better graphics and was less difficult. [...] The remake also provided a quick-save function to allow players save and load game anywhere unless they reset the Game Boy. In the Game Boy Color localization, the main characters' and towns' names were retranslated to be similar to the original Japanese names: legendary hero [...] "Erdrick" [...] was retranslated as [...] "Loto", and the castle name [...] "Midenhall" [...] was re-dubbed [...] "Lorasia". The original translation had a lot of errors, and Enix changed the names to help <b>fix</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

500|$|The main fortifications for {{infantry}} {{consisted of}} 44 concrete bunkers, 23 dugouts and 26 fortified observation posts. The concrete bunkers ( [...] , redoubts) {{were long and}} narrow. The longest, Abramsskansen, was [...] long and had room for 160 men and four machine guns, but most had room for less than 80 menusually a rifle platoon reinforced with a machine gun section and an anti-tank section. Due to their length, their curved shapes following the mountain sides, and other characteristics, the bunkers were popularly referred to as [...] "sausages" [...] (...) [...] The construction of these started in 1911. Many officers still considered the fortress to have inadequate and too few fortifications for the infantry, and one officer compared the fortress to [...] "a shoe, which is too large for the foot." [...] One million kronor was allocated in 1915 to <b>fix</b> <b>that</b> problem, and many minor fortifications were built during the First World War.|$|E
500|$|Fez was {{released}} on April 13, 2012 and sold 200,000 copies in its yearlong exclusivity to the Xbox Live Arcade platform. Several months later, Polytron became embroiled in a high-profile dispute with Microsoft over the cost of patching the game. Polytron had released a <b>fix</b> <b>that</b> resolved many of the game's technical issues but introduced another that corrupted the saved games for about one percent of users. They withdrew the patch, but found Microsoft's fee for subsequent patch releases unviable, and chose to reinstate the withdrawn patch as their most utilitarian option. Polytron drew ire for the decision, which raised awareness for the business needs of indie developers. In July 2013, a year later, Microsoft announced {{that they no longer}} charged for patches, and Fish tweeted that Polytron's patch would take [...] "a couple of months". Speaking in retrospect of the release, Fish [...] "fiercely criticized" [...] Fez co-publisher Microsoft Games Studios for botching the game's release. Fish cited a lack of promotion and publicity, and poor advertising of the game on Microsoft's digital market.|$|E
500|$|Several gaming and {{technology}} sites reported an [...] "overheating bug" [...] with StarCraft II {{that in some}} cases resulted in permanent damage to video cards. The source of the problem {{is the fact that the}} frame rate is not locked on menu screens. This causes the graphics card to continuously render the image, resulting in excessive heat. Blizzard has acknowledged the problem, and posted a temporary workaround. [...] They also recommended ensuring computer systems are well ventilated and contacting the videocard manufacturer for hardware-related issues. In response to the reports, Blizzard's Public Relations Manager, Bob Colayco said: [...] "There is no code in our software that will cause video cards to overheat. When we saw this issue first reported, we conducted thorough additional testing and determined that for those players experiencing this problem, the cause is most likely hardware-related." [...] CrunchGear has also suggested that the problem is not with StarCraft II, but rather due to poorly maintained hardware and inadequate cooling. They do however agree that the overheating only occurs on non-framerate locked screens and provide the <b>fix</b> <b>that</b> Blizzard has offered to users. [...] Other articles recommend that users regularly clean the dust out of their computer to improve the cooling efficiency of their systems. Blizzard posted a message on their forums regarding the issue that has since been removed. The message was: [...] "Screens that are light on detail may make your system overheat if cooling is overall insufficient. This is because the game has nothing to do so it is primarily just working on drawing the screen very quickly." ...|$|E

[...] He noted the stylistic similarities of the album to the band's previous work and wrote [...] "There is nothing here to shock or bewilder unless you are expecting Birds of Tokyo to return to their alt-rock origins with a hardened edge. If that's the case, you will be in for a jolt of disappointment, as beneath Kenny's words there is an astounding sense of positivity - as though one can climb that mountain, <b>fix</b> <b>that</b> bridge or restore faith."

There she studied with Rem Koolhaas, Elia Zenghelis and Bernard Tschumi. [...] Her former professor, Koolhaas, described her at graduation as [...] "a planet in her own orbit." [...] Zenghelis described her as the most outstanding pupil he ever taught. ‘We called her {{the inventor of the}} 89 degrees. Nothing was ever at 90 degrees. She had spectacular vision. All the buildings were exploding into tiny little pieces." [...] He recalled that she was less interested in details, such as staircases. [...] "The way she drew a staircase you would smash your head against the ceiling, and the space was reducing and reducing, and you would end up in the upper corner of the ceiling.

2500|$|Paul Ebersol (as Mr. Fix) {{appears in}} , voiced by Donny Lucas. He {{is a genius}} {{inventor}} and a high-tech arms dealer with ties to the Maggia. For protection, he employs highly sophisticated communications and surveillance equipment, teams of soldiers, and individuals equipped with high-tech weapons. In the episode “Whiplash”, Mr. Fix orders Whiplash to kill Pepper Potts’ FBI agent father (who is close to apprehending him); then, Mr. Fix sends Whiplash after Pepper herself. Whiplash fails at both tasks; ultimately, Iron Man defeats him. In the episode “Man and Iron Man”, Mr. Fix sends an enhanced Whiplash to get revenge against Iron Man. He is nearly killed when his lab is destroyed. In the episode [...] "Don’t Worry, Be Happy", Iron Man suggests that Mr. Fix is trying to eliminate Unicorn and Killer Shrike upon learning that Mr. Fix hired them to perform a robbery, but, unbeknownst to them, equipped them with explosives powerful enough to destroy the entire city. Mr. Fix later returns in the second season under the employ of a shadowy figure and has Whiplash kidnap Obadiah Stane and Justin Hammer (who had orchestrated his own kidnapping). After escaping from Iron Man, Mr. Fix learns that his mysterious benefactor was Hammer. Hammer's assistant Sasha then implants a nano-virus into Mr. Fix which Hammer would activate if Mr. Fix threatens him or leaves his services. In the episode [...] "Look Into the Light" [...] Mr. Fix gives Justin Hammer a disk with the information needed to complete Project Titanium. In the episode [...] "Titanium vs. Iron", Mr. Fix completes the Titanium Man armor yet Hammer wants to test drive it. Growing impatient that Mr. Fix had not yet {{found a way to}} properly bond titanium to vibranium following his first outing as Titanium Man, Hammer activates the nano-virus killing his physical body. However, Hammer removed a flash drive with Mr. Fix's consciousness on it from him and places it into a nearby console. Hammer tells Mr. <b>Fix</b> <b>that</b> his consciousness has evolved at the cost of his body and that now he can work on Hammer's other projects 24/7. In the episode [...] "The Hawk and the Spider", Hammer speaks with Mr. Fix 2.0 about the Titanium Man armor. Hammer tells Mr. Fix 2.0 {{to find a way to}} make it work or he will destroy him. In the episode [...] "Hostile Takeover", Mr. Fix 2.0 works on the 'dissection' of Iron Man (whose armor was under lock-down to save enough power upon being knocked down by Titanium Man) even when the Iron Man armor is accidentally recharged during Killer Shrike and Unicorn's fight. When Hammer receives a shock trying to remove the Iron Man helmet, Mr. Fix 2.0 tells Hammer that War Machine is approaching Hammer Multinational. In the episode [...] "The Hammer Falls", Mr. Fix 2.0 creates the Zombie Gas which Hammer tests on Count Nefaria. When Mr. Fix 2.0 is unable to trace the call of an individual who recently started blackmailing Hammer, Hammer threatens him. It is revealed that Mr. Fix 2.0 was responsible for the blackmail and had helped Iron Man expose Hammer as part of his revenge for what Hammer did to him. After Hammer is dropped from his Titanium Man armor, Mr. Fix 2.0 then traps Hammer in a Zombie Gas chamber which results in Iron Man blasting the console Mr. Fix 2.0 is in causing Mr. Fix 2.0 to disintegrate.|$|E
