5|$|When {{two species}} {{are similar in}} a {{particular}} character, evolution is defined as parallel if the ancestors were also similar, and convergent if they were not. Some scientists have argued {{that there is a}} continuum between parallel and convergent evolution, while others maintain that despite some overlap, there are still important <b>distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two.|$|E
5|$|Differentiating {{the various}} periods {{of human history}} {{involved}} is a complex task. The Paleolithic lasted until the retreat of the ice, the Mesolithic until the adoption of farming and the Neolithic until metalworking commenced.

A number of the sites span very long periods of time and in particular the <b>distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Neolithic and the later periods are not clear cut.|$|E
5|$|Four major Chinese-speech {{groups are}} {{represented}} in Indonesia: Hokkien, Mandarin, Hakka and Cantonese. In addition to these, the Teochew people speak their own dialect that has some degree of mutual intelligibility with Hokkien. <b>Distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two, however, are accentuated outside of their regions of origin. There were an estimated 2.2 million native speakers of various Chinese varieties in Indonesia in 1982: 1,300,000 speakers of Southern Min varieties (including Hokkien and Teochew); 640,000 Hakka speakers; 460,000 Mandarin speakers; 180,000 Cantonese speakers; and 20,000 speakers of the Eastern Min varieties (including Fuzhou dialect). Additionally, an estimated 20,000 spoke different dialects of the Indonesian language.|$|E

5|$|From the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 CE) {{until the}} modern period (1840–1919), {{scholars}} and rulers developed a male-dominated patriarchal society in China. Confucianism {{was at the}} root of the development of the patriarchal society in China, and emphasized the <b>distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> sexes and the roles they have within the family. These ideologies continued through the Tang dynasty (618-907), and girls were taught from a very young age to be submissive to their fathers, then to their husbands, and later to their sons. During the Song Dynasty (960-1297), Confucian scholars further developed the patriarchal tradition with more restrictions for females, including foot binding for girls at a very young age.|$|E
5|$|The war {{had also}} led to {{political}} tensions, revolution and turmoil. In Russia, the conflict resulted in revolution and civil war between 1917 and 1923, and the rise to power of the Communist Bolshevik government. The German Empire had seen revolution break {{out at the end}} of the war, with vicious street fighting in the major cities, including Berlin; some Germans felt that this experience was too quickly forgotten in the post-war years. Romania almost descended into revolution as well. There was turmoil in Ireland; 210,000 Irish served in the war as part of the British forces, but the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916 led in turn to the Irish War of Independence and the later civil war. Elsewhere the war exposed simmering ethnic and religious divisions. In Canada, for example, the <b>distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> English, largely Protestant, and French speaking, predominantly Catholic, parts of the country become increasingly apparent, with conscription becoming a major political issue.|$|E

25|$|The {{conclusion}} of the Warring States period brought the first unified Chinese state-established by the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE-who established the imperial system and forcibly standardized the traditional Chinese script, leading to {{the first of the}} <b>distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> refined Hua and the increasingly marginalized Yi.

25|$|Ministers may be {{considered}} equal in status with the other elders, {{but they have a}} distinct ordination and distinct function. They are the primary preachers and teachers, celebrants of sacraments. There are sometimes further <b>distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> minister and the other elders. Some Presbyterian denominations enroll ministers as members of their respective congregations, while others enroll the minister {{as a member of the}} regional presbytery. The presbyteries are responsible for the ordination of the ministers.|$|E

As a result, the complex political and sociological context of Franco-Ontarian can only be fully understood by recognizing both meanings and understanding the <b>distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two.|$|E
25|$|This theology, though {{original}} in some respects, {{has often}} been compared to Adoptionism, Arianism, and Sabellianism, all of which Trinitarians rejected in favour of the belief that God exists eternally in three distinct persons. Nevertheless, Servetus rejected these theologies in his books: Adoptionism, because it denied Jesus's divinity; Arianism, because it multiplied the hypostases and established a rank; and Sabellianism, because it seemingly confused the Father with the Son, though Servetus himself does appear to have denied or diminished the <b>distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Persons of the Godhead, rejecting the Trinitarian understanding of One God in Three Persons.|$|E

In the first wave of the expulsion, Acadians were deported to other British colonies. During the second wave, they were deported to Britain and France, from where they migrated to Louisiana. Acadians fled initially to Francophone colonies such as Canada, the uncolonized northern part of Acadia, Isle Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island) and Isle Royale (present-day Cape Breton Island). During the second wave of the expulsion, these Acadians were either imprisoned or deported.|$|E
25|$|Cleckley draws {{important}} <b>distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> psychopath and non-psychopathic criminal. He {{states that}} the psychopath very seldom takes much advantage of any gain, has an obscure or inconsistent purpose, usually puts himself unnecessarily in a shameful position as much as causing trouble for others; and usually does not commit the most serious or violent crimes, but usually does end up harming himself. However, despite the general picture of weak-willed and inconsistent antisocial behavior, he also states, at least in later editions, that some may develop drives towards the most serious or sadistic crimes. He suggests this is a somewhat separate additional pathology but does not explain why or how.|$|E
25|$|However, {{with the}} {{evolving}} {{shift in the}} economy towards an informational materiality, in which value {{is based upon the}} informational significance, or the narratives surrounding the products, the clear-cut subjective separation is no longer obvious. Hardt and Negri see the open source approaches as examples of new ways of co-operation that illustrate how economic value is not founded upon exclusive possession, but rather upon collective potentialities. Informational materiality is characterized by gaining value only through being shared. Hardt and Negri thus suggest that the commons become the focal point of analyses of public relations. The point being that with this shift it becomes possible to analyse how the very <b>distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> private and public are evolving.|$|E

25|$|A {{major problem}} in {{determining}} whether the Cimbri were speaking a Celtic or a Germanic language is {{that at this time}} the Greeks and Romans tended to refer to all groups to the north of their sphere of influence as Gauls, Celts, or Germani rather indiscriminately. Caesar seems {{to be one of the}} first authors to distinguish the two groups, and he had a political motive for doing so (it was an argument in favour of the Rhine border). Yet, one cannot always trust Caesar and Tacitus when they ascribe individuals and tribes to one or the other category, although Caesar made clear <b>distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two cultures. Most ancient sources categorize the Cimbri as a Germanic tribe, but some ancient authors include the Cimbri among the Celts.|$|E
25|$|Following the Revolution, {{there was}} a policy of {{removing}} all Imperial emblems from the palace, including those on the stonework, plaster-work and iron work. During the Soviet era, many of the palace's remaining treasures were dispersed around the museums and galleries of the Soviet Union. Some were sold for hard currency while others were given away to visiting dignitaries. As the original contents disappeared and other items from sequestered collections began to be displayed in the palace, the <b>distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> rooms' original and later use have become blurred. While some rooms have retained their original names, and some even the trappings of Imperial Russia, such as the furnishings of the Small and Large Throne Rooms, many other rooms are known by {{the names of their}} new contents, such as The Room of German Art.|$|E
25|$|According to Abel, Mittleman, and Becker (1985) and Ward et al. (1995), {{there are}} {{generally}} large <b>distinctions</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> characteristics of pedophilic and non-pedophilic molesters. They state that non-pedophilic offenders tend to offend {{at times of}} stress; have a later onset of offending; and have fewer, often familial, victims, while pedophilic offenders often start offending at an early age; often have {{a larger number of}} victims who are frequently extrafamilial; are more inwardly driven to offend; and have values or beliefs that strongly support an offense lifestyle. One study found that pedophilic molesters had a median of 1.3 victims for those with girl victims and 4.4 for those with boy victims. Child molesters, pedophilic or not, employ a variety of methods to gain sexual access to children. Some groom their victims into compliance with attention and gifts, while others use threats, alcohol or drugs, or physical force.|$|E
