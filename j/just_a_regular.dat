A scene is depicted in the lyrics where someone {{at the beginning of a}} concert compares himself with the other members of the audience, and realises that comparing yourself to others is not a proper way to live. Later, he thinks about childhood memories of defeat, and realises that these memories are his pure self. After understanding this, he feels like he wants to scream, and begins to cry.|$|E

500|$|Both [...] "Mortal Folly" [...] and [...] "Mortal Recoil" [...] were {{directed}} by Larry Leichliter. The first half was written and storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Adam Muto, whereas {{the second half}} was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Cole Sanchez. Both {{were based on a}} story by Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. In the original outline for [...] "Mortal Folly", the Lich had several lines that played him off as a stereotypical villain. Sugar and Muto decided to make him into a more [...] "scary and dangerous" [...] character, and purposely played up the darker elements of the episode. In addition, Princess Bubblegum's sweater was supposed to be [...] "magic" [...] and [...] "shoot lasers". However, Sugar felt that it would be more emotionally poignant if the sweater was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> sweater imbued with positive emotions. The scene featuring Finn stuffing the sweater into the Lich's eye sockets and then ripping his skull apart was inspired by an artistic design idea Sugar had had when she was in high school; she had wanted to draw a comic featuring a small person getting into a fight and being pushed up to the ceiling.|$|E
500|$|William Petersen {{worked with}} the Chicago Police Department Violent Crimes Unit and the FBI Violent Crimes Unit in {{preparation}} for the role of Will Graham, talking to the officers and reading some of their crime files. He spoke to the investigators on the Richard Ramirez case about how they coped with the effects these disturbing cases had on them and how they learned to [...] "compartmentalize" [...] their working and personal lives. [...] "Of course you don’t really turn it off", he recalled. [...] "At the end of the day, even if you’re <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> policeman, it takes a toll". [...] During the three years he spent working on the script, Michael Mann also spent time with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, where he claimed to have met people very like the character of Will Graham. This level of research led Brent E. Turvey to describe the film as [...] "one of the most competent blends of cutting-edge forensic science and criminal profiling at the time". Mann also spent several years corresponding with imprisoned murderer Dennis Wayne Wallace. Wallace had been motivated by his obsession for a woman he barely knew, and believed that Iron Butterfly's [...] "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" [...] was [...] "their song". This connection inspired Mann to include the song in the film.|$|E
500|$|Before Rosenbaum got the part, Martin Cummins {{auditioned for}} the role of Lex Luthor; Cummins would go on to play Dr. Garner, a neuro-scientist who {{experiments}} on Clark, in multiple episodes of Smallville spanning season two and three. Michael Rosenbaum is not the only actor to portray Lex on the show. There have been four other actors that have performed the role; Matthew Munn, Wayne Dalgish, Lucas Grabeel, and Connor Stanhope have all portrayed Lex Luthor as a child in various episodes throughout the series. Rosenbaum relished the opportunities he gets to show Lex's evil side, even if it is only for a few seconds in earlier seasons. Specifically, he delighted in the chance to [...] "go overboard", like he did in [...] "Hug" [...] where his character pulls out a machine gun and shoots everything in sight; to the actor, this gave the audience a glimpse into who Lex was becoming. To portray Lex's signature bald head, Rosenbaum had to go through more than <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> head shaving. Not only was his head shaved every day, but he had to undergo hours of make-up treatments on his head, in various color combinations, so that his natural hairline did not show up on film. After seven seasons of portraying Lex Luthor on Smallville, Michael Rosenbaum decided to move on with his acting career, so he departed from the show. On February 11, 2011, Michael Ausiello reported that after the back and forth speculation as to whether Rosenbaum would return to the series, the actor finally agreed to appear in the series finale. Rosenbaum expressed that his return for the final episode was for the fans, stating, [...] "I appreciate all of their passion, their relentlessness, and even their threats." ...|$|E

2500|$|A few of {{the core}} {{characters}} from Chrono Cross originate from an earlier game titled Radical Dreamers. Chrono series writer Masato Kato felt that the first game in the series, Chrono Trigger, did not wrap up all its story arcs, and as such, wrote the story of Radical Dreamers to conclude some aspects of it. However, due to the rushed nature of the development schedule, it being a short, text based visual novel, and being released on an obscure add-on for the Super Famicom, the Satellaview, Kato would label the game [...] "unfinished", leading to the conception of a more complete game, which would be Chrono Cross. Serge, Kid, Lynx, Viper, Radius, and Riddel all originate from the game. Additionally, the Radical Dreamers character Magil, who is an amnesiac Magus from Chrono Trigger, was originally {{going to be the}} character Guile in Chrono Cross, before Kato wrote him out of the script, fearing he could not do the character justice in the massive scope of Chrono Cross. While Radical Dreamers characters were used as a base for the characters of Chrono Cross, Kato made changes as well. In Radical Dreamers, Serge acted as the game's narrator, rather than a silent protagonist, and Lynx, is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> human, rather than an anthropomorphic cat.
