5|$|Operation Barbarossa, the Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, began on 22June 1941.

5|$|In 1348 {{a plague}} {{known as the}} Black Death crossed from {{mainland}} Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population.

Labourers could charge more for their work and, in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards. In turn, the profits of landowners were eroded. The trading, commercial and financial networks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>towns</b> disintegrated.|$|E
