25|$|Normal People Scare Me: A Film about Autism is a {{documentary}} film about autism, produced by Joey Travolta, older brother of actor John Travolta. The documentary initially {{began as a}} 10-minute short film co-directed by an autistic teenager named Taylor Cross, and his mother Keri Bowers. Joey Travolta first met Cross at a program Travolta led teaching the art of filmmaking to children with special needs. He helped educate Cross about filmmaking, and the documentary was expanded into a feature-length film. It includes interviews with 65 people, including those who are autistic as well as friends and family. Cross asks them about their experiences with autism and how they <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and elicits multiple insightful responses from his subjects.|$|E
25|$|Slapp Happy {{then left}} Polydor Germany {{and moved to}} London where a record deal was signed {{a deal with the}} then {{emerging}} Virgin Records label, which was looking for experimental groups. Faust and Henry Cow had already signed up. At Virgin's Manor Studios in Oxfordshire, Slapp Happy re-recorded Casablanca Moon with the help of session musicians (under the direction of violinist Graham Preskett) and Virgin released it as Slapp Happy in 1974. It was not until 1980 that Recommended Records released the original Casablanca Moon (with Faust) as Acnalbasac Noom (the words of the original title written backwards). Comparison of the two releases revealed two very different musical arrangements. Acnalbasac Noom had a raw and unsophisticated <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> whereas Casablanca Moon tended to be more sentimental with more complex arrangements, including a string orchestra.|$|E

500|$|In 1971, he {{released}} another well-received album, Tupelo Honey. This album produced the hit single [...] "Wild Night" [...] {{that was later}} covered by John Mellencamp. The title song has a notably country-soul <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and the album ended with another country tune, [...] "Moonshine Whiskey". Morrison said he originally intended to make an all country album. The recordings were as live as possible – after rehearsing the songs the musicians would enter the studio and play a whole set in one take. His co-producer, Ted Templeman, described this recording process as the [...] "scariest thing I've ever seen. When he's got something together, he wants to put it down right away with no overdubbing." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of composing [...] "Fifteen", Swift became very nervous to show Anderson the song, for {{she did not know}} how her friend would respond. [...] "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." [...] However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: [...] "She said, 'Does it bother you that your name is in a song that's so personal?' And it really doesn't just because of the way Taylor and I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> If one girl can kind of learn from it or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it." [...] With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded [...] "Fifteen" [...] with producer Nathan Chapman, who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to {{the fact that she is}} most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather than her own experiences. She went to say [...] "Fifteen" [...] usually gets her every time.|$|E

At the [...] "Justin Timberlake & Friends Concert in Las Vegas", Timberlake told MTV News that Rated R {{is a whole}} new sound and that the new songs are not just a rehash of what fans heard on her last album. [...] "She broke onto the scene so hard with the last record— to have that many songs on the charts is impressive. I think that the smartest thing she's doing is not trying to emulate what she did but move forward", Timberlake explained. In February 2010, Rihanna admitted that [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] was inspired by her difficult relationship with ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, [...] "It's a song that everybody wanted to hear, everything that I didn't say for the past eight months, exactly how I felt about that relationship and how I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> now– that song says it all." [...] When asked what the most important song from the album to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, Rihanna cited [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] together with [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] as her favorites.|$|E

500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, how they <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it...</b> It’s amazing that they have such a connection {{but they seem to}} act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E

2500|$|The idea to {{collaborate}} with Henry Cow eventually materialised in November 1974 when Slapp Happy asked them to provide instrumental backing, much as Faust had done {{on the first two}} albums. The resulting Desperate Straights was released under the name [...] "Slapp Happy/Henry Cow". The success of this collaboration surprised everyone, considering how dissimilar the two bands were, and the two bands merged. The music often had a Berlin Cabaret <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> with a taste of avant-garde jazz.|$|E

2500|$|Philip Lombard, {{a soldier}} of fortune. Literally {{down to his}} last square meal, {{he comes to the}} island with a loaded revolver, as {{suggested}} by his invitation letter. Lombard is accused of causing the deaths of a number of East African tribesmen, after stealing their food and abandoning them to their deaths. He, along with Marston, are the only guests to openly and immediately confirm that the accusations against them are true; neither feels any remorse. ("Story's quite true! I left 'em! Matter of self-preservation. We were lost in the bush. I {{and a couple of other}} fellows took what food there was and cleared out ... Not quite the act of a pukka sahib, I'm afraid. But self-preservation's a man's first duty. And natives don't mind dying, you know. They don't <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> as Europeans do.") Lombard fulfilled the ninth referenced verse of the rhyme, shot to death on the beach by Vera, ("One got frizzled up ...") who believed him to be the murderer. Of all the [...] "guests" [...] he is the only one to theorize that [...] "U.N. Owen" [...] might be Wargrave, but the others reject this and it does him no good. He, along with Vera, is the only guest not killed by Justice Wargrave. Technically he is the 8th person to die out of the ten guests.|$|E
2500|$|The editing {{of the car}} chase by Frank P. Keller likely won Keller {{the editing}} Oscar for 1968, and has been {{included}} in lists of the [...] "Best Editing Sequences of All-Time". Paul Monaco has written, [...] "The most compelling street footage of 1968, however, appeared in an entirely contrived sequence, with nary a hint of documentary <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> – the car chase {{through the streets of}} San Francisco in Bullitt, created from footage shot over nearly five weeks. Billy Fraker, the cinematographer for the film, attributed the success of the chase sequence primarily to the work of the editor, Frank P. Keller. At the time, Keller was credited with cutting the piece in such a superb manner that he made the city of San Francisco a [...] "character" [...] in the film." [...] The editing of the scene was not without difficulties; Ralph Rosenblum wrote in 1979 that [...] "those who care about such things may know that during the filming of the climactic chase scene in Bullitt, an out-of-control car filled with dummies tripped a wire which prematurely sent a costly set up in flames, and that editor Frank Keller salvaged the near-catastrophe with a clever and unusual juxtaposition of images that made the explosion appear to go off on time." [...] This chase scene has also been cited by critics as groundbreaking in its realism and originality. In the release print and the print shown for many years, a scene in which the Charger actually hits the camera causing a red flare on screen, which many feel added to the realism, was edited out on DVD prints to the disappointment of many fans.|$|E
2500|$|Earl Scruggs did not invent three-finger banjo playing; in fact, he {{said the}} three-finger style {{was the most common}} way to play the five-string banjo in his {{hometown}} in western North Carolina. An early influence was a local banjoist, DeWitt [...] "Snuffy" [...] Jenkins, who plucked in a finger style. According to banjoist and historian Tony Trischka, [...] "Jenkins came about as close as one could to Scruggs style without actually playing it". At age ten, when Scruggs first learned the technique, he recalled that he was at home in his room after a quarrel with his brother. He was idly playing a song called [...] "Reuben" [...] and suddenly realized that he was playing with three fingers, not two. [...] "That excited me to no end", he later recalled, and said he ran through the house repeatedly yelling [...] "I've got it". From there he devoted all his free time to perfecting his timing and to adding syncopation and variations to it. Controversy exists as to the actual origin of three-finger picking style. Don Reno, an eminent banjo player who also played this style and who knew Scruggs at that young age, described Scruggs' early playing as similar to that of Snuffy Jenkins. Scruggs, however, consistently referred to it as his own, saying that he adapted to it [...] "a syncopated roll that was quite different." [...] On the subject, John Hartford said, [...] "Here's the way I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Everybody's all worried about who invented the style and it's obvious that three finger banjo pickers have been around a long time— maybe since 1840. But it's my feeling that if it wasn't for Earl Scruggs, you wouldn't be worried about who invented it." ...|$|E
