5|$|After {{the last}} ice age only large mammals such as mammoths, bison and woolly {{rhinoceros}} remained. Roughly 11,000years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> part of the Iberian Peninsula. The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|Although it lost {{usefulness}} {{for long}} distances, the National Roads system has acquired local importance: EN13 that cuts {{the city in}} half, in a north-south direction, is used by commuters originating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> suburbs and from Vila do Conde, in the south, to travel downtown.

5|$|Appreciation of art {{among the}} gentry class flourished during the Song dynasty, {{especially}} {{in regard to}} paintings, which is an art practiced by many.

5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> terminus, a tramway {{connected}} the canal to iron works at Aberdare and Hirwaun. This {{was built in}} 1803, and included an incline just north of Glynneath, which was powered by a high-pressure Trevithick steam engine. The Tappenden brothers had bought into the iron industry in 1802, and built the tramway because of high tolls on the Glamorganshire Canal, but by 1814 they were bankrupt, and had no further connections with the canal.|$|E

5|$|Given {{that the}} {{matching}} vocabulary and astronomical content {{is drawn from}} throughout Polynesia, far afield from Easter Island, this supports the argument that rongorongo was not a recent, localized development; rather it {{was a product of}} thriving Polynesian trade and cultural interaction throughout the Pacific.

5|$|Muhammad {{expelled}} from Medina the Banu Qaynuqa, {{one of three}} main Jewish tribes, but some historians contend that the expulsion happened after Muhammad's death.

5|$|The most {{significant}} threat the Roman Empire faced {{during the reign}} of Domitian arose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> provinces of Illyricum, where the Suebi, the Sarmatians and the Dacians continuously harassed Roman settlements along the Danube river.
