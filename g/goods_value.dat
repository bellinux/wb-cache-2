Therefore, this research is conducted to identify how far the students and lecturer have instilled the <b>good</b> <b>values</b> during {{the teaching and learning}} processes in the laboratory. About 226 Bachelor of Technical and Vocational Education's students are the respondents in this research.

However, it was found out that only several number of the lecturers instil and practice the <b>good</b> <b>values</b> to the students during the teaching and learning processes in the laboratory.

30|$|The {{analyses}} of the model and the scenario runs provide three findings related {{to the influence of}} oil price on the structure of logistic networks. First, the optimal structure of the distribution network depends on the oil price. Second, traded <b>goods</b> <b>value</b> has considerable impact on the sensitivity of the network response to the oil price variation. Third, total CO 2 emissions are prone to the network structure, and thus, CO 2 savings by network restructuring are achievable.|$|E
