His style is {{influenced}} by the Swiss film Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000, a favorite of Cuarón's. Cuarón reminisces: [...] "I was studying cinema when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> , and interested in the French New Wave. Jonah was so unflashy compared to those films. The camera keeps a certain distance and there are relatively few close-ups. It's elegant and flowing, constantly tracking, but very slowly and not calling attention to itself." ...|$|E

[...] Bobby Orr once said of Perreault: [...] "His head and shoulders go one way, his legs go the other way, and the puck is doing something else. [...] When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> it I couldn't believe it." [...] His popularity and respect surpassed O. J. Simpson in a poll of Buffalonians about the best Buffalo athlete.

For the Glass Swords album cover, Whyte was shown various designer's portfolios by Warp. Whyte chose Jonathan Zawada, as he felt it had a [...] "'70s sci-fi art feel". After discussing ideas with Whyte, Zawada gave him the album cover in a few days. When asked about the album cover resembling two erect penises, Whyte responded [...] "Everyone says that! That's what I thought when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> it and I was like, 'Am I okay with that?' And, yeah, that's fine." ...|$|E

500|$|In April, Judge Wickersham {{arrived on}} a trip looking for a {{location}} for the courthouse, jail, and government offices for the Third District courts. He later described his first view of the settlement: [...] "A half-dozen new squat log structures, a few tents ... a small clearing in the primitive forest—that was Fairbanks as <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> it on April 9, 1903." [...] Wickersham examined Chena as a potential site for the government offices, but he settled on Fairbanks, partially because Barnette's partner and brother-in-law, Frank Cleary, gave Wickersham a choice piece of land valued at between $1,500 and $2,000. Wickersham asked Cleary to name the two main streets in town Cushman and Lacey, after U.S. Representatives Francis W. Cushman of Washington and John F. Lacey of Iowa.|$|E
500|$|Writing for AOL TV, Michael Sciannamea thought [...] "The Convict" [...] seemed {{different}} from previous episodes, citing as evidence {{the scene of}} Michael and Martin discussing trustworthy black men; Sciannamea attributed this to its guest writers: [...] "I don't think Gervais and Merchant went over the top...it just seemed {{a little different than}} the others." [...] Also in his review, Sciannamea expressed his gradual enjoyment of Andy, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> him up in Stamford, I thought he was just the Connecticut version of Dwight. But now I think he adds greatly to the mix and is definitely one who is going to stir things up in Scranton." [...] Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry believed [...] "the uncomfortable, unbearably awkward moments that the UK version perfected are definitely present throughout the episode."

Built around The Dave Brubeck Quartet's [...] "Take Five" [...] and Fred Wesley's [...] "Same Beat", the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: [...] "I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze held my eyes when he told me the truth about the basket of lies". Sounds considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of Robin Hood: [...] "This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history".|$|E

500|$|Out in Forest Hills, Queens, {{several miles}} from lower Manhattan, {{the members of}} a newly formed band adopted a common surname. Drawing on sources ranging from the Stooges to the Beatles and the Beach Boys to Herman's Hermits and 1960s girl groups, the Ramones {{condensed}} rock 'n' roll to its primal level: [...] "'1-2-3-4!' bass-player Dee Dee Ramone shouted at the start of every song, as if the group could barely master the rudiments of rhythm." [...] The band played its first gig at CBGB on August 16, 1974, on the same bill as another new act, Angel and the Snake, soon to be renamed Blondie. By the end of the year, the Ramones had performed seventy-four shows, each about seventeen minutes long. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> the Ramones", critic Mary Harron later remembered, [...] "I couldn't believe people were doing this. The dumb brattiness." [...] The Dictators, with a similar [...] "playing dumb" [...] concept, were recording their debut album. The Dictators' Go Girl Crazy! came out in March 1975, mixing absurdist originals such as [...] "Master Race Rock" [...] and loud, straight-faced covers of cheese pop like Sonny & Cher's [...] "I Got You Babe".|$|E

As you bowled opening overs to the later Sutcliffe you noticed the entire development of every defensive art; the depressingly straight bat, the astute use of pads (as with Hobbs), the sharp detection of which out-swinger could be left; above all, the consistently safe playing down of a rising or turning ball on leg stump, or thighs.|$|E

2500|$|DreamWorks and Paramount began a {{significant}} awards campaign for Dreamgirls while {{the film was}} still in production. In February 2006, the press was invited on set to a special live event showcasing {{the making of the}} film, including a live performance of [...] "Steppin' to the Bad Side" [...] by the cast. Three months later, twenty minutes of the film— specifically, the musical sequences [...] "Fake Your Way to the Top", [...] "Family", [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>First</b> <b>Saw</b> You", and [...] "Dreamgirls" [...] - were screened at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, with most of the cast and crew in attendance.

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} overall {{plot of the}} film and {{elements}} already present in the stage musical, many direct references to Supremes, Motown, or R/soul history in general {{are included in the}} film. In one scene, Effie saunters into Curtis' office and discusses Rainbow Records' latest LP, The Great March to Freedom, a spoken word album featuring speeches by Martin Luther King, Jr. This LP is an authentic Motown release, issued as Gordy 906 in June 1963. A later scene features Curtis and the Dreams recording in the studio, while a riot rages outside. By comparison, Motown's Hitsville U.S.A. studio remained open and active during Detroit's 12th Street Riot in July 1967. The photo shoot montage which accompanies [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>First</b> <b>Saw</b> You", as well as the subplot of Deena being forced to star in Curtis' Cleopatra film against her will, reflect both scenes from and the production of Mahogany, a 1975 Motown film starring Diana Ross and directed by Motown CEO Berry Gordy.|$|E
2500|$|Addressing the {{similarities}} between MDK2 and the original game, he explained [...] "The key characteristics we retained in MDK2 were the humor and the light-hearted style of the game.

It {{could have been a}} little longer, it would have been well served by more character development and it really needed a method {{to tell the story of}} the game. We're directly addressing all of these areas in MDK2." [...] Speaking of how much MDK2 was influenced by MDK, he explained [...] "I can't even begin to explain the strength of the visual influence that the original MDK has over MDK2. I was very impressed when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> MDK and I'm even more impressed after having played it many times. In many ways, in MDK2 we're striving to reach the goal Shiny set with the original by using new and improved technology." ...|$|E

At that time a large portion of it was standing fully six or seven feet high, and was well built. Its thickness was about two feet at the base, and slightly tapered towards the top. There were a number of gates, or openings, in the wall, that are quite perceptible even at this time. They were, however, very plainly perceivable a half century ago. From the number of stones promiscuously scattered in the vicinity of the wall, my impression is that it was originally greater than seven or even eight feet in height." [...] This wall was nearly three and a half miles long. Some have surmised it was nearly 10 miles long in total, having short branching elements also connected. Parts of these walls were damaged during the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Following his Australian {{citizenship}} ceremony, Coetzee {{said that}} [...] "I did {{not so much}} leave South Africa, a country with which I retain strong emotional ties, but come to Australia.

[...] When he initially moved to Australia, he had cited the South African government's lax attitude to crime in that country as a reason for the move, leading to a spat with Thabo Mbeki, who, speaking of Coetzee's novel Disgrace stated that [...] "South Africa is not only a place of rape". In 1999, the African National Congress submission to an investigation into racism in the media by the South African Human Rights Commission named Disgrace as a novel exploiting racist stereotypes. However, when Coetzee won his Nobel Prize, Mbeki congratulated him [...] "on behalf of the South African nation and indeed the continent of Africa".|$|E
2500|$|By 1972, Deena Jones and the Dreams {{have become}} the most {{successful}} girl group in the country ("Act II Opening"1). Deena has married Curtis, and C.C. {{is in love with}} Michelle. Jimmy has gone years without a hit. Curtis shows little interest in updating or revitalizing Jimmy's act because of Curtis's preoccupation with Deena and because of Jimmy's habit of sneaking funk numbers into his repertoire of pop-friendly songs. Effie is back in Chicago, a single mother to her daughter, Magic (or Ronald in other versions), struggling to get another break. Marty, who is now her manager, compels her to rebuild her confidence and give up her [...] "diva behaviors." [...] Once she does, Effie is able to make a show business comeback ("I Am Changing"). In contrast to Effie's struggling return to her musical career, Deena wants to stop singing and become an actress. Deena informs Curtis of her careers plans during a Vogue photo shoot ("One More Picture Please"), but Curtis refuses to let her go ("When <b>I</b> <b>First</b> <b>Saw</b> You"). Deena {{is not the only one}} chafing under Curtis's control: C.C. is enraged by Curtis's constant rearrangements of his songs, including an emotional ballad, entitled [...] "One Night Only", which Curtis wants instead recorded to reflect the [...] "new sound" [...] he is inventing.|$|E
