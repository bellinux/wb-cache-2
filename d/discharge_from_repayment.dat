40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the fluctuation of}} precipitation and air temperature from Dunde ice core data since 1606 comparing to meteorological data taken near the July 1 st glacier since 1930 s. Then, we calculated the <b>discharges</b> <b>from</b> glaciers and glacier-free areaFurthermore, we analyzed the sensitivity of those discharges to meteorological factor. The result revealed that calculated <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier-free area increased with precipitation. Meanwhile, calculated <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glaciers decreased with precipitation. Since little precipitation cause expose the glacier ice surface, which can absorb almost solar radiation, then glacier melt accelerated. Then, relatively large <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier can be provided when the <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier-free area is less. Therefore, <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier {{make up for the}} shortage of <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> glacier-free area due to less precipitation.

It concerns debtors non- entrepreneurs, natural persons and legal entities. Only the debtor is entitled to apply for <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> debts. The court shall while deciding on the debt discharge permission consider especially whether it is likely that at least 30 % of the claims of creditors receivable from the debtor will be settled and it shall also assess the honest intentions of the debtor.
