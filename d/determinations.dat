50|$|The {{adaptive}} {{significance of}} environmental sex <b>determination</b> {{is not so}} clear for amniotes, because most amniote vertebrates have genetic sex <b>determination.</b> In those animals that don't, environmental sex <b>determination</b> occurs as temperature-dependent sex <b>determination</b> (TSD), wherein sex of individuals is permanently determined by thermal conditions experienced approximately during the middle one-third of embryonic development. Mammals and birds have only genetic sex <b>determination,</b> whereas crocodilians and sphenodontians exclusively have temperature-dependent sex <b>determination.</b> In contrast, squamates (lizards and snakes) and turtles exhibit both genotypic sex <b>determination</b> and temperature-dependent sex <b>determination,</b> although TSD is much more common in turtles than in squamates.|$|R

While there is some evidence for a nutritional influence on caste <b>determination</b> in Melipona, in M. beecheii queens and workers have similar weights, supporting self-determination of caste.|$|R

5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} <b>determinations</b> of {{the speed}} of light substituting a rotating mirror for Fizeau's toothed wheel.

If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Determination</b> is a {{positive}} emotional feeling that involves persevering towards a difficult goal in spite of obstacles. <b>Determination</b> occurs prior to goal attainment and serves to motivate behavior that will help achieve one’s goal. Empirical research suggests that people consider <b>determination</b> to be an emotion; in other words, <b>determination</b> {{is not just a}} cognitive state, but rather an affective state. In the psychology literature, researchers have studied <b>determination</b> under other terms, including challenge and anticipatory enthusiasm; this may explain one reason for the relative lack of research on <b>determination</b> compared to other positive emotions.|$|R

40|$|Sex Combs Reduced (SCR) {{activity}} is proposed {{to be required}} cell nonautonomously for <b>determination</b> of tarsus identity, and Extradenticle (EXD) {{activity is}} required cell autonomously for <b>determination</b> of arista identity. Using the ability of Proboscipedia to inhibit the SCR activity required for <b>determination</b> of tarsus identity, we found that loss-of-EXD activity is epistatic to loss-of-SCR activity in tarsus vs. arista <b>determination.</b> This suggests that in the sequence leading to arista <b>determination</b> SCR activity is OFF while EXD activity is ON, and in the sequence leading to tarsus <b>determination</b> SCR activity is ON, which turns EXD activity OFF. Immunolocalization of EXD in early third-instar larval imaginal discs reveals that EXD is localized in the nuclei of antennal imaginal disc cells and localized in the cytoplasm of distal imaginal leg disc cells. We propose that EXD localized to the nucleus suppresses tarsus <b>determination</b> and activates arista <b>determination.</b> We further propose that in the mesodermal adepithelial cells of the leg imaginal discs, SCR {{is required for the}} synthesis of a tarsus-inducer that when secreted acts on the ectoderm cells inhibiting nuclear accumulation of EXD, such that tarsus <b>determination</b> is no longer suppressed and arista <b>determination</b> is no longer activated...|$|R

A gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the valence and motivational direction components of affect using facial expressions of <b>determination,</b> anger and joy. <b>Determination</b> is a positive, approach-related emotion; anger is a negative, approach-related emotion; and joy is a positive, low-approach emotion.

Participants created facial expressions intended to express joy, anger, fear, sadness, disgust and <b>determination.</b> Naive judges attempted to identify these expressions. Correct identifications of intended <b>determination</b> expressions were {{positively correlated with}} misidentifications of the expressions as anger, suggesting that <b>determination</b> is perceived as more similar to anger than to joy.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1529, Cranmer stayed with {{relatives}} in Waltham Holy Cross to avoid an outbreak of the plague in Cambridge. Two of his Cambridge associates, Stephen Gardiner and Edward Foxe, joined him. The three discussed the annulment issue and Cranmer suggested putting aside the legal case in Rome in favour of a general canvassing of opinions from university theologians throughout Europe. Henry showed much interest in the idea when Gardiner and Foxe presented him this plan. It is not known whether the king or his new Lord Chancellor, Thomas More, explicitly approved the plan. Eventually it was implemented and Cranmer was requested to join the royal team in Rome to gather opinions from the universities. Edward Foxe coordinated the research effort and the team produced the Collectanea Satis Copiosa ("The Sufficiently Abundant Collections") and The <b>Determinations,</b> historical and theological support for {{the argument that the}} king exercised supreme jurisdiction within his realm.|$|E
