5|$|The {{other main}} event was a WWF Championship match between The Ultimate Warrior and Randy Savage. The rivalry between them {{began in the}} fall of 1990, when Sensational Sherri, who was {{managing}} Savage, tried to arrange a match between Savage and Warrior. The Warrior refused to defend his WWF Championship against Savage, and <b>he</b> <b>ripped</b> up a contract that Sherri had given him. While they faced each other at house shows over the next few months, where Savage was unable to win the title, they never had a televised match with each other. Savage then interfered in the title match at Royal Rumble 1991, enabling Sgt. Slaughter to win the title. To settle the rivalry, Savage and the Warrior agreed to face each other in a retirement match at WrestleMania VII. The Warrior won the match, forcing Savage into retirement. However, Savage would be reinstated as an active wrestler in November 1991. The following year, the rivalry was rekindled when the Ultimate Warrior was granted a shot at the WWF Championship, which Savage had won from Ric Flair at WrestleMania VIII on April 5, 1992. Flair and his executive consultant Mr. Perfect, were upset that Flair had not been granted a rematch. They decided to cause trouble between Savage and the Warrior. In August, Perfect claimed that he was in negotiations with Savage and Warrior, who both had sought his managerial services, but refused to clarify which wrestler he would support at SummerSlam. At the SummerSlam Spectacular, a show designed to promote the pay-per-view, Savage and the Warrior teamed up to face The Nasty Boys. Perfect and Ric Flair interfered in the match, resulting in a count-out victory for the Nasty Boys and more animosity between Savage and Warrior.|$|E

25|$|Furtwängler resumed conducting. On April 25, 1935, he {{returned}} to the Berlin Philharmonic with a program dedicated to Beethoven. Many people who had boycotted the orchestra during his absence came to the concert to support him. He was called out seventeen times. On May 3, in his dressing room before conducting the same program, he was informed that Hitler and his entire staff would attend the concert. He was given the order to welcome Hitler with the Nazi salute. Furtwängler was so furious that <b>he</b> <b>ripped</b> the wooden panelling off a radiator. Franz Jastrau, the manager of the orchestra, suggested that he keep his baton in his right hand all the time. When he entered the hall, all the Nazi leaders were present making the Hitler salute, but Furtwängler kept hold of his baton and began the concert immediately. Hitler probably could not have imagined that such an affront was possible but decided to put up a good show: he sat down and the concert went on.|$|E

25|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Survivor Series {{included}} André the Giant, One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, Butch Reed and Rick Rude against Hulk Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Don Muraco, Ken Patera and Bam Bam Bigelow. In January 1987, Hogan {{was awarded a}} trophy for his third year as WWF World Heavyweight Champion while Hogan's best friend André was awarded a smaller trophy than Hogan's, for being undefeated in WWF for 15 years. Hogan congratulated his friend and said that André was the real champion of superstars all around the world. André surprisingly left the place before Hogan could even finish. In February, he came with a new manager Bobby Heenan. When Hogan came to know about that, he begged André not to keep Heenan as his manager because Heenan was Hogan's longtime enemy. André {{said that he had}} come to challenge Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Title at WrestleMania. <b>He</b> <b>ripped</b> off Hogan's Hulkamania shirt and golden chain, turning heel. This culminated in their historic match at WrestleMania III, where Hogan defeated André to retain the title. During the match, he set a record by scoop slamming the 520-pound Frenchman. On August 22, 1987 edition of Prime Time Wrestling, Paul Orndorff fired Bobby Heenan as his manager when he came to know that Heenan had brought in a new wrestler Rick Rude to replace Orndorff. Orndorff appointed Oliver Humperdink as his manager to feud with Rude. Superstar Billy Graham got involved in a feud with Butch Reed, culminating in a match between the duo. One Man Gang interfered in a match where he hit Graham with a big splash on the concrete floor. Don Muraco came to the rescue of Graham and Graham who was scheduled to participate in the main event of the first-ever Survivor Series retired due to an attack by One Man Gang. Muraco replaced him. Ken Patera got involved in a feud with Bobby Heenan and The Heenan Family and turned babyface, and was chosen to be the fourth member on Hogan's team. Many heel managers wanted to manage Bam Bam Bigelow, but Bigelow chose Oliver Humperdink as his manager thus making his WWF debut as a babyface. He also became a part of Hogan's team.|$|E

500|$|Hoffman's second 2003 {{appearance}} {{was a small}} role in Anthony Minghella's successful Civil War epic Cold Mountain. He played an immoral preacher, a complex character that Hoffman described as a [...] "mass of contradictions". The same year, from April to August, he appeared with Vanessa Redgrave in a Broadway revival of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. Director Robert Falls later commented on the dedication and experience that Hoffman brought to his role of alcoholic Jamie Tyrone: [...] "Every night <b>he</b> <b>ripped</b> it up to an extent that he couldn't leave [...] Phil carried it with him." [...] Hoffman received his second Tony Award nomination, this time for Best Featured Actor in a Play.

Reflecting on the role, People [...] said it proved that [...] "Hoffman could deliver comedic performances {{with the best of}} them".|$|E
500|$|For many Southern sympathizers, the Mint {{soon became}} a symbol of their hatred for the Union occupation. After U.S. Marines under Farragut had raised the U.S. flag {{on the roof of the}} Mint in April 1862, a {{professional}} steamboat gambler named William Bruce Mumford ascended the roof and tore the flag down. <b>He</b> <b>ripped</b> the banner into shreds, and defiantly stuffed pieces of it into his shirt to wear as souvenirs. Union General Benjamin Franklin Butler, the military governor of New Orleans (who was soon to be derisively nicknamed [...] "Spoons" [...] for allegedly pocketing the silverware of New Orleans citizens arrested for treason against the United States), ordered Mumford executed in retaliation. And so, Mumford was hanged from a flagstaff projecting horizontally from the building on June 7, 1862. Mumford's hanging made national headlines. Jefferson Davis demanded that Butler immediately be executed if captured. The event stuck in the minds of many New Orleanians: eleven years later, in 1873, a visitor to the city named Edward King mentioned it in his description of the structure.|$|E

500|$|Later in the tournament, on 18 June 2012, Mario Balotelli scored {{his first}} goal {{in a major}} {{international}} tournament in a 2–0 victory against the Republic of Ireland. When he attempted to celebrate this goal, he was immediately halted by teammate Leonardo Bonucci, who covered Balotelli's mouth with his hand for fear that the striker would say something to [...] "get in trouble." [...] Balotelli had been dropped to the bench by Cesare Prandelli prior to the game due to his lack of ability shown in his previous group games, so when he was subbed on against Ireland fans didn't expect him to {{have much of an}} impact, and his celebration of his goal may have originally been directed towards the naysayers who believe he is bad for the team. Balotelli went on to start against England in the quarter-finals, his performance was described as wasteful but his effort was rated highly in a game where he missed multiple chances. He scored the first penalty taken in the shootout against his Manchester City teammate Joe Hart. On 28 June, Balotelli scored twice within the first 40 minutes in Italy's semi-final clash with Germany, as the Azzurri won 2–1 and progressed to the Euro 2012 final against European and World champions Spain. After scoring the second goal in that semi-final, <b>he</b> <b>ripped</b> off his shirt and stood motionless as he flexed his muscles, developing a famous celebration. Going into the final Balotelli said that, Manchester City's title success meant that failure in the Euros would not signal a personal failure this season.

On his album Bi-Polar, Ice mentions Eminem {{in a positive light}} ("Hip Hop Rules") and in a negative light ("Exhale"), however, Ice stated that he has no bad feelings towards Eminem. In a 2002 interview, Vanilla Ice stated that he thought Eminem's references were flattering, going on to say [...] "I give him credit, I think he’s talented, I think he’s a killer rapper, you know I don’t compare myself to him because he’s another white rapper, I don't compare myself to any other rapper period, I don’t colorize hip hop, it’s stupid, but for people who are doing that are just looking {{through the eyes of a}} racial standpoint, and it really shouldn’t be looked at that way, you’re looking at two musicians that are in a broad brand of hip hop, so you don’t need to compare us two.

In Week 7, he set the second fastest touchdown to start a game in team history after he intercepted a pass by Rams quarterback Sam Bradford on the first offensive play of the game and returned it 45 yards for the score, coming 21 seconds into the game; later in the game, he also recovered a fumble by wide receiver Tavon Austin that set up a field goal for the Panthers. In Week 13 at the Miami Dolphins, he compiled a single-game career-high and team-leading 13 tackles as the Panthers won 20-16. On December 15, he set the franchise record with his fifth career interception return for a touchdown after he picked off Jets' quarterback Geno Smith and returned it 41 yards for the score, surpassing the previous mark of four by Mike Minter from 1997 to 2006; in that game, he also established a single-game career high with two sacks as he brought down Smith for losses of seven and eight yards. The following week against the New Orleans Saints, he was credited with 1.5 sacks, one when he blitzed quarterback Drew Brees for a five-yard loss and the half combined with defensive end Greg Hardy to sack Brees for another five-yard loss.
