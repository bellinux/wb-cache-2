40|$|The {{document}} presents some {{design and}} development solutions concerning the system MY-AHA, with specific {{focus on the}} appropriation, that is {{the process by which}} people adopt and adapt technology, fitting it into their practices. According to this principle, the collected user requirements are here declined into different system descriptions. Two service scenarios describe different situations in which the system and the users will interact: a ‘supervised’ scenario, inspired to the MY-AHA waves, where the clinicians engage directly the subjects, and one scenario looking at a future where the subject autonomously will adopt and use the system. Design thinking techniques, such as Service blueprint, user journey and GUI wireframe, present the concept at a different detail levels. A specific focus is dedicated on the My-Dashboard, the communication layer between primary end users and healthcare professionals, also working as a hub able to introduce and connect all the My-AHA platforms and simplify the access in a single coherent environment. Some technical features support the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appropriation</b> and personalization <b>of</b> my-AHA, such as the recommender systems, are also presented in this deliverable.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} describing teachers’ affective and cognitive thought processes, {{as well as}} the sensemaking and decision-making ongoing within them, during the various stages <b>of</b> the <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> an educational innovation. Design/methodology/approach – The Rubicon model of action phases, borrowed from psychology, is first used as a lens to understand teacher will. The model is subsequently adapted to reconcile it with existing literature on teacher beliefs, teacher sensemaking, and teacher resistance. Findings – The proposed framework shows that teachers’ <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> an educational innovation is multi-layered and multi-dimensional. This contradicts appropriation as simply a procedural <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> research recommendations, culminating in only success or failure. Originality/value – The paper sensitises policy makers, school leaders, and teacher educators to the complexity <b>of</b> the <b>appropriation</b> process. The proposed framework serves {{as a starting point for}} school and reform leaders, to re-examine their school’s <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> an educational innovation from a more human relations perspective.

40|$|This thesis studies {{contemporary}} poetry’s {{innovations in}} textual borrowing {{and the range}} and scope of its appropriative practices. The restrictions of the inherited definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> include a limited capacity for expression and meaningfulness, a partial concept of appropriation’s critical capacity, and an inadequate sense of the poet’s individual and unique practice <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> This thesis resolves the problematic constraints limiting contemporary definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> by tracing {{the history of the}} practice to reveal an enduring relation between appropriation and poetic expression. Close readings of Trevor Joyce’s, Alan Halsey’s, and Susan Howe’s poetry serve as evidence of contemporary poetry’s development <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> beyond the current ascriptions and offer some direction on how the critical understanding <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> might be extended and redefined. Here, appropriation is recognized as another source of lyric expression, critical innovation, and conceptual development in contemporary poetry.

40|$|The {{article is}} an attempt at showing the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> Jacques Ranciere’s theory in contemplating about city space, its division, {{appropriation}} and privatization. The first part of paper is focused on presentation of approaches describing processes <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> space, which are dominant on the sociological field. There are two main interpretations: (1) first perspective reduces appropriation to legal or factual annexation of space, authors write here about gentrification, gated communities or privatization of public space by corporations; (2) second perspective reduces appropriation to visual (over) presence, of which the best example is ostentatious presence of billboards in public place and appropriation/retrieval of space with such activities as painting graffiti and sticking stickers. Unfortunately, these two perspectives {{do not include the}} wholeness <b>of</b> processes <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> which take place in the city, because of two reasons: (1) these two perspectives unwillingly relate to the fact that city is aesthetic space (city continually provides innumerable volume of aesthetic experiences); (2) both perspectives completely ignore the fact that city is »multi-sensual world« (city provides not only visual experiences but it is full of sounds, scents and kinaesthetic experiences). So, there is requirement of using multi-sensual perspective to make the recognition about processes <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> city space more complex. The next part of article is devoted to presentation of Ranciere’s conception of the distribution of the sensible, as the one of possible strategies of analyzing processes <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> city space in terms of aesthetic experiences. The distribution of the sensible is sensuously accessible system of relations between objects which is connected with specified time and space, in other words: this system defines what can be seen and heard at given moment in such place. Therefore, the distribution of sensible defines where each element/individual should be »placed«, with whom each individual can talk, which language is appropriate in specified space-time, and, finally, which scents are proper there. Processes of distribution of the sensible will be discuss on example of changes of historical centers of polish cities which took place after the 1989...|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in debates {{on how to}} account for migrants’ capacity to defy restrictive border controls and migration policies. What the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> better captures than concepts like agency or resistance is the multi-faceted and intricate intertwinement of border regimes and migratory practices. The article illustrates this advantage through {{an analysis of the}} phenomenon of bezness. The term refers to a migration strategy of aspiring migrants who seduce and subsequently marry European tourists as a way to gain entry to and residency in Europe. This article develops a reading of bezness as a mode <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> mobility which is intertwined with the border regime in at least four ways: First, bezness is provoked by restrictive visa policies that create a highly unequal access to mobility and life opportunities. The case of bezness illustrates, second, that migrants try to recode the methods, logics and effects of mobility control into means <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> Migrants’ practices <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> involve, third, the clandestine transgression of the norms, rules and regulations that define particular border regimes. Finally, the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> permits to recognise that the European border regime operates as an apparatus of capture that tries to recuperate migrants’ practices in order to turn them into a driving force for its own development. The example of bezness demonstrates, moreover, that these processes of recuperation also feature the mobilisation of emotions – in this case of romantic love – as technologies of government...|$|R

40|$|According to Locke, {{appropriation}} is {{a precondition}} for moral responsibility and thus we can expect that it plays a distinctive role in his theory. Yet it is rare to find an interpretation of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> that does not associate it with serious problems. To {{make room for a}} more satisfying understanding of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> we have to analyse why it was so widely misunderstood. The aim of this paper is fourfold: First, I will show that Mackie’s and Winkler’s interpretations that have shaped the subsequent discussion contain serious flaws. Second, I will argue that the so-called appropriation interpretation —that is the view that appropriation is meant to provide alternative persistence conditions for persons—lacks support. Third, I will re-examine Locke’s texts and argue that we can come {{to a better understanding of}} his notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in the Essay if we interpret it in analogy to his account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in Two Treatises.
