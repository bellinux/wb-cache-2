40|$|British cinema {{has long}} been {{intertwined}} with television. The buzzwords of the transition to digital media, 'convergence' and 'multi-platform delivery', have particular histories in the British context which can be grasped only through {{an understanding of the}} cultural, historical and institutional peculiarities of the British film and television industries. Central to this understanding must be two comparisons: first, the relative stability of television in the duopoly period (at its core, the licence-funded BBC) in contrast to the repeated boom and bust of the many different financial/industrial combinations which have comprised the film industry; and second, the cultural and historical connotations of 'film' and 'television'. All readers of this journal will be familiar – possibly over-familiar – with the notion that 'British cinema is alive and well and living on television'. At {{the end of the first}} decade of the twenty-first century, when 'the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>medium</b> specificity' is much trumpeted, it might be useful to return to the historical imbrication of British film and television, to explore both the possibility that medium specificity may be more nationally specific than much contemporary theorisation suggests, and to consider some of the relationships between film and television manifest at a textual level in two recent films, Red Road (2006) and The Unloved (2009) ...|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} outcome of two {{different}} targeting strategies for treating radiolucent ureteric calculi by {{extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy}} (ESWL), focusing the shock waves either at the end or 5 mm beyond the column <b>of</b> contrast <b>medium</b> visible in the ureter. Patients and methods A total of 156 patients undergoing ESWL for a radiolucent ureteric stone were randomized into two groups. Group 1 comprised 74 patients in whom the shock waves were focused on the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the contrast <b>medium</b> column, and group 2 comprised 82 patients in whom the shock waves were focused 5 mm beyond the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the column.

The stone-free rate after 2 months was 17 % greater in group 2 (91 %) than in group 1 (74 %; P < 0. 05).

50|$|The {{remaining}} step in utilizing {{optical amplification}} {{to create an}} optical oscillator is to place highly reflecting mirrors at each <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the amplifying <b>medium</b> so that a wave in a particular spatial mode will reflect back upon itself, gaining more power in each pass than is lost due to transmission through the mirrors and diffraction. When these conditions are met for one or more longitudinal modes then radiation in those modes will rapidly build up until gain saturation occurs, resulting in a stable continuous laser beam output through the front (typically 99% reflecting) mirror.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of laser uses {{feedback}} from an optical cavity—a pair of mirrors on either <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the gain <b>medium.</b> Light bounces {{back and forth between the}} mirrors, passing through the gain medium and being amplified each time. Typically one of the two mirrors, the output coupler, is partially transparent. Some of the light escapes through this mirror. Depending on the design of the cavity (whether the mirrors are flat or curved), the light coming out of the laser may spread out or form a narrow beam. In analogy to electronic oscillators, this device is sometimes called a laser oscillator.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} the first and second order models for predicting the tangential cutting force produced in end-milling operation <b>of</b> <b>medium</b> carbon steel. The mathematical model for the cutting force prediction has been developed, in terms of cutting parameters cutting speed, feed rate, and axial depth of cut using design of experiments and the response surface methodology (RSM). All the individual cutting parameters affect on cutting forces as well as their interaction are also investigated in this study. The second order equation shows, based on the variance analysis, that the most influential input parameter was the feed rate followed by axial depth of cut and, finally, by the cutting speed. Central composite design was employed in developing the cutting force models in relation to primary cutting parameters. The experimental results indicate that the proposed mathematical models suggested could adequately describe the performance indicators within the limits of the factors that are being investigated. The adequacy of the predictive model was verified using ANOVA at 95 % confidence level.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the major}} {{technological}} parameters in metal cutting is surface roughness. It is an unavoidable, and often, unwanted by-product of all machining operations, especially end milling. Surface roughness {{is directly related to}} product quality and performance, operation cost, machining accuracy, and chatter. Today’s stringent customer requirements demand machined parts with minimum (mirror finished) products. Hence, the prediction, modeling, and optimization of surface roughness is a quintessential concern in machining research and industrial endeavor. This research was undertaken in order to determine whether <b>end</b> milling <b>of</b> <b>medium</b> carbon steel performed using chosen ranges of cutting parameter and under magnetic field generated by permanent magnets could effectively improve surface roughness. A small central composite design with five levels and an alpha value of 1. 4142, in Response Surface Methodology, was used in developing the relationship between cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut, with surface roughness. Design-Expert 6. 0 software was utilized to develop the quadratic empirical mathematical model for surface roughness. The experiments were performed under two different conditions. The first condition was cutting under normal conditions, while the other one was cutting under the application of magnetic fields from two permanent magnets. Medium carbon steel was used as the work material. The resultant average surface roughness was found to be reduced by a maximum of 59 % due to magnet application...|$|R
