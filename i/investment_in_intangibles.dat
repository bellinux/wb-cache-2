40|$|In {{this paper}} I attempt to {{replicate}} for Sweden the Corrado, Hulten and Sichel (2006) and Marrano and Haskel (2006) working papers on spending on intangible {{assets in the}} US and the UK. Based on their measurement methods the total spending on intangibles in Sweden in 2004 was 277 billion SEK or 10. 6 percent of total GDP. Based on total spending it can be estimated that total <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles</b> was 227 billion or approximately two-thirds of the total investment in fixed capital in 2004. Thus, <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles</b> was considerable in 2004. The corresponding figures for the UK and the US were 10. 9 and 13. 1 percent, respectively. Even though the measurement methods of intangibles must be further developed, {{it could be argued}} that intangibles in the future should be included in the Swedish national accounts.

40|$|After {{a severe}} {{crisis in the}} early 1990 s, the Swedish economy {{experienced}} a boom in productivity growth. According to economists there have been primarily three explanations for the fast productivity growth in 1995 – 2004 : Market reforms, recovery from the crisis {{and the impact of}} information and communication technology (ICT). This paper offers an alternative view by recognizing that firms make substantial investment in intangible assets such as R&D, design, advertising etc. These investments are not classified as investment in the National Accounts, where only tangible assets are defined as investment. This paper provides estimates of investment in intangible assets and uses the growth accounting framework to analyze the Swedish productivity boom. The results show that <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles</b> was approximately 246 bn SEK in 2004 or 9 percent of GDP. Moreover, intangible capital accounted for almost 50 percent of labor productivity growth in the Swedish business sector 1995 – 2004. Thus, <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles</b> was an important source to the Swedish productivity boom in 1995 – 2004. Intangibles; Investment; Economic growth...|$|E

I calibrate the parameters associated with intangible capital by using new estimates of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles</b> by Corrado et al. (2006). When intangible capital is added to the model, the TFP elasticity of output increases from 2. 14 to 2. 64. This finding implies that the addition of intangible capital increases the ability of the neoclassical growth model to explain international income differences by more than a factor of two.

Our results indicate that <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> capital is pro-cyclical. Both transitory aswell as permanent productivity shocks increase <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> capital. However, <b>in</b> case of a permanent technology shock we learn that firms allocate more labor and physical capital to the creation of intangible capital which increases future profits at the cost of current profit.

40|$|According to the Resource-Based View, {{the nature}} of the resources, competences and {{knowledge}} accumulated by firms are the major causes of variation in business performance. In view of the importance attributed to intangible assets, {{the purpose of the present}} study was to investigate whether innovative firms with superior and sustained performance and firms without superior and sustained performance differ with regard to <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> assets. The sample consisted of 137 firms listed on the Brazilian stock exchange from 2007 to 2010 and belonging to innovative sectors according to the Brazilian Innovation Index. Only 51 firms with profitability above the sector average during the entire study period (four years) met the criterion of superior and sustained performance. Thus, using return on assets as a proxy for performance, <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles</b> were found to be greater in firms without superior and sustained performance, particularly with regard to the categories intellectual property assets (the predominant category) and infrastructure assets. Based on the lack of evidence for a significant correlation between corporate performance and <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> assets, our initial hypothesis that a positive relation exists between the composition of <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> assets and the performance of innovative firms could not be confirmed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role {{intangible}} capital plays {{for economic growth}} in different sectors in Germany. It consists of two major parts. In the first part, we aim at measuring <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles</b> at the sector level. We shed light on differences across sectors but also compare these figures with investment in physical capital and with <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles</b> in the UK as European benchmark. The second part explores the role of intangible assets for stimulating growth at the sector level by performing growth accounting analyses. We find that German firms have boosted investments in intangible capital from 1995 - 2006 by 30 %. Furthermore, results reveal differences in the investment patterns among the UK and Germany. In nearly all sectors investments in design and computerized information are larger in the UK. In contrast, German firms invest {{a higher proportion of}} gross output in R&D in all sectors, and advertising is also more common except for the sector trade & transport. Intangible assets have stimulated labour productivity growth in all sectors. The contribution varies between 0. 17 (construction) and 0. 59 (manufacturing) percentage points. In manufacturing, financial and business services innovative property capital is the most influential type of intangible capital for labour productivity, followed by economic competencies and computerized information. In all other sectors, economic competencies play the most prominent role for labour productivity growth...|$|E

Market failure justifications depend {{on the status of}} arts and culture as non-rival public goods, as ‘merit goods’, or the need to moderate the effects of up-front investment costs or monopoly, and the inherent uncertainty of creative production. ‘Systems failure’ too is a regular rationale for policy intervention. Using the United Kingdom as an example, the chapter shows how emphasis on these rationales has shifted over the last three decades, first in the context of industrial policies for traditional aims such as exports and job growth, which have been joined in recent years by the need for <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles,</b> knowledge exchange, and spillover effects in the wider economy...|$|E
40|$|The study aims to {{investigate}} the determinants of subjective bonus payouts in the UK financial industry. Bonuses are increasingly linked to wider business goals, such as quality and customer service, firm reputation and employee hiring and retention policies, thus replacing the traditional focus on output or profit measures. A new conceptual work on subjectivity is used to evaluate these bonus practices. Results indicate {{that a variety of}} contextual factors have influenced the firms to make greater use of subjectivity in bonus payouts. Of these, organizational interdependency appeared to be the most forceful factor, followed by management’s strategic focus, long-term <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles,</b> economic constraints, performance target difficulty, and competition. The analysis suggests that subjectivity acts as a mechanism that aligns the interests of individual employees with the firm’s performance goals.

40|$|This study empirically {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} greenfield <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> assets <b>in</b> emerging and industrialized countries. Data consists of host parent country pairs of greenfield FDI projects in (i) software (except video games), (ii) advertising, public relations and related activities, (iii) headquarters, (iv) research & development and (v) design, development & testing. With a world market share of 33 per cent in 2011 {{in terms of the}} number of projects, descriptive statistics show that the EU 27 is one of the most important locations for international greenfield <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> assets. However, there was a decline in the EU 27 s share of such projects after the recent financial and economic crisis, which is mainly due to the decrease in intra-EU greenfield FDI activities. In contrast, FDI inflows <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> assets increased <b>in</b> the United States, in other non EU OECD countries and in emerging countries. Among the EU countries of Ireland, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands and Sweden are the most attractive locations for Non-EU investors, whereas the southern and East EU countries are least successful in attracting FDI projects <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> assets. The results using fixed and random effects negative binomial regression models for 40 host and 26 parent countries during the period 20032 ̆ 0132010 show that FDI <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> assets depends significantly positively on quantity of human capital, quality of human capital measured as the PISA score in maths and reading, costs of starting a business, broadband penetration, strength of investor protection, R&D endowment and direct R&D subsidies. Wage costs (or unit labour costs) have a significant negative impact on FDI inflows <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> assets. Other policy factors, such as labour market regulations, product, or FDI regulations, do not have a significant impact.

40|$|Intangible {{assets are}} largely {{ignored by the}} “traditional” System of National Accounts (SNA), {{although}} they play an increasingly important economic role. The reasons for this are the substantial measurement and valuation problems. This article applies a methodology based on Hulten (1979) and Corrado et al.

I discuss the proposed categorization approach and quantify the different components for the German economy, drawing on a number of different data sources.

Specifically, when intangible capital is added to the model, the required TFP ratio to explain observed income differences falls from 4. 05 to 2. 97. I also study variants of the model with endogenous and exogenous barriers to accumulation of technology capital, which consists of intangible capital and a fraction of physical capital that embodies technology. The addition of endogenous barriers, for reasonable parameter values, has a very small positive effect on the ability of the model to account for income differences. The addition of exogenous barriers suggests that huge cross-country differences in such barriers are needed to generate the observed income differences...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s the Swedish economy {{experienced}} a severe {{economic and financial}} crisis {{which resulted in a}} substantial GDP decrease.

40|$|In {{an era of}} {{knowledge}} based economy <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> assets such as knowledge and innovation play important role in economic growth. In recent {{years there has been}} considerable debate on the role of <b>intangible</b> assets <b>in</b> economic growth particularly <b>in</b> advanced economies. <b>Investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> assets is as much as in tangible assets and has been on the rise in recent years.

For a valid assessment of the economic performance of the construction sector in terms of its productivity, it is important that the economic benefits for the sector from technological change are properly recognized but the impact of such benefits may be ‘hidden’ due to measurement issues, as innovative activity and investment in intangible assets have both gone unrecognized in official statistics. Much of the innovation in the construction sector is hidden from conventional measures and, for the UK economy, there is evidence that <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles</b> may be even greater than tangible investment, if a definition of intangible assets incorporating spending on a broad range of knowledge‐based assets including organizational capital, human capital, etc. is taken.

40|$|Modern {{economic}} growth stems in good part from investments in knowledge-based intangible assets, such as {{research and development}} (R&D), organisational know-how, product design, branding and marketing. By capitalising expenditures on these intangibles as business investments, this thesis investigates the role they play in productivity and growth from various perspectives. From firm-level analysis of potential knowledge spillovers of organisation capital to the complementary relationship between investments in intangibles and information and communications technology; from an aggregate macroeconomic analysis of how intangibles could account for part of income variation across countries to how intellectual property rights (IPR) protection {{could serve as a}} tool to attract knowledge-intensive imports. By combining different data sources and research methods, this thesis shows that (1) the knowledge about organisational know-how does not readily spill over between firms; (2) full productivity exploitation of investment in ICT requires complementary investments in R&D and organisational know-how; and (3) a significant portion of international income differences can be accounted for by investments in intangible capital. Lastly, countries with a slow pace of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles</b> could import more knowledge-intensive goods by strengthening their own IPR protection...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} studies confirm that investment in intangible assets is a non-negligible component of business sector output. The contribution of intan-gible capital to total labour productivity growth {{is comparable to}} that of tangi-ble capital {{for a wide range of}} the countries, including the US, UK, Canada, Ger-many, France etc. Following Corrado et al. (2005) and Baldwin et al.

The findings indicate that the Ontario business investment in intangible assets accounts on average for 10 percent of revised business sector output in the 1998 - 2008 period. The growth rate of real <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles</b> exceeds that of investment in tangible assets.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} that the Japanese economy has fumbled their chance to reap the benefits of investment in information technology due to a reluctance to carry out drastic corporate reforms in business processes and human resource management associated with the introduction of new technology. For this purpose, we first review Solow’s productivity paradox and the new economy in the U. S., and then we compare these with the Japanese economy based on growth accounting analysis and an estimation of production function models. On top of that, we illustrate a series of firm-level questionnaire surveys to examine the decisive role of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangibles,</b> i. e., reforming organizational structures and human resource management, in line with IT investment. These analyses yield two observations. First, Japan’s investment in IT has been stagnant over the last two decades in spite of its potential to contribute to productivity improvement and consequent economic growth. Second, there is a strong complementary relationship between drastic corporate reforms and positive outcomes from IT investment, which Japanese firms have been fumbling. The results of this research suggest that the inertia of Japan’s integrated corporate system persists in the midst of innovation in information technology. Therefore, the Japanese private business sector needs to make an intense effort into investing in intangibles, i. e., a drastic redesign of business processes and human resource management in order to achieve the maximum effect of investments in information technology...|$|E

While the literature states that the economic success is based on the effective utilization of intangible assets, in the public sector there is low level of interest in their identification, measurement and disclosure. In the light of the theoretical evidences, the purpose of our research is to verify the developed stage of intangible assets process in Romanian municipalities as regards the awareness, measurement and disclosure in 2012 annual reports. Also, the paper presents the most influential factors of intangible assets information disclosure.

40|$|This Study {{concentrates}} on private-sector intangible investment analysing its causes, benefits, {{and the challenges}} it presents. The Study highlights several non-trivial problems in relation to current regulation and practices for internal and external reporting on intangible assets. These include the following: (1) we think we understand but need more empirical evidence on what drives enterprise resource allocation decisions between tangible and intangible assets; (2) {{we do not yet}} understand the links between patterns of enterprise strategic investment decisions and external competitive processes; (3) internal data collection appears insufficient, on average, to permit comprehensive identification and management of intangible investment; (4) external financial reporting regulations define assets to encompass all resources expected to generate future benefits, but exclude many intangibles with the reliable measurement rule; and, (5) separate agencies responsible for microeconomic data collection (external financial reporting) and macroeconomic statistical data collection, work in isolation without a common conceptual framework or data collection tools. The Study summarises theory and evidence suggesting the extent of possible distortions across sectors arising from these latter challenges and other related issues. It demonstrates the chronic measurement and reporting problems occurring in data collection at the macro level (e. g., broad-based measurement of macro indicators of intangible asset investment) {{as well as at the}} enterprise level. The Study also provides the basis for the European Union to contribute towards the development of an information infrastructure for measuring and reporting on intangible assets.

Accounting profit rates are adjusted to take account of firm capital outlays on R&D and advertising (i. e., <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>intangible</b> capital). Then, {{with the use of a}} structure-performance regression model, these adjusted profit rates are regressed on various determinant variables including a measure of the firm's stock of R&D capital. This analysis indicates that firms in research-intensive industries earn significantly above-average returns on their R&D capital. These results are robust to alternative assumptions concerning depreciation rates and other model specification changes. ...|$|R
