In addition to their biocompatibility, the feasibility of these delivery systems is significantly contributed by their ability to gel at physiological conditions and to release entrapped molecules in a sustained manner. In this study, parameters affecting the gelling behavior and the release characteristics of a neutral hydrogel system based on chitosan and an inorganic orthophosphate salt have been investigated. Monobasic and tribasic phosphate salts were not effective in inducing gelation of chitosan solution. However, {{in the presence of}} dibasic phosphate salt such as <b>dipotassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> (DHO), the acidic chitosan solution was neutralized and gelling at temperature and time regulated by varying chitosan and salt concentrations in the formulation.

30|$|The Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis DSM 20481 strain was {{cultivated}} in Medium 53 [glucose (5 [*]g[*]L- 1), casein peptone, tryptic digest (10 [*]g[*]L- 1), yeast extract (5 [*]g[*]L- 1) and NaCl (5 [*]g[*]L- 1)] under shaking at 30 °C. The Lactobacillus plantarum NC 8 strain was {{cultivated in}} de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) medium [glucose (20 [*]g[*]L- 1), casein peptone, tryptic digest (10 [*]g[*]L- 1), meat extract (10 [*]g[*]L- 1), yeast extract (5 [*]g[*]L- 1), Na-acetate (5 [*]g[*]L- 1), <b>dipotassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate (2 [*]g[*]L- 1), diammonium hydrogen citrate (2 [*]g[*]L- 1), Tween 80 (1 [*]g[*]L- 1), magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (0.2 [*]g[*]L- 1) and manganese sulfate monohydrate (0.05 [*]g[*]L- 1)] under shaking at 37 °C.|$|R
30|$|Gold (III) {{chloride}} (99  % pure) and Bradford reagent were procured from Sigma Aldrich. Yeast malt broth media constituents (peptone, yeast extract, malt extract; dextrose) and phenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) {{were purchased}} from Hi Media laboratories. Buffering reagents such as potassium dihydrogen phosphate and <b>dipotassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate were purchased from Merck. Enzyme cofactors such as Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) were procured from Sisco Research Laboratory chemicals. All set of experiments was performed using ultra pure MilliQ H 2 O (resistivity: 18.2  MΩ cm). All the reaction flasks were washed with aqua regia (3 : 1 v/v of Conc. hydrochloric acid and nitric acid) before use.|$|R
40|$|The {{unialgal culture}} of Spirulina platensis was sub-cultured in Zarrouk’s medium under photoautotrophic conditions. Initially, indoor batch {{cultivation}} {{was carried out}} for a week in four different types of cultivation media viz., Zarrouk’s, Modified Zarrouk’s, prescribed Nallayam Research Centre (NRC), and Modified NRC. In modified medium, urea and phosphoric acid of NRC medium were replaced with sodium nitrate and <b>dipotassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate (anhydrous) and concentration of ferrous sulphate heptahydrate was reduced. The batch and airlift indoor culture experiments were carried out with an illumination of 3500 ± 100 lux, photoperiod of 12 : 12 hour light and dark periods and temperature of 24 ± 1 °C. The specific growth rate value was 5. 7...|$|R
40|$|The {{preservation}} of prawns with boric acid, <b>dipotassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate, sodium bisulphite, ascorbic acid, citric ascorbic acid mixture, acronise pd, foromycin and penicillin have been investigated. Acronise pd, foromycin and citric ascorbic acid mixture {{in the order}} named proved the most effective inhibitors of growth of the natural mixture flora at temperatures between - 18 °C and 28 °C; while foromycin inhibited yeast growth and sodium bisulphite and boric acid retarded melanosis. Acronise pd caused marked inhibition of bacterial growth in 5 to 50 per ml concentration, when used as an immersion medium for 10 to 15 minutes. The other chemicals used exerted a less intense action or were without any effect...|$|R
