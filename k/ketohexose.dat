Development of immobilized/stabilized biocatalysts could be a further option to improve the process. In this work, β-galactosidase from Bacillus circulans, l-arabinose (d-galactose) isomerase from Enterococcus faecium, and d-xylose (d-glucose) isomerase from Streptomyces rubiginosus were immobilized individually onto Eupergit C and Eupergit C 250 L. Immobilized activity yields were over 90 % in all cases. With the purpose of increasing thermostability of derivatives, two post-immobilization treatments were performed: alkaline incubation to favor the formation of additional covalent linkages, and blocking of excess oxirane groups by reacting with glycine. The greatest thermostability was achieved when alkaline incubation was carried out for 24 h, producing l-arabinose isomerase-Eupergit C derivatives with a half-life of 379 h and d-xylose isomerase-Eupergit C derivatives with a half-life of 554 h at 50 °C.

The metabolism of D-fructose and the effect of D-glucose thereupon were essentially comparable in control and GK rats in both pancreatic islets and parotid cells. In both cell types, the comparison between the metabolism of D-glucose and D-fructose in cells simultaneously exposed to the two hexoses suggested a far from negligible contribution of fructokinase to the phosphorylation of D-fructose.

We measured the permeabilities of model protocellular membranes to water, {{five of the six}} pentoses, and selected aldohexoses, <b>ketohexoses,</b> and three to six carbon alditols by following volume changes of vesicles after the addition of solute to the external medium. Solute hydrophobicities correlated poorly with permeability coefficients within one structural class of compounds. The permeability coefficients of diastereomeric sugars differed by as much as a factor of 10, with ribose being the most permeable aldopentose. Flexible alditols and sugars, sugars biased toward or restricted to furanose forms, and sugars having anomers with hydrophobic faces permeated more quickly than compounds lacking these features. Among the aldopentoses, only ribose possesses all of these properties. Ribose permeated both fatty acid and phospholipid membranes more rapidly than the other aldopentoses or hexoses. The enhanced permeability conferred by the unique conformational preferences of ribose would have allowed faster assimilation of ribose by primitive cells as they passively absorbed materials from the environment.

Recent studies on the reactivities of Lewis base-doped and alkali-exchanged Sn-Beta samples have conclusively demonstrated that the “open” tin site performs the glucose isomerization reaction. With Lewis base doped Sn-Beta, glucose conversion is almost completely eliminated and product selectivity is shifted predominantly to mannose. These data suggest that glucose reactions may occur through pathways that do not involve the “open” site in Sn-Beta; albeit at significantly lower rates. To examine this possibility, reactions of glucose catalyzed by a homogeneous model of Sn-Beta that does not contain “open” sites, methyl-ligated tin silsesquioxane 1 a, is experimentally and theoretically examined. 1 a is an active glucose conversion catalyst selectively producing mannose, although the rates of reaction are far below those obtained from Sn-Beta. A hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics model is constructed, and the complete catalytic cycle is computationally examined, considering ring-opening, three distinct pathways for each hydride- and carbon-shift reaction, and ring-closing. The combined experimental and computational results suggest that there could be reaction pathways that involve Si–O–Sn cleavage that give much slower reaction rates than the open tin site in Sn-Beta...|$|R

Chapter 1 encompasses a general introduction to branched-chain sugars, with the emphasis upon 2 C- hydroxymethyl and -methyl branched sugars. Strategies for their synthesis are discussed, both from nucleophilic and electrophilic carbohydrate derivatives. Some synthetic applications of carbohydrates and consequently branched carbohydrates are highlighted, {{with a view to}} the derivatisation of a proposed chiron from the Kiliani ascension of L-sorbose, 2 -C-hydroxymethyl 2, 3 : 5, 6 -di-O-isopropylidene-L-gulono, 1, 4 -lactone. In chapter 2, the Kiliani ascension of L-sorbose and two subsequent complementary di-O-isopropylidene protections of the branched-chain lactones generated (thermodynamic and kinetic) are discussed. Further studies into the same transformations of three other <b>ketohexoses,</b> D-fructose, D-tagatose and D-psicose are then discussed. Further useful synthetic derivatives of the three major isomeric L-sorbose-derived branched di-protected lactones: selective deprotections and cleavage of C 5 -C 6 bonds. One major area wh!ch utilizes carbohydrate building blocks is iminosugar synthesis. Iminosugars are the major compound class of interest in the realm of glycosidase inhibition, and also have other therapeutic properties, thus making them desirable synthetic targets. The application of 2 -C-. branched sugar derivatives in the synthesis of novel iminosugars is proposed. Chapter 4 {{describes the}} syntheses of eight novel 2 -C- hydroxymethyl and -methyl branched iminosugars from the major thermodynamic product (2 -C-hydroxymethyl- 2, 3 : 5, 6 -di-O-isopropylidene-L-gulono-l, 4 -lactone) obtained from the Kiliani ascension of L-sorbose, as described in chapter 2. The syntheses of two additional novel iminosugars from isomeric 2, 3 : 5, 6 -di-O-isopropylidene branched derivatives is described. Some results of inhibitory activity follow the synthetic results. The last two chapters provide a general introduction to macrocycles, and some synthetic investigations into macrocycles based on open-chain sugar amino acids (SAAs). SAA-derived macrocycles are structural hybrids of macrocyclic peptides and cyclodextrins. Strategies for the synthesis of large rings and previous work on D-galactose-derived-SAA macrocycles within the group is described with a view to the extension of this work towards novel asymmetric macrocycles with functionalisable rings. Chapter 6 reports synthetic investigations into three related families of macrocycles, each based on an open-chain galacto SAA. The pure galacto SAA macrocycles are revisited and two novel families of macrocycles are born, one containing proteinogenic amino acids and the other incorporating branched-chain SAAs.

Upon formation of [M − H]−, both cross-ring cleavages and glycosidic bond decompositions were observed in varying degrees for the two series of disaccharides. Remarkably, for three non-reducing polysaccharides that each contain a terminal sucrose group at the “downstream” end, chlorine-containing product ions arising from cleavage of the Glcα– 2 Fru linkage have been observed. Apart from Cl−, chlorine-containing product ions are not observed for any of the other disaccharides investigated, and they appear to be specifically diagnostic of a terminal Glcα– 2 Fru linkage.

This class of compounds {{could be viewed}} as synthetic equivalents of natures building block [...] 1, 3 -dihydroxyacetone and could be used in construction of many polyoxygenated natural products. A general, simple, cheap and easy to scale-up synthesis of 2 -substituted- 1, 3 dioxan- 5 -ones was developed. The yields of this three-step procedure, starting form commercially available tris(hydroxymethyl) nitromethane, ranged from 40 to 90 %. The exploration of the chemistry of 2 -substituted- 1, 3 -dioxan- 5 -ones was focused on carboanion chemistry of these compounds. 2 -Substituted- 1, 3 -dioxan- 5 -ones were shown to easily form corresponding lithium, boron and titanium enolates. The 2 -'tert'-butyl- 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -dioxan- 5 -one was deprotonated enantioselectively in 90 % e. e. with the aid of chiral lithium amide derived from (R) - or (S) -'N'-(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl) - 1 -phenylethylamine. This successful outcome was a result of extensive methodological studies. The enolates reacted readily with electrophiles: reactions with aldehydes provided 'anti' aldols in modest to high selectivities in cases of lithium and boron enolates and 'syn' aldols in case of titanium enolate. The enolates could be conveniently trapped as trimethylsilyl enol ethers or as enol acetates, however they failed to react with alkylating agents.

Iterative single-site randomization and screening of 48 residues in the first and second shells around the substrate-binding site of Var 8 yielded the eight-site mutant IDF 8 (ninefold improved kcat for the epimerization of D-fructose) and the six-site mutant ILS 6 (14 -fold improved epimerization of L-sorbose), compared to Var 8.

Significant randomization of the 1 and 6 positions of fructose has been reported previously for the wild-type organism during growth on this <b>ketohexose.</b> The pattern of 3 H incorporation into the C 5 position of ribonucleic acid-ribose when the mutant was grown on [1 - 3 H]fructose and [6 - 3 H]fructose {{in the presence of}} 5 KF indicated that such randomization did not occur in this variant. The randomization observed in the wild type is, therefore, a consequence of the partial oxidation of fructose to the symmetrical 5 KF intermediate prior to its conversion to pentose. When the mutant was grown on [1 - 3 H]fructose in the presence of unlabeled 5 KF, [5 - 3 H]fructose appeared in the culture medium. Thus, 5 KF served as the oxidant for the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form, generated during growth on fructose...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of biomass}} as a {{resource}} to produce value-added products has garnered significant interest {{as a means of}} reducing reliance on fossil fuels. This task is complicated by the complex, highly functionalized nature of abundant biomass derivatives, such as glucose. Tin-containing zeolite Beta (Sn-Beta) has been investigated as a catalyst for isomerizing aldohexoses into <b>ketohexoses</b> through a Lewis acid mediated hydride shift (1, 2 -intramolecular hydride shift, 1, 2 -HS). Recent studies on the reactivities of Lewis base-doped and alkali-exchanged Sn-Beta samples have conclusively demonstrated that the open tin site performs the glucose isomerization reaction. With Lewis base doped Sn-Beta, glucose conversion is almost completely eliminated and product selectivity is shifted predominantly to mannose, formed through a 1, 2 -intramolecular carbon shift (1, 2 -CS). To understand the structure-activity relationships between the conditions of the active sites in the zeolite, three molecular models (tin silsesquioxanes) of the tin sites in the zeolite are synthesized. Two tin silsesquioxanes that contain an octahedral tin site with and without an adjacent silanol group are prepared and used as catalysts for the reaction of glucose. The catalyst that contains the adjacent silanol group selectively forms fructose through a 1, 2 -HS while the catalyst without the silanol group yields mannose through a 1, 2 -CS. These results provide further evidence for the nature of the active sites in Sn-Beta. A methyl-ligated tin silsesquioxane is experimentally and theoretically examined to examine possible reactivities at the closed site. This compound is an active glucose conversion catalyst that selectively produces mannose, although the rates of reaction are far below those obtained from Sn-Beta. Additionally, a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics model is constructed, and the complete catalytic cycle is computationally examined via considering ring-opening, three distinct pathways for each hydride- and carbon-shift reaction, and ring-closing. The combined experimental and computational results suggest that there could be reaction pathways that involve Si-O-Sn cleavage that give much slower reaction rates than the open tin site in Sn-Beta. Zeolite and zeolite-like molecular sieves are being used in a large number of applications such as adsorption and catalysis. Achievement of the long-standing goal of creating a chiral, polycrystalline molecular sieve with bulk enantioenrichment would enable these materials to perform enantioselective functions. In part II of this thesis, the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched samples of a molecular sieve is reported. Enantiopure organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) are designed with the assistance of computational methods, and used to synthesize enantioenriched, polycrystalline molecular sieve samples of either enantiomer. Computational results correctly predicted which enantiomer is obtained, and enantiomeric enrichment is proven by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The enantioenriched and racemic samples of the molecular sieves are tested as adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts. The enantioenriched molecular sieves show enantioselectivity for the ring opening reaction of epoxides and enantioselective adsorption of 2 -butanol (R enantiomer of the molecular sieve shows opposite and approximately equal enantioselectivity from the S enantiomer of the molecular sieve, while the racemic sample of the molecular sieve shows no enantioselectivity). ...|$|R
40|$|Part I: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a known {{periodontal}} pathogen {{that produced}} four classes of novel dihydroceramides with biological activity ranging from inducing pro-inflammatory responses to gingival tissue and bone degeneration. It {{has been shown}} that these compounds are capable of induction of multiple sclerosis in mice model systems. GCMS and NMR analysis of these active compounds revealed that a mixture of dihydroceramides existed whose composition was dihydrosphinganine base with an amide linkage to a β-hydroxy fatty acid. The dihydrosphinganine portion contained two stereocenters, odd-carbon chains (C 17 and C 19), and a terminal isobranch moiety. The β-hydroxy fatty acid had a chain length of C 17, a single stereocenter and a terminal isobranch. Due to the complexity of the lipid extracts {{we have not been able}} to isolate individual lipid components in pure form, directly from P. gingivalis by using chromatographic method, making their synthesis essential. Apart from the synthesis and verification of the structure, our work is focused on determining the absolute and relative stereochemistry of the most active dihydroceramide. ^ Part II: Conducting polymers are rarely thought of as chemical reagents that promote chemical transformations. Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) or PEDOT and Polypyrrole (PP) are some of the most widely used conducting polymers and can be prepared via oxidative chemical using FeCl 3 or electrochemical polymerization with a triflate counterion. Chemical reactions induced by PEDOT and PP alone have not been reported prior to our work. The commercial importance of PEDOT, along with the ease of preparation and handling, stability to air and solvents, and its conductive properties led us to choose it for our studies. ^ Work in our laboratory disproves the common assumption of chemical inertness by showing that these polymers are capable of facilitating a variety of chemical reactions. Upon exposure to PEDOT or polypyrrole, alcohols are converted to ethers or undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Polyols and <b>ketohexoses</b> undergo cyclodehydrations, dienones undergo Nazarov cyclization, 1, 2 -diols go through Pinacol rearrangements, and acid-sensitive alcohol and ketone protecting groups can be removed. Their use as a chemical reagent in organic reactions has proved to not only generate equivalent yields when compared to standard literature precedent but also able to complete reactions previously inaccessible by conventional methods. ^ Part III: Cancerous solid tumors generate a specific environment that are characterized by a low oxygen partial pressure and low pH. This microenvironment is recognized as a critical factor that makes conventional anti-cancer treatment ineffective while also rapidly advancing the malignant progression. This condition is known as tumor hypoxia. Currently non-invasive imaging methods include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron emission tomography (PET). The issue with these methods is the large expense and short half-life of radioactive isotopes required for imaging that is required during chemotherapy treatment. Hence a new, non-invasive, lost cost method to repeatedly monitor changes to hypoxia tumor size and characteristics is an attractive goal. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT) is low-cost and highly effective technique used to image tumors. However the technique is dependent on an internal fluorochrome to generate a fluorescent signal. Our goal was to combine a biologically safe fluorescent dye (indocyanine green), that could be easily detectable by a topical imaging probe, with a molecule which has an affinity for low-pH, hypoxic areas (2 -nitroimidazoles). This involved the formation these new indocyanine green dye conjugates that would specifically target hypoxic tumor and supply imaging at that site. Our work synthesized four generations of dye conjugates with each subsequent generation improving on the previous. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of this project, acidic, basic, metal, and photo {{catalysts}} were applied to carbohydrate melts. We aimed to find chemical reactions converting carbohydrates in a selective and efficient way into fine chemicals in this screening process. The present study revealed that under basic conditions carbohydrates isomerise via well-known keto-enediol intermediates which are in equilibrium. Besides, observed decomposition reactions were also unselective. The addition of amines led to random Maillard products. Caramelisation products occurred constantly, especially at high temperatures. Furthermore, we could show that carbohydrates were not converted by applying metal catalysis, with the focus on oxidation reactions, or photo catalysis. Often, glucosylurea was formed during the reaction. Acid catalysed reactions provided the most promising results. In choline chloride melts, acids catalyse the elimination of water molecules which leads to furfural derivatives, important organic platform chemicals. We illustrated the synthesis of 5 -hydroxmethylfurfural (5 -HMF) from L-sorbose and 5 -(α-D-glucosyloxymethyl) furfural (GMF) from isomaltulose. In general, glycosylureas are produced in sugar-urea melts from different aldohexoses as well as from <b>ketohexoses</b> under acidic conditions. They are remarkably stable and are stereoselectively formed in high yields and short reaction times. Slightly acidic conditions are sufficient to make them the preferred product. Thus, we could improve existing syntheses of glycosylureas by implementing a method using environmentally benign bulk chemicals without the need of a solvent. Accordingly, reactions times were reduced and yields were increased. Summing up, we concluded that sugars show similar reaction behaviour in melts as in solution. Aggressive growth accompanied by rapid metastasis makes the malignant melanoma a kind of cancer with a low rate of survival in an advanced stage. The melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) protein reduces the cell contacts to the extracellular matrix and facilitates metastasis. Remarkably, MIA protein is exclusively expressed in malignant melanoma cells and chondrocytes. In comparison to other chemotherapeutic agents, anti metastatic agents (substances which inhibit the functional activity of MIA protein) would thus prevent the spreading of these cells and reduce the side effects of systemic chemotherapy dramatically. MIA protein is functionally active after formation of dimers. Small compounds which prevent this assembly would be very interesting drugs in the treatment of cancer. Short peptides consisting of three to eighteen amino acids were assessed in a screening process to inhibit the dimerisation of MIA protein in vitro and in vivo. The major drawback of proteins and peptides as drugs is their poor in vivo stability and the resulting low plasma concentration which is often below the effective dose. Currently, the poor pharmacokinetic properties of proteins often require daily injections which entail high costs and are a burden to the treated patients. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to increase the in vivo stability of MIA inhibiting peptides and thus to achieve adequate drug levels in plasma. It was attempted to achieve this goal by simple modifications of the molecular structure of the known inhibitors, with the focus on modifications of the peptide backbone. The synthesised peptide mimetics were methylated at the nitrogen atom of the amide bond of the peptide chain, transformed to N-substituted glycines (peptoids), or cyclised in a head-to-tail fashion. Subsequent in vitro tests (HTFP assay, Western Blot analysis) of the derivatives showed that their activity was significantly reduced in comparison to the original compounds. This was attributed to a conformational change of the mimics due to variations in the chemical structure. The results implicate that their conformation differs strongly from the bioactive conformation, thus reducing the potency. As the structural variation of lead compounds is often connected with the risk of losing activity, a second approach was pursued. By applying drug delivery systems the molecular structure can be retained. Furthermore, these devices should ideally release a drug selectively at the site of action over a predetermined period of time. Consequently, a constant plasma concentration might be maintained leading to a reduced frequency of application and overall in an improved therapy. Covalent attachment of polymers like poly(ethylene glycol) is a convenient method to increase the circulation time by reducing the rate of renal and hepatic clearance and metabolic degradation of the drugs. PEGylation of small MIA inhibitors led to highly active compounds, as in vitro tests showed. Future experiments will have to elucidate their pharmacokinetic properties. Sustained release devices are also suitable alternatives to reduce the drug administration frequency. A new formulation of biocompatible triglyceride implants released the incorporated peptide almost completely within 24 hours which provided no improvement over the current application method. For this reason, highly biocompatible PEG hydrogels were applied as slow-releasing matrices. The applicability of hydrogels in sustained release systems is still limited as incorporated compounds are rapidly released. It was observed that the incorporated model peptide was released within five days from PEG hydrogels. In conclusion, first steps to increase the in vivo stability of MIA inhibitors by different approaches have been made within the scope of this thesis. Certainly, many experiments will still be necessary in order to obtain a marketable product for the treatment of malignant melanoma. First steps {{have been made in the}} challenging field of peptide delivery. The knowledge attained in this work contributes significantly to future work of optimising the molecular structure of the drug or the drug carrier system. ...|$|R
