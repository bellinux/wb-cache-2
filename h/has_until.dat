5|$|For a phylum with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores {{have a wide}} range of body plans. Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that {{it is very difficult to}} capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention <b>has</b> <b>until</b> recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E

5|$|At 12:21 PM ET on April 4, Forbes sports {{business}} reporter Darren Heitner tweeted that Hardaway and teammate Burke would declare for the 2013 NBA draft. At 2:23 PM, Heitner tweeted that Hardaway Sr. {{said his}} son was undecided. On April 9 before boarding the airplane to return from the NCAA Final Four, Beilein met with Burke, Hardaway, Robinson and McGary to direct them to seek {{the advice of the}} NBA advisory committee. The draft board <b>has</b> <b>until</b> April 15 to develop each individual report and the players have until April 28 to enter the draft. On April 12, ESPN journalist Myron Medcalf predicted Hardaway would enter the draft noting that the 2014 draft was likely to be wing-heavy. On April 17, Hardaway declared for the NBA draft. Hardaway signed with sports agent Mark Bartelstein, the father of a former Michigan teammate who represents 37 NBA players. Hardaway was one of 60 players invited to the NBA Draft Combine. At the combine, Hardaway strengthened his draft stock with his physical measurements and his athletic results.|$|E

Shanmugam commented that on a cursory examination of the documents without detailed legal advice, he did not see how the documents would make any difference to the ICJ's judgment. On 2 March, Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament that the Singapore legal team has studied Malaysia’s application carefully, including the three documents relied on by Malaysia to support its application, and strongly believes that the documents relied on by Malaysia do not satisfy the criteria under Article 61.

5|$|The game's {{locations}} {{reflect the}} dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena, such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and unexplained noises are present, and, {{for the most}} part, the player has to rely on their lighter and rechargeable flashlight to navigate the darkness. Locations will often have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map or objective marker, leaving the player to try finding their objectives with only a compass. The surface is more lethal than the metro system. Featuring a day-night cycle, and a dynamic weather system, these sections are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times because of the toxic air. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask. These last several minutes each, and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. Players are also tasked to wipe off the dirt and blood splatter that collects on the gas mask. There is no head up display indicator to tell how long the player <b>has</b> <b>until</b> the gas mask's filters begin to fail — rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The watch also serves to indicate to a player {{if they have been}} exposed to enemy attention. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammunition and they have to reload. Instead of head up display the game makes use of audio and visual cues to present information to players.|$|E

Shortly after the war ended, Simone Weil, despite having volunteered for service on the republican side, went on to publish The Iliad or the Poem of Force, a work that {{has been described as a}} pacifist manifesto. In response to the threat of fascism, some pacifist thinkers, such as Richard B. Gregg, devised plans for a campaign of nonviolent resistance in the event of a fascist invasion or takeover.|$|E

25|$|The closest {{relatives}} of gorillas {{are the other}} two Homininae genera, chimpanzees and humans, all of them having diverged from a common ancestor about 7 million years ago. Human gene sequences differ only 1.6% on average from the sequences of corresponding gorilla genes, but there is further difference in how many copies each gene <b>has.</b> <b>Until</b> recently, gorillas {{were considered to be}} a single species, with three subspecies: the western lowland gorilla, the eastern lowland gorilla and the mountain gorilla. There is now agreement that there are two species, each with two subspecies. More recently, a third subspecies has been claimed to exist in one of the species. The separate species and subspecies developed from a single type of gorilla during the Ice Age, when their forest habitats shrank and became isolated from each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{arthropod}} head problem <b>has</b> <b>until</b> {{recently been}} {{predicated on the}} Articulata theory, i.e. that the arthropods and annelids are close relatives. Although arthropods are essentially direct developers that do not possess a trochophore-like larva, the annelids do. During annelid metamorphosis, segments are added close to the posterior of the body, behind the mouth; whereas the brain {{is derived from the}} episphere or region in front of the mouth. Recognition of this led to the concept of a primary, non-segmental component of the body in annelids known as the acron being developed, from which the brain is ultimately derived. Because the arthropod and annelid heads, {{in the light of the}} Articulata theory, were assumed to be structurally homologous in some way, the arthropod head was also often considered to incorporate a non-segmental acronal component. Taking the homology between annelid and arthropod heads at face value, Swedish workers such as Hanström and Holmgren assumed that a large part of the arthropod head must correspond to the acron, a view followed later by several prominent American insect workers such as Butt and Snodgrass. They proposed that all pre-oral structures in insects were non-segmental, although such a view is at odds with the preoral position of apparently bona fide appendages such as the antennae. A less extreme set of theories propose that only the protocerebrum and associated structures should be considered to be acronal.|$|E

Several sources regarded him as a likely first round draft choice in the NBA Draft, so there was much speculation about him entering his name into the draft. On April 18, he and Robinson held a joint press conference to announce that they would not enter the draft.

500|$|The {{main event}} was contested inside a 16foot (4.9m) high steel {{structure}} with six sides—known as Six Sides of Steel; {{to win a}} wrestler must either gain a pinfall or submission, with the losing team disbanding. [...] Participants in the main event included the tag team pairings of America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) and Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper). The storyline build to this match on September 8 at TNA's last weekly PPV event (#110). During this event, Harris replaced an injured Daniels and teamed with Skipper to defeat The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens) for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Harris and Skipper then proceeded to lose the championship to Storm and Daniels on the September 24 episode of TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!. After Storm and Daniels lost the championship to Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young) on the October 15 episode of Impact!, tensions between the teams during the respective title reigns gave way to an official rivalry between America's Most Wanted and Triple X. The teams fought {{against each other in}} an Elimination Last Team Standing match at TNA's previous and first monthly three-hour PPV event, Victory Road. In an Elimination Last Man Standing match, a series of events must take place to eliminate a participant. First, a wrestler must be pinned, and then the pinned wrestler <b>has</b> <b>until</b> the referee's count of ten to reach their feet before they are officially eliminated from the match. The first two members of a team to be eliminated lose the contest; America's Most Wanted was victorious in the Elimination Last Man Standing match at Victory Road. On the November 19 episode of Impact!, Daniels insinuated that the two teams were scheduled for a Six Sides of Steel cage match at Turning Point. Later in the episode, newly appointed authority figure Dusty Rhodes announced that the match was indeed scheduled, with the added stipulation that the losing team would have to disband and never team together again in TNA under any circumstances.|$|E
