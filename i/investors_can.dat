5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - <b>investors</b> <b>can</b> readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected to}} hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{benefit of}} an ETF is the stock-like features offered. A mutual fund is bought or {{sold at the}} end of a day's trading, whereas ETFs can be traded whenever the market is open. Since ETFs trade on the market, <b>investors</b> <b>can</b> carry out the same types of trades that they can with a stock. For instance, <b>investors</b> <b>can</b> sell short, use a limit order, use a stop-loss order, buy on margin, and invest as much or as little money as they wish (there is no minimum investment requirement). Also, many ETFs have the capability for options (puts and calls) to be written against them. Covered call strategies allow investors and traders to potentially increase their returns on their ETF purchases by collecting premiums (the proceeds of a call sale or write) on calls written against them. Mutual funds do not offer those features.|$|E
25|$|ETF shares {{can be sold}} in {{basically}} two ways. The <b>investors</b> <b>can</b> {{sell the}} individual shares to other investors, or they can sell the Creation Units back to the ETF. In addition, ETFs generally redeem Creation Units by giving investors the securities that comprise the portfolio instead of cash. Because of the limited redeemability of ETF shares, ETFs are {{not considered to be}} and may not call themselves mutual funds.|$|E

Critics state that using an average annual return rate is misleading and that the compound annual growth rate is a better measurement when planning investments.

According to the Motley Fool, following Ramsey's calculations could cause individuals to be seriously under-invested for retirement.|$|E
25|$|When a {{security}} is sold, the seller is contractually obliged {{to deliver it}} to the buyer. If a seller sells {{a security}} short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation. Otherwise, the seller fails to deliver, the transaction does not settle, and the seller {{may be subject to}} a claim from its counterparty. Certain large holders of securities, such as a custodian or investment management firm, often lend out these securities to gain extra income, a process known as securities lending. The lender receives a fee for this service. Similarly, retail <b>investors</b> <b>can</b> sometimes make an extra fee when their broker wants to borrow their securities. This is only possible when the investor has full title of the security, so it cannot be used as collateral for margin buying.|$|E

2500|$|An {{investor}} {{can reduce}} portfolio risk simply by holding combinations of instruments {{that are not}} perfectly positively correlated (correlation coefficient [...] ). In other words, <b>investors</b> <b>can</b> reduce their exposure to individual asset risk by holding a diversified portfolio of assets.

40|$|There {{is a large}} {{academic}} literature on the principal-agent problem in financial contracting. 1 This literature focuses on the conflicts of interest between an agent, who is an entrepreneur with a venture that needs financing, and a principal, who is the investor providing the funds for the venture. Theory has {{identified a number of}} ways that the <b>investor</b> / principal <b>can</b> mitigate these conflicts. First, the <b>investor</b> <b>can</b> structure financial contracts, i. e. the allocation of cash flow and control rights, between the entrepreneur and investor to provide incentives for the entrepreneur to behave optimally. Second, the <b>investor</b> <b>can</b> engage in information collection before deciding whether to invest, in order to screen out ex ante unprofitable projects and bad entrepreneurs. And third, the <b>investor</b> <b>can</b> engage in information collection and monitoring once the project is under way.
