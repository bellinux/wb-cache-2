25|$|An {{incandescent}} light bulb, incandescent lamp or {{incandescent light}} globe is an electric light {{with a wire}} filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light (incandescence). The filament, heated by passing an electric current through it, is protected from oxidation with a glass or fused quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by <b>feed-through</b> terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.|$|E
50|$|Rectangular frame shaped preforms {{are often}} {{required}} {{for the construction of}} electronic packages while washer shaped brazing preforms are typically utilized to attach lead wires and hermetic <b>feed-throughs</b> to electronic circuits and packages.

It consists of selecting of the materials, draft {{of shapes and}} calculations of <b>feed-throughs</b> for the source container to ensure the required electromagnetic characteristics.

30|$|The chamber {{contains}} {{a variety of}} electrical/optical <b>feed-throughs,</b> viewports and vacuum measurement gauges, {{as well as other}} instruments. A sample holder was fitted with 3 D stages so that different samples could be analysed without the need for opening the chamber in between sample analyses. As the majority of planetary instruments will include CCDs as detectors (e.g., for ExoMars Cameras, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and Raman laser spectrometer (RLS instrument), the MASC was fitted with a separate cooling circuit for the CCD of the space instrument.|$|R

50|$|Passive <b>feed-through</b> nulling is {{not used}} with CW radar {{altimeters}} because this eliminates the ground-bounce signal.|$|E

50|$|Dry {{dilution}} refrigerators generally follow {{one of two}} designs. One design incorporates {{an inner}} vacuum can, {{which is used to}} initially precool the machine from room temperature down to the base temperature of the pulse tube cooler (using heat-exchange gas). However, every time the refrigerator is cooled down, a vacuum seal that holds at cryogenic temperatures needs to be made, and low temperature vacuum <b>feed-throughs</b> must be used for the experimental wiring. The other design is more demanding to realize, requiring heat switches that are necessary for precooling, but no inner vacuum can is needed, greatly reducing the complexity of the experimental wiring. The latter type is used for the SCUBA-2 sub-millimetre camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.|$|R
40|$|Work {{continued}} {{on the development}} of the high-pressure helium-cooled design for the PULSAR reactor study. It was found that the high pressure helium-cooled solid breeder design may be able to breed adequate tritium without the use of Be as the neutron multiplier. Thermal-hydraulic results also indicate that the ARIES-IV shield can be used as the thermal storage component, while keeping outlet coolant temperature constant during the dwell time of about 2 minutes. During this period, two TE{sub 22, 6 } mode generators were fabricated and a report on the testing of the RF vacuum <b>feed-throughs</b> were written. Also, the DiMES sample chamber was operated in a piggyback mode and different samples were exposed to the DIII-D plasma during dedicated physics experiments...|$|R
40|$|Metallic rooms {{as part of}} {{a complex}} system, like a ship, are {{necessarily}} connected electromagnetically via apertures and cables to the outside. Therefore, their electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (SE) is limited by ventilation openings, cable <b>feed-throughs</b> and door gaps. Thus, electronic equipment inside these rooms is susceptible to outer electromagnetic threats like IEM (Intentional Electromagnetic Interference). Dielectric or magnetic absorber inside such a screened room can be used in order to prevent the SE from collapsing at the resonant frequencies. In this contribution, the effect of different available absorber materials is compared, as well as other properties like weight and workability. Furthermore, parameter variations of the absorber as well as the effect of loading in form of metallic and dielectric structures on the SE are analyzed...|$|R

50|$|The {{band-pass filter}} {{used with a}} {{microwave}} receiver is typically 1 MHz. The band-stop filter used as a <b>feed-through</b> nuller is typically 1kHz, which attenuates signals {{in the center of}} the band-pass filter.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} using a laser as the heat source to drive a hermetic joining process based on a glass frit intermediate layer. The laser allows the necessary heat energy to be provided in a localized manner; important either {{as part of a}} multistage process, or to allow thermally-sensitive materials to be used inside the package. Our study includes an investigation of the impact of rough and grooved surfaces on the hermeticity and strength of the join, demonstrating the robust nature of the process, and its ability to allow <b>feed-throughs</b> to the center of package. Hermetic sealing is demonstrated, with leak rates of 10 - 9 mbar 1 s- 1, satisfying the military standard MIL-STD- 883 G...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel concept of the general {{connectivity}} among cells. While conventional concept considers direct connections only, the new concept considers both the direct and indirect connections among cells leading to a model capturing a more precise relationship among cells. Based on the model, a new parallel clustering approach is proposed and analyzed. Another new concept of the stable cluster is introduced to improve the clustering result. In conjunction with the clustering process, an investigatory procedure which back tracks the cluster development process to check if all clusters are stable is also developed. Initial test runs, using the new clustering approach for placement, yield an encouraging 21. 6 % reduction {{on the number of}} <b>feed-throughs</b> in a complex ASIC design...|$|R
40|$|The photo shows one of {{the four}} bending magnets of LEAR. They were of C-type with the opening ('mouth') to the outside of the ring (yoke to the inside). Last {{preparations}} are made before the vacuum chamber is slid through the mouth into the magnet. Stochastic cooling pickups/kickers were installed inside the chamber. One can distinguish a large number of <b>feed-throughs</b> on the chamber (leading to the pickup/kicker gaps). The free space {{in the middle of the}} block was left to offer room for an internal target in the magnet. This possibility was never exploited. Instead it is used here, to accommodate a pumping port for the high vacuum system. Michel Chanel (left) and Pierre Lefevre admire the mechanics at work...|$|R
50|$|<b>Feed-through</b> null is {{typically}} required to eliminate bleed-through between the {{transmitter and receiver}} to increase sensitivity in practical systems.

30|$|The sensors on {{the left}} cooling plate front and {{the middle of the}} chamber were {{directly}} cooled by the Freon passing through the cooling pipe and cooling screen. Consequently, these sensors recorded the lowest temperature of[*]~[*] 244 and 248  K respectively. In contrast, due to the open structure of the 3 D linear stages, there was relatively poor thermal conductivity between the cooling plate and the sample tray. Thermal straps were included in the design but better thermal conduction is needed to reduce the sample tray below[*]~[*] 250  K. The temperature {{on the left}} door only reached[*]~[*] 285  K, because local heaters maintain the electrical <b>feed-throughs</b> at 293  K. Therefore an aluminium cover was designed to insulate the inside of the MASC from thermal radiation of the doors.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{conceptual}} design for an active neutron veto, based on boron-loaded liquid scintillator, {{for use in}} direct-detection dark matter experiments. The simulated efficiency of a 1 meter thick veto, after including the effects of neutron captures in the inner detector and inefficiencies due to <b>feed-throughs</b> into the veto, is greater than 99. 5 % for background events produced by radiogenic neutrons, while the background due to externally produced cosmogenic neutrons is reduced by more than 95 %. The ability of the veto to both significantly suppress, and provide in situ measurements of, these two dominant sources of background would make {{the next generation of}} dark matter experiments much more robust, and dramatically improve the credibility of a dark matter detection claim based on the observation of a few recoil events. The veto would also allow direct extrapolation between the background-free operation of a small detector and the physics reach of a larger detector of similar construction.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of the}} STAR project is to test and space qualify a new continuous cycle cryogenic refrigeration system for cooling of sensors and electronics which {{is based upon the}} newly discovered thermoacoustic heat pumping effect. The new refrigerator has no sliding seals, a cycle frequency of about 300 hz, and uses acoustic resonance to enhance the overall power density and efficiency. This thesis is concerned specifically with the design and testing of the electrodynamic transducer which is responsible for the electro-acoustic power conversion. A computer model of the driver/resonator system is presented along with the techniques for measurement of the electrical and mechanical parameters used as input for the model.

40|$|Above {{a certain}} current level, {{the use of}} a superconducting {{rectifier}} as a cryogenic current source offers advantages compared to {{the use of a}} power supply at room temperature which requires large current <b>feed-throughs</b> into the cryostat. In some cases, the power of such a rectifier is immaterial, for example {{if it is to be}} used as a current supply for short test samples with low inductances. Usually, however, a rectifier is intended to energize large superconducting magnets, so the maximum power available becomes an important parameter since it determines the loading time. One method of increasing the power of a rectifier is to raise the operating frequency. In this respect, magnetically controlled switches with very fast switching times are preferable to thermally controlled ones. This paper reports on the design, as well as the experimental results of a magnetically switched full-wave superconducting rectifier. Once this rectifier is brought to its design frequency of 5 Hz, the average power delivered to the cryogenic load will be 500 W...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss a new method of signal {{read-out}} from photon detectors in ultra-large, underground liquid argon time projection chambers. In this design, the {{signal from the}} light collection system is coupled via capacitive plates to the TPC wire-planes. This signal is then read out using the same cabling and electronics as the charge information. This greatly benefits light collection: it {{eliminates the need for}} an independent readout, substantially reducing cost; it reduces the number of cables in the vapor region of the TPC that can produce impurities; and it cuts down on the number of <b>feed-throughs</b> in the cryostat wall that can cause heat-leaks and potential points of failure. We present experimental results that demonstrate the sensitivity of a LArTPC wire plane to photon detector signals. We also simulate the effect of a 1 μs shaping time and a 2 MHz sampling rate on these signals in the presence of noise, and find that a single photoelectron timing resolution of ~ 30 ns can be achieved.

40|$|A {{document}} {{proposes that}} future spacecraft for planetary and space exploration {{be designed to}} enable reuse of drained propellant tanks for occupancy by humans. This proposal would enable utilization of volume and mass {{that would otherwise be}} unavailable and, in some cases, discarded. Such utilization could enable reductions in cost, initial launch mass, and number of launches needed to build up a habitable outpost in orbit about, or on the surface of, a planet or moon. According to the proposal, the large propellant tanks of a spacecraft would be configured to enable crews to gain access to their interiors. The spacecraft would incorporate hatchways, between a tank and the crew volume, that would remain sealed while the tank contained propellant and could be opened after the tank was purged by venting to outer space and then refilled with air. The interior of the tank would be pre-fitted with some habitation fixtures that were compatible with the propellant environment. Electrical <b>feed-throughs,</b> used originally for gauging propellants, could be reused to supply electric power to equipment installed in the newly occupied space. After a small amount of work, the tank would be ready for long-term use as a habitation module...|$|R
