2500|$|However, only {{a limited}} number of people can bring claims for {{judicial}} review. Under TFEU article 263(2), a member state, the Parliament, Council or Commission have automatic rights to seek judicial review. But under article 263(4) a [...] "natural or legal person" [...] must have a [...] "direct and individual concern" [...] about the regulatory act. [...] "Direct" [...] concern means that someone is affected by an EU act without [...] "the interposition of an autonomous will between the decision and its effect", for instance by a national government body. In Piraiki-Patraiki v Commission, a group of Greek textile businesses, who exported cotton products to France, challenged a Commission decision allow France to limit exports. The Commission argued that the exporters were not directly concerned, because France might decide not to limit exports, but the Court of Justice held this possibility was [...] "entirely theoretical". A challenge could be brought. By contrast in Municipality of Differdange v Commission a municipality wanted to challenge the Commissions decision to aid steel firms which reduced production: this would probably reduce its tax collections. But the Court of Justice held that because Luxembourg had discretion, and its decision to reduce capacity was not inevitable, the municipality had no [...] "direct" [...] concern (its complaint was with the Luxembourg government instead). [...] "Individual" [...] concern requires that someone is affected specifically, not as a member of a group. In Plaumann & Co v Commission the Court of Justice held that a clementine importer was not individually concerned when the Commission refused permission to Germany to stop import custom duties. This kept it more expensive for Mr Plaumann to import clementines, but it was equally expensive for everyone else. This decision heavily restricted the number of people who could claim for judicial review. In Unión de Pequeños Agricultores, Advocate General Jacobs propose a broader test of allowing anyone to claim if there was a [...] "substantial adverse effect" [...] on the claimant's interests. Here, a group of Spanish olive oil producers challenged Council Regulation No 1638/98, which withdrew subsidies. Because Regulations are not implemented in national law, but have direct effect, they argued the requirement for individual concern would deny them effective <b>judicial</b> <b>protection.</b> The Court of Justice held that direct actions were still not allowed: if this was unsatisfactory the member states would have to change the treaties. Individual concern is not needed, however under article 263(4), if an act is not legislation, but just a [...] "regulatory act". In Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami v Parliament and Council the Court of Justice affirmed that a Regulation does not count as a [...] "regulatory act" [...] within the Treaty's meaning: it is only meant for acts of lesser importance. Here, a Canadian group representing the Inuit people wished to challenge a Regulation on seal products, but were not allowed. They would have to show both direct and individual concern as normal. Thus, without a treaty change, EU administrative law remains one of the most restrictive in Europe.|$|E

40|$|In this article, we {{test the}} extent to which {{decisions}} by the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court (ECC) are predicted by non-legal variables. Our theoretical argument proposes that not only the presence of public actors as plaintiffs—especially those working for the executive branch—but also political salience, i. e., the degree of importance attributed to a case by the government and public opinion, plays a crucial role in explaining the outcome of judicial decisions. Original data on all abstract review decisions issued by the ECC (2008 – 2016) is used to test our argument. We control for possible selection effects, incorporating a novel measure of the overall quality of argumentation and strength of cases brought before the ECC by both public and private parties, {{in the form of an}} expert survey. Consistent with our argument, the results show that even when controlling for a wide range of potential confounders, norms are more likely to be struck down by the ECC when (1) public officials claim unconstitutionality than when non-public parties do, and (2) cases are reported by media. In the light of the Ecuadorian case, we conclude that the formally powerful ECC is quite sensitive to governmental influence, even under an improved situation of de jure <b>judicial</b> <b>protections...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} over forty years since the Supreme Court {{declared}} a class suspect under the Equal Protection Clause. In that time, the Court has denied suspect-class status-and the special <b>judicial</b> <b>protections</b> associated with it- to the elderly, the disabled, and the poor, and it has avoided suspect-class determinations when addressing laws that discriminate against members of the LGBTQ community. Administrative agencies, however, have stepped in to provide marginalized groups with some protections through their interpretation of civil rights laws. The Court has shown hostility to those agency interpretations, often in opaque decisions that seem to rest on principles of judicial supremacy as much as substantive constitutional principles. This Article argues that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s hostility to agencies 2 ̆ 7 role {{in this area is}} misguided. Courts should defer to administrative agencies when they protect suspect classes on the basis of reasonable interpretations of civil rights statutes. The principle of judicial supremacy is not relevant: the Court 2 ̆ 7 s abandonment of suspect classes appears driven by the Justices 2 ̆ 7 concern that the judiciary is intervening too much into the political process rather than a genuine belief that the groups in question do not qualify for suspect status. Given that this court-centered institutional concern does not apply to agencies, it is entirely appropriate for administrative officials to step in to fill the gap in protecting vulnerable minorities. Further, agencies are better positioned than other institutions to calibrate the protection of groups according to the societal context and the need for intervention...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{identifies}} a market-based {{solution for}} monitoring large-scale litigation proceeding outside of Rule 23 ’s safeguards. Although class actions dominate the scholarly discussion of mass litigation, the ever increasing restrictions on certifying a class mean that plaintiffs’ lawyers routinely rely on aggregate, multidistrict litigation {{to seek redress}} for group-wide harms. Despite sharing key features with its class action counterpart—such as attenuated attorney-client relationships, attorneyclient conflicts of interest, and high agency costs—no monitor exists in aggregate litigation. Informal group litigation not only lacks Rule 23 ’s <b>judicial</b> <b>protections</b> against attorney overreaching and self-dealing, but plaintiff’s themselves cannot adequately supervise their attorneys’ behavior. Plaintiffs’ attorneys may represent thousands of geographically dispersed clients, which fosters collective-action problems and makes individual, case-specific information hard to obtain. An answer to this monitoring problem comes from an unlikely and potentially controversial source: alternative litigation financing. Self-dealing and high agency costs arise in aggregate litigation principally because of the contingent-fee attorney’s dual roles as agent and investor. These roles can pull lawyers in divergent directions; because attorneys front massive litigation costs, they {{may be tempted to}} coerce clients into settling so that they can recoup and profit from their investment. Third-party litigation financing, which involves hedge funds, private investors, and venture capitalists investing in and profiting from large-scale litigation, can ameliorate this critical conflict of interest by allowing the financier to bear the financial risk. Shorn of financial self-interest, the lawyer is then free to act as a faithful agent. Although alternative litigation financing can be controversial, this Article seeks to marry profit-seeking capitalists and aggregate litigation in a way that benefits society as a whole and plaintiffs in particular...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the possibilities for}} the justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights in the Constitution of Bangladesh. Economic social and cultural rights {{are part of the}} “fundamental principles of state policy” which are recognized in Part II of the Bangladeshi Constitution. Article 8 (2) of the Constitution explicitly states that those principles are judicially unenforceable. At the international level, human rights were formally split into two different covenants in 1966 : the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). The latter, unlike the former, contained no enforcement mechanism. This differential treatment of the economic, social and cultural rights reflected the traditional assumption that economic social and cultural rights were not capable of judicial enforcement. Those assumptions were later reflected in the Bangladeshi Constitution. This thesis critiques the main objections to the justiciability of economic social and cultural rights in the light of contemporary developments in the international human rights regime, regional human rights systems and different domestic jurisdictions. It is posited that economic social and cultural rights have evolved so that their justiciability is now generally accepted. Indeed, the ICESCR (to which Bangladesh is a party) now casts an obligation on States Parties to make them justiciable in their domestic jurisdictions. The thesis {{examines the}} substantive constitutional provisions and the relevant case law, and argues that there is in fact enough scope to judicially enforce economic, social and cultural rights contained in the Constitution of Bangladesh, despite the bar of article 8 (2). In this respect, comparative case law in India will also be examined, as India has similar constitutional provisions. Such new interpretations of the Bangladeshi Constitution, if adopted by Bangladesh’s courts, will act as guidelines for the development of <b>judicial</b> <b>protections</b> for economic, social and cultural rights at the municipal level in Bangladesh. Such a reformulation of constitutional law will also facilitate the fulfillment of Bangladesh’s obligations under the ICESCR, and the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by its people...|$|R
