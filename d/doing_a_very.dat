500|$|Laura Elston {{from the}} {{magazine}} Canada wrote that The Lives of a Bengal Lancer did [...] "more glory to the British traditions than the British would dare {{to do for}} themselves." [...] In response to the film success, Frederick Herron of the Motion Picture Association of America wrote [...] "Hollywood is <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good work in selling the British Empire to the world." [...] Historian John Reid noted in his book Award-Winning Films of the 1930s that the film is considered [...] "one of the greatest adventure films of all time" [...] and highly praised Hathaway's work by saying [...] "the film really made his reputation." [...] It also received a praised review in Boys' Life magazine, starting off the review with the words [...] "You will be immensely pleased with The Lives of a Bengal lancer" [...] {{and went on to}} compare the style and class of the three main characters to that of The Three Musketeers. The film holds an overall approval rating of 100% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 9 reviews, with a rating average of 8 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN called [...] "The Dark Defender" [...] "a very {{satisfying}} {{episode of the}} show" [...] and thought that [...] "so far [...] <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good job" [...] of replicating the tension seen in the first season. He was impressed by Dexter's discoveries about his birth mother and adoptive father, but called Debra's romance with Gabriel a [...] "less successful" [...] storyline. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Tom O'Neil called the episode a [...] "standout" [...] because of the parts of Dexter's past that it explored. He stated that, for regular viewers, [...] "this episode is a real knockout", but for unfamiliar viewers, [...] "this whole Dark Defender bit might look pretty corny". TV Squad's Keith McDuffee believed the revelation of Laura's affair with Harry to be [...] "certainly the most shocking moment of the episode", and thought that [...] "One of the brilliant moments of the season so far was Dexter going after one of his mom's killers." [...] Paula Paige of TV Guide called Dexter's monologue about his hollowness [...] "very moving". She thought that his confrontation with his mother's killer [...] "may {{have been one of}} the best shot [...] in the whole series". Blogcritics Ray Ellis praised the [...] "razor-sharp sense of humor" [...] seen in the episode and thought that [...] "In a season of mostly dreary, bland series, Dexter remains the most daring show on television." [...] Dexter and Jimenez's confrontation was named Hall's best scene by Variety critic Stuart Levine.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. [...] She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide what they can really do. [...] They are athletes {{who want to be}} in a class [...] that is more advantageous to for them. [...] In testing and classification they don't show what they can really do. [...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult. [...] In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: that is certainly the future that we are all looking to." ...|$|E

2500|$|Blache was {{introduced}} to the idea of painting Leah Chase by his art representative at the time Eugene C. Daymude in the summer of 2009. The 20 small oil paintings that comprised the series detailed the day-to-day activities 92-year-old Chef Leah Chase encounters from early morning prep work to greeting guests in the dining room. [...] Blache was heralded for his depiction of the culinary icon for his accuracy and delicate handling of paint, color, and texture. [...] “Asked whether she thought the rendering was accurate, Chase, 89, said the young artist had gotten it right. [...] “I told him, ‘You could have made me look like Halle Berry or Lena Horne, but you made it look like me,’” she said. [...] The painting Cutting Squash was acquired for its permanent collection by the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in 2011. [...] “We are always looking for portraits of nationally prominent figures,” National Portrait Gallery chief curator Brandon Fortune said. [...] “It is a very interesting image of a woman at work, <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> simple task, cutting squash,” [...] [...] [...] “But in some ways it transcends the everyday and becomes something of national significance.” [...] This series reinforces Blache's commitment to documenting everyday labor and showcasing these intimate processes to the public. [...] Another one of the Smithsonian Institution Museums, National Museum of African History and Culture, came calling for another painting of Chase from the Blache series in 2013 and acquired Leah Red Coat Stirring (Sketch) in 2013, making it the third painting from Blache {{to be included in the}} permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
