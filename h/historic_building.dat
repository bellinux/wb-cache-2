Recently, preservation concepts for <b>historic</b> <b>buildings</b> have become more important, while the meaning of common memory space for people living and growing-up is well aware in the world. Because ownership for <b>historic</b> <b>buildings</b> gets more private, people feel their <b>historic</b> <b>buildings</b> rights had deprived.

The objective of the paper is to define a methodology for <b>historic</b> <b>buildings</b> restoration {{in order to increase}} energy efficiency and re-usability in accordance with modern standards. The main method used in the paper is the observation of <b>historic</b> <b>buildings</b> during their restoration and exploitation, analysis and evaluation of achieved results regarding energy efficiency and energy saving, through the examples of the buildings belonging to Hilandar Monastery, Mount Athos, in Greece. Mount Athos was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for its cultural and natural values. This case study discusses the abandoned and dilapidated <b>historic</b> <b>buildings</b> of the Haybarn Complex (Stable, Mulekeepers’ House and Haybarn), the achieved results regarding the restoration of these buildings, their energy efficiency and turning into the premises for occasional stays.

The architectural scores that punctuate the sequence of the altar and the composition of the whole, however, are unrelated to Cairano's style.

In the mid-19th century the European powers forcibly opened China to foreign trade. The Divine Word Missionaries built a church in the Jiaozhou Bay concession in Shandong in 1902, and in 1934 erected the cathedral, which remained nominally under their administration until 1964. In 1942 it came under the control of the Japanese Army, returning to Chinese control when the Japanese left Qingdao in 1945. In the early 1950s, all foreign missionaries, including the Bishop of Qingdao, were either imprisoned or expelled from China, and during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) the cathedral was defaced and abandoned. In 1981, it was repaired by the government and reopened for services, and in 1992 it was listed as a Provincial <b>Historic</b> <b>Building</b> by the government of Shandong Province.|$|E

40|$|Magister Artium - MAThe mini-thesis {{will examine}} the {{conservation}} of colonial <b>historic</b> <b>buildings</b> at Old Umtali (today Mutare) in Zimbabwe and {{the changes that have}} affected the buildings in terms of use and maintenance of their architectural character. There has been a shift in heritage management priorities in Zimbabwe and all heritage linked to colonialism has been supplanted by archaeological and liberation war heritage. The result is that the category of colonial heritage which includes <b>historic</b> <b>buildings,</b> forts and memorials have been neglected and vandalised. Various international frameworks in the conservation of buildings will be referred to in this research in examining related questions of urban heritage management. The dichotomy that exists between conservation and adaptive reuse of <b>historic</b> <b>buildings</b> as these issues have unfolded at Old Umtali, a former colonial town with <b>historic</b> <b>buildings</b> constructed in 1891 will be at the centre of this interrogation. Notwithstanding the changes in heritage management priorities in Zimbabwe, the irony is that heritage practitioners are still obliged to conserve <b>historic</b> <b>buildings</b> by legislation. This work then attempts to place back the question of conserving <b>historic</b> <b>buildings</b> on the conservation agenda for a post-colonial Zimbabwe. I argue that <b>historic</b> <b>buildings</b> should be conserved and used for different contemporary purposes {{and at the same time}} becoming the subject of interpretative work. Questions can then be asked about the experience of colonialism and the various movements of the Pioneer Column in Zimbabwe using the case study of Old Umtali. In this thesis conservation of <b>historic</b> <b>buildings</b> is not just a technical question but is also seen as an intellectual, epistemological and political question...|$|R
