5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving {{drinking and driving}} and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria can {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases {{can be grown}} in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when {{it may be difficult to}} acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|Most TBI {{that results}} from blunt trauma occurs within the chest. The most common {{tracheal}} injury is a tear near the carina or in the membranous wall of the trachea. In blunt chest trauma, TBI occurs within 2.5cm of the carina 40–80% of the time. The injury {{is more common in}} the right main bronchus than the left, possibly because the former is near vertebrae, which may injure it. Also, the aorta and other tissues in the mid chest that surround the left main bronchus may protect it. Another possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> with left main bronchus injuries are more likely to also have other deadly injuries and therefore die before reaching hospital, making them less likely to be included in studies that determine rates of injuries.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} accepted model of {{migration to the}} New World <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>peoples</b> from Asia crossed the Bering land bridge to the Americas some 16,500 years ago.|$|R
5000|$|The APPD {{propagated}} {{the idea}} of a [...] "youth pension", to replace the existing old-age pension. The idea <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> should enjoy life first, and work later.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{from another}} interview, Lorna says warmly: [...] "I think {{what my mother}} loved most of all <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> wanted to hear her sing... and they always will." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{ownership}} principle <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> are stewards, not owners, {{of their}} possessions. Gothard teaches that anger results from not yielding personal rights to God.|$|E
25|$|Hungry Ghosts is a Chinese {{concept that}} differs from ghosts in Chinese tradition, {{it does not}} relate to buddhism. Traditional belief <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> become ghosts when they die.|$|E
25|$|Sebeolsik Noshift is {{a variant}} of sebeolsik {{which can be used}} without {{pressing}} the shift key. Its advantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> with disabilities who cannot press two keys at the same time will still be able to use it to type in Hangul.|$|E
5000|$|The ongoing punchline of {{the show}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> meeting Szysznyk {{for the first time}} almost {{invariably}} mispronounced his surname. In one episode, a narcotics detective called him [...] "Sneeze-wick".|$|R
60|$|Shelton {{stared at}} the rose; he had {{suddenly}} realised why it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> take more interest in roses than in human beings--one could {{do it with a}} quiet heart.|$|R
25|$|Other {{arguments}} for starting therapy earlier <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who start therapy later {{have been shown}} to have less recovery of their immune systems, and higher CD4 counts are associated with less cancer.|$|R
25|$|Advice in China <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> stung {{more than}} 10 times need medical help, and need {{emergency}} treatment {{for more than}} 30 stings. The stings can cause kidney failure. Stings by Asian giant hornets killed 41 people and injured more than 1,600 people in Shaanxi, China, in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Another theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{who have}} {{recovered}} from polio lose remaining healthy neurons {{at a faster}} rate than normal. However, little evidence exists to support this idea. Finally, it has been proposed that the initial polio infection causes an autoimmune reaction, in which the body's immune system attacks normal cells as if they were foreign substances. Again, compared to neural fatigue, the evidence supporting this theory is quite limited.|$|E
25|$|A Parpolity or Participatory Polity is a {{theoretical}} form of democracy that is {{ruled by a}} Nested Council structure. The guiding philosophy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> should have decision making power in proportion to how much they {{are affected by the}} decision. Local councils of 25–50 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them, and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council.|$|E
50|$|The {{reasons for}} the small {{population}} may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> migrated from the village {{because there are no}} industries set up, no minerals to extract, and poor soils for both pastoral and arable farming.|$|R
5000|$|In 1919 {{the results}} of King-Crane Commission <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> of [...] "Syria" [...] (all lands from Cilicia to Gaza inclusively) wanted {{foremost}} a united Syria (but federal with autonomy) for the whole region.|$|R
5000|$|... “Once {{it used to}} <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{and rights}} went by dignities geþyncðo, and councillors of the people were then {{entitled}} to honour, each according to his rank, whether noble eorl or ceorl, retainer or lord.” ...|$|R
25|$|The {{patient may}} want to {{consider}} some basic preparation before the surgery. The most basic preparation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who have body hair on the chest {{may want to}} remove the hair by clipping just prior to surgery or using a depilatory agent (preoperative shaving has been on the decline as it can cause skin breakage and increase infection risk of any surgical procedure) as the surgery will involve bandages and monitoring equipment to be affixed to the body.|$|E
25|$|The second {{component}} of strong reciprocity <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{are willing to}} punish those who fail to cooperate, even when punishment is costly. There {{are two types of}} punishment: second party and third party punishment. In second party punishment, the person who was hurt by the other parties' failure to cooperate has the opportunity to punish the non-cooperator. In third party punishment, an uninvolved third party has the opportunity to punish the non-cooperator.|$|E
25|$|Type not trait: The MBTI sorts for type; it {{does not}} {{indicate}} the strength of ability. It allows the clarity of a preference to be ascertained (Bill clearly prefers introversion), but not the strength of preference (Jane strongly prefers extraversion) or degree of aptitude (Harry is good at thinking). In this sense, it differs from trait-based tools such as 16PF. Type preferences are polar opposites: a precept of MBTI <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> fundamentally prefer one thing over the other, not a bit of both.|$|E
50|$|It <b>is</b> {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>people</b> first {{settled in}} Rosmuc in 400, {{one hundred years}} before Naomh Briocán (Saint Briocán) brought Christianity to the area. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> to say <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> have <b>been</b> in Rosmuc for one thousand five hundred years.|$|R
50|$|In {{experiments}} that test how workers respond when {{the meaning of}} their task is diminished, the test condition {{is referred to as}} the Sisyphusian condition. The two main conclusions of the experiment <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> work harder when their work seems more meaningful, and <b>that</b> <b>people</b> underestimate the relationship between meaning and motivation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fundamentals}} of ROT <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> obliged by reason to accept information <b>that</b> <b>is</b> congruent with their currently held self views and reject information <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not. The theory challenges a self-verification motive, stating <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{do not want}} to self-verify, they simply convey, through behaviour, cognitions that accurately and honestly reflect their own self views.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} on {{the perception of}} our own behavior. Daryl Bem's (1972) self-perception theory claims that when internal cues are difficult to interpret, people gain self-insight by observing their own behavior. Leon Festinger's 1954 social comparison theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their own ability or opinions. There is also the facial feedback hypothesis: that changes in facial expression can lead to corresponding changes in emotion.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of the optimistic bias <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> know more about themselves than they do about others. While individuals know how to think about themselves as a single person, they still think of others as a generalized group, which leads to biased estimates and inabilities to sufficiently understand their target or comparison group. Likewise, when making judgments and comparisons about their risk compared to others, people generally ignore the average person, but primarily focus on their own feelings and experiences.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} often {{repeated}} myths <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> found guilty of witchcraft were rolled down Slieau Whallian, a hill near St John's, in a barrel. However this is a 19th-century legend {{which in turn is}} a Scottish legend which in turn is a German legend. It never happened. Separately, a witchcraft museum was opened at the Witches Mill, Castletown in 1951. There has never actually been a witches' coven on that site; the myth was only created {{with the opening of the}} museum.|$|E
60|$|The one {{outstanding}} fact <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> {{buying a}} lot of things they had no use for, merely because they felt they were getting them cheaply and that their money would be devoted to a good cause.|$|R
5000|$|There <b>are</b> more <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{interested}} in others than there <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> interesting to others.|$|R
25|$|Public {{goods are}} goods which are undersupplied {{in a typical}} market. The {{defining}} features <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> can consume public goods without having {{to pay for them}} and that more than one person can consume the good at the same time.|$|R
25|$|A popular notion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{might not}} share {{extremely}} intense emotional events {{because they are}} simply inexpressible. Along with this idea, psychologists initially hypothesized that the extreme nature of such experiences would {{play an important role}} in determining whether an emotional event is shared or not. Additionally, they thought that people would be motivated not to deliberately revisit such events because they would reactivate the extreme negative emotions that accompanied the events. However, their studies revealed that there was no difference in the average emotional intensity between events that were shared compared to those that were kept secret.|$|E
25|$|A vast majority, 94%, {{are raised}} {{in memory of}} men, but, {{contrary}} to common perception, {{the vast majority of}} the runestones are raised in memory of people who died at home. The most famous runestones and those that people tend to think of are those that tell of foreign voyages, but they comprise only c. 10% of all runestones, and they were raised in usually memory of those not having returned from Viking expeditions and not as tributes to those having returned. These runestones contain roughly the same message as the majority of the runestones, which <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> wanted to commemorate one or several dead kinsmen.|$|E
25|$|One {{hypothesis}} {{to explain}} this relationship is that the phosphoric acid contained in some soft drinks (colas) displaces calcium from the bones, lowering bone density of the skeleton and leading to weakened bones, or osteoporosis. However, 2001 calcium metabolism studies by Dr. Robert Heaney suggested that {{the net effect of}} carbonated soft drinks, (including colas, which use phosphoric acid as the acidulant) on calcium excretion in urine was negligible. Heaney concluded that carbonated soft drinks, which do not contain the nutrients needed for bone health, may displace other foods which do, and that the real issue <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who drink a lot of soft drinks also tend to have an overall diet that is low in calcium.|$|E

25|$|In {{psychological}} {{experiments that}} test how workers respond when {{the meaning of}} their task is diminished, the test condition {{is referred to as}} the Sisyphusian condition.

50|$|The overall {{findings}} of the report <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> can reduce their risk of cancer by eating healthily, being regularly physically active and maintaining a healthy weight.
