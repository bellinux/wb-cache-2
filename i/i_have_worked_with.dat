500|$|Although {{critical}} {{reception of}} Barbara Gordon's evolution into Oracle {{have been mixed}} among critics and other observers, according to John Ostrander: [...] "We have, over the years, on those occasions when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> the character, gotten some letters {{from those who have}} disabilities of one stripe or another and all have been very supportive.

DC Senior Vice President Dan DiDio comments, [...] "Some stories... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime. The DCU would be a lesser place without Barry's sacrifice, or the crippling of Barbara at the hands of the Joker." ...|$|E
