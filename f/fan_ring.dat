50|$|The blower door fan {{is used to}} blow {{air into}} {{or out of the}} building, {{creating}} either a positive or negative pressure differential between inside and outside. This pressure difference forces air through all holes and penetrations in the building enclosure. The tighter the building (e.g. fewer holes), the less air is needed from the blower door fan to create a change in building pressure. Typically, only depressurization testing is performed, but both depressurization and pressurization are preferable. Different values for blower door metrics are to be expected for pressurizing and depressurizing, due to the building envelope's response to directional airflow. The smallest <b>fan</b> <b>ring</b> that allows the fan to reach the maximum target indoor/outdoor pressure differential should be used. A multi-point test can be performed either manually or using data acquisition and fan control software products. The manual test consists of adjusting the fan to maintain a series of indoor/outdoor pressure differentials and recording the resulting average fan and indoor/outdoor pressures. Alternatively, a single-point test can be performed, where the blower door fan is ramped up to a reference indoor/outdoor pressure differential and the fan pressure is recorded. Often the blower door hardware converts fan pressure measurements directly to fan airflow values.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} present a {{comparison}} between measured and CFD simulated fan performance characteristics of three different types of heavy duty truck fans. The test bench incorporates a fan, <b>fan</b> <b>ring,</b> shroud and 3 D engine blockage. The latter creates a severe constraint {{to the use of}} simplified 3 D CFD fan models (MRF-model). The results illustrates that the MRF methodology is consistent with test data for axial flow conditions up to fan transition, i. e. this methodology could be used for applications with a correctly installed axial fan.

40|$|Today CFD is an {{important}} tool for engineers in the automotive industry who model and simulate fluid flow. For the complex field of Under hood Thermal Management, CFD has become a very important tool to engineer the cooling airflow process in the engine bay of vehicles. To model the cooling airflow process accurately in CFD, it is of utmost importance to model all components in the cooling airflow path accurately. These components are the heat exchangers, fan and engine bay blockage effect. This paper presents CFD simulations together with correlating measurements of a cooling airflow system placed in a test rig. The system contains a heavy duty truck louvered fin radiator core, fan shroud, <b>fan</b> <b>ring</b> and fan. Behind the cooling module and fan a 1 D engine silhouette is placed to mimic the blockage done by a truck engine behind the fan. Furthermore a simple hood is mounted over the module to mimic the air guiding done by the hood in an engine bay. The measurements monitor pressure and flow over the system. Supporting this examination {{is a set of}} 48 velocity probes in the radiator that measures the local velocity. The simulations of this system are correlated to measurements. Furthermore to support these simulations, specific simulations and measurements are conducted using the radiator only and the fan only. This is done to see how well each separate component is predicted in CFD and correlated back to measurements. This work is the continuation of work presented in [5] and identified in this paper is that one can simulate the cooling airflow system rather well with steady state CFD. However, fan modeling is sensitive and specific care has to be taken in order for these simulations to be accurate...|$|E

40|$|A <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> is a {{propeller}} fan that applies an axial-flow impeller with a ring-shaped shroud on the blade tip side. In this study, the entire flow {{field of the}} <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> is simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD); {{the accuracy of the}} CFD is verified through a comparison with the aerodynamic characteristics of a {{propeller fan}} of current model. Moreover, the aerodynamic noise generated by the fan is predicted {{on the basis of the}} wake characteristics. The aerodynamic characteristic of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> based on CFD can represent qualitatively the variation in the measured value. The main flow domain of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> is formed at the tip side of the blade because blade tip vortex is not formed at that location. Therefore, the relative velocity of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> is increased by the circumferential velocity. The sound pressure levels of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> within the frequency band of less than 200 Hz are larger than that of the propeller fan. In the analysis of the wake characteristics, it revealed that Karman vortex shedding occurred in the main flow domain in the frequency domain lower than 200 Hz; the aerodynamic noise of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> in the vortex shedding frequency enlarges due to increase in the relative velocity and the velocity fluctuation...|$|R

In this study, the whole flow field of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> is simulated by a CFD code; theaerodynamic noise generated by the fan is predicted based on the wake characteristics. Moreover, theaccuracy of the CFD code has been verified by comparing with the aerodynamic characteristics ofthe {{propeller fan}} of a current model. The aerodynamic characteristics of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> by the CFD canrepresent the tendency of the measurement value qualitatively, however, the flow rate in the CFDbecomes 30 % lower than the actual measurement value.

Therefore, the relative velocity of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> becomes fast due to the circumferential velocity. Thesound pressure levels of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> in the frequency band less than 200 Hz become larger than thepropeller fan. According to the analysis on the wake characteristics, it clarified that (1) Karmanvortex at the main flow domain is shedding in the frequency domain lower than 200 Hz, (2) theaerodynamic sound of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> on the vortex shedding frequency becomes large because of anincrease in the relative velocity and the velocity fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|Ring fan is a {{propeller}} fan that applies an axial-flow impeller with a ring-shaped shroud on the blade tip side. The fan has been expected {{not only to}} improve the aerodynamic characteristics but also to reduce the aerodynamic noise. In this study, the influence of wake on aerodynamic noise of a <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> has been discussed by comparison with {{the characteristics of a}} current {{propeller fan}}. The blade rotating noise was assumed for the mechanism of the discrete frequency noise in the <b>ring</b> <b>fan.</b> Moreover, the theory for the estimation of the blade rotating noise based on the wake characteristics has been proposed. The overall noise level of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> was decreased 3 dB than that of the propeller fan due to the discrete frequency noise in the first harmonics. As a result of CFD analysis, it is considered that the discrete frequency noise was generated from the blade surface of the impeller by the periodic pressure fluctuation synchronizing with the blade passing frequency. According with measured flow patterns, the relative velocity of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> became slightly high than the propeller fan whereas the velocity fluctuation of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> decreased approximately 71 % than that of the propeller fan in the near wake. From results of the estimation based on the proposed theory of the aerodynamic noise, it can be considered that the discrete frequency noise of the <b>ring</b> <b>fan</b> was decreased by the perturbation of the jet-wake flow in the wake...|$|R
