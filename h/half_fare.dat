5|$|Despite the Turnpike Act 1734, Oldham had no turnpike road to Manchester {{for another}} 56 years and Church Lane, Oldham {{remained}} {{part of the}} main street through the town. But following a further Act of Parliament a turnpike was constructed. The first regular coach service to Manchester came into operation in October 1790, with a journey time of over 2 hours and a fare 2s.8d (about 13p), with <b>half</b> <b>fare</b> for travellers {{on top of the}} coach.|$|E

25|$|In March, {{a driver}} dropped dead at Bulwell Depot {{just before he}} was due to take a car out. Consequently, all drivers were {{required}} to be medically examined periodically. A further noteworthy incident at Bulwell at this time occurred when an officer stationed at Bulwell Hall commandeered a tramcar standing at Bulwell Market Place to take 17 men to Victoria Station. This created quite a stir, for if such occasions occurred frequently the service would be thrown into disorder. From this time soldiers were carried at <b>half</b> <b>fare,</b> a later concession being the issue of prepaid ½d. and 1d. passes to wounded soldiers.|$|E

2500|$|A {{series of}} major {{changes were made}} on 1 February 1981. [...] The {{new version of the}} Railcard became valid for either one or two adults, with no {{distinction}} in price—so the separate [...] "joint-holder Railcard" [...] ceased to exist. [...] The price was changed to £10.00; the Railcard holder now gained a discount of 50% on off-peak fares; the child flat fare became £1.00; and two other adults (in addition to the holder/s) could travel in the group for <b>half</b> <b>fare.</b> [...] Other than a price rise in 1983, and some discounts on Motorail services, Sealink ferry services to the Channel Islands and rail-based holidays, the conditions remained the same until 1985.|$|E
2500|$|Working for the Pullman Company was, however, less glamorous in {{practice}} than it appeared. Porters depended on tips {{for much of}} their income and thus on the generosity of white passengers who often referred to all porters as [...] "George", the first name of George Pullman, the company's founder (see also Society for the Prevention of Calling Sleeping Car Porters [...] "George"). Porters spent roughly ten {{percent of their time}} in unpaid [...] "preparatory" [...] and [...] "terminal" [...] set-up and clean-up duties, paid for their food, lodging, and uniforms, which could consume up to half of their wages, and were charged whenever their passengers stole a towel or a water pitcher. Porters could ride at <b>half</b> <b>fare</b> on their days off — but not on Pullman coaches. They were not promotable to conductor, a job reserved for whites, despite frequently performing some of the [...] conductor duties.|$|E

On its second possession, Virginia Tech had a three-and-out drive, thanks in part to an 11-yard sack of Sean Glennon by Boston College's Kevin Atkins.|$|R

The fifteen men in the fore <b>half</b> <b>fared</b> better; although rescue attempts were futile during the stormy night, the next day a small boat made it out, and all fifteen were taken off in two boatloads.|$|R
