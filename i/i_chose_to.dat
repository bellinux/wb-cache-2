In addition, the South Saqqara Stone, a royal annal dating to the reign of Merenre or of his {{successor}} Pepi II, records rich offerings being made to Djedkare on behalf of the king. An estimated 92% of the text inscribed on the stone was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid, possibly in the late First Intermediate (c. 2160–2055 BC) to early Middle Kingdom period (c. 2055–1650 BC).|$|E
25|$|To be sure, this fortuitous {{takeover}} of Salin {{was backed by}} no additional Ava troops, and could not last. Sithu Kyawhtin II returned with a 7000-strong army (2000 horses, 15 elephants). Though his army was outnumbered more than two-to-one, Sithu Kyawhtin <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> make a stand. But Salin's defenses were breached on the second day. Inside the city, Sithu Kyawhtin I fought on atop his war elephant, and even engaged Sithu Kyawhtin II, who was also on his war elephant. In the end, Toungoo troops won the battle. Sithu Kyawhtin barely escaped, fleeing to the Chin Hills.|$|E

After graduating in 1940, Lee decided to quit clinical medicine and keep on studying.

25|$|The {{restoration}} of Constantine I at first {{did not bring}} any change to Aspasia's situation. Considered intriguing by part of the Royal Family, especially by her sister-in-law Princess Elisabeth of Romania who hated her, she was under the suspicion {{that she wanted to}} put her unborn child on the throne. The Royal Family feared the birth of a male child, which could further complicate the political situation at a time when Greece was already at war against the Ottoman Empire. However, not all members of the Royal Family, shared this distrust: Princess Alice of Battenberg, aunt of the deceased Alexander <b>I,</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> spend Christmas of 1920 in the company of Aspasia. For her part, Queen Sophia, who previously strongly opposed the relationship of her son with Aspasia, approaches her daughter-in-law and awaited birth of her first grandchild.|$|E
25|$|Military {{training}} and strategy are two important matters {{on which the}} sources are more than usually silent. There are no references in literature or laws to men training, {{and so it is}} necessary to fall back on inference. For the noble warrior, his childhood was of first importance in learning both individual military skills and the teamwork essential for success in battle. Perhaps the games the youthful Cuthbert played ('wrestling, jumping, running, and every other exercise') had some military significance. Turning to strategy, of the period before Alfred the evidence gives the Impression that Anglo-Saxon armies fought battles frequently. If this is not solely due to the deficiencies of the sources, it would make England a special case. Battle was risky and best avoided unless all the factors were on your side. But if you were in a position so advantageous that you were willing to take the chance, it is likely that your enemy would be in such a weak position that he would avoid battle and pay tribute. Unless, of course, he was Bede's Oswald and trusted in God. Anyway, battle put the princes' lives at risk, as is demonstrated by the Northumbrian and Mercian overlordships brought to an end by a defeat in the field. Gillingham has shown how few pitched battles successful Charlemagne and Richard <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> fight.|$|E

[...] In the kitchen, the old woman (Squires) was sat in a chair and asked her [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> go their way". [...] Canning's refusal had prompted Squires to cut off her stays, slap her face, and push her up the stairs into a darkened room. [...] She told the court she [...] "saw nothing brought uphen day-light appeared, I could see about the room; there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor bedstead, nothing but hay to lie upon; there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about twenty-four pieces of bread ... about a quartern loaf". [...] She claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window {{at the north end of}} the loft, climbing out, and jumping down to the soft clay below. [...] She fled along a lane behind the house, through some fields, and on finding a road set out for London. [...] When asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on the way back, she replied that she had not, explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting somebody from the house she had escaped from. [...] Canning was cross-examined by William Davy, who questioned her recollection of events in the house. [...] Asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied: [...] "Because I thought they might let me out; it never came into my head till that [...] morning."

500|$|Madonna also {{performed}} the song at the 2015 Brit Awards, on February 25. However, {{in the early}} stages of the performance, a wardrobe malfunction caused her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of the stage. It was later revealed that since her cape was tied tightly, when her dancers attempted to remove it from her neck, she fell down to the floor. However Madonna then continued the performance as planned. She later took to Instagram to confirm that she was well, posting [...] "Thanks for the good wishes! I'm fine". Richard Smirke from Billboard praised the performance and Madonna's recovery, saying that [...] " [...] didn't let the fall affect her performance and quickly recovered to deliver a slickly choreographed routine that mirrored the matador theme of her recent Grammy Awards performance." [...] Madonna explained on The Jonathan Ross Show that she was told to start walking towards the stage further than originally planned. Hence her team thought that the cape could have slid off and tied it tightly round her neck. The singer had two choices when the cape did not come undone, [...] "I could either be strangled or fall, and <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> fall". Madonna endured a whiplash and added that she [...] "smacked the back of my head. And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3 am to make sure I was compos mentis". The singer jokingly added that she would not use any cape for further performances and attributed her prompt recovery to having good core strength and her daily exercise routine. The accident led to an increase in viewership of the awards show. According to the British Phonographic Industry, the event resulted a 95% increase in Twitter activity about the show compared with the previous year, with an exchange of 7.8million tweets, while 6.8million viewers tuned in to watch the performance. The singer's fall was voted the most shocking [...] "Celebrity Moment of 2015" [...] by UK's Channel 5.|$|E
