40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Doctorate in Professional Studies (DProf) as developed at a UK University and specifically {{focuses on the}} specialist doctoral pathways in Health, Environment and Risk in the School of Health and Social Sciences. The paper considers {{the role of the}} major stakeholders; Doctoral candidate, <b>Employer</b> <b>Organisation</b> hosting the research, and the University. Since the inception of the DProf there has been recognition of the need for the <b>employer</b> <b>organisation</b> to be an active partner in the research by supporting it through being receptive to the emerging research findings. There is also recognition of the differences between traditional doctoral study and that of the work based professional doctoral candidate. Portwood (2000) considered the concept of the learned worker as the person who is able to develop a reflective and cognisant view of organisational developments and change. Armsby and Costley (2009) took the learned worker concept further by considering the potential risks and barriers encountered through the “situatedness” of the professional doctoral candidate in the organisation, and ultimately their vulnerability should there be internal resistance or apathy towards the research. The paper considers two examples of such resistance and analyses the support required for the learned professional doctoral candidate through utilising the resources of “organisation sapiens”. Recommendations are made on strategy for leading the change process and understanding positive and constructive approaches to questioning organisational change. The paper concludes with a consideration of a more inclusive and participatory approach to organisation stakeholder involvement and potential methodologies that may enable greater partnership in the research...|$|E
40|$|Although trainee pay {{is central}} to the {{economics}} of work-based training, institutionalists have paid it little attention, while economists typically assume that it is set by market clearing. We document large differences in the pay of metalworking apprentices in three countries: relative to the pay of skilled employees, it is high in Britain, middling in Germany, and low in Switzerland. Combining fieldwork evidence with national survey data, we associate apprentice pay with both institutional attributes and market forces: specifically, with trade union presence and goals, <b>employer</b> <b>organisation,</b> the contractual status of apprentices, the supply of eligible and interested young people, and public subsidies. Apprentice pay appears to have fallen in Britain and Germany as bargaining coverage has declined...|$|E

This paper investigates use of incentive pay systems in British and French private sector establishments in 2004, focusing on payment-by-results, merit pay, and profit sharing, using British and French workplace surveys: WERS and Réponse. Despite the stereotypes of Britain as a deregulated economy and France as a more coordinated social-market economy, French firms make considerably greater use of incentive pay, and particularly, merit pay. The paper explores the organisational and institutional determinants of this. It finds that personnel economics and management theories explain a significant share of the within country variation in use of incentive pay systems. incentive systems, merit pay, profit-sharing, <b>employer</b> <b>organisation...</b>|$|E

40|$|Public {{relations}} is often perceived as unethical, yet professional associations and educators position {{the industry as}} an ethical profession. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the perceptions of public relations students (N = 45) in a communication school in Australia towards ethics. Research involving a survey and a focus group found that students perceived public relations ethics depended on a negotiation between practitioners’ responsibilities to stakeholders and their client or <b>employer</b> <b>organisation,</b> and broader societal expectations. They perceived professional codes of ethics to be of limited value and the development of ethical understanding as incremental over the course of their studies. The findings suggest ethics should be scaffolded in public relations education, the social impact of public relations activity should be emphasised and the limitations of professional codes highlighted...|$|E

In this two-study investigation, we examine how employees’ beliefs about the organisation’s legitimacy relate to their organisational trust because legitimacy signals organisational trustworthiness in the impersonal system of the institutional environment. Results from Study 1, which drew on data from one organisation, reveal that employees’ legitimacy beliefs are related to their organisational trust. Furthermore, results from Study 2, {{which are based on}} data from five organisations, reveal that employees’ judgment of the organisation’s trustworthiness mediates the relationship between legitimacy beliefs and organisational trust.
