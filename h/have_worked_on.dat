5|$|Robert Frederick Christy (May 14, 1916 – October 3, 2012) was a Canadian-American {{theoretical}} {{physicist and}} later astrophysicist {{who was one}} of the last surviving people to <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> the Manhattan Project during World War II. He was also briefly president of California Institute of Technology (Caltech).|$|E
5|$|According to {{official}} figures, 33,145 black Southern Rhodesians were conscripted for labour between 1943 and 1945; Vickery estimates that between 15,000 and 60,000 more may <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> the aerodromes. According to Ashley Jackson's work The British Empire and the Second World War, the Rhodesian Air Training Group instructed 8,235 Allied pilots, navigators, gunners, ground crew and others—about 5% of overall EATS output.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli {{commissioned}} {{a number of}} writers {{to work on the}} script, including Stirling Silliphant, John Landis, Ronald Hardy, Anthony Burgess, and Derek Marlowe. In the second volume of his autobiography, Burgess claims to <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> an early treatment for the movie. The British television producer Gerry Anderson also stated that he provided a film treatment (although originally planned to be Moonraker) much similar to what ended up as The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E

5|$|During Gaudí's life {{only the}} crypt, apse {{and part of}} the Nativity facade were completed. Upon his death his {{assistant}} Domènec Sugrañes took over the construction; thereafter it was directed by various architects. Jordi Bonet i Armengol assumed responsibility in 1987 and continued as of 2011. Artists such as Llorenç and Joan Matamala, Carles Mani, Jaume Busquets, Joaquim Ros i Bofarull, Etsuro Sotoo and Josep Maria Subirachs (creator of the Passion facade) <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> the sculptural decoration. Completion is not expected until at least 2026.|$|E
5|$|Around the 14th century, {{the temple}} was {{associated}} with the Vajrasana in India. In the 18th century the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, following the Gorkha-Tibetan war in 1792, did not allow the Nepalese to visit this temple and it became an exclusive place of worship for the Tibetans. During the Chinese development of Lhasa, the Barkhor Square in front of the temple was encroached. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards attacked the Jokhang temple in 1966 and for a decade there was no worship. Renovation of the Jokhang took place from 1972 to 1980. In 2000, the Jokhang became a UNESCO World Heritage Site {{as an extension of the}} Potala Palace (a World Heritage Site since 1994). Many Nepalese artists <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> the temple's design and construction.|$|E
5|$|In about 701 Bede {{wrote his}} first works, the De Arte Metrica and De Schematibus et Tropis; both were {{intended}} {{for use in the}} classroom. He continued to write {{for the rest of his}} life, eventually completing over 60 books, most of which have survived. Not all his output can be easily dated, and Bede may <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> some texts over a period of many years. His last-surviving work is a letter to Ecgbert of York, a former student, written in 734. A 6th-century Greek and Latin manuscript of Acts of the Apostles that is believed to have been used by Bede survives and is now in the Bodleian Library at University of Oxford; it is known as the Codex Laudianus. Bede may also <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> one of the Latin bibles that were copied at Jarrow, one of which is now held by the Laurentian Library in Florence. Bede was a teacher as well as a writer; he enjoyed music, and was said to be accomplished as a singer and as a reciter of poetry in the vernacular. It is possible that he suffered a speech impediment, but this depends on a phrase in the introduction to his verse life of Saint Cuthbert. Translations of this phrase differ, and it is uncertain whether Bede intended to say that he was cured of a speech problem, or merely that he was inspired by the saint's works.|$|E

5|$|Zappa {{attempted}} {{to earn a}} living as a musician and composer, and played different nightclub gigs, some with {{a new version of the}} Blackouts. Zappa's earliest professional recordings, two soundtracks for the low-budget films The World's Greatest Sinner (1962) and Run Home Slow (1965) were more financially rewarding. The former score was commissioned by actor-producer Timothy Carey and recorded in 1961. It contains many themes that appeared on later Zappa records. The latter soundtrack was recorded in 1963 after the film was completed, but it was commissioned by one of Zappa's former high school teachers in 1959 and Zappa may <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> it before the film was shot. Excerpts from the soundtrack can be heard on the posthumous album The Lost Episodes (1996).|$|E
5|$|From 1947, Ivatt 2-6-0 {{lightweight}} tender locomotives were {{allocated to}} Goole shed, and were soon {{operating on the}} Axholme Joint Railway. The last two Barton Wright 0-6-0 locomotives left Goole shed in December 1950 for Wakefield {{and all of the}} seven Ivatt locomotives are thought to <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> the line. They were popular with the crews, as the tender was fitted with a back sheet for the cab, and was low enough to provide good visibility when running tender-first across the moors on the return journey to Goole. In 1957 they were briefly replaced by four elderly J10 0-6-0 tender engines, transferred from Liverpool, but all were withdrawn in 1958. Small diesel shunters were allocated to Goole shed in 1960, for use in the docks, but were also used on the Axholme Joint Railway. Only one of the Ivatt 2-6-0 locomotives was left at Goole by mid-1962.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Flight 370's disappearance, discussions {{concerning}} the analysis of satellite data began on the website of space scientist Duncan Steel. The informal group of people, most with scientific backgrounds, soon {{became known as the}} Independent Group (IG) and has worked to analyse possible flight paths to determine the most likely final location of Flight 370. For the first few months, their efforts were hindered by a lack of data publicly released and they were critical of the official analysis by Inmarsat; the IG also pressured officials to release data related to Flight 370's satellite communications. The IG did not believe there was sufficient evidence, using publicly available information, to exclude the possibility of Flight 370 following a northern track prior to the release of the communication logs on 27 May. Some of the IG members <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> analysing specific elements of Flight 370's flight path, such as the mid-flight speed of Flight 370 and precise location of the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite.|$|E
