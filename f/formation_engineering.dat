In this paper, we surveyed the tight oil exploration status and challenges, {{as well as the}} tight reservoir properties in China, including source rocks, lithology, physical properties and pressure coefficient. The process of pilot test and key technologies are analyzed, while it is still urgent to improve tight oil study and the production mode. We concluded that there are 4 aspects, which are geological features, energy supplement for <b>formation,</b> <b>engineering</b> and technical management innovation, should be improved, and national policy support for tight oil is another key point for successful exploration.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} patenting and spin-off creation using survey data of 479 researchers in engineering and 449 researchers in life sciences funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). The results show that research novelty and laboratory size {{are the only two}} variables significantly explaining patenting and spin-off <b>formation</b> in both <b>engineering</b> and life sciences. Network capital explains spin-off <b>formation</b> in <b>engineering</b> and in life sciences as well as patenting in life sciences, but not in engineering. Furthermore, the results suggest that many categories of resources explain patenting and spin-off <b>formation</b> in <b>engineering</b> and in life sciences, but that the combinations of resources required differ for patenting and spin-off <b>formation</b> and between <b>engineering</b> and life sciences. The results of this paper suggest that customized policies would be required to accommodate differences between spin-off formation and patenting as well as between engineering and life sciences.

40|$|Engineers are {{involved}} in the implementation, application, operation, design and management of projects and processes, changing the type of work with the specific engineering field. The world in which engineers operates {{at the beginning of this}} century, is characterised by the diverse, profound and incessant changes occurring in technology, natural environment and society expectations. The recent review of engineering education indicates that there are a variety of roles of professional engineers which need to be reflected in engineering <b>formation.</b> <b>Engineering</b> can be considered at this moment as a broad discipline that embraces knowledge and training in science and mathematics, business and management, social science and computer technology. We think that engineering students perception of the work and skills of an actual engineer is not according to that reality, because the actual curriculum do not include those skills and the curriculum has a tremendous influence in the thought of the students.

40|$|The {{increasing}} attribute {{focus in}} the <b>formation</b> (<b>engineering</b> education, training, work-based learning and experience) of engineers now being adopted by engineering education accrediting bodies is based on meeting the perceived needs of professional practice. Related to this is an increasing expectation of new graduates being work-ready {{rather than relying on}} work-based learning and experience to develop many of the essential professional practice attributes. The scope of the mechanical engineering profession is broad and practitioners contributing to debate on attribute requirements have their own individual views {{of the nature of the}} profession, largely influenced by their own professional formation. As a foundation for detailed study on attribute requirements for effective Australian professional mechanical engineers, in this paper we provide a concise study of the development of the established scope of practice and knowledge base of the profession over the last two centuries. Formation practices in Europe and the United States played significant roles in the 19 th century.

30|$|The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is widely}} used as a cell factory to produce {{recombinant}} proteins. However, S. cerevisiae naturally secretes only a few proteins, such as invertase and the mating alpha factor, and its secretory capacity is limited. It {{has been reported that}} engineering protein anterograde trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus by the moderate overexpression of SEC 16 could increase recombinant protein secretion in S. cerevisiae. In this study, the retrograde trafficking in a strain with moderate overexpression of SEC 16 was engineered by overexpression of ADP-ribosylation factor GTP activating proteins, Gcs 1 p and Glo 3 p, which are involved in the process of COPI-coated vesicle <b>formation.</b> <b>Engineering</b> the retrograde trafficking increased the secretion of α-amylase but did not induce production of reactive oxygen species. An expanded ER membrane was detected in both the GCS 1 and GLO 3 overexpression strains. Physiological characterizations during batch fermentation showed that GLO 3 overexpression had better effect on recombinant protein secretion than GCS 1 overexpression. Additionally, the GLO 3 overexpression strain had higher secretion of two other recombinant proteins, endoglucanase I from Trichoderma reesei and glucan- 1, 4 -α-glucosidase from Rhizopus oryzae, indicating overexpression of GLO 3 in a SEC 16 moderate overexpression strain might be a general strategy for improving production of secreted proteins by yeast.|$|E

In the work there are six objective factors: economic status of country and labour market state, scientific and technical policy, political and legal situation, globalization and international differentiation of labor, financial standing of population, and state of educational system. The analysis of dynamics of number of specialists of higher qualification level in area of natural and technical sciences witnesses increasing attraction of engineers to economy {{of the country and}} strengthening of their positions on labour market. In this connection the task of own production development and support of the branches, which are not belong to primary production, appear {{to be one of the}} most important for future economic development. Despite acute need of economy for engineering and technical workers, many of them, as researches show, feel socially unprotected.

40|$|Biomedical imaging is a {{relatively}} young discipline that started with Conrad Wilhelm Roentgen’s discovery of the x-ray in 1885. X-ray imaging was rapidly adopted in hospitals around the world. However, it was the advent of computerized data and image processing that made revolutionary new imaging modalities possible. Today, cross-sections and three-dimensional reconstructions of the organs inside {{the human body is}} possible with unprecedented speed, detail and quality. This book provides an introduction into the principles of image formation of key medical imaging modalities: X-ray projection imaging, x-ray computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, and radionuclide imaging. Recent developments in optical imaging are also covered. For each imaging modality, the introduction into the physical principles and sources of contrast is provided, followed by the methods of image <b>formation,</b> <b>engineering</b> aspects of the imaging devices, and a discussion of strengths and limitations of the modality. With this book, the reader gains a broad foundation of understanding and knowledge how today’s medical imaging devices operate. In addition, the chapters in this book can serve as an entry point for the in-depth study of individual modalities by providing the essential basics of each modality in a comprehensive and easy-to-understand manner. As such, this book is equally attractive as a textbook for undergraduate or graduate biomedical imaging classes and as a reference and self-study guide for more specialized in-depth studies...|$|E
40|$|In Britain {{engineering}} {{professional development}} {{has traditionally been}} seen as a three phase process consisting of a period of <b>engineering</b> <b>formation,</b> a period of training and a period during which engineering responsibilities are demonstrated. An individual could submit evidence of these activities and become registered as a Professional Engineer. Increasing numbers of people employed in the role of engineer do not have formal engineering qualifications and a part or all their <b>engineering</b> <b>formation</b> is carried out within engineering companies or organizations. These people therefore do not have the academically authenticated credentials to register as professional engineers but if they are ignored then the pool of registered engineers will cease to be representative of the profession. The Engineering Council, the body responsible for registering engineers in the UK, has acknowledged the changes {{in the structure of the}} profession and has introduced an alternative route for assessing the knowledge and understanding that underpins the competence of a professional engineer. Individual engineers can demonstrate that they have an adequate <b>engineering</b> <b>formation</b> through any combination of academic qualifications and a technical report on some aspect of their professional engineering work. The introduction of the technical report requires the Professional Engineering Bodies to carry out an assessment outside the traditional assessment framework of the Universities.
