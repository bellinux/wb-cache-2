40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a face {{recognition}} algorithm using AAM and Gabor features. Gabor feature vectors which {{are well known}} to be robust with respect to small variations of shape, scaling, rotation, distortion, illumination and poses in images are popularly employed for feature vectors for many object detection and recognition algorithms. EBGM, which is prominent among face recognition algorithms employing Gabor feature vectors, requires localization of <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> points where Gabor feature vectors are extracted. However, localization method employed in EBGM is based on Gabor jet similarity and is sensitive to initial values. Wrong localization of <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> points affects face recognition rate. AAM {{is known to be}} successfully applied to localization of <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> points. In this paper, we devise a <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> point localization method which first roughly estimate <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> points using AAM and refine <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> points using Gabor jet similarity-based <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> localization method with initial points set by the rough <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> points obtained from AAM, and propose a face recognition algorithm using the devised localization method for <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> localization and Gabor feature vectors. It is observed through experiments that such a cascaded localization method based on both AAM and Gabor jet similarity is more robust than the localization method based on only Gabor jet similarity. Also, it is shown that the proposed face recognition algorithm using this devised localization method and Gabor feature vectors performs better than the conventional face recognition algorithm using Gabor jet similarity-based localization method and Gabor feature vectors like EBGM...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an automatic technique for detecting the 18 -most important <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> points using a statistically developed anthropometric face model. Most {{of the important}} <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> points are located just about the area of mouth, nose, eyes and eyebrows. After carefully observing the structural symmetry of human face and performing necessary anthropometric measurements, {{we have been able}} to build a model that can be used in isolating the above mentioned <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> regions. In the proposed model, distance between the two eye centers serves as the principal parameter of measurement for locating the centers of other <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> regions. Hence, our method works by detecting the two eye centers in every possible situation of eyes and isolating each of the <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> regions using the proposed model. Combinations of differnt image processing techniques are then applied within the localized regions for detecting the 18 -most important <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> points. Experimental result shows that the developed system can detect the 18 -feature points successfully in 90. 44 % cases when applied over the test databases...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive survey of <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> point detection {{with the assistance}} of abundant manually labeled images. <b>Facial</b> <b>feature</b> point detection favors many applications such as face recognition, animation, tracking, hallucination, expression analysis and 3 D face modeling. Existing methods can be categorized into the following four groups: constrained local model (CLM) -based, active appearance model (AAM) -based, regression-based, and other methods. CLM-based methods consist of a shape model and a number of local experts, each of which is utilized to detect a <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> point. AAM-based methods fit a shape model to an image by minimizing texture synthesis errors. Regression-based methods directly learn a mapping function from facial image appearance to <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> points. Besides the above three major categories of methods, there are also minor categories of methods which we classify into other methods: graphical model-based methods, joint face alignment methods, independent <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> point detectors, and deep learning-based methods. Though significant progress has been made, <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> point detection is limited in its success by wild and real-world conditions: variations across poses, expressions, illuminations, and occlusions. A comparative illustration and analysis of representative methods provide us a holistic understanding and deep insight into <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> point detection, which also motivates us to explore promising future directions.

40|$|Abstract – Locating <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> {{points in}} images of faces is an {{important}} stage for numerous facial image interpretation tasks. In this paper we present a method for fully automatic detection of 20 <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> points in images of expressionless faces using Gabor feature based boosted classifiers. The method adopts fast and robust face detection algorithm, which represents an adapted version of the original Viola-Jones face detector. The detected face region is then divided into 20 relevant regions of interest, {{each of which is}} examined further to predict the location of the <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> points. The proposed <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> point detection method uses individual feature patch templates to detect points in the relevant region of interest.

Based on such theories, the Chera coins could either belong to a series of rulers or to a single king called Cheraman Makkotai.|$|E

In this work <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> points are tracked with a Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature tracker and the tracking results are linked with a 3 D Active Shape Model (ASM). Thus, the efficient Gauss-Newton method is not solving for {{the shift of}} each <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> point separately but for the 3 D position, rotation and the 3 D ASM parameters which are {{the same for all}} feature points.

The Jacobian matrix for the Gauss-Newton optimization is split via chain rule and the computations per frame are further reduced.
