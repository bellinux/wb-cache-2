50|$|The first {{cases of}} NSF were {{identified}} in 1997, but NSF was first described as an independent disease entity in 2000. While skin involvement is on the foreground, the process may involve any organ and resembles diffuse scleroderma or systemic sclerosis. In 2006, the link between NSF and gadolinium-containing contrast agents was made. As a result, gadolinium-containing contrast is now considered contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (a measure of renal function) under 60 and especially under 30 ml/mn.

50|$|Some {{articles}} {{suggested that}} over 60 persons examined with Omniscan had either died {{or had been}} severely disabled {{as a result of}} the use of the product. However, a recent report by the Danish Medicines Agency stated that there were 35 cases of NSF reported after use of Omniscan and that 33 of these had been reported from a single centre in Copenhagen.However, already in 2001, a case of renal toxicity and pancreatitis associated with Omniscan use for arteriography had been reported. In their paper, the authors also referred to two other previous case reports (1998 and 1999) of acute renal failure after <b>gadoteridol</b> (Prohance) intraarterially and acute pancreatitis after intravenous gadolinium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (Magnevist). A case of cardiac arrest has also been reported. Gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist) was administered during an MR study of the head, and from the rapid onset of signs and symptoms and subsequent cardiovascular arrest, a cause-and-effect relationship was suggested. In the interest of public health, it seems important that not only renal disease should be considered a factor when decisions about the use of this kind of MRI contrast is taken.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveProspective {{evaluation}} of optimal MR arthrographic concentration of two gadolinium-based agents of different relaxivities, either in saline or iodinated carriers at 1. 5, 3 and 7 T field strengths was evaluated in vitro. Materials and methodsAt 1. 5, 3. 0 and 7. 0 T, gadobenate and <b>gadoteridol</b> were studied at different concentrations in both normal saline and iodinated contrast. IRT 1 W and multi-echo T 2 FSE sequences were obtained. Signal–concentration relationship of both used agents in different carriers and field strengths was plotted from their collected T 1 and T 2 values, {{as well as}} their derived longitudinal (r 1) and transverse (r 2) relaxivities. ResultsSignificant increase in T 1 signal intensity (p< 0. 001) of both gadobenate and <b>gadoteridol</b> was observed in higher fields of 3 T and 7 T, stronger for <b>gadoteridol.</b> Contrarily, <b>gadoteridol</b> showed a significantly lesser decrease (p< 0. 0001) of T 2 signal intensity with increasing field from 3 T to 7 T. Iodinated carriers significantly diminished T 2 signal intensity (p< 0. 0001) except for highest concentration (10 mmol/L) (p= 0. 8899) while this was only significant (p= 0. 0279) between extreme concentrations for T 1 signal. ConclusionOn transitioning to high-field (3 T and 7 T) MR arthrography, keeping the least amount of iodine for intra-articular contrast delivery, and when choice is available, <b>gadoteridol</b> is preferable to gadobenate. However, gadobenate was still optimal at 3 T...|$|E

No minor or major reactions to <b>gadoteridol</b> injection developed in the 13 patients. <b>Gadoteridol</b> injection provided excellent delineation and enhancement of the arteriovenous malformation and all of the primary and secondary neoplasms of the central nervous system except for one case of a grade 1 glioma of the midbrain. <b>Gadoteridol</b> injection is a safe and excellent contrast agent for use in MRI...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Contrast-enhanced {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) with gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) is standard of care for CNS imaging and diagnosis because of the visualization of lesions that cause blood–brain barrier breakdown. Gadobutrol is a macrocyclic GBCA with high concentration and high relaxivity. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the safety and efficacy of gadobutrol 1. 0 M vs unenhanced imaging and vs the approved macrocyclic agent <b>gadoteridol</b> 0. 5 M at a dose of 0. 1 mmol/kg bodyweight. Materials and Methods Prospective, multicenter, double-blind, crossover trial in patients who underwent unenhanced MRI followed by enhanced imaging with gadobutrol or <b>gadoteridol.</b> Three blinded readers assessed the {{magnetic resonance}} images. The primary efficacy variables included number of lesions detected, degree of lesion contrast-enhancement, lesion border delineation, and lesion internal morphology. Results Of the 402 treated patients, 390 patients received study drugs. Lesion contrast-enhancement, lesion border delineation, and lesion internal morphology were superior for combined unenhanced/gadobutrol-enhanced imaging vs unenhanced imaging (P < 0. 0001 for all). Compared with <b>gadoteridol,</b> gadobutrol was non-inferior for all primary variables and superior for lesion contrast-enhancement, as well as sensitivity and accuracy for detection of malignant disease. The percentage of patients with at least one drug-related adverse event was similar for gadobutrol (10. 0 %) and <b>gadoteridol</b> (9. 7 %). Conclusion Gadobutrol is an effective and well-tolerated macrocyclic contrast agent for MRI of the CNS. Gadobutrol demonstrates greater contrast-enhancement and improved sensitivity and accuracy for detection of malignant disease than <b>gadoteridol,</b> likely because of its higher relaxivity...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} {{and safety of}} higher doses of <b>gadoteridol</b> in the MR evaluation of patients with brain metastases. Materials and Methods: Thirty-one patients with a clinical suspicion of brain metastases were studied prospectively with <b>gadoteridol,</b> a new, nonionic, low-osmolality contrast agent. Each patient received an initial injection of 0. 1 mmol/kg and an additional dose of 0. 2 mmol/kg 30 minutes later. Images were obtained before, immediately after, and 10 and 20 minutes after the initial dose. Images also were acquired immediately after the additional dose of <b>gadoteridol.</b> Results: No adverse effects were attributed to the injection of <b>gadoteridol.</b> Four patients ' examinations were excluded from analysis because of machine mal-function (two patients) and excessive motion artifact (two patients). Four patients had no detectable metastases. After the additional dose of <b>gadoteridol,</b> there was a marked qualitative improvement in lesion conspicuity and detection. The conspicuity of 80 of 81 lesions was increased in the high-dose studies, and 46 new lesions were detected in 19 of 27 patients. Quantitative image analysis demonstrated {{a significant increase in}} normalized mean lesion contrast between the initial-dose and high-dose studies (35 lesions identified in 13 patients, P <. 0001). The additional information gained by high-dose examinations contributed to a potential modification of the treatment in 10 of 27 patients. High-dose examinations increased flow-related artifact in the posterior fossa in 12 of 27 patients. Conclusion: Based on our preliminary results, high-dose gadolinium-enhanced MR examinations may have advantages over 0. 1 mmol/kg examinations in detecting early and/or small metastases. This may be significant in the management of patients with cerebral metastases.

40|$|This study aims {{to compare}} <b>gadoteridol</b> with ferumoxytol for contrast-enhanced and perfusion-weighted (PW) MRI of {{intracranial}} tumors. The final analysis included 26 patients, who underwent 3 consecutive days of 3 T MRI. Day 1 consisted of anatomical pre- and postcontrast images, and PW MRI was acquired using <b>gadoteridol</b> (0. 1 mmol/kg). On Day 2, the same MRI sequences were obtained with ferumoxytol (510 mg) and on Day 3, the anatomical images were repeated to detect delayed ferumoxytol-induced signal changes. The T 1 -weighted images were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively for enhancement volume and signal intensity (SI) changes; PW data {{were used to}} estimate the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). All 26 lesions showed 24 -hour T 1 -weighted ferumoxytol enhancement; 16 also had T 2 -weighted hypointensities. In 6 patients, ferumoxytol-induced signal changes were noted in areas with no <b>gadoteridol</b> enhancement. Significantly greater (P<. 0001) SI changes were seen with <b>gadoteridol,</b> and qualitative analyses (lesion border delineation, internal morphology, contrast enhancement) also showed significant preferences (P=. 0121; P =. 0015; P <. 0001, respectively) for this agent. There {{was no significant difference}} in lesion enhancement volumes between contrast materials. The ferumoxytol-rCBV values were significantly higher (P =. 0016) compared with the gadoteridol-rCBV values. In conclusion, ferumoxytol provides important information about tumor biology that complements <b>gadoteridol</b> imaging. The rCBV measurements indicate areas of tumor undergoing rapid growth, whereas the 24 -hour scans mark the presence of inflammatory cells. Both of these functions provide useful information about tumor response to treatment. We suggest that dynamic and anatomical imaging with ferumoxytol warrant further assessment in brain tumor therapy...|$|E

40|$|Canine {{spontaneous}} intracranial tumors bear striking {{similarities to}} their human tumor counterparts {{and have the}} potential to provide a large animal model system for more realistic validation of novel therapies typically developed in small rodent models. We used spontaneously occurring canine gliomas to investigate the use of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of liposomal nanoparticles, containing topoisomerase inhibitor CPT- 11. To facilitate visualization of intratumoral infusions by real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we included identically formulated liposomes loaded with <b>Gadoteridol.</b> Real-time MRI defined distribution of infusate within both tumor and normal brain tissues. The most important limiting factor for volume of distribution within tumor tissue was the leakage of infusate into ventricular or subarachnoid spaces. Decreased tumor volume, tumor necrosis, and modulation of tumor phenotype correlated with volume of distribution of infusate (Vd), infusion location, and leakage as determined by real-time MRI and histopathology. This study demonstrates the potential for canine spontaneous gliomas as a model system for the validation and development of novel therapeutic strategies for human brain tumors. Data obtained from infusions monitored in real time in a large, spontaneous tumor may provide information, allowing more accurate prediction and optimization of infusion parameters. Variability in Vd between tumors strongly suggests that real-time imaging should be an essential component of CED therapeutic trials to allow minimization of inappropriate infusions and accurate assessment of clinical outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Dendrimersomes are {{nanosized}} vesicles {{constituted by}} amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (JDs), {{which have been}} recently proposed as innovative nanocarriers for biomedical applications. Recently, we have demonstrated that dendrimersomes self-assembled from (3, 5) 12 G 1 -PE-BMPA-G 2 -(OH) 8 dendrimers can be successfully loaded with hydrophilic and amphiphilic imaging contrast agents. Here, we present two newly synthesized low generation isomeric JDs: JDG 0 G 1 (3, 5) and JDG 0 G 1 (3, 4). Though less branched than the above-cited dendrimers, they retain the ability to form self-assembled, almost monodisperse vesicular nanoparticles. This contribution reports on the characterization of such nanovesicles loaded with the clinically approved MRI probe <b>Gadoteridol</b> and the comparison with the related nanoparticles assembled from more branched dendrimers. Special emphasis {{was given to the}} in vitro stability test of the systems in biologically relevant media, complemented by preliminary in vivo data about blood circulation lifetime collected from healthy mice. The results point to very promising safety and stability profiles of the nanovesicles, in particular for those made of JDG 0 G 1 (3, 5), whose spontaneous self-organization in water gives rise to a homogeneous suspension. Importantly, the blood lifetimes of these systems are comparable to those of standard liposomes. By virtue of the reported results, the herein presented nanovesicles augur well for future use in a variety of biomedical applications...|$|E
40|$|Administration of {{contrast}} media before proton {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} (1 H MRS) may allow more accurate placement {{of the volume of}} interest in breast tumors, but some studies have suggested their use decreases the choline peak. We studied the impact {{of contrast}} use to determine which method would reduce the choline peak the least. 　Phantoms containing 1, 5, and 10 mM concentrations of choline were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline and mixed with contrast media in concentrations of 0, 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 6 mM. We used 2 different media: one being a negatively-charged diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid gadolinium (Gd-DTPA), and the other a neutral <b>gadoteridol</b> (Gd-HP-DO 3 A). We studied all phantoms by single voxel 1 H MRS with a repetition time (TR) of 2, 000 msec and an echo time (TE) of 136 or 270 msec. 　Gd-DTPA tended to induce an increase in the peak integral and amplitude at lower concentrations and a decrease at a higher concentration, whereas Gd-HP-DO 3 A tended to induce an increase in the peak integral and amplitude at lower concentrations with no definite decrease at higher concentrations. Neither contrast medium induced a definite change in peak width. The reduction of the choline peak integral and amplitude at TE of 270 msec was greater than at TE of 136 msec. 　Therefore, we recommend the use of the neutral contrast agent and short TE in 1 H MRS studies of breast tumors to avoid underestimation of the level of choline peaks...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMolecular {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) of tumors improves the specificity of MRI by using targeted probes conjugated to contrast-generating metals. The limitation {{of this approach is}} in the identification of a target molecule present in sufficient concentration for visualization {{and the development of a}} labeling reagent that can penetrate tumor tissue with the fast kinetics required for use in a clinical setting. The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPµ is a transmembrane protein that is continuously proteolyzed in the tumor microenvironment to generate a high concentration of extracellular fragment that can be recognized by the SBK 2 probe. We conjugated the SBK 2 peptide to a gadolinium chelate [SBK 2 -Tris-(Gd-DOTA) 3] to test whether the SBK 2 probe could be developed as an MR molecular imaging probe. When intravenously injected into mice bearing flank tumors of human glioma cells, SBK 2 -Tris-(Gd-DOTA) 3 labeled the tumors within 5 minutes with a high level of contrast for up to 2 hours post-injection. The contrast enhancement of SBK 2 -Tris-(Gd-DOTA) 3 was significantly higher than that observed with a current MRI macrocyclic gadolinium chelate (<b>Gadoteridol,</b> ProHance) alone or a scrambled control. These results demonstrate that SBK 2 -Tris-(Gd-DOTA) 3 labeling of the PTPµ extracellular fragment is a more specific MR molecular imaging probe than ProHance or a scrambled control. Consequently, the SBK 2 probe may be more useful than the current gold standard reagent for MRI to identify tumors and to co-register tumor borders during surgical resection...|$|E
40|$|A {{picosecond}} infrared laser (PIRL) {{is capable}} of cutting through biological tissues {{in the absence of}} significant thermal damage. As such, PIRL is a standalone surgical scalpel with the added bonus of minimal postoperative scar tissue formation. In this work, a tandem of PIRL ablation with electrospray ionization (PIR-LAESI) mass spectrometry is demonstrated and characterized for tissue molecular imaging, with a limit of detection in the range of 100 nM for reserpine or better than 5 nM for verapamil in aqueous solution. We characterized PIRL crater size using agar films containing Rhodamine. PIR-LAESI offers a 20 – 30 μm vertical resolution (∼ 3 μm removal per pulse) and a lateral resolution of ∼ 100 μm. We were able to detect 25 fmol of Rhodamine in agar ablation experiments. PIR-LAESI was used to map the distribution of endogenous methoxykaempferol glucoronide in zebra plant (Aphelandra squarrosa) leaves producing a localization map that is corroborated by the literature. PIR-LAESI was further used to image the distribution inside mouse kidneys of <b>gadoteridol,</b> an exogenous magnetic resonance contrast agent intravenously injected. Parallel mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) using desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) were performed to corroborate PIR-LAESI images of the exogenous agent. We further show that PIR-LAESI {{is capable of}} desorption ionization of proteins as well as phospholipids. This comparative study illustrates that PIR-LAESI is an ion source for ambient mass spectrometry applications. As such, a future PIRL scalpel combined with secondary ionization such as ESI and mass spectrometry has the potential to provide molecular feedback to guide PIRL surgery...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveMicro-computed {{tomography}} (microCT) imaging has {{the potential}} to allow the three-dimensional (3 D) visualization of cartilage morphology. However, cartilage intensity on a microCT image is weak because cartilage does not strongly attenuate X-rays. This work was designed to demonstrate that exposure of cartilage to charged gadolinium compounds modifies the intensity to allow an improved visualization of cartilage morphology and the determination of proteoglycan content. DesignTrypsin was used to deplete proteoglycan in bovine nasal cartilage disks. Disks were then exposed to Gd 3 +, gadopentetate (Gd–DTPA 2 −), or <b>gadoteridol</b> (Gd–HP–DO 3 A), and imaged with microCT. The intensities of the disks were measured from the images and compared to the actual proteoglycan content determined with a dimethylmethylene blue assay. ResultsTreatment of naïve disks with 200 mM Gd 3 + for 24 h at room temperature produced a 2. 8 -fold increase in intensity on microCT images. Similar treatment with 200 mM Gd–DTPA 2 − produced a 1. 4 -fold increase. After 2 h of trypsin treatment at room temperature, the intensities of cartilage disks exposed to 200 mM Gd 3 + decreased by 12 %. Conversely, the intensities of trypsin-treated disks exposed to 200 mM Gd–DPTA 2 − increased by 15 %. Trypsin treatment caused a 4 % increase in the intensities of disks exposed to neutral Gd–HP–DO 3 A. The correlation between proteoglycan content and the microCT intensity of cartilage treated with Gd 3 + was very good (r 2 = 0. 81). ConclusionsGadolinium and microCT allow an improved 3 D visualization of cartilage and quantification of its proteoglycan content...|$|E
