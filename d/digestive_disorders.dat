5|$|Demand for bismuth {{was small}} prior to World War II and was {{pharmaceutical}} – bismuth compounds {{were used to}} treat such conditions as <b>digestive</b> <b>disorders,</b> sexually transmitted infections and burns. Minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for fire sprinkler systems and fuse wire. During World War II bismuth was considered a strategic material, used for solders, fusible alloys, medications and atomic research. To stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound (2.75 $/kg) {{during the war and}} at $2.25 per pound (4.96 $/kg) from 1950 until 1964.|$|E
5|$|If {{symptoms}} develop {{during the}} acute phase, they usually resolve spontaneously within three {{to eight weeks}} in approximately 90% of individuals. Although the symptoms resolve, even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase. Of individuals with chronic Chagas disease, 60–80% will never develop symptoms (called indeterminate chronic Chagas disease), while the remaining 20–40% will develop life-threatening heart and/or <b>digestive</b> <b>disorders</b> during their lifetime (called determinate chronic Chagas disease). In 10% of individuals, the disease progresses directly from the acute form to a symptomatic clinical form of chronic Chagas disease.|$|E

25|$|Though not common, Leonbergers do inherit and/or {{develop a}} number of {{diseases}} that range in their impact from mild to devastating. In addition to hip dysplasia, Leonbergers can inherit and/or develop heart problems, Inherited Leonberger Paralysis/Polyneuropathy (ILPN), osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, Osteochondrosis Dissecans, allergies, <b>digestive</b> <b>disorders,</b> cataracts, entropion/ectropion eyelids, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), perianal fistulas, and thyroid disorders. Though rumors persist of Leonbergers being more sensitive to anesthesia than other breeds of dog, they are largely untrue. Leonbergers, like other large breed dogs, require less dosage per pound of sedative than smaller breeds to yield the same effect. The Leonberger Health Foundation, a private nonprofit foundation whose sole mission is to support major researchers who are seeking to identify genetic markers for serious diseases which affect the breed, is currently focusing on osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and Leonberger Polyneuropathy.|$|E

25|$|The {{ecosystems}} of the Aral Sea and {{the river}} deltas feeding into it have been nearly destroyed, not least because of the much higher salinity. The receding sea has left huge plains covered with salt and toxic chemicals resulting from weapons testing, industrial projects, and pesticides and fertilizer runoff. These substances form wind-borne toxic dust that spreads throughout the region. As a result, the land around the Aral Sea is heavily polluted, and {{the people living in}} the area are suffering from a lack of fresh water and health problems, including high rates of certain forms of cancer and lung diseases. Respiratory illnesses, including tuberculosis (most of which is drug resistant) and cancer, <b>digestive</b> <b>disorders,</b> anaemia, and infectious diseases are common ailments in the region. Liver, kidney, and eye problems can also be attributed to the toxic dust storms. All of this has resulted in an unusually high fatality rate among vulnerable parts of the population: the child mortality rate is 75 in every 1,000 newborns, and maternity death is 12 in every 1,000 women. The dust storms also contribute to water shortages through salt deposition, which has accelerated glacial melting to as much as 12 times the normal rate. The overuse of pesticides on crops to preserve yields has made this worse, with pesticide use far beyond health limits. Crops in the region are destroyed by salt being deposited onto the land, and fields are being flushed with water at least four times per day to try to remove the salinity from the soils. The dust storms make regional winters colder, and summers hotter.|$|E
