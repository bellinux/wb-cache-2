5|$|Division II works {{similarly}} to Division I, with two six-team groups where group 'A' promotes one team to Division I and group 'B' exchanges its last placed team with Division III. Division III is now composed of {{one group of}} six, and <b>if</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> six nations register for this, the lowest level, then a qualification tournament will be held.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{barometric}} {{pressure and the}} pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) {{have been used in}} forecasting since the late 19th century. The larger the change in pressure, especially <b>if</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> , the larger the change in weather can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a low pressure system is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain. Rapid pressure rises are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.|$|E
5|$|The 2005season marks {{only the}} eighthtime in 50years that exactly twoteams {{have gone into}} the bowl season undefeated. This {{has been a major}} {{criticism}} of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Unless there are exactly two unbeaten teams, both from BCS conferences, the choice of the top twoteams can generate controversy. <b>If</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twoundefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams will be left out.|$|E

5|$|The {{year and}} a day rule was {{abolished}} in England and Wales by the Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1996. As a matter of practice, the defendant may already have been prosecuted for the initial offence (for example, another offence against the person). Accordingly, the Attorney General's consent is required <b>if</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three years has elapsed, or where the defendant has already been prosecuted in the circumstances alleged to {{have resulted in the}} victim's death.|$|E
5|$|A {{few other}} non-essential heavy metals {{have one or}} more toxic forms. Kidney failure and {{fatalities}} have been recorded arising from the ingestion of germanium dietary supplements (~15 to 300g in total consumed {{over a period of}} two months to three years). Exposure to osmium tetroxide (OsO4) may cause permanent eye damage and can lead to respiratory failure and death. Indium salts are toxic <b>if</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> few milligrams are ingested and will affect the kidneys, liver, and heart. Cisplatin (PtCl2(NH3)2), which is an important drug used to kill cancer cells, is also a kidney and nerve poison. Bismuth compounds can cause liver damage if taken in excess; insoluble uranium compounds, as well as the dangerous radiation they emit, can cause permanent kidney damage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the world}} of Chocobo Racing, Magic Stones are {{scattered}} throughout each course, and can {{be picked up by}} the player by driving through them. Magic Stones can also be stolen from opponent players by bumping into another player. The player can then activate the Magic Stone for some special effect. Activating a Haste Stone, for example, gives the character a short speed boost. In some Magic Stones, the power of the stone increases <b>if</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one of the same stone is picked up by the player. Each stone is represented by a corresponding symbol on the racetrack, while stones marked with question marks represent random Magic Stones, which grant the player either a Haste Stone, Fire Stone, Ice Stone, Thunder Stone, Minimize Stone, Reflect Stone, Doom Stone, or Ultima Stone.|$|E

5|$|The Sabor {{meets in}} public {{sessions}} in two periods; the first from 15 January to 30 June, {{and the second}} from 15 September to 15 December. Extra sessions can be called by the President of the Republic, {{by the president of}} the parliament or by the government. The powers of the legislature include enactment and amendment of the constitution, enactment of laws, adoption of the state budget, declarations of war and peace, alteration of the country's boundaries, calling and conducting referenda and elections, appointments and relief of office, supervising the work of the Government of Croatia and other holders of public powers responsible to the Sabor, and granting amnesty.

5|$|The {{constitution}} {{makes no}} mention of a lieutenant governor; if the governorship becomes vacant, the Senate President acts as governor. <b>If</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one year remains in the governor's term at the time of vacancy, a new election is held; otherwise, the Senate President serves the remainder of the term. A bill passed in 2000 grants the Senate President the honorary title of Lieutenant Governor, but this title is rarely used in practice and the terms of the Senate President do not correspond with governorships. The same bill states that the line of succession after the Senate President will be the Speaker of the House of Delegates, followed by the state attorney general, the state auditor and former governors, in inverse order of term, that are in residence in the state {{at the time of the}} vacancy.|$|E
5|$|City's unbeaten run was {{extended}} to six games when David Brown scored on his debut to beat Macclesfield Town 1–0. The run {{came to an end}} with consecutive 2–1 defeats to Bury and Rochdale. On 20 February 2008, David Wetherall, who had played nearly 300league games for City since he joined in 1999, announced he would retire {{at the end of the}} season. City won their first win in three games when they beat Notts County for the second time in as many months, with a 3–1 win. Three days later City added a second consecutive win by defeating Rotherham United 3–2 in the game which had been postponed in December, with Lee Bullock scoring his first goal for the club. The same day, club chairman Julian Rhodes announced a new season ticket offer in a bid to fill more of the 25,000-seater stadium for the following season by offering free tickets <b>if</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 9,000adult tickets were bought.|$|E

5|$|Granule cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the granule cell population activity state is the same as {{the information in the}} mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are so small and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. The idea is that with each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond <b>if</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E
5|$|Lions are {{the most}} {{socially}} inclined of all wild felids, most of which remain quite solitary in nature, and have two types of social organisation. Some lions are residents, living in groups of related lionesses, their mates, and offspring. Such a group is called a pride. Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females. Membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses, although some females do leave and become nomadic. Although extremely large prides, consisting of up over 30 individuals, have been observed, the average pride consists of around fifteen lions; including several adult females, up to four males (known as a coalition <b>if</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one) and their cubs of both sexes. The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion pride which always has just one adult male. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around 2–3 years of age. The second organisational behaviour is labeled nomads, who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs. Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrous may allow nomad males to approach them.|$|E
5|$|The host {{city for}} an Olympic Games is usually chosen {{seven to eight}} years ahead of their celebration. The process of {{selection}} is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; <b>if</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can {{be presented to the}} International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organisation of the Olympic Games. In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.|$|E

5|$|The third {{multiplayer}} mode is the Combat Simulator, involving {{up to four}} human {{players and}} eight computer-controlled players. Again, a split-screen is used <b>if</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one human is playing. If three or four humans play, the screen is divided into quarters, with one quarter left blank if necessary. Players enter the game unarmed and {{with a certain amount}} of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the level in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the level, once again unarmed. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by killing their respective enemies, to objective-based games, such as Capture the Flag or King of the Hill. Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a gametype where players score points by hacking a computer system using a data uplink. Aspects of each game can be customised, including the chosen map, the weapons available, and the winning conditions. Players can also be grouped into teams or compete individually. In a team game, the players can optionally be shown coloured according to their team. Each game can be customised to a greater degree than was possible in GoldenEye 007s multiplayer mode, such as free weapons selection and placement of shields.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} states, New Jersey imposes no {{restrictions}} on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase. Grain alcohol, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, and absinthe can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content of beer or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import any amount of alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required <b>if</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 3 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or a half-gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year. No permit is required, but any brewing or winemaking must take place at a private home or non-commercial property, and any beer and wine produced cannot be sold. It is a criminal offense to possess an unregistered still, or distill any amount of hard liquor.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective To {{evaluate}} tendinopathy of the pectoralis major {{muscle in}} weightlifting athletes using ultrasound and elastography. Methods This study included 20 patients, 10 with rupture of the pectoralis major muscle and 10 control patients. We evaluated pectoralis major muscle contralateral tendon with ultrasonographic and elastography examinations. The ultrasonographic examinations were performed using a high-resolution B mode ultrasound device. The elastography evaluation was classified into three patterns: (A), <b>if</b> stiff (<b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50 % area with blue staining); (B), <b>if</b> intermediate (<b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50 % green); and (C), <b>if</b> softened (<b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50 % red). Results Patients&# 8217; {{mean age was}} 33 ± 5. 3 years. The presence of tendinous injury measured by ultrasound had a significant different (p= 0. 0055), because 80 % of cases had tendinous injury versus 10 % in the Control Group. No significant differences were seen between groups related with change in elastography (p= 0. 1409). Conclusion Long-term bodybuilders had ultrasound image with <b>more</b> tendinous injury <b>than</b> those in Control Group. There was no statistical significance regarding change in tendon elasticity compared with Control Group...|$|R
