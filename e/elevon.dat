25|$|Similar to the H.IIIa, {{but with}} outer <b>elevon</b> not {{extending}} to the wing tip. Selected for production, nine were completed by 1941.|$|E
25|$|During {{the time}} the F-102A was in service, several new wing designs were used to {{experiment}} with the application of increased conical camber to the wings. Ultimately, a design was selected that actually increased <b>elevon</b> area, reduced takeoff speed, improved the supersonic L/D ratio and increased the aircraft's ceiling to 56,000ft (17,069m). A modification was required to the landing gear doors due to the wing redesign.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacturers}} have carried out {{tests on the}} early Eurofighter prototypes to optimise the low observability characteristics of the aircraft from the early 1990s. Testing at BAE's Warton facility on the DA4 prototype measured the RCS of the aircraft and investigated {{the effects of a}} variety of RAM coatings and composites. Another measure to reduce the likelihood of discovery is the use of passive sensors, which minimises the radiation of treacherous electronic emissions. While canards generally have poor stealth characteristics, the flight control system is designed to maintain the <b>elevon</b> trim and canards at an angle at which they have the smallest RCS.|$|E
50|$|<b>Elevons</b> are {{installed}} {{on each side}} of the aircraft at the trailing edge of the wing. When moved in the same direction (up or down) they will cause a pitching force (nose up or nose down) to be applied to the airframe. When moved differentially, (one up, one down) they will cause a rolling force to be applied. These forces may be applied simultaneously by appropriate positioning of the <b>elevons</b> e.g. one wing's <b>elevons</b> completely down and the other wing's <b>elevons</b> partly down.|$|R
50|$|Early {{examples}} used a {{patented system}} in which the wingtips pivoted to act as slab <b>elevons</b> providing control in pitch and roll, while later types had more conventional <b>elevons</b> in the wing trailing edge.|$|R
25|$|Northrop's Chief Test Pilot Vance Breese {{flew the}} N-1M on its maiden flight, {{unexpectedly}} bouncing {{into the air}} during a planned high-speed taxi run. He reported that the aircraft could fly no higher than five feet off the ground. Flight could only be sustained by maintaining a precise angle of attack, but Theodore von Kármán solved the problem by making adjustments to the trailing edges of the <b>elevons.</b> Control of the aircraft was achieved {{through the use of}} a system of <b>elevons</b> and wingtip rudders. The <b>elevons</b> served in tailless type aircraft both as elevators and ailerons, while split flaps on the downward angled wingtips took the place of a conventional rudder; they were later straightened after that angle proved unnecessary during flight testing.|$|R
500|$|High-pressure {{hydraulic}} system using 28 MPa (4,000lbf/in²) for lighter hydraulic components, tripled independent systems ("Blue", [...] "Green", and [...] "Yellow") for redundancy, with an emergency {{ram air turbine}} (RAT) stored in the port-inner <b>elevon</b> jack fairing supplying [...] "Green" [...] and [...] "Yellow" [...] as backup.|$|E
2500|$|The H.III {{series was}} an {{incremental}} {{development of the}} Horten H.II with reduced sweepback of 23°, span increased to 20 m (65ft 7 in) and modified lateral controls. [...] The wing trailing edges had three movable surfaces; the innermost was a landing flap, but the outer pair were geared differential elevons with the outer <b>elevon</b> having a large upward deflection and only slight downward movement, conversely, the inner <b>elevon</b> had large downward movement and slight upward movement.|$|E
2500|$|This {{arrangement}} reduced unfavourable yawing moments due to aileron {{by making}} use of differential aileron movement, but avoided the change in longitudinal trim by the opposing differential of the inner flap pair. In high speed flight the nose down trim was provided mainly by the inner <b>elevon</b> section moving downwards, the outer flap deflecting only slightly; this {{had the advantage of}} relieving the tips of torsional loads at high speed. [...] Drag rudders, similar to airbrakes fitted in modern gliders, were fitted near the wingtips, providing yaw control similar to those used in the H.II.|$|E
5000|$|Chyeranovskii {{designed}} {{an enlarged}} BICh-3, at approximately 1.5 scale, with tandem open cockpits, underslung <b>elevons</b> (à la Junkers) centreline mono-wheel, wing-tip rudders with skids with no tail. Flight testing commenced in 1929 but was soon halted {{due to the}} very poor handling characteristics which rendered the BICh-7 almost impossible to take-off.The BICh-7 was completely re-built as the BICh-7A, modifications included: enclosed tandem cockpits, a conventional style tail-skid undercarriage, and a fin with rudder faired into {{the rear of the}} cockpit nacelle.Flight tests resumed, in , with much improved handling other than excessive speed loss when turning and engine vibration. The speed loss was attributed to interference between the large <b>elevons</b> and the rudder and was alleviated by adding breaker strips to the <b>elevons</b> and setting them at a lower incidence.|$|R
50|$|The {{swept wing}} has control {{surfaces}} {{along the entire}} trailing edge: flaps occupy the inner 42%, and <b>elevons</b> take up 58% of the outer span. The Swift has no vertical stabilizer and so faces the need for directional stability in yaw. This is addressed by winglets and the models with an enclosed cockpit also have conventional fuselage stabilising surfaces that contribute to yaw stability. The winglets on the 1990 prototype were fixed surfaces, so the pilot effected turns using the <b>elevons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several {{technology}} {{research and}} development efforts exist to integrate the functions of aircraft flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, <b>elevons</b> and flaps into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of less: mass, cost, drag, inertia (for faster, stronger control response), complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and radar cross section for stealth. However, the main drawback {{is that when the}} <b>elevons</b> move up in unison to raise the pitch of the aircraft, generating additional lift, they reduce the camber, or downward curvature of the wing. Camber is desirable when generating high levels of lift, and so <b>elevons</b> reduce the maximum lift and efficiency of a wing. These may be used in many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 6th generation fighter aircraft. Two promising approaches are flexible wings, and fluidics.|$|R
2500|$|In December 1944, {{the first}} JB-1 {{was ready for}} launch. The missile was {{launched}} by a rocket-propelled sled along a 150m (500ft) long track, but seconds after release the JB-1 pitched up into a stall and crashed. This was caused by an incorrectly calculated <b>elevon</b> setting for take-off, but the JB-1 program was subsequently stopped, mainly because the performance and reliability of the GE B1 turbojet engines were far below expectations. [...] In addition, the cost to produce the Ford copy of the Argus pulse-jet engine of the JB-2 was {{much less than the}} GE turbojets. Subsequently, work proceeded on the JB-2 for final development and production.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wheel in}} the two-seat cabin {{controlled}} the Arrowbile {{both on the}} road and in the air. [...] Outer wing elevons moved together to alter pitch and differentially to bank. [...] The rudders, interconnected with the elevons when the wheel was turned, moved only outwards, so in a turn only the inner rudder was used, both adjusting yaw as normal and assisting the <b>elevon</b> in depressing the inner wing tip. This system had been used on the Arrowplane as a safety feature to avoid the commonly fatal spin out of climb and turn from take-off accident but the raked rudder hinge of the Arrowbile provided the banking component even from a nose-down attitude. [...] There were no conventional flaps or wing mounted airbrakes but the rudders could be operated as brakes by opening them outwards together with a control independent of the wheel. The cabin interior was designed to motor car standards, with easy access and a baggage space under the seats.|$|E
2500|$|While its {{performance}} and design were exceptional and appreciated, {{it was never}} easy to fly. This {{was caused by the}} 60° leading edge sweepback of its wing and was inherent in these types of delta wing platforms. It required a much higher angle of attack than a conventional aircraft, up to 9.4° at Mach 0.5 at low altitudes. If the angle of attack was too high, in excess of 17°, the bomber could pitch up and enter a spin. Several factors could prevent a successful recovery: if the pilot applied <b>elevon,</b> if the center of gravity was not correctly positioned, or if the spin occurred below , recovery might not be possible. The B-58 also had stall characteristics that were not conventional. If the nose was elevated, the bomber maintained forward motion without pitching down. Unless large amounts of power were applied, the descent rate increased rapidly. Another problem pilots faced was called [...] "fuel stacking" [...] and took place when the B-58 accelerated or decelerated. It was due to fuel moving in the tanks and causing sudden changes in the center of gravity. This could cause the aircraft to pitch or bank and subsequently lose control. The B-58 was very difficult to safely recover from the loss of an engine at supersonic cruise due to differential thrust.|$|E

40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Mach numbers (M) from 1. 6 to 4. 5 to define the control effectiveness of a lifting-body configuration (HL- 20) in the supersonic speed range. The lifting body is being considered as a possible future crewed spacecraft. The configuration has a low aspect ratio body with a flat undersurface. Three fins, a small centerline fin and two outboard tip fins set at dihedral angles (Γ) of 50 °, are mounted on the aft body. The control surfaces consist of <b>elevons</b> on the outboard fins and four body flaps, two on the upper and two on the lower aft body. An all movable center fin was used for yaw control. Tests were made with <b>elevons</b> and body flaps deflected to ± 30 ° and the center fin deflected to 5 °. Almost full negative body flap deflection was required to trim the HL- 20 (moment reference center at 0. 54 -percent body length from nose) to positive values of lift in the M range from approximately 1. 6 to 2. 5. <b>Elevons</b> were about twice as effective as body flaps. The <b>elevons</b> were effective as a roll control, but because of Γ, they produced about as much adverse yawing moment as favorable rolling moment. The body flaps produced less rolling moment and much less adverse yawing moment than the <b>elevons.</b> The yaw effectiveness of the all movable center fin was essentially constant over the angle of attack range at each M. The value of yawing moment, however, was small. Center-fin deflection produce...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard <b>elevons,</b> varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost <b>elevons,</b> which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|R

50|$|The {{right and}} left ailerons move in {{opposite}} directions. However, aileron control will often use two channels to enable mixing of other functions on the transmitter. For example, when they both move downward {{they can be used}} as flaps (flaperons), or when they both move upward, as spoilers (spoilerons). Delta winged aircraft designs commonly lack a separate elevator, its function being mixed with the ailerons and the combined control surfaces being known as <b>elevons.</b> V-tail mixing, needed for such full-scale aircraft designs as the Beechcraft Bonanza, when modeled as RC scale miniatures, is also done in a similar manner as <b>elevons</b> and flaperons.|$|R

50|$|The FPG-9 Foam Plate Glider is a simple, hand-launched glider {{made from}} a 9 inch foam dinner plate, {{featuring}} a moveable rudder and <b>elevons,</b> allowing for an inexpensive way to teach basic flight mechanics.|$|R
50|$|Control was {{achieved}} with <b>elevons</b> and spoilers. The control system included both long-span (inboard) and short-span (outboard) spoilers, with the smaller outboard spoilers activated first. This system gave a smoother and more graceful control of yaw than would a single-spoiler system.|$|R
50|$|The prototypes flew {{originally}} with <b>elevons</b> on the canard {{for both}} {{pitch and roll}} control but the design was changed to pitch control with the canard elevators and roll control with mid span wing ailerons after a few aircraft were built.|$|R

50|$|The {{pilot and}} flight test {{engineer}} were accommodated in two separate cockpits protruding from the top surface of the wing centre section with the pilot in the port cockpit and test engineer in the starboard cockpit.A comprehensive instrumentation package was fitted, with automatic recording of time, airspeed, altitude, wing tip incidence, flap angle, side-slip, roll rate, pitch rate, yaw rate, <b>elevon</b> hinge moment, <b>elevon</b> angles, rudder angles, ambient air temperature, normal acceleration (gy), longitudinal acceleration (gz), gyro attitude, pendulum attitude and bank angle. In addition radio transmissions from the pilot and test engineer were recorded on the ground.|$|E
50|$|An {{aircraft}} with elevons {{is controlled}} {{as though the}} pilot still has separate aileron and elevator surfaces at his disposal, controlled by the yoke or stick. The inputs of the two controls are mixed either mechanically or electronically to provide the appropriate position for each <b>elevon.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{mid-mounted}} wings {{would have}} been swept back 23.4°, housing the stalky retractable main landing gear with <b>elevons</b> inboard and ailerons outboard on the trailing edge. Slots in the outboard leading edges would have improved slow speed performance and handling.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{for both}} the Shuttle and the HL-42, as the {{airspeed}} dropped below Mach 3.5 with denser air and a lower angle of attack, the rudder would begin to meet the airflow and take over yaw control from the RCS. From here until landing the HL-42 would behave more like a normal aircraft, controlled mainly by <b>elevons</b> and rudder, with some roll control from the lower body flaps. At lower speeds the upper body flaps, moving together, could also assist the <b>elevons</b> in controlling pitch (at higher speeds they {{would be out of}} the airflow and ineffective). After touchdown the upper body flaps would be extended together with the lower body flaps to serve as air-brakes.|$|R
5000|$|The A.W.52 was {{intended}} for high speeds and was an all-metal turbojet-powered aircraft, with a retractable undercarriage; aerodynamically it had {{much in common with}} the glider. Both aircraft were moderately-swept flying wings with a centre section having a straight trailing edge. The wing tips carried small (not full chord) end-plate fin and rudders, which operated differentially, with a greater angle on the outer one. Roll and pitch were controlled with <b>elevons</b> that extended inward from the wing tips over most (in the case of the A.W.52 about three-quarters) of the outer, swept part of the trailing edge. The <b>elevons</b> moved together as elevators and differentially as ailerons. They were quite complicated surfaces - which included trim tabs - and hinged not from the wing but from [...] "correctors", which were wing-mounted; the correctors provided pitch trim. To delay tip stall, air was sucked out of a slot {{just in front of the}} <b>elevons,</b> by pumps powered by undercarriage-mounted fans on the glider and directly from the engine in the A.W.52. The inner centre section wing carried Fowler flaps and the upper surface of the outer section carried spoilers.|$|R
