It makes for an odd, charmless second chapter to a first that includes miraculous recordings like 'Billie Jean,' 'The Way You Make Me Feel,' 'Black or White' and 'Beat It.' In relation to [...] "This Time Around", Hunter {{described it as a}} [...] "dynamite jam" [...] that's [...] "ripe for remixes" [...] and described [...] "Scream" [...] and [...] "Tabloid Junkie," [...] as being [...] "adventurous" [...] while noting that [...] "Earth Song" [...] as a [...] "noble sentiments" [...] that sounds [...] "primarily like a showpiece". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News gave the album a generally mixed review and commented that he would give the album's first disc three stars if it was released on its own. Jon Pareles of The New York Times believed that Jackson [...] "muttered" [...] lyrics such as [...] "They thought they really had control of me". Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times said of [...] "This Time Around", [...] "a tough, rhythm-guitar-driven track co-written and co-produced by hit-maker Dallas Austin that sports one of the album's better grooves".|$|E

40|$|Few {{studies have}} focused on the care setting {{transitions}} that occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life. People living in rural areas may have more difficult care setting transitions and also more moves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life as health changes occur. A mixed-methods study was conducted to gain an understanding of the number and implications or impact of care setting transitions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life for rural Canadians. Rural Albertans had significantly more healthcare setting transitions than urbanites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life (M= 4. 2 vs 3. 3). Online family respondents reported 8 moves on average occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life. These moves were most often identified (65 %) on a likert-type scale as “very difficult,” with the free text information revealing these trips were often emotionally painful for themselves and physically painful for the decedent. Eleven informants were then interviewed until data saturation, with constant-comparative data analysis conducted. Moving from place to place for needed care <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life was identified as common and concerning for rural people and their families, with three data themes developing: (a) needed care <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life is scattered across many places, (b) traveling is very difficult for terminally-ill persons and their caregivers, and (c) local rural services are minimal. These findings indicate planning is needed to avoid unnecessary end-of-life care setting transitions and to make needed moves for essential services <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life less costly, stressful, and socially disruptive for rural people and their families. </p...|$|R

They were agents for several obscure makes of bicycle,--two samples constituted the stock,--and occasionally they effected a sale; they also repaired punctures and did their best--though luck was not always on their side--with any other repairing that was brought to them. They handled a line of cheap gramophones, and did a little with musical boxes.|$|E

60|$|In the {{intervening}} years the Movement had had ups and downs; it had had a boom, which had ended abruptly in a complete loss of voice for Aunt Plessington--she had tried to run it on a patent non-stimulating food, and then it had entangled itself with a new cult of philanthropic theosophy from which it had been extracted with difficulty and in a damaged condition. It had never completely recovered from that unhappy association. Latterly Aunt Plessington had lost her nerve, and she had taken to making calls upon people with considerable and sometimes embarrassing demand for support, urging them to join committees, take chairs, stake reputations, speak and act as foils for her. If they refused she lost her temper very openly and frankly, and became industriously vindictive. She circulated scandals or created them. Her old assurance had deserted her; the strangulated contralto was losing its magic power, she felt, in this degenerating England it had ruled so long. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> so she had become extremely snappy with Uncle Hubert. She ascribed much of the Movement's futility to the decline of his administrative powers and the increasing awkwardness of his gestures, and she did her utmost to keep {{him up to the}} mark. Her only method of keeping him up to the mark was to jerk the bit. She had now come to compel Marjorie to address a meeting that was to inaugurate a new phase in the Movement's history, and she wanted Marjorie because she particularly wanted a daring, liberal, and spiritually amorous bishop, who had once told her with a note of profound conviction that Marjorie was a very beautiful woman. She was so intent upon her purpose that she scarcely noticed Trafford. He slipped from the room unobserved under cover of her playful preliminaries, and went to the untidy little apartment overhead which served in that house as his study. He sat down at the big desk, pushed his methodically arranged papers back, and drummed on the edge with his fingers.|$|E
