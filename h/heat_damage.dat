The item was then placed in a specific area of a hangar at CFB Shearwater, based on a grid system representing the various sections of the plane. All items not considered significant to the crash were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was weighed {{and moved to a}} custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, the item was documented, photographed, and kept in the active examination hangar.

Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the impact}} in New Jersey was from the high tides, which caused the worst {{flooding}} in 30years in some locations. In Hoboken, high tides flooded portions of the New York City Subway and Port Authority Trans-Hudson systems, leaving them closed for a few days. High tides destroyed portions of the boardwalks in Bradley Beach and Belmar, and also destroyed a century-old fishing pier in Ocean Grove. Flooding closed portions of roads across North Jersey, including the Garden State Parkway near Cheesequake State Park and six state highways. At Newark International Airport, dozens of flights were canceled. The storm left 102,000customers of Jersey Central Power & Light without power. Damage to short circuits caused house fires in Monmouth County. Damage was heaviest near Raritan, Newark, and Sandy Hook along Raritan Bay. High winds in Jersey City destroyed the roof of an apartment; the debris struck and killed a woman walking along a nearby sidewalk. Throughout the state, the nor'easter damaged about 3,200homes, primarily in Monmouth and Ocean counties, and caused an estimated $750million in damage (1992USD). Then-governor Jim Florio {{declared a state of}} emergency and activated the New Jersey National Guard. About 19,000people were evacuated in six towns in Monmouth County. Statewide, about 2,000people in 20towns had to be evacuated by helicopter or National Guard truck. The American Red Cross opened at least 30shelters across the state, housing over 5,000people affected by floods or lack of <b>heat.</b> <b>Damage</b> in the state was less than the nor'easter of 1962 due to 30years of disaster mitigation, including beach replenishment, dune construction, and improved building codes.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>damaged</b> {{wines are}} often casually {{referred}} to as cooked, which suggests how heat can affect a wine. They are also known as maderized wine, from Madeira wine, which is intentionally exposed to heat. [...] The ideal storage temperature for wine is generally accepted to be 13°C (55°F). Wines that are stored at temperatures greatly higher than this will experience an increased aging rate. Wines exposed to extreme temperatures will thermally expand, and may even push up between the cork and bottle and leak from the top. When opening a bottle of wine, if a trace of wine is visible {{along the length of}} the cork, the cork is partially pushed out of the bottle, or wine is visible on the top of the cork while it is still in the bottle, it has most likely been <b>heat</b> <b>damaged.</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>damaged</b> wines often become oxidized, and red wines may take on a brick color.|$|R

Heating {{provides}} a reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, {{but it is not}} always appropriate if it will damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, fiber optics, electronics, and many plastics. In these situations chemicals, either as gases or in liquid form, can be used as sterilants. While the use of gas and liquid chemical sterilants avoids the problem of <b>heat</b> <b>damage,</b> users must ensure that article to be sterilized is chemically compatible with the sterilant being used. In addition, the use of chemical sterilants poses new challenges for workplace safety, as the properties that make chemicals effective sterilants usually make them harmful to humans.|$|E

Latex, nitrile rubber or vinyl disposable gloves are often worn by health care professionals as hygiene and contamination protection measures. Police officers often wear them to work in crime scenes to prevent destroying evidence in the scene. Many criminals wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, which makes the crime investigation more difficult. However, the gloves themselves can leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting glove prints, law enforcement can then match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence. In many jurisdictions the act of wearing gloves itself while committing a crime can be prosecuted as an inchoate offense.|$|E

Tracked vehicles such as tanks or APCs can lose their tracks as a result of damage, but may continue moving even though there is no way for the drive sprockets to propel the vehicle. Exposed gas cans on Humvees can be shot in order to detonate their contents, which usually results in the explosion of the vehicle. While burning, destroyed vehicles will cause proximity <b>heat</b> <b>damage</b> to objects and characters.

2500|$|Jet blast {{deflectors}} aboard {{aircraft carriers}} {{are placed in}} very {{close proximity to the}} [...] temperatures of modern jet fighter exhaust. The non-skid decking surface of the deflector suffers <b>heat</b> <b>damage</b> and requires frequent maintenance or replacement. Additionally, the hot deflector surface cannot be used as normal decking until it has cooled enough to allow aircraft tires to roll over it. To mitigate the heat problem, active cooling systems were installed in the 1970s, tapping the fire mains (fire suppression water systems) to use seawater circulating through water lines within the deflector panel. However, the water cooling system adds more complexity and failure points, and requires additional maintenance. The most recent method tried by the United States Navy for solving the heat problem was introduced in 2008 with USS George H.W. Bush which uses heavy-duty metal panels covered in heat-dissipating ceramic tiles similar to those used on the Space Shuttle. The tiled panels can be changed quickly and easily—the ship carries a large replacement supply. Without active water lines, the passively-tiled deflector is expected to require much less maintenance.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies on}} thermotolerance {{have been done}} in Caenorhabditis elegans in order to extend {{survival}} under heat stress; Daf- 16, a homolog of FoxO in C. elegans, was detected as the key factor in thermotolerance. However, the recovery process from <b>heat</b> stress <b>damage</b> has been seldom discussed. In this study, we analyzed the roles of FoxO/Daf- 16 on the recovery from <b>heat</b> stress <b>damage</b> by monitoring thrashing movement. Heat shock reduced the movement, which was restored by culturing at 20 °C. Thrashing movement was not restored in the daf- 16 mutant, which suggests that Daf- 16 is one of the essential factors in repairing the damage. Movement restoration was promoted in the daf- 2 mutant, a homolog of insulin/IGF- 1 -like receptor, in a daf- 16 -dependent manner. In addition, heat stress decreased the expression of daf- 28 and ins- 7, agonists of Daf- 2. Taken together, these results revealed that FoxO/Daf- 16 removes <b>heat</b> stress <b>damage</b> and restores movement via inhibition of the insulin-like signaling pathway in C. elegans, suggesting that FoxO/Daf- 16 plays a critical role in thermotolerance...|$|R
