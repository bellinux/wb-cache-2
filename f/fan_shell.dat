40|$|Coastal {{degradation}} and habitat disruption are severely compromising sessile marine species. The <b>fan</b> <b>shell</b> Pinna nobilis is an endemic, vulnerable species {{and the largest}} bivalve in the Mediterranean basin. In spite of species legal protection, <b>fan</b> <b>shell</b> populations are declining. Models analyzed the contributions of environmental (mean depth, wave height, maximum wave height, period of waves with high energy and mean direction of wave source) versus human-derived stressors (anchoring, protection status, sewage effluents, fishing activity and diving) as explanatory variables depicting Pinna nobilis populations at a mesoscale level. Human stressors were explaining most of the variability in density spatial distribution of <b>fan</b> <b>shell,</b> significantly disturbing benthic communities. Habitat protection affected P. nobilis structure and physical aggression by anchoring reveals a high impact on densities. Environmental variables instead played a secondary role, indicating that global change processes are not so relevant in coastal benthic communities as human-derived impacts.

40|$|Epifaunal {{communities}} {{associated with}} the <b>fan</b> <b>shell</b> Pinna nobilis Linnaeus, 1758 along the Tunisian coastline were investigated. Both univariate and multivariate analysis were done at different spatial scales within five populations located at different localities, three from northern and two from eastern Tunisia. The size of Pinna did not appear as the main factor affecting {{the structure of the}} associated biota, which seemed to be more influenced by (a) marine-lagoon and (b) biogeographic gradients. Patterns of similarity of sessile sclerobionts and motile epifauna were clearly different. The former assemblage best replied to lagoon-sea gradient and to locality, with three real clusters at 40 %, whereas the latter assemblage scattered widely in a non-metrical MDS plane, with two real clusters only at 20 % similarity. The spatial turnover of motile species was ten times higher than that of sessile species at a small spatial scale, being less affected by Pinna size, and three times higher though invariant at a large geographic scale. On the other hand, β-diversity of sessile species appeared to be more influenced by latitudinal (climatic) gradient at a large scale, being higher in the northern than in the eastern communities. Analysis of taxonomic (dis) similarity of the whole community detected these two sources of environmental (lagoon-sea gradient) and biogeographic (lati-longitudinal gradient) variation, although each phylum showed its peculiar pattern. In terms of Dajoz’s constancy index the majority of associated communities were dominated by rare species, and within the majority of epifaunal assemblages, the most abundant sessile epizoobiont was a bivalve mollusc. The sessile epifauna was dominated by active filterers, which led to a possible existence of trophic competition between the host and the sedentary epizoites, since both basibionts and sclerobionts occupy the same trophic niche. The <b>fan</b> <b>shell</b> played an important ecological role, providing new hard substrate to colonise, increasing the spatial heterogeneity for the surrounding soft-bottom communities, and contributing to the overall increase of the local biotope complexity level...|$|E
40|$|Environment, Trade and The Regions (now DEFRA) {{in order}} to protect species and {{habitats}} important to the integrity of UK biodiversity. The BAP highlights species and habitats requiring immediate conservation action, and was initially recommended to government by a consortium of marine biologists, conservationists, government agencies and departments. For some plans it also provides targets for conservation action and for stable population numbers in the field. There are 38 BAPs for marine species and habitats, and amongst them three for marine molluscs, including a pinnid bivalve mollusc, The <b>Fan</b> <b>Shell</b> (Atrina fragilis). Atrina fragilis naturally occurs in all UK and Eire waters between the surface and down to at least 400 m. It can grow up to 40 cm long, and is found in mud, sand and gravel habitats. They are commonly found with half to three quarters of their shell submerged in sediment (Fig. 1) ...|$|E
40|$|The post-perihelion coma {{activity}} of Comet C/ 1995 O 1 Hale-Bopp is monitored at ESO telescopes in La Silla and Paranal since Sept. 1997. Imaging through broadband filters in the visible and near-IR wavelength ranges allows {{to investigate the}} evolution of the dust coma, namely the appearance of jets, <b>fans,</b> <b>shells</b> and clouds. Long-term evolution: the comet had a porcupine-like embedded fan coma in autumn 1997 that evolved into a northern <b>fan</b> plus <b>shell</b> pattern in 1998 and remains like this since. Thus, {{the evolution of the}} coma structure post-perihelion was similar to that pre-perihelion at about the same heliocentric distances, but is occurred in reversed order. This long-term evolution can be characterized by quasi-continuous dust emission from a few (minimum 4) active regions (producing the fan structures) on the nucleus that is modulated by occasional, repetitive and short-term activity increases (generating shell features in the coma). Outbursts: a number of outbursts and unusual activity patterns occurred in the coma of the comet post-perihelion that are documented through the appearance of complex "palm-tree-like" structures of temporary nature in association with outbursts in the visual lightcurve of the comet and a series of 3 dust clouds resembling "mini-comets" and passing through the northern coma at projected velocities of 30 - 50 m/s. The similarity of coma patterns and cometary viewing geometry from Earth before and after perihelion suggests that some nuclear regions had enhanced long-term activity, possibly driven by super-volatile ices at larger (> 10 AU) heliocentric distances and that the orientation of the rotation axis of the nucleus did not change much over the past 7 years...|$|R

Such a motor can drive any farm machine ordinarily turned by hand {{at a cost of}} about 1 cent per hour for electricity. A 1 / 4 -horsepower motor costs from $ 5 to $ 18; a good reliable heavy-duty motor costs only $ 11. 50, and it will last for many years. In this time it will do dozens of chores such as pumping water, turning separators, grinding corn, driving <b>fanning</b> mills and <b>shelling</b> corn. With proper care electric motors will give years of low-cost, trouble-free service, but with improper care a motor may wear out in a year or burn out in a few minutes.

40|$|Design {{and process}} {{development}} tasks intended to demonstrate composite blade application in large high by-pass ratio turbofan engines are described. Studies on a 3. 0 aspect radio space and <b>shell</b> construction <b>fan</b> blade indicate a potential weight savings {{for a first}} stage fan rotor of 39 % when a hollow titanium spar is employed. An alternate design which featured substantial blade internal volume filled with titanium honeycomb inserts achieved a 14 % potential weight savings over the B/M rotor system. This second configuration requires a smaller development effort and entails less risk to translate a design into a successful product. The feasibility of metal joining large subsonic spar and <b>shell</b> <b>fan</b> blades was demonstrated.

40|$|The byssal {{threads of}} the <b>fan</b> <b>shell</b> Atrina pectinata are non-living {{functional}} materials intimately associated with living tissue, which provide an intriguing paradigm of bionic interface for robust load-bearing device. An interfacial load-bearing protein (A. pectinata foot protein- 1, apfp- 1) with L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) -containing and mannose-binding domains {{has been characterized}} from Atrina's foot. apfp- 1 was localized at the interface between stiff byssus and the soft tissue by immunochemical staining and confocal Raman imaging, implying that apfp- 1 is an interfacial linker between the byssus and soft tissue, that is, the DOPA-containing domain interacts with itself and other byssal proteins via Fe 3 (+) -DOPA complexes, and the mannose-binding domain interacts with the soft tissue and cell membranes. Both DOPA-and sugar-mediated bindings are reversible and robust under wet conditions. This work shows the combination of DOPA and sugar chemistry at asymmetric interfaces is unprecedented and highly relevant to bionic interface design for tissue engineering and bionic devices...|$|E

40|$|We present deep Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph South (GMOS-S) /Gemini optical {{broad-band}} {{images for}} a complete sample of 46 southern 2 Jy radio galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0. 05 <z < 0. 7). Based on them, we discuss the role of galaxy interactions in the triggering of powerful radio galaxies (PRGs). The high-quality observations presented here show {{for the first time}} that the overall majority of PRGs at intermediate redshifts (78 - 85 per cent) show peculiarities in their optical morphologies at relatively high levels of surface brightness (;). The observed morphological peculiarities include tails, <b>fans,</b> bridges, <b>shells,</b> dust lanes, irregular features, amorphous haloes and multiple nuclei. While the results for many of the galaxies are consistent with them being observed at, or after, the time of coalescence of the nuclei in a galaxy merger, we find that more than one-third of the sample are observed in a pre-coalescence phase of the merger, or following a close encounter between galaxies that will not necessarily lead to a merger. By dividing the sample into Weak-Line Radio Galaxies (WLRGs; 11 objects) and Strong-Line Radio Galaxies (SLRGs; 35 objects) we find that only 27 per cent of the former show clear evidence for interactions in their optical morphologies, in contrast to the SLRGs, of which at least 94 per cent appear interacting. This is consistent with the idea that many WLRGs are fuelled/triggered by the Bondi accretion of hot gas. However, the evidence for interactions and dust features in a fraction of them indicates that the accretion of cold gas cannot always be ruled out. Of the 28 per cent of the sample that display evidence for significant starburst activity, we find that 92 per cent present disturbed morphologies, following the same general trend as the total and SLRG samples. By comparing our PRGs with various samples of quiescent ellipticals from the literature, we conclude that the percentage of morphological disturbance that we find here exceeds that found for quiescent ellipticals when similar surface brightnesses are considered. Overall, our study indicates that galaxy interactions are likely to play a key role in the triggering of active galactic nuclei (AGN) /jet activity...|$|R
