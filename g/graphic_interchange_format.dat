40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. GIFs have {{become much more}} than they {{initially}} promised; {{they are much more}} than a format, and they are a mode of expression as well as a creative act as micro movies. Micro movies have been around since the capture of motion. Although they have gone through transformation, the principle characteristics have remained. This thesis attempts to demonstrate this through a brief media archeology with the aim to highlight what it represents today, as what they are commonly known as GIFs (<b>Graphic</b> <b>Interchange</b> <b>format).</b> The thesis also aims to highlight a significant role that micro movies have shouldered in daily life: a mode of expression in form of digital gesture. The project of the thesis is based on this idea and exhibits the common digital culture features, platforms, production and exhibition methods that we observe in GIFs which we see regularly on our daily online lives and attempts to do so with a local touch.

My work is a critical view of how an immigrant Asian woman tries to establish a friendly character in order to fit into American society. Meanwhile, whether I like it or not, what I was born with such as skin color or accent sometimes becomes an important factor that solely represents who I am. Mass media such as television and internet also help spread profiled satiric images of colored people as if what people see is truth. How representations of different ethnicities are broadcasted are recognized as the truth to public is because people are exposed to such crafted images over and over again. "Masquerade" presents my frivolous actions {{to be seen as}} an atypical Asian female in the society. My attempt with this work is to break stereotypes about Asian women and to establish an approachable character to reclaim my own identity...|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{high-profile}} examples where the patenting of a data exchange standards forced another programming group to introduce an alternative format. For instance, the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format was largely introduced to avoid the <b>Graphics</b> <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format</b> (GIF) patent problems, and Ogg Vorbis to avoid MP3. If it is discovered that these new suggested formats are themselves covered by existing patents, the final result may be a large number of incompatible formats. Creating such formats and supporting them costs money and creates inconvenience to users.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposed}} several {{methods to}} transplant the compound chaotic image encryption scheme with permutation based on 3 D baker into image formats as Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) and <b>Graphics</b> <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format</b> (GIF). The new method averts the lossy Discrete Cosine Transform and quantization and can encrypt and decrypt JPEG images lossless. Our proposed method for GIF keeps {{the property of}} animation successfully. The security test results indicate the proposed methods have high security. Since JPEG and GIF image formats are popular contemporarily, this paper shows that the prospect of chaotic image encryption is promising...|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} methods are {{implemented}} in open-source and proprietary tools, particularly LZW and its variants. Some algorithms are patented in the United States and other countries and their legal usage requires licensing by the patent holder. Because of patents on certain kinds of LZW compression, and in particular licensing practices by patent holder Unisys that many developers considered abusive, some open source proponents encouraged people to avoid using the <b>Graphics</b> <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format</b> (GIF) for compressing still image files in favor of Portable Network Graphics (PNG), which combines the LZ77-based deflate algorithm with a selection of domain-specific prediction filters. However, the patents on LZW expired on June 20, 2003.|$|R
50|$|GIF (<b>Graphics</b> <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format)</b> is {{in normal}} use limited to an 8-bit palette, or 256 colors (while 24-bit color depth is {{technically}} possible). GIF is {{most suitable for}} storing graphics with few colors, such as simple diagrams, shapes, logos, and cartoon style images, as it uses LZW lossless compression, which is more effective when large areas have a single color, and less effective for photographic or dithered images. Due to GIF's simplicity and age, it achieved almost universal software support. Due to its animation capabilities, it is still widely used to provide image animation effects, despite its low compression ratio compared to modern video formats.|$|R

40|$|The {{new image}} {{compression}} standard, JPEG 2000, provides higher compression {{rates for the}} same visual quality for grayscale and color images than JPEG. JPEG 2000 is being adopted for image compression and transmission, e. g. in mobile phones, PDAs, and wearable computers. Depending on the application, images may contain formatted text and graphics data. For graphics images at the same low bit rates, graphics compression methods, such as the <b>graphics</b> <b>interchange</b> <b>format</b> #GIF# and portable network graphics #PNG#, outperform JPEG 2000 in visual quality. In this paper, we describe problems associated with compressing graphics data with JPEG 2000, and propose modi#cations to a JPEG 2000 encoder to minimize distortion for color graphics data by using {{a model of the}} human visual system.

40|$|In this assignment, {{students}} in Introduction to Film and Media Studies performed shot-by-shot {{analysis of a}} film scene using GIF (<b>Graphics</b> <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format)</b> images in place of traditional short-by- shot analysis formats. Why use GIFS? Because they not only force students to deconstruct a film scene into its segmented layers of time and place, into individual shots and even frames (using Photoshop software, in this case), but also make the semiotic codes (e. g. use of lighting, camera distance) apparent through the repetition of movement in the completed GIF. The complete GIF can be embedded in an essay on a course site, allowing the reader to compare interpretations and analysis with the moving image, not just the still of a screen capture.

40|$|Palette {{images are}} widely used on the World Wide Web (WWW) and in game-cartridge applications. Many images used on the WWW are stored and {{transmitted}} after they are compressed losslessly with the standard <b>graphics</b> <b>interchange</b> <b>format</b> (GIF), or portable network graphics (PNG). Well-known 2 -D compression schemes, such as JPEG-LS and JPEG- 2000, fail to yield better compression than GIF or PNG {{due to the fact}} that the pixel values represent indices that point to color values in a look-up table. To improve the compression performance of JPEG-LS and JPEG- 2000 techniques, several researchers have proposed various reindexing algorithms. We investigate various compression techniques for color palette images. We propose a new technique comprised of a traveling salesman problem (TSP) -based reindexing scheme, Burrows-Wheeler transformation, and inversion ranks. We show that the proposed technique yields better compression gain on average than all the other 1 -D compressors and the reindexing schemes that utilize JPEG-LS or JPEG- 2000...|$|R

40|$|The World Wide Web has rapidly {{become the}} hot new mass {{communications}} medium.

The standard design approach is to use palettized color and to limit as much as possible the number of colors used, so that the images can be encoded with a small number of bits per pixel using the <b>Graphics</b> <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format</b> (GIF) file format. The World Wide Web standards contemplate a second data encoding method (JPEG) that allows color fidelity but usually performs poorly on text, which is a critical element of information communicated on this medium.
