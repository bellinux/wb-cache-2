5|$|Back at {{the bowling}} alley, Homer {{and his friends}} enter the bowling league competition, calling {{themselves}} the Pin Pals. They beat three teams before moving up into second place in their league. Meanwhile, Burns recovers from his stupor and discovers the check he wrote to Homer. Burns wants to join the team (replacing Otto in the team), but since Burns <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> bowler, the team is convinced they will lose the championship.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) {{asks for}} Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) help in {{adopting}} a baby, {{as the local}} adoption agency requires a reference letter from an employer. Andy promises to read her application letter, but tells the camera crew he will only sign it if she admits that she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> person in it. However, Andy is unaware that Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is using her own painful past as a non-adopted orphan to help Nellie with the process. When Andy coldly rejects Nellie's letter (which Erin helped her write), Nellie accepts his decision, but Andy is stunned to hear Erin crying sadly over the failure. He finally adds some mildly snarky but complimentary lines to her letter and signs onto it as a reference, leaving Nellie overjoyed.|$|E

500|$|In the British fleet {{there was}} much debate about how to proceed against the French. Gambier was {{concerned}} that an attack by French fireships on his fleet anchored in the Basque Roads might cause considerable destruction, and consequently ordered his captains to prepare {{to withdraw from the}} blockade at short notice should such an operation be observed. He also wrote to the Admiralty in London recommending British fireships be prepared but cautioning that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> mode of warfare, and the attempt very hazardous, if not desperate". A number of officers in the fleet, in particular Rear-Admiral Eliab Harvey, volunteered to lead such an attack, but Gambier hesitated to act, failing to take soundings of the approaches or make any practical preparations for an assault.|$|E

By April 1900, the Boer War was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable. Instead, the Queen went to Ireland {{for the first time since}} 1861, in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war.

[...] The day after the debate, Mourdock issued a statement saying, [...] "God creates life, and that was my point. God does not want rape, and by no means was I suggesting that he does. Rape <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> thing, and for anyone to twist my words otherwise is absurd and sick." [...] He later said at a press conference, [...] "I believe God controls the universe. I don't believe biology works in an uncontrolled fashion." [...] The controversy likely contributed to Mourdock's loss to Representative Joe Donnelly, and Tom LoBianco of Associated Press' The Big Story commented upon the similarities to Akin's comments.|$|E

[...] In response to criticism of the remarks, Giuliani said, [...] "Some people thought it was racist—I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother... This isn't racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism." [...] White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said he agreed with Giuliani [...] "that it was a horrible thing to say", but said he would leave it up to the people who heard Giuliani directly to assess if the remarks were appropriate for the event.

[...] He also suggested that AIDS patients should be [...] "isolated from the general population." [...] He stuck by those comments in December 2007 when asked if homosexuality is sinful. He replied, [...] "Well I believe it would be—just like lying is sinful and stealing is sinful. There {{are a lot of}} things that are sinful. It doesn't mean that a person <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> person. It means that they engage in behavior that is outside the norms of those boundaries of our traditional view of what's right and what's wrong. So, I think that anybody who has, maybe a traditional worldview of homosexuality would classify that as an unusual behavior that is not traditional and that would be outside those bounds." [...] He also defended his statements about isolation of AIDS patients, claiming that in 1992 [...] "we were still learning about the virus that causes AIDS." ...|$|E

American economist Mark Skousen praised the film, writing in Human Events, [...] "The script is true to the philosophy of Ayn Rand's novel." [...] The Weekly Standard senior editor Fred Barnes noted that the film [...] "gets Rand's point across forcefully without too much pounding", that it is [...] "fast-paced" [...] {{when compared with the}} original novel's 1200-page length, and that it is [...] "at least as relevant today as it was when the novel was published in 1957." [...] Jack Hunter, contributing editor to The American Conservative, wrote, [...] "If you ask the average film critic about the new movie adaptation of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged they will tell you it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> movie. If you ask the average conservative or libertarian they will tell you it is a great movie. Objectively, it is a mediocre movie at best. Subjectively, {{it is one of the}} best mediocre movies you'll ever see." [...] In the National Post, Peter Foster credited the movie for the daunting job of fidelity to the novel, wryly suggested a plot rewrite along the lines of comparable current events, and concluded, [...] "if it sinks without trace, its backers should at least be proud that they lost their own money." ...|$|E
