25|$|APL {{has been}} both criticized and praised for its choice of a unique, {{non-standard}} character set. Some who learn it become ardent adherents, suggesting {{that there is some}} weight behind Iverson's idea that the notation used <b>does</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference.</b> In the beginning, there were few terminal devices and even display monitors that could reproduce the APL character set—the most popular ones employing the IBM Selectric print mechanism used with a special APL type element. One of the early APL line terminals (line-mode operation only, not full screen) was the Texas Instruments TI Model 745 (circa 1977) with the full APL character set which featured half and full duplex telecommunications modes, for interacting with an APL time-sharing service or remote mainframe to run a remote computer job, called an RJE.|$|E
2500|$|In statistics, a null {{hypothesis}} {{is a statement}} that one seeks to nullify with evidence to the contrary. [...] Most commonly it is a statement that the phenomenon being studied produces no effect or makes no difference. An example of a {{null hypothesis}} is the statement [...] "This diet {{has no effect on}} people's weight." [...] Usually, an experimenter frames a null hypothesis with the intent of rejecting it: that is, intending to run an experiment which produces data that shows that the phenomenon under study <b>does</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference.</b> In some cases there is a specific alternative hypothesis that is opposed to the null hypothesis, in other cases the alternative hypothesis is not explicitly stated, or is simply [...] "the null hypothesis is false" [...] – in either event, this is a binary judgment, but the interpretation differs and is a matter of significant dispute in statistics.|$|E

60|$|But {{the time}} {{selected}} for the measure was most inappropriate. If good in itself, it was bad {{at the time it}} was passed. Home Rule coming across to us from America had taken the guise of rebellion. I have met gentlemen who, as Home-Rulers, have simply desired to obtain for their country an increase of power in the management of their own affairs. These men have been loyal and patriotic, and it might perhaps be well to meet their views. The Channel no doubt <b>does</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> between Liverpool and Dublin. But the latter-day Home-Rulers, of whom I speak, brought their politics, their aspirations, and their money from New York, and boldly made use of the means which the British Constitution afforded them to upset the British Constitution as established in Ireland. That they should not succeed in doing this is the determination of all, at any rate on this side of the Channel. It is still, I believe, the desire of most thinking men on the Irish side. But parliamentary votes are not given only to thinking men; and consequently a body of members has appeared in the House, energetic and now well trained, who have resolved by the clamour of their voices to put an end to the British power of governing the country. These members are but a minority among those whom Ireland sends to Parliament; but they have learned what a minority can effect by unbridled audacity. England is still writhing in her attempt to invent some mode of controlling them. But long before any such mode had been adopted,--had been adopted or even planned,--the Government in 1881 brought out their plan for securing to the tenants fair rents, fixity of tenure, and freedom of sale.|$|E

50|$|Just {{as in this}} spin-1/2 {{particle}} example, quantum reference {{frames are}} almost always treated implicitly {{in the definition of}} quantum states, and the process of including the reference frame in a quantum state is called quantisation/internalisation of reference frame while the process of excluding the reference frame from a quantum state is called dequantisation/externalisation of reference frame.
