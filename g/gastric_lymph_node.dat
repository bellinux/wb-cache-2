40|$|Background The abomasal {{helminth}} Teladorsagia circumcincta {{is one of}} {{the most}} economically important parasites affecting sheep in temperate regions. Infection is particularly detrimental to lambs, in which it can cause pronounced morbidity and severe production losses. Due to the spreading resistance of this parasite to all classes of anthelmintic drugs, teladorsagiosis is having an increasingly severe impact on the sheep industry with significant implications for sheep welfare. Protective immunity develops slowly, wanes rapidly and does not appear to be as effective in young lambs. To investigate the development of immunity to T. circumcincta in sheep and lambs, we used cytokine transcript profiling to examine differences in the abomasal mucosa and <b>gastric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> of naïve and previously infected sheep and lambs following challenge. Results The results of these experiments demonstrated that the abomasal mucosa is a major source of cytokines during abomasal helminth infection. A local Th 2 -type cytokine response was observed in the abomasal mucosa and <b>gastric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> of the previously infected sheep and lambs when compared with those of the naïve during the early stages of infection. In contrast, a pro-inflammatory component more was evident in the abomasal mucosa and <b>gastric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> of the naïve sheep when compared with those of the previously infected, which was not observed in the lambs. Conclusions The greater levels of Th 2 -type cytokine transcripts in both the abomasum and <b>gastric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> of the previously infected compared with naïve sheep and lambs emphasises the importance of these mechanisms in the immune response to T. circumcincta infection. Younger lambs appear to be able to generate similar Th 2 -type responses in the abomasum suggesting that the increased morbidity and apparent lack of resistance in younger lambs following continuous or repeated exposure to T. circumcincta is unlikely to be due to a lack of appropriate Th 2 -type cytokine production...|$|E
40|$|Thymic-derived, {{naturally}} occurring, CD 4 � CD 25 � regulatory T cells (nTreg) are potent suppressors of immune responses. A detailed {{understanding of}} which {{components of the}} development and activation of pathogenic effector T cells are inhibited by nTreg {{during the course of}} T cell-mediated, organ-specific autoimmunity is as yet unknown. We have analyzed the effects of polyclonal nTreg on the development of autoimmune gastritis. The nTreg inhibited the development of disease, but failed to inhibit the migration of effector cells into the <b>gastric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> or stomach. Notably, nTreg did not inhibit the expansion of autoreactive T cells in the <b>gastric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> The primary effect of nTreg appeared to be inhibition of differentiation of autoantigen-specific T cells to Th 1 effector cells, as reflected by a decrease in Ag-stimulated IFN- � production and a reduction in T-be...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} TCR: MHC/peptide {{interactions and}} in vivo epitope availability {{to explore the}} Th 1 -or Th 2 -like phenotype of autoimmune disease in two TCR Tg mouse models of autoimmune gastritis (AIG). The TCR of strains A 23 and A 51 recognize distinct IAd-restricted peptides from the gastric parietal cell H/K-ATPase. Both peptides form extremely stable MHC/peptide (MHC/p) complexes. All A 23 animals develop a Th 1 -like aggressive, inflammatory AIG early in life, while A 51 mice develop indolent Th 2 -like AIG at 6 – 8 wk with incomplete penetrance. A 51 T cells were more sensitive than A 23 to low doses of soluble antigen and to MHC/p complexes. Staining with IAd/ peptide tetramers was only detectable on previously activated T cells from A 51. Thus, despite inducing a milder AIG, the A 51 TCR displays a higher avidity for its cognate IAd/peptide. Nonetheless, in vivo proliferation of adoptively transferred A 51 CFSE-labeled T cells in the <b>gastric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was relatively poor compared with A 23 T cells. Also, DC from WT <b>gastric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> presenting processed antigen available in vivo, stimulated proliferation of A 23 T cells better than A 51. Thus, the autoimmune potential of these TCR in their respective Tg lines is strongly influenced by {{the availability of the}} peptide epitope, rather than by differential avidity for their respective MHC/ p complexes...|$|E

40|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) -dependent presentation of processed tissuespecific self-antigens can contribute to either peripheral (extrathymic) tolerance or the differentiation of autoreactive T cells. Here, we have studied the MHC class II molecule presentation of gastric parietal cell (PC) -specific H � /K �-ATPase, which induces a destructive autoimmune gastritis in BALB/c mice lacking CD 4 � CD 25 � regulatory T cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed physical association of CD 11 c � dendritic cells (DCs) with PCs in the gastric mucosa.

Pigs were selected {{on the basis}} of unthriftiness, decreased feed intake, and wasting. The stomachs were opened, inverted, and classified into 0 - 3 score according the severity of the gross lesions present in pars oesophagica (non-glandulargastric mucosa). Selected samples were processed for paraffin embedding and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemistry using anti-PCV 2 (porcine circovírus type 2) antibody, anti-Helicobacter pylori antibody and a wide-spectrum anti-cytokeratin antibody was performed. Gross changes in pars oesophagea were classified according to the severity of lesions as score 3, 2, and 1 in 8, 6, 5 stomachs respectivelly. Microscopically, hyperplastic lymphoid follicles, lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrates and focci of necrosis in the gastric mucosa were common findings. Large amounts of PCV 2 antigen were observed in the cytoplasm and nuclei from intralesional cells and debris from the gastric glandular mucosal zone; however, in the fundus, anti-PCV 2 immunostaining was restricted to the surface mucosal cells and foveolar compartment.

CD 4 � T cells sort-purified from GLN expressed mRNAs encoding for both IFN-γ and IL- 4. However, those infiltrating into GM expressed very low levels of IL- 4 mRNA, even though they strongly expressed IFN-γ mRNA. Among CD 4 � T cells separated from AIG mice expressing detectable levels of either IFN-γ or IL- 4 by intracellular staining, less than oneseventh expressed IL- 4 and thus most of them expressed IFN-γ in GM, whereas roughly half and one-third expressed IL- 4 in GLN and spleen respectively. These findings indicate that the T h 1 cells predominantly infiltrate into autoimmune lesions and T h 2 cells are mainly resident in the regional LN. We further set up an in vitro model system of transendothelial migration using a murine endothelial cell line, F- 2, and found that T h 1 cells in CD 4 � T cells separated from lymphoid tissues of AIG mice preferentially passed through the monolayer of endothelial cells while {{only a small portion}} of T h 2 cells did so.

As a basic technique, laparoscopic total gastrectomy employed Roux-en-Y reconstruction, laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy employed double tract reconstruction, and end-to-side anastomosis {{was used for the}} cut-off stump of the esophagus and lifted jejunum. We used EEATM OrVilTM as a device that permitted mechanical purse-string suture similarly to conventional EEA, and endo-Surgitie. After the <b>gastric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection, the esophagus was cut off using an automated stapler. EEATM OrVilTM was orally and slowly inserted from the valve tip, and a small hole was created {{at the tip of the}} obliquely cut-off stump with scissors to let the valve tip pass through. Yarn was cut to disconnect the anvil from a tube and the anvil head was retained in the esophagus. The end-Surgitie was inserted at the right subcostal margin, and after the looped-shaped thread was wrapped around the esophageal stump opening, assisting Maryland forceps inserted at the left subcostal and left abdomen were used to grasp the left and right esophageal stump. The surgeon inserted anvil grasping forceps into the right abdomen, and after grasping the esophagus with the forceps, tightened the end Surgitie, thereby completing the purse-string suture on the esophageal stump. The main unit of the automated stapler was inserted from the cut-off stump of the lifted jejunum, and a trocar was made to pass through. To prevent dropout of the small intestines from the automated stapler, the automated stapler and the lifted jejunum were fastened with silk thread, the abdomen was again inflated, and the lifted jejunum was led into the abdominal cavity. When it was confirmed that the automated stapler and center rod were made completely linear, the anvil and the main unit were connected with each other and firing was carried out. Then, DST-based anastomosis was completed with no dog-ear. The method may facilitate safe laparoscopic anastomosis between the esophagus and reconstructed intestine. This is also considered to serve as a useful anastomosis technique for upper levels of the esophagus in laparotomy. </p...|$|E

The depth of invasion could be used to evaluate the number of hepatic metastases, while the depth of invasion and the Lauren classification could be used to evaluate the pattern of hepatic metastases in patients who underwent radical gastrectomy...|$|R
40|$|The high {{incidence}} of gastric cancer {{has led to the}} initiation of cancer screening programs. As a result, the number of early gastric cancer cases has increased and consequentially, the cancer mortality rate has decreased. Moreover, the development of minimally invasive endoscopic treatment has been introduced for these early lesions. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is now {{recognized as one of the}} preferred treatment modalities for premalignant gastrointestinal epithelial lesions and early <b>gastric</b> cancer without <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis. We review the results of ESD including experiences in Japan and Korea, as well as western countries...|$|R
40|$|Background: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{has been}} shown to be {{associated}} with gastric cancer. However, inconsistent findings have been reported regarding the distribution of EBV infected cells (in normal gastric epithelium vs. intestinal metaplastic cells vs. in neoplastic cells) and the characteristics of EBV-associated <b>gastric</b> cancer. <b>Lymph</b> <b>node</b> positive EBV-associated <b>gastric</b> cancer has not been systematically studied. The aims of this study were to evaluate EBV-associated gastric cancer, to assess the distribution of EBV infected cells including all positive <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and to define the characteristics of EBV-associated gastric cancer. Design: The study included primary gastric cancer patients who underwent surgical resection with no preoperative treatment at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1987 and 2006. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from these resection specimens were assessed for EBV by in situ hybridization, the gold standard for EBV detection in tissue. EBV status was analyzed along with clinicopathologic parameters including age, gender, tumor type, <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> status, and pathologic stage of the tumor. Results: Among 235 patients, 12 had intranuclear expression of EBV. EBV staining was seen only in tumor cells and no detectable EBV was observed in normal gastric mucosa, intestinal metaplasia or stromal cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeIn {{the context}} of <b>gastric</b> cancer, <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> target volume {{delineation}} for post-operative radiotherapy is currently built on the traditional system of dividing the stomach and 2 -D treatment methods. Here, we have proposed a new delineation approach with irradiation indications for <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> stations. Its safety and efficacy were evaluated in a phase II clinical trial. Materials and methodsFifty-four gastric cancer patients with D 2 <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection received 2 cycles of FOLFOX 4. They subsequently received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (45 Gy at 1. 8 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions per week for 5 weeks) with a 5 -fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen, followed by 4 additional FOLFOX 4 cycles. The target volume included the remnant stomach, anastomosis site, tumor bed, and regional <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> selected through our new approach by taking gastric arteries as references. ResultsThe most common grade 3 – 4 adverse event was neutropenia (14. 8 %). Neutropenia, anemia, and nausea were common grade 1 – 2 toxicities. No treatment-related deaths occurred during treatment. The 3 -year overall, disease-free, and locoregional recurrence-free survival rates were 81. 6 %, 70. 2 %, and 91. 1 %, respectively. Eight patients developed peritoneal or distant metastases. ConclusionsUsing our new approach and irradiation indications, delineation of the target volume of post-operative <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> stations was feasible and well tolerated after D 2 resection in patients with gastric cancer...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{present study}} aims to {{identify}} the clinicopathologic factors predictive of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis (LNM) in poorly differentiated early gastric cancer (EGC) and to expand {{the possibility of using}} laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of poorly differentiated EGC. Methods Data from 70 cases of poorly differentiated EGC treated with surgery were collected. The association between clinicopathologic factors and the presence of LNM was retrospectively analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results Univariate analysis showed that tumor size, depth of invasion, and lymphatic vessel involvement (LVI) were the significant and independent risk factors for LNM (all P< 0. 05). The LNM rates were 6. 9 %, 45. 5 %, and 60. 0 %, respectively. There was no LNM in 25 patients without the above three risk factors. Conclusions Laparoscopic surgery is a sufficient treatment for intramucosal poorly differentiated EGC if the tumor is {{less than or equal to}} 2. 0 cm in size and when LVI is absent upon postoperative histological examination.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Microtubules, {{the main}} {{components}} of spindles in the mitotic phase, can provide the suitable conditions for unlimited proliferation of tumor cells. Cytoskeleton microtubule-associated-Tau accelerates the progress of malignant tumor through microtubules. Currently, the expression of Cytoskeleton microtubule-associated-Tau in gastric cancer and the relationship between clinical pathological factors research has not yet been reported, so the report aims to elucidate the features of Cytoskeleton microtubule-associated-Tau expression in normal gastric tissue and gastric carcinoma tissue. Materials and Methods: The expressions of Cytoskeleton microtubule-associated protein-Tau protein and Cytoskeleton microtubule-associated protein-Tau mRNA were investigated in 60 cases of gastric carcinoma (cases) and 10 cases of normal gastric tissues (controls). Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR were respectively used to detect the expression of Cytoskeleton microtubule-associated protein-Tau protein and Tau mRNA in the normal and carcinomatous gastric tissues. Results: The expressions of both cytoskeleton microtubule-associated protein-Tau protein and Tau mRNA in the carcinomatous gastric tissue were higher than in the normal gastric tissue (P< 0. 05). Likewise, both biomarkers were expressed significantly lower in the well-differentiated and moderately-differentiated gastric carcinoma was than in the poorly-differentiated one (P< 0. 05). Moreover, their expressions in the <b>gastric</b> carcinoma without <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis was lower than in the <b>gastric</b> carcinoma with <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The expressions of Cytoskeleton microtubule-associated-protein, Tau-protein and Cytoskeleton microtubule-associated-protein, Tau-mRNA were significantly different between the normal gastric tissue and the gastric carcinoma tissue, and were correlated with the degree differentiation and <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> status.
