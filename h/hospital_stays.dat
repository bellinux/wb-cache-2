40|$|ObjectiveLaparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} (LC) is {{the most}} common minimally invasive surgery in Hong Kong. However, ambulatory LC is not a common practice in Hong Kong. This study aims to identify the causes of long <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> after elective LC and to delineate a guideline for ambulatory LC. MethodsA retrospective analysis of 278 patients who underwent successful elective LC in a single unit between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2003 was performed. They were divided into two groups: LS group had a long <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> (> 24 hours after operation) and SS group had a short <b>hospital</b> <b>stay.</b> A total of 18 variables, including five patient variables, nine operative variables and four postoperative variables, were identified for univariate analysis. Significant pre- and postoperative factors were included in the multivariate analysis to identify independent predictive factors for long <b>hospital</b> <b>stay.</b> ResultsOf the 278 patients, 118 (44. 2 %) could be discharged within 24 hours, while 149 (55. 8 %) had long <b>hospital</b> <b>stay.</b> Nine significant factors were identified in the univariate analysis; three independent factors were found to predict long <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> in the multivariate analysis. Patients with age more than 60 years had double risk of long <b>hospital</b> <b>stay.</b> Patients who could not tolerate diet within 8 hours or took more than two tablets of oral analgesia (dologesics) had a four- and threefold increase in risk of long <b>hospital</b> <b>stay,</b> respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although most {{patients}} with ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) {{have a good}} prognosis and can be discharged from hospital very soon, some patients must be admitted longer. We performed the current analysis to assess predictors and the prognostic significance of prolonged <b>hospital</b> <b>stay.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, individual data from 2323 patients who survived at least 2 days after primary PCI in our hospital were recorded. Patients in the highest tertile of <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> were compared with the other patients. Both predictors and prognostic importance of prolonged <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean admission duration was 6. 7 days (standard deviation= 6. 6). A total of 797 patients had a <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> for more than 6 days (highest tertile). Patients with a longer <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> were older, more often female, had more often a history of previous myocardial infarction and signs of heart failure on admission, and had more frequently Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow 0 before PCI. In addition, a low left ventricular ejection fraction was independently associated with prolonged <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> [odds ratio: 2. 06 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 54 - 2. 76) ], but with a comparable risk of 1 -year mortality [odds ratio: 1. 3 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 8 - 2. 0) ]. CONSLUSION: According to this study, a low left ventricular ejection fraction is associated with prolonged <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> in patients after primary PCI. Predictors of prolonged <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> are age, female sex, previous myocardial infarction, heart failure on admission, and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow 0 before PCI...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Length of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Stay</b> is an {{important}} issue for the hospital managers, patients and their families. Regarding to the importance of this issue and few similar researches, this study aimed to model the Length of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Stay</b> for myocardial infarction (MI) patients admitted in Vasei hospital of Sabzevar, and to investigate its effective factors. Material and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was performed to model the Length of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Stay</b> for myocardial infarction (MI) patients admitted in Vasei hospital of Sabzevar, in 2012. By using census method, 201 patients were entered to this study and the value of the length of hospitalization as the response variable, and the value of gender, age and residence location of the patients as the independent variables are considered. The data were analyzed using an advanced and new model, zero-truncated generalized poisson regression model, and SAS 9. 2 software. Results: The results showed that the average Length of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Stay</b> of MI patients was 4. 876 days in Vasei hospital. Also, it was found that one year increase in age was related to one day increase in hospitalization of the MI patients. Moreover, the regression models predicted that the average Length of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Stay</b> for female patients was less than male patients, and the average Length of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Stay</b> for the urban residence patients was less than those of rural residence. Conclusions: In this study, a suitable statistical method for analyzing and modeling of the Length of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Stay</b> was obtained. Because of differences in Length of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Stay</b> in different units of hospitals, use of these advanced statistical models is proposed for another hospitals and cities...|$|R
40|$|Objectives:To {{investigate}} {{factors associated}} with a prolonged <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> after elective open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Patients and methods:We have investigated prospectively base-line risk {{factors associated with}} an increased length of postoperative <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> in 474 of the patients undergoing surgery as part of the U. K. Small Aneurysm Trial. Results:The median length of <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> was 11 days (interquartile range 9 – 14 days). Age (within the range 60 – 76 years), sex, body mass index, aneurysm diameter, graft type (tube or bifurcated), hospital (university or other), ECG characteristics, angina (from Rose questionnaire) and/or previous myocardial infarction were not associated with length of <b>hospital</b> <b>stay.</b> Quality of life also was assessed before surgery using the Medical Outcomes Study SF 20. Psychosocial aspects including level of social functioning, role functioning, mental health, health perceptions and pain were not associated with length of postoperative stay. The level of preoperative physical functioning was associated inversely with length of <b>hospital</b> <b>stay,</b> p = 0. 004. Patients' length of <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> also was inversely associated with preoperative lung function: FEV 1, p = 0. 011 and FVC, p = 0. 006. In contrast, smoking habit was of only borderline significance, p = 0. 09. Conclusion:Conditional logistic regression analysis identified only preoperative lung function (FEV 1 and FVC) and physical functioning, three intrinsically linked factors, as predictors of length of <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> after elective repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm...|$|R
