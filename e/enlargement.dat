5|$|There are {{intentional}} and unintentional modifications {{concerning the}} clitoris, including female genital mutilation (FGM), sex reassignment surgery, clitoris <b>enlargement</b> and genital piercings.

40|$|In this article, {{we define}} {{the notion of}} a {{filtration}} and the related notion of the usual hypotheses. We then explain the problem of <b>enlargements</b> of filtrations: how are (semi) martingales affected under a change of filtrations? We state the main theorems in the classical frameworks of initial and progressive <b>enlargements</b> of filtrations. In the case of initial <b>enlargements</b> of filtrations, we state the well known Jacod's condition and in the framework of progressive <b>enlargements</b> of filtrations, we give the decomposition of a local martingale in the larger filtration. We finally specialize to the case of immersed filtrations, which is very widely used in credit risk modeling, and study the effect of a combination of changes of filtration and probability measure in this situation...|$|R

5|$|Disorders of {{the thyroid}} are functional–caused by {{dysfunction}} {{in the production}} of hormones, and nodes and tumors either benign or malignant.

40|$|Aims and Objectives: Diagnosis of {{salivary gland}} <b>enlargements</b> is a {{demanding}} task {{and it requires}} a thorough knowledge of the clinical presentation of salivary gland diseases and the various imaging modalities available. This study aims at assessing the reliability of ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) as the first line investigatory procedure for major salivary gland <b>enlargements</b> and to correlate the diagnosis obtained from imaging modalities (Ultrasound guided FNAC, CT or MRI). so that an imaging protocol for salivary gland <b>enlargements</b> can be provided to clinicians, to aid them in preoperative planning. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with clinically suspected salivary gland <b>enlargements</b> were subjected to ultrasound-guided FNAC, CT and MRI, at appropriate clinical situations. The <b>enlargements</b> found extraglandular {{in the course of}} the study were excluded from it. A Chi-square test was applied to obtain the statistical significance and the Galan and Gambino method was applied to find the sensitivity values. Results: The sensitivity of ultrasound-guided FNAC as the first line investigatory procedure for major salivary gland <b>enlargements</b> was found to be 87 %. The P value was found to be. 0027 FNx 08 (Statistical significance at 1 % level). The sensitivity of imaging modalities combined (USG-guided FNAC, CT and MRI) at appropriate clinical situations to detect benign and malignant neoplasms was found to be 90 %. The P value was found to be. 0114 FNx 01 (Statistical significance at 5 % level) Conclusion: Ultrasound followed by USG-guided FNAC is the ideal first line investigatory procedure in case of major salivary gland <b>enlargements.</b> The combining of clinical diagnosis with USG-guided FNAC. CT or MRI at appropriate clinical situations gives a more reliable diagnosis...|$|R

Russia's actions in the First Chechen War were also a motivating factor for several countries that had memories of similar Soviet offensives.|$|E
5|$|Extensive sociological, sexological {{and medical}} debate {{have focused on}} the clitoris, {{primarily}} concerning anatomical accuracy, orgasmic factors and their physiological explanation for the G-spot, and whether the clitoris is vestigial, an adaptation, or serves a reproductive function. Social perceptions of the clitoris range from the significance of its role in female sexual pleasure, assumptions about its true size and depth, and varying beliefs regarding genital modification such as clitoris <b>enlargement,</b> clitoris piercing and clitoridectomy. Genital modification may be for aesthetic, medical or cultural reasons.|$|E
