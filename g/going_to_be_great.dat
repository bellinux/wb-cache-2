500|$|The four played {{together}} for the first time in a room below a record store on Gerrard Street in London. Page suggested that they attempt [...] "Train Kept A-Rollin'", originally a jump blues song popularised in a rockabilly version by Johnny Burnette, which had been covered by the Yardbirds. [...] "As soon as I heard John Bonham play", Jones recalled, [...] "I knew this was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>great...</b> We locked together as a team immediately". Before leaving for Scandinavia, the group took part in a recording session for the P. J. Proby album, Three Week Hero. The album's track [...] "Jim's Blues", with Plant on harmonica, was the first studio track to feature all four future members of Led Zeppelin.|$|E
500|$|Allison Stewart for The Washington Post {{thought that}} [...] "Jump" [...] stood out {{as one of}} the {{highlights}} of Unapologetic, describing it as a [...] "monster in the making". Along with [...] "Stay", Stewart listed [...] "Jump" [...] as her top two songs on the album. Alike Stewart, Melissa Maerz for Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Jump" [...] was one of her top recommendations to listen to along with [...] "Diamonds". Stacey-Ann Ellis for Vibe thought that [...] "Jump" [...] could be [...] "mosh-inducing" [...] if played in a nightclub. Michael Gallucci for PopCrush also agreed that [...] "Jump" [...] is one of Unapologetics best songs, writing that [...] "It's an unofficial rule in pop music that any song titled 'Jump' is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> (see Pointer Sisters, Van Halen, Kriss Kross, etc.). Rihanna's is no exception". Chris Younie for 4Music echoed Gallucci's sentiments, writing that it is one of the best songs on the album. He further wrote that he felt as though the album peaked after the second track, [...] "Diamonds", had finished, but stated that [...] "Jump" [...] filled void between that and the former.|$|E
500|$|Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian {{called it}} [...] "one of those shiny and insubtantial series," [...] adding that [...] "all that leaping {{out of bed}} at dawn on the pretext {{that you have to}} go and sell a house tends to wear thin." [...] Banks-Smith also called the story [...] "slightly unexpected." [...] She also stated [...] "Spooks appears to plume itself on its authenticity, and there are moments, well one moment, so stupid it has to be true." [...] Thomas Sudcliff of The Independent felt it was a [...] "different kind of spy drama" [...] with [...] "a literal description, derived from the sort of rueful story you could imagine being told at an MI5 staff social," [...] and [...] "a lot of bullshit too, naturally. This is one of those dramas where colleagues never make small talk but instead launch {{straight}} into an urgent purposive shorthand." [...] Joe Joseph of The Times stated that it [...] "bears a closer resemblance [...] 24," [...] which [...] "shaded the pleasure of this opening episode," [...] but felt {{that by the end of}} the episode, Spooks had [...] "established a voice of its own." [...] Gerard O'Donovan of The Telegraph thought that the episode [...] "proved thoroughly entertaining," [...] and praised Wolstencroft's writing, which O'Donovan felt was [...] "confident enough to be playful with its subject - especially regarding Britain's poor-relation relationship with America." [...] Alison Graham of the Radio Times said that after the episode, the series [...] "looks like it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> fun," [...] but [...] "it's presumably not meant to be taken too seriously, because surely life in MI5 can't be this exciting?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Howard Schnellenberger called Richt's signing “a {{marriage}} made in heaven." [...] Miami Heisman alumni Vinny Testaverde, noted [...] "I know he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>great</b> {{role model}} for my boy, for our kids, he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>great</b> person and a great teacher...And that's what these kids need." [...] “I was shocked that Georgia let him go. But their loss is Miami’s gain." [...] Testaverde's son Vincent is a backup quarterback on the team.|$|R

I'm also going to have my parents' band backing me up for that show, which is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>great.</b> And the cause itself is something I've really wanted to put energy and time into since I was a young girl. Plus, April happens to be Sexual Assault awareness month. I'm just happy to be a part of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|My {{whole body}} changed into {{something}} else. I {{could see through}} myself. And I went up... I wasn't in human form... I landed on a planet that I identified as Saturn... they teleported me and I was down on [...] stage with them. They wanted to talk with me. They had one little antenna on each ear. A little antenna over each eye. They talked to me. They told me to stop [...] because there was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> trouble in schools... the world was going into complete chaos... I would speak , and the world would listen. That's what they told me.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} stages of production, the role of Thranduil had been linked to actor Doug Jones but on 29 April 2011, Jackson {{reported}} on Facebook that the role had gone to Lee Pace. On his casting, Jackson said, [...] "Casting these Tolkien stories is very difficult, especially the Elven characters and Lee has always been our first choice for Thranduil. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>great.</b> We loved his performance in a movie called The Fall {{a few years ago and}} have been hoping to work with him since. When we were first discussing who would be right for Thranduil, Lee came into mind almost immediately." ...|$|E
3000|$|I {{think the}} end goal, what I would {{really want is}} {{students}} who can problem solve. … Life problems, work problems, I mean for years I’ve just thought employers just want employees who can think {{and take care of}} the problems at hand. Not have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> told, “Do this, do this, do this.” And so if you’re a problem solver you’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>great</b> employee.

2500|$|Roberts {{said in a}} 2007 interview: [...] "Right now I am {{focusing}} on movies. I am getting ready {{to start a new}} movie this summer so that is taking a lot of my time. I think when I am a little bit older it is definitely something I'd like to pursue." [...] In another interview, she said: [...] "My musical career is indefinitely on hold. I don't like people who become like 'actor slash singer.' I think people should be one or the other because usually you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> at both. You're going to be better at one, so you might as well stick to the one you're good at. I'm going for acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with the Norwegian TV channel TVTromsø, Paul Waaktaar-Savoy expressed frustration over {{the time it took}} to produce new material with the band: [...] "The trouble with us is that we're never in sync. Right now, I'm eager to get going on the new album. I'm telling everybody that the new album is coming out next year and that it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>great.</b> But the other two are of course just starting to get into their solo projects again and want to prioritize those for the time being." [...] Getting around to recording the follow-up to Analogue took four years due to the individual projects of the band members. Paul's band Savoy released Savoy Songbook Vol. 1, Magne released his second solo album A Dot of Black in the Blue of Your Bliss and Morten Harket released his second English-language solo album Letter from Egypt. Despite touring quite extensively between 2005–08, the focus of the group was not directed towards recording. The album ended up being recorded in {{a relatively short period of}} time (between January - May 2009) with Steve Osborne, Mark Saunders and Roland Spremberg producing.|$|E

Yea, thou wilt be great, and live at court amongst noble folk, and Kings haply. Presently thou wilt not be with me any more, and wilt forget me by-and-by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} be. I suppose God chooses one's parents quite deliberately. Praise Him from Whom all blessings flow!" [...] She {{smoothed}} out her black cloak over her ankles, raised her face {{again into the}} dwindling moonlight, and gently smiled at me. [...] "I am glad I came, Midgetina, though it's suicidally cold. 'Pardi! on sent Dieu bien à son aise ici.' We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> friends, aren't we?"

I {{want to see the}} world. I can't be shut up in a little town like Lodi. I want to see people--thousands of people. I want to see what the world is like. I may go to Europe before I get done with it. I'm going to study art. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>great.</b> I can't marry any one now." ...|$|E

So sorry you can't take a part, for it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> fun and very splendid. I am in the Hungarian dance, and it's one of the hardest; but the dress is lovely, and I would be in it. Mamma is the matron of it; so I had my way, though I know the girls don't want me, and the boys make fun of me. Just see if this isn't the queerest step you ever beheld!" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the first}} place, Beatrice Hill {{was saying to}} Sidney, [...] "Oh, Sid, that Miss Seeley you had at the prom is a lovely girl. I don't know when I've met anyone I liked so much. She was so jolly and {{friendly}} and she didn't put on learned airs at all, as {{so many of those}} Payzant girls do. I asked her all about herself and she told me, and all about her mother and sisters and home and the lovely times they had together, and how hard they worked to send her to college too, and how she taught school in vacations and 'roomed' herself to help along. Isn't it so brave and plucky of her! I know we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What an opinionated young gentleman! Well, I see I must {{do all the}} courting. So {{consider}} that I sent for you this morning. I've got another letter for you to mail." [...] She put {{her hand to her}} breast, and out of the pretty frillings of her frock produced, as before, with the same faint perfume of violets, a letter like the first. But it was unsealed.

We <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> told by the biography why Shelley deserted his wife and child and took up with Cornelia Turner and Italian.
