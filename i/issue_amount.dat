The <b>issue</b> <b>amount</b> was 6 billion yen with a 7-year maturity, and the bond was {{accepted}} {{very well in}} the market. [...] At first, Asian Development Bank and other high credit supranational issuers were given an access priority to the market. [...] To control stream of issuance, these special criteria were established. Those who were unable to meet eligibility criteria could finance yen through yen-denominated private placement bonds. They were permitted to target a restricted number of institutional investments, and terms and liquidity were under close control. In 1972 the first non-Japanese 10 billion yen bond was issued by Australia. In 1979, Sears made the first corporate Samurai bond issue for 20 billion yen. [...] At that time, Samurai market gradually became accessible to more issuers through the alleviation of eligibility criteria, which now required minimum credit ratings, and through liberalization of new kinds of bonds. [...] In addition, Samurai bonds provided an opportunity of issuing in two different currencies, as well as interest and principal were paid in ether of these currencies.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of empirical and theoretical {{studies on the}} liquidity of bond markets. In the first study, we present an extended model for the estimation of the effective bid-ask spread that improves the existing models and offers a new direction of generalisation. The quoted bid-ask spread represents the prices available {{at a given time}} for transactions only up to some relatively small trade size. Trades can be executed inside or outside the quoted bid-ask spread. Thus, we extend Roll's model to include multiple spreads of different sizes and their associated probabilities. The extended model is estimated via a Bayesian approach, and the fit of the model to a time series of a year of corporate bond transaction data is assessed by a Bayesian model selection method. Results show that our extended model fits the data better. Our second study examines the relationships between different liquidity proxies and the non-default corporate yield spread as well as the effective bid-ask spread. We first separate the non-default component of bond spreads from the default one by using the information contained in credit default swaps. We then apply our state-space extension of the Roll model to disentangle the unobservable non-default yield spread from the effective bid-ask spread. The empirical results show that the non-default yield spread has a nonlinear relationship with time to maturity and a positive correlation with the bid-ask spread {{as well as with the}} default risk, and therefore may reflect the future expected liquidity. We find that the effective bid-ask spread is related to bond characteristics associated with illiquidity (e. g. timeto-maturity and <b>issue</b> <b>amount)</b> and trading activity measures (e. g. daily turnover, and daily average trade size), indicating that transactions costs are more likely to be associated with the current level of liquidity rather than the future expected liquidity. We also find that the non-default component accounted for a bigger proportion of the yield spread before the financial crisis 2007 - 2009, whereas during the crisis credit risk played a more influential role in determining the yield spread. Common factors such as the underlying volatility and CDS spread explain more of the variation in the non-default yield spread and the bid-ask spread than idiosyncratic factors such as timeto-maturity, issue size, and trading activity proxies do. The third study presents an equilibrium model in which the heterogeneity of liquidity among bonds is determined endogenously. In particular we show that bonds differ in their liquidity despite having identical cash flow, riskiness and <b>issue</b> <b>amount.</b> Under certain conditions, we show that investors have strong preference for concentrating trading on a small number of bonds. We conjecture that the identity of the ones which are traded may result from a `Sunspot' equilibrium where it is optimal for traders to randomly label a subset of the bonds as the `liquid' ones and concentrating trading on them. We also show that changing the model assumptions leads to different equilibrium configurations where trading is spread over the bonds. In addition, by utilising the concepts of stochastic dominance, utility indifference pricing, and some specific assumptions on asset value and order arrival rate, the equilibrium prices and bid-ask spreads can be quantified...|$|E

Experiment will be divided into constant temperature and fluctuating temperature treatments, observed under the same average temperature difference between the two treatments. In this study, Myzus varians rear at 8 different temperatures on Clematis gouriana. According to climate data of Ilan in July 2009, adjust the average temperature corresponding to the same constant temperature of the variable temperature treatments. The longest developmental time for nymphs was 29. 1 days at 10 ℃ of the longest, and shortest developmental time was 7. 27 days at 30 ℃. The adult longevity was 66. 33 days at 10 ℃ while the minimum of longevity was 18. 67 days at 30 ℃. The adult fecundity at 20 ℃ was maximum (42. 03 offspring / female) and minimum at 30 ℃ (4. 73 offspring / female). Under fluctuating temperatures between 25 ℃ to 32. 5 ℃ the nymphs on average 28. 8 ℃ was the longest development time 9. 00 days, while at average 25 ℃ with the shortest development time 7. 97 days. The adult at 25 ℃ with a maximum longevity 23. 27 days, while the shortest longevity at average 30 ℃ with 13. 47 days. The adult fecundity at average 25 ℃ was maximum value (10. 2 offspring / female) and minimum at average 30 ℃ (0. 97 offspring / female). Furthermore, at average 30 ℃ the population growth was negative growth. From analysis of variance results show that constant temperatures and fluctuating temperatures were significant different, and in case of elevated temperature, fluctuating temperature treatments than in constant temperature should be set early response to higher temperatures, so temperature is a critical cues to the result, will increase insects growth, development and affect various physiological responses. According to the control treatments, constant temperature and fluctuating temperature treatments have different expectations, and this means that in order to set temperature and the prediction of climate warming may underestimate their seriousness. 全球氣候變遷所造成生態的影響，對於外溫生物而言，溫度是影響生長發育最重要的因子，氣候暖化造成的衝擊已是重要的議題。許多關於昆蟲與溫度之間關係的研究多以定溫處理的方式作探討，但定溫處理不能正確地反映真正的自然環境溫度變動對於生物的影響。試驗將分作定溫處理部分以及變溫處理部分來作為對照，觀察在相同均溫之下兩者的差異性。試驗用之桃捲葉蚜(Myzus varians) 取食串鼻龍(Clematis gouriana) 嫩葉放置在培養皿上飼養，放入已設定的八個不同定溫進行試驗。以 2009 年七月宜蘭氣候站資料為基準，共進行五組變溫試驗並且將平均溫度提升至相同定溫所對應之均溫處理組，比較兩者的差異性。在不同的定溫之下若蚜期於 10 ℃有最長發育時間 29. 1 天，而在 30 ℃有最短發育時間 7. 27 天。成蚜平均壽命在 10 ℃最大值 66. 33 天，而 30 ℃下有最小值 18. 67 天。成蚜繁殖率以 20 ℃為最大值(42. 03 offspring/female) 而在 30 ℃有最小值(4. 73 offspring/female) 。在變溫 25 ℃至 32. 5 ℃之間若蚜期於變溫 28. 8 ℃有最長發育時間 9. 00 天，而在變溫 25 ℃有最短發育時間 7. 97 天。成蚜於變溫 25 ℃有最長壽命 23. 27 天，而在變溫 30 ℃有最短壽命 13. 47 天。繁殖率以變溫 25 ℃為最大值(10. 2 offspring/female) 而在變溫 30 ℃有最小值(0. 97 offspring/female) ，且在變溫 30 ℃時族群的成長為負成長。變異數分析的結果顯示定溫與變溫之間有顯著差異，且在溫度提升的情況下，變溫組較定溫組提早達到高溫所應有的反應，故變溫所橫跨的某一臨界溫度所造成的結果，確實會對昆蟲的生長發育及各種生理反應有所影響。從對照的結果顯示，定溫與變溫的處理會有不同的預期結果，而這表示以定溫預測氣候暖化時，可能會低估其嚴重性。誌謝 [...] i 目錄 [...] ii 摘要 [...] iii 前言 [...] 1 前人研究 [...] 3 一、氣候暖化概況 [...] 3 二、氣候暖化對生態之影響 [...] 4 三、溫度對植食性昆蟲的影響 [...] 6 材料與方法 [...] 9 一、供試寄主植物 [...] 9 二、供試蟲源飼養 [...] 9 三、溫度對桃捲葉蚜之影響 [...] 9 四、數據分析 [...] 10 結果 [...] 12 一、定溫處理對桃捲葉蚜的影響 [...] 12 二、變溫處理對桃捲葉蚜的影響 [...] 13 三、定溫與變溫處理之間的比較 [...] 15 討論 [...] 16 一、溫度對桃捲葉蚜的影響 [...] 16 二、定溫與變溫之間的差異 [...] 16 三、溫度提升造成的影響 [...] 17 參考文獻 [...] 20 表 [...] 29 圖 [...] 3...|$|E
