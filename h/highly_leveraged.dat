25|$|Wealth {{inequality}} {{had also}} risen similarly, with {{the share of}} wealth owned by the top 1% rising from 24% in 1979 to 36% by 2007. While U.S. household net worth rose nearly 30% from its pre-crisis peak in 2007 to 2016, much of this gain went to the wealthiest Americans, as it had prior to his tenure. By 2015, the share of wealth owned by the top 1% reached 42%. However, the share of wealth owned by the bottom 50% fell from 2.9% in 1979 to 2.6% in 2007 and 1.1% in 2015, as the crisis did additional damage to <b>highly</b> <b>leveraged</b> households that had purchased homes with low down-payments.|$|E
30|$|In {{the summer}} of 2007 the economies of the United States and Western Europe {{starting}} suffering bank liquidity and real estate problems, which were followed by a severe banking crisis, with a strong credit reduction and economic recession that still last in Spain. This sequence of events was not unique: Banking crises are recurrent phenomena, often-triggering deep and long-lasting recessions (Reinhart and Rogoff 2009; Schularick and Taylor 2012). A weakening in banks’ balance-sheets {{may lead to a}} contraction in the supply of credit and to a slowdown in real activity (Bernanke 1983). Moreover, <b>highly</b> <b>leverage</b> non-financial borrowers may face tightened lending conditions in crises due to a debt overhang problem (Myers 1977). Importantly, banking crises are not random exogenous phenomena, but regularly come on the heels of periods of strong credit growth and asset-price bubbles (Kindleberger 1978; Schularick and Taylor 2012; Gourinchas and Obstfeld 2012).|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} mission {{analyses}} were performed to evaluate human mission to Mars and the moon with and {{without the aid of}} planetary resource utilization. The types of trade studies that are considered include the use of resources to manufacture propellant, food, habitat atmospheric gases, and lander habitat structure. Also, the potential for export of resources from the moon, Mars, Phobos, Deimos, and selected asteroids is also examined. In all cases, mass leveraging is evaluated. For certain cases, economic factors are evaluated as well. It is concluded that some uses are <b>highly</b> <b>leveraging</b> on the mission, whereas others have lesser impact and, therefore, should be afforded lesser priority in resource utilization studies. This survey is made with a consistent set of scaling laws for spacecraft propulsion and habitation systems and subsystems, and therefore, provides a rational basis for comparing different resource locations and use strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{innovative}} research conducted {{for this project}} contributed greatly {{to the understanding of}} generating low-cost hydrogen from solar energy. The project’s research identified two <b>highly</b> <b>leveraging</b> and complementary pathways. The first pathway is to dramatically increase the efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity. Improving solar electric conversion efficiency directly increases hydrogen production. This project produced a world record efficiency for silicon solar cells and contributed to another world record efficiency for a solar concentrator module using multijunction solar cells. The project’s literature review identified a second pathway in which wasted heat from the solar concentration process augments the electrolysis process generating hydrogen. One {{way to do this is}} to use a “heat mirror” that reflects the heat-producing infrared and transmits the visible spectrum to the solar cells; this also increases solar cell conversion efficiency. An economic analysis of this concept confirms that, if long-term concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) and solid-oxide electrolyzer cost goals can be achieved, hydrogen will be produced from solar energy cheaper than the cost of gasoline. The potential public benefits from this project are significant. The project has identified a potential energy source for the nation’s future electricity and transportation needs that is entirely “home grown” and carbon free. As CPV enter the nation’s utility markets, the opportunity for this approach to be successful is greatly increased. Amonix strongly recommends further exploration of this project’s findings...|$|R
25|$|This {{extended}} period of growth ended in Q2 of 2008 when the United Kingdom suddenly entered a recession – its first {{for nearly two decades}} – brought about by the global financial crisis. The UK was particularly vulnerable to the crisis because its financial sector was the most <b>highly</b> <b>leveraged</b> of any major economy. Beginning with the collapse of Northern Rock, which was taken into public ownership in February 2008, other banks had to be partly nationalised. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, at its peak the fifth-largest bank in the world by market capitalisation, was effectively nationalised in October 2008. By mid-2009, HM Treasury had a 70.33% controlling shareholding in RBS, and a 43% shareholding, through UK Financial Investments Limited, in Lloyds Banking Group. The Great Recession, as it came to be known, saw unemployment rise from just over 1.6million in January 2008 to nearly 2.5million by October 2009.|$|E

In 2012, A emerged from bankruptcy by becoming a private company and briefly returned to modest profitability in 2013 and 2014. A had been for sale in 2013 but could not find a suitable buyer. After declaring a loss in April 2015, it filed for its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 19 of that year.

25|$|In 1990, Frank Lorenzo {{was forced}} to retire after 18 years {{at the helm of}} Texas International and later Texas Air and Continental Airlines, selling the {{majority}} of his Jet Capital Corporation to Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). According to William F. Buckley, in his September 17, 1990 article on National Review, the sale to SAS was conditioned on Lorenzo leaving the company. On December 3, 1990, Continental filed for its second bankruptcy, due to Lorenzo dedicating himself almost full-time to Eastern Air Lines acquisition and labor relations issues, the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the resultant Gulf War had prompted a dramatic increase in the price of jet fuel, and People Express had been <b>highly</b> <b>leveraged</b> {{at the time of its}} merger with Continental. In addition to Lorenzo embarking on deals which saddled the airline with other carriers' debts, he also began consolidating the different airlines into one system.

500|$|In May 2005, Malcolm Glazer {{purchased}} the 28.7percent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a <b>highly</b> <b>leveraged</b> takeover valuing the club at approximately £800million (then approx. $1.5billion). Once the purchase was complete, {{the club was}} taken off the stock exchange. In July 2006, the club announced a £660million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30percent reduction in annual interest payments to £62million a year. In January 2010, with debts of £716.5million ($1.17billion), Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth £504million, enabling them to pay off most of the £509million owed to international banks. The annual interest payable on the bonds – which mature on 1 February 2017 – is approximately £45million per annum. Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's Trafford Training Centre. Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath.

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of <b>highly</b> (over-) <b>leveraged</b> Austrian ski hotels {{undergoing}} debt restructurings, we show that reducing a debt overhang leads to a significant improvement in operating performance (return on assets, net profit margin).

Changes in leverage in the debt restructurings are instrumented with Unexpected Snow, which captures {{the extent to which a}} ski hotel experienced unusually good or bad snow conditions prior to the debt restructuring. Effectively, Unexpected Snow provides lending banks with the counterfactual of what would have been the ski hotel’s operating performance in the absence of strategic default, thus allowing to distinguish between ski hotels that are in distress due to negative demand shocks (“liquidity defaulters”) and ski hotels that are in distress due to debt overhang (“strategic defaulters”). ...|$|R
