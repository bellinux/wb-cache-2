5|$|A {{battle for}} Mogadishu {{followed}} {{in the first half}} of 2006 in which the ARPCT confronted the ICU. However, with local support, the ICU captured the city in June of the year. It then expanded its area of control in south-central Somalia over the following months, assisted militarily by Eritrea. In an effort at reconciliation, TFG and ICU representatives held several rounds of talks in Khartoum under the auspices of the Arab League. The meetings ended unsuccessfully due to uncompromising positions retained by both parties. Hardline Islamists subsequently gained power within the ICU, prompting <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Talibanization of the movement.|$|E

5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments {{arrived on}} the scene. Although the troops {{assisted}} in crowd control, their arrival was also a reaction of the authorities to <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E
5|$|Due to Turkish {{government}} <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> terrorist attack, {{security measures}} during the summit were tight.

5|$|Following the U.S. {{financial}} crisis in 2008, <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sovereign debt crisis developed in 2009 among investors concerning some European states, {{with the situation}} becoming particularly tense in early 2010. Greece was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were also significantly affected.

5|$|In South Korea, the {{government}} issued a typhoon warning {{for the southern}} portion of the country along the coast, prompting the airport at Pohang to close, and forcing 162flights to be canceled. Ferry service was also disrupted, and thousands of boats returned to port. The storm also prompted 138schools to close in the region. Earlier, the storm spurred <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible repeat of either typhoon Rusa in 2002 or Maemi in 2003, {{both of which were}} devastating storms in South Korea. Officials in the Russian Far East issued a storm warning for Vladivostok, advising boats to remain at port.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1942, when there were <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> German victory in the Middle East, Mishmar HaEmek {{was used as a}} {{training}} camp by the British army. 160 Jewish volunteers, who would later become members of the Palmach branch of the Haganah, were trained by Royal Engineers in sabotage and wireless operation. Several tons of explosives were hidden in caches in case the area came under German occupation. This program was terminated immediately upon the training of the volunteers, and orders issued for the collection of all equipment and explosives to be returned to the British.|$|E
5|$|Kingswear Castle {{was built}} to protect the coastal town of Dartmouth in Devon.

5|$|Singapore was an {{enthusiastic}} operator of the Hunter, first ordering the aircraft in 1968 during a massive {{expansion of the}} city-state's armed forces; deliveries began in 1971 and were completed by 1973. At the time, considerable international controversy was generated as Britain (and, as was later revealed, the U.S.) had refused to sell Hunters to neighbouring Malaysia, sparking <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regional arms race and accusations of favouritism. The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) eventually received 46 refurbished Hunters to equip two squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the chaos}} were <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{potential}} second explosion. A cloud of steam {{shot out of}} ventilators at the ammunition magazine at Wellington Barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine. While the fire was quickly put out, the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent. Uniformed officers ordered everyone away from the area. As the rumour spread across the city, many families fled their homes. The confusion hampered efforts for over two hours until fears were dispelled by about noon. However, many rescuers ignored the evacuation and naval rescue parties continued working uninterrupted at the harbour.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Pendennis was neglected; many of its guns became {{unserviceable}} {{and some}} buildings fell into ruin. The old post of captain of Pendennis Castle was abolished in 1837, with the fortification commanded by a conventional military appointment. In the 1850s, renewed <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> French invasion led to investment in new artillery at the castle, and nineteen 32- and 56-pounder (14.5 and 24.5 kg) guns were installed. Falmouth continued to be an important harbour, particularly for the Royal Navy. When new concerns about France emerged, an electronically operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from Pendennis and St Mawes. New 6- and 12-pounder (2.7 and 5.4 kg) quick-firing guns, supported by machine-guns for close defence, were assigned to the castle to deal with the emerging threat from enemy torpedo boats.|$|E
5|$|After {{the recent}} events, Queen Margaret still {{considered}} Warwick {{a threat to}} the throne, and cut off his supplies. In August 1457, however, a French attack on the English seaport of Sandwich set off <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full-scale French invasion. Warwick was again funded to protect the garrison and patrol the English coast. In disregard of royal authority, he then conducted highly successful acts of piracy, against the Castilian fleet in May 1458, and against the Hanseatic fleet a few weeks later. He also used his time on the Continent to establish relations with Charles VII of France and Philip the Good of Burgundy. Developing a solid military reputation and with good international connections, he then brought a part of his garrison to England, where he met up with his father and York in the summer of 1459.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Australian <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Japanese counterattack {{grew and}} they {{requested}} reinforcements from their higher commander, General Douglas MacArthur.

Actually, there were already 5,000Japanese around Sattelberg and Finschhafen while throughout early October this number grew to 12,000 {{as they began to}} prepare for their planned counterattack. The Australians received some reinforcements {{in the shape of the}} 2/43rd Infantry Battalion. The arrival of this unit meant that the 2/17th, deadlocked around Jivevaneng, could be freed for the advance on Finschhafen, thus enabling the entire 20th Brigade to concentrate on that objective.|$|E

The Japanese naval troops which were holding Finschhafen began to withdraw and Finschhafen fell to the Australians on 2 October. The 20th Infantry Brigade then linked up with the 22nd Infantry Battalion, a Militia infantry battalion that had cleared the coastal area in the south of the Huon Peninsula, advancing from Lae over the mountains. The Japanese withdrew into the mountains around Sattelberg.|$|E
5|$|Bayard's Cove Fort {{was built}} in the early 16th century to protect the coastal town of Dartmouth in Devon. In the medieval period, the town's harbour, located in the estuary of the River Dart, was an {{important}} trading and fishing port, able to hold up to 600 vessels; it continued to prosper in the 15th century on the proceeds of the wool trade. <b>Fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> French invasion, combined with the hope of retaining a valuable royal subsidy, led the town to develop Dartmouth Castle, {{on the west side of}} the estuary, into an artillery fort after 1486, with another fortification, Kingswear, being constructed the east side from 1491 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on 21January 1947, the UK {{experienced}} several cold spells {{that brought}} large drifts of snow to the country, blocking roads and railways, which caused problems transporting coal {{to the electric}} power stations. Many had to shut down, forcing severe restrictions to cut power consumption, including restricting domestic electricity to 19 hours per day and cutting some industrial supplies completely. In addition, radio broadcasts were limited, television services were suspended, some magazines were ordered to stop publishing, and newspapers were reduced in size. These measures, {{on top of the}} low temperatures, badly affected public morale and the Minister of Fuel and Power, Emanuel Shinwell, became a scapegoat; he received death threats and had to be placed under police guard.
