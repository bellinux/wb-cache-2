5|$|Christmas {{television}} is predominantly secular {{and focuses on}} the ethical message of <b>generosity</b> through gift giving and Santa Claus, or the psychological message of home, nostalgia and childhood, or both. The theological message of the holidaythe Incarnationis rarely encountered in Christmas television. Such a message would be inaccessible to many Americans.|$|E
5|$|Germanus {{is given}} a very {{favourable}} treatment {{in the work of}} Procopius, he openly praises him for his virtue, justice, and <b>generosity,</b> as well as for his energy and ability both as a soldier and an administrator.|$|E
5|$|Impulse control {{disorders}} including pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, binge eating, compulsive {{shopping and}} reckless <b>generosity</b> {{can be caused}} by medication, particularly orally active dopamine agonists. The dopamine dysregulation syndrome – with wanting of medication leading to overusage – is a rare complication of levodopa use (Giovannoni, et al. 2000).|$|E
5|$|On April 4, 2012, the Dartmouth Medical School {{was renamed}} the Audrey and Theodor Geisel School of Medicine {{in honor of}} their many years of <b>generosity</b> to the College.|$|E
5|$|The Clinton Presidential Center offers free {{admission}} to school groups, homeschool groups, {{and other school}} personnel with a reservation. Limited bus transportation grants for school districts are available. These are thanks to the <b>generosity</b> of The Bank of America Foundation.|$|E
5|$|According to Cassius Dio, a {{financial}} crisis emerged in AD 39. Suetonius places {{the beginning of this}} crisis in 38. Caligula's political payments for support, <b>generosity</b> and extravagance had exhausted the state's treasury. Ancient historians state that Caligula began falsely accusing, fining and even killing individuals for the purpose of seizing their estates.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl in their obituaries, Noether's {{contributions}} to topology illustrate her <b>generosity</b> with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study {{the properties of}} objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their connectedness. A common joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug, since they can be continuously deformed into one another.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Thomas {{was praised}} for his learning, his {{encouragement}} {{of education in}} his diocese, and his <b>generosity.</b> He was an excellent singer and composed hymns. In his youth, he was known for having a sturdy build, and in his old age he had a ruddy complexion and snow white hair.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{grew up to}} be {{tall and}} muscular, and was {{considered}} good looking {{by the standards of the}} period. He had a reputation as a competent public speaker and was known for his <b>generosity</b> to his household staff. Unusually, he enjoyed rowing, as well as hedging and ditching, and enjoyed associating with labourers and other lower-class workers. This behaviour was not considered normal for the nobility of the period and attracted criticism from contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels, however, used {{not only}} {{intimidation}} but also cajoling and <b>generosity</b> {{to achieve his}} goals. Ferdinand Marian requested compensation of 50,000 marks for taking {{on the role of}} Süß, an amount double anything he had received for previous roles. When asked to approve this amount, Goebbels did so citing the importance of the film and the need for a high-caliber cast to ensure its success.|$|E
5|$|In April 2008, Gan's {{life and}} <b>generosity</b> to many {{charitable}} causes {{are currently being}} showcased in a permanent gallery of the Peranakan Museum (former Tao Nan School building) at Armenian Street. The gallery titled Public Life: Making a difference (Level 3) honours Peranakans (Straits Chinese), who were prominent public figures and philanthropists such as Gan, Singapore pioneer Tan Kim Seng and former Cabinet Minister Lim Kim San.|$|E
5|$|In western societies, {{voluntary}} {{blood donation}} is a common, yet less extreme, form of risk taking. Costs {{associated with these}} donations include pain and risk of infection. If blood donation {{is an opportunity to}} send costly signals, then donors will be perceived by others as generous and physically healthy. In a survey, both donors and non-donors expressed perceptions of the health, <b>generosity,</b> and ability of blood donors to operate in stressful situations.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi {{recorded}} {{no apparent}} {{interest in the}} performance of Andromeda after the 1620 Carnival; the long letter that he wrote to Striggio on 13 March 1620 makes no reference to the event and is chiefly concerned with financial matters. The letter implies that the Gonzaga court was trying to persuade Monteverdi to return to Mantua; in courtly language Monteverdi evades the issue, while comparing the relative <b>generosity</b> of his Venetian employers with the parsimony of the Gonzaga court.|$|E
5|$|One day, Chia-yi forgets her English textbook. Ching-teng slips her his {{own book}} and tells their teacher he forgot his own textbook; he then endures a long lecture and is punished. Chia-yi, touched by Ching-teng's <b>generosity,</b> prepares a {{practice}} exam {{for him in}} return, to encourage him to study. She also convinces him to stay after school to study with her. Their relationship grows, and Ching-teng's grades gradually improve.|$|E
5|$|Scrooge awakens on Christmas {{morning a}} changed man. He spends {{the day with}} Fred's family and {{anonymously}} sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner. The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay and becomes like another father to Tiny Tim. From then on Scrooge began to treat everyone with kindness, <b>generosity</b> and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Tessa is MacLeod's mortal {{companion}} and bears {{the consequences of}} his immortality. These include her aging while he does not, the impossibility of having children together and the dangers of MacLeod's involvement in the Game, an ongoing battle in which all Immortals must behead each other until a single victor remains. Fully aware of this situation, Tessa stays with MacLeod, demonstrating her courage, understanding, <b>generosity</b> and compassion.|$|E
5|$|The chapter {{asserts that}} the king should be truthful, avoid anger, be virtuous and lead by example. The king, ministers and {{citizens}} should, states the Manasollasa's first sub-book, refrain from injury to others, practice self-restraint and <b>generosity,</b> have faith in gods, feed and support the poor and helpless, and be friendly. The king, according to the text, should honour his ancestors and all guests.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Durant {{has participated}} in philanthropic causes. In 2013, he pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross {{for the victims of}} the 2013 Moore tornado. His <b>generosity</b> {{inspired}} the Thunder and Nike to match his donation. He is also a spokesperson for the Washington, D. C. branch of P'Tones Records, a nationwide non-profit after-school music program.|$|E
5|$|With A Christmas Carol, Dickens {{captured}} the zeitgeist of the mid-Victorian {{revival of the}} Christmas holiday. He has been acknowledged as an influence on the modern Western observance of Christmas and inspired several aspects of Christmas, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive <b>generosity</b> of spirit.|$|E
5|$|A {{recipient}} of France's Legion of Honour and Croix de Guerre, and twice mentioned in despatches during the war, Watt was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1919. He left {{the military to}} pursue business interests in Australia, and was lauded for his <b>generosity</b> to other returned airmen. In 1921, {{at the age of}} forty-three, he died by accidental drowning at Bilgola Beach, New South Wales. He is commemorated by the Oswald Watt Gold Medal for outstanding achievement in Australian aviation, and the Oswald Watt Fund at the University of Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Acarya Ananda Jha, {{the author}} of the Chinnamasta Tattva, prescribes her worship by {{soldiers}} as she embodies self-control of lust, heroic self-sacrifice for the benefit of others, and fearlessness in the face of death. In a collective prayer to the Mahavidyas in the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, the devotee prays to emulate Chhinnamasta in her <b>generosity</b> to others. Other goals common to worship of all Mahavidyas are: poetic speech, well-being, control of one's foes, removal of obstacles, ability to sway kings, ability to attract others, conquest over other kings, and, finally, moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|Gates has {{credited}} the <b>generosity</b> {{and extensive}} philanthropy of David Rockefeller {{as a major}} influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby {{they are interested in}} tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations. As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28billion to charity; the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.|$|E
5|$|It is {{unnecessary}} to add, {{that it was}} instantly afforded. He recovered; and, when discharged from the hospital, signified his desired {{to return to his}} corps to combat us again: exhibiting thus, through the whole, a strong sense of the value of <b>generosity</b> and courtesy in warfare, and also of his duty to his country,– separating completely in his own mind private and national feelings from each other,– and his frank confidence in the individuals of our nation, from the duty he owed his own, to fight against us collectively.|$|E
5|$|Official {{religion}} {{involved a}} variety of rituals, based in temples. Some rites were performed every day, whereas others were festivals, taking place at longer intervals and often limited to a particular temple or deity. The gods received their offerings in daily ceremonies, in which their statues were clothed, anointed, and presented with food as hymns were recited in their honor. These offerings, in addition to maintaining maat for the gods, celebrated deities' life-giving <b>generosity</b> and encouraged them to remain benevolent rather than vengeful.|$|E
5|$|One day, Indra, {{the king}} of the Devas (celestial deities), {{disguised}} as a Brahmin, approaches Karnan and asks for his armour and ear rings in donation to weaken and stop him from overpowering Arjuna. Aware of Indra's intention, Karnan yet donates both the items he was born with and which would make him invincible. Pleased with Karnan's <b>generosity,</b> Indra gives him a powerful weapon, Nagastra, but states that he can use it only once. Karnan, disguised as a Brahmin, becomes the student of the sage Parasurama to acquire the Brahmastra; one day, however, Parasurama realises that Karnan is a Kshatriya, a tribe he opposes. Enraged, he renders Karnan incapable of using the Brahmastra when most needed, and banishes him.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} also emerged. In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and the Duke of Somerset) {{demanded that}} she be granted a parliamentary annuity of £50,000, a sum that would end her dependence on William and Mary. Sarah {{was seen as the}} driving force behind this bill, creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the Privy Purse, to keep Anne dependent on his <b>generosity.</b> However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing out that a parliamentary grant would be more secure than charity from the Privy Purse. Eventually Anne received the grant from Parliament, and felt she owed this to Sarah's efforts.|$|E
5|$|Pain gave {{lands to}} Llanthony Priory, helping to {{establish}} the endowment of that monastic house, although {{it is difficult to}} distinguish his gifts from those of Hugh de Lacy, as the monks of Llanthony grouped the gifts of both men together in their records. In addition Pain granted lands to Gloucester Abbey, which had benefited from the <b>generosity</b> of his father and brother, as did his wife Sybil, together with other grants to her uncle the abbot. She also gave to two churches in Hereford: St Peter and St Guthlac.|$|E
5|$|Rice is the {{foundation}} of every meal, and is often eaten with fish broth, greens, beans or squash. Manioc and green bananas are staples most commonly eaten when other more preferable foods are too expensive or out of season. The Antankarana were historically herders and although they are now generally agriculturalists, cattle are kept for milk. They are also viewed as a form of wealth; the number of cattle one gives away indicates <b>generosity,</b> and the number sacrificed to the ancestors is a measure of loyalty. The sacrifice of zebu is a typical element of many major rituals and celebrations ranging from Muslim holidays to life events like marriage, death and birth.|$|E
5|$|The Princess {{was married}} by proxy to PedroII in 1843. Her spouse's {{expectations}} {{had been raised}} when a portrait was presented that depicted Teresa Cristina as an idealized beauty, but he was displeased by his bride's plain looks upon their first meeting later that year. Despite a cold beginning, the couple's relationship improved as time passed, due primarily to Teresa Cristina's patience, kindness, <b>generosity</b> and simplicity. These traits also helped her win {{the hearts of the}} Brazilian people, and her distance from political controversies shielded her from criticism. She also sponsored archaeological studies in Italy and Italian immigration to Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{composed}} the epitaph placed on William the Conqueror's tomb in St. Etienne in Caen, but the chronicler Orderic Vitalis felt that Thomas was chosen more for his rank than for his skill in composition. Thomas did not concern {{himself with the}} church–state issues surrounding the Investiture Crisis, but he was tenacious in defending the independence of York against the efforts of Canterbury to assert primacy over the whole of England. Later authors, including William of Malmesbury and Hugh the Chantor, praised Thomas for his <b>generosity,</b> chastity, elegance, and charm.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his life}} in {{politics}} and his long military career he characterised the arrogant and extravagant aristocrat of the period. His progression through the Army was marked by many episodes of extraordinary incompetence, but this can be measured against his <b>generosity</b> to the men under his command and genuine bravery. As {{a member of the}} landed aristocracy he had actively and steadfastly opposed any political reform in Britain, but {{in the last year of}} his life he relented and came to acknowledge that such reform would bring benefit to all classes of society.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with {{the concerns of the}} plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of <b>generosity</b> and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E
5|$|During {{his search}} for backers, Borchgrevink met Sir George Newnes, a leading British {{magazine}} publisher and cinema pioneer whose portfolio included the Westminster Gazette, Tit-Bits, Country Life and the Strand Magazine. It was not unusual for publishers to support exploration—Newnes's great rival Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe) had recently financed Frederick Jackson's expedition to Franz Josef Land, and had pledged financial backing to the National Antarctic Expedition. Newnes was sufficiently impressed by Borchgrevink to offer the full costs of his proposed expedition—around £40,000, (at least £3million in 2008 values). This <b>generosity</b> infuriated Sir Clements Markham and the geographical establishment, who saw Borchgrevink as a penniless Norwegian nobody who had secured British money which they believed {{ought to have been}} theirs. Markham maintained an attitude of hostility and contempt towards Borchgrevink, and chastised Mill for attending the launch of his expedition.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{had raised}} $1.7 {{million by the}} time he was forced to abandon the Marathon. He {{realized}} that the nation was about to see the consequences of the disease, and hoped that this might lead to greater <b>generosity.</b> A week after his run ended, the CTV Television Network organized a nationwide telethon in support of Fox and the Canadian Cancer Society. Supported by Canadian and international celebrities, the five-hour event raised $10.5 million. Among the donations were $1 million each by the governments of British Columbia and Ontario, the former to create a new research institute to be founded in Fox's name, and the latter an endowment given to the Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation. Donations continued throughout the winter, and by the following April, over $23 million had been raised.|$|E
5|$|In his profession, Coward {{was widely}} admired and loved for his <b>generosity</b> and {{kindness}} {{to those who}} fell on hard times. Stories are told of the unobtrusive {{way in which he}} relieved the needs or paid the debts of old theatrical acquaintances who had no claim on him. From 1934 until 1956, Coward was the president of the Actors Orphanage, which was supported by the theatrical industry. In that capacity, he befriended the young Peter Collinson, who was in the care of the orphanage. He became Collinson's godfather and helped him to get started in show business. When Collinson was a successful director, he invited Coward {{to play a role in}} The Italian Job. Graham Payn also played a small role in the film.|$|E
5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 {{and gone to}} study at the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further <b>generosity.</b> Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired to paint The Conquest of Belgrade around this time. Writing in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted to paint the brave battle of Mirko on my canvas. With seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims were celebrating Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't even think about any danger. Mirko and his comrades killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal for the others. Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed {{with some of the}} participants in Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E
