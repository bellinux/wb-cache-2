40|$|Labour hire {{workers are}} one {{category}} {{of a group}} more generally labelled contingent, temporary, precarious or casual workers. Research shows they are generally at increased risk of occupational injury and illness compared to permanent employees. It is proposed {{that one of the}} causal factors is the unique tripartite employment relationship used to engage labour hire. The dynamics and behaviours in this triangular relationship are discussed with reference to the legal and organisational uncertainty that it frequently presents. A model is proposed that suggests the occupational health and safety interdependence between the three parties. The potential occupational health and safety outcomes for the labour <b>hire</b> <b>worker</b> are examined. Apparent gaps in the existing literature are identified, along with future research opportunities...|$|E
30|$|The {{picture for}} total <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> in the {{informal}} sector (columns four to six) looks somewhat different. As more modern activities include those with more <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> per enterprise, the relatively modern state-industries account for a much larger share of <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> than they do for total employment. Compared to total employment, however, there was less change {{in the distribution of}} <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> across quartiles. Both the top and bottom quartile slightly declined in terms of their share in total <b>hired</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|R
30|$|Based on the NSS {{survey of}} unorganized manufacturing, we {{construct}} three measures of informal sector employment: total state-industry employment, {{the total number}} of <b>hired</b> <b>workers,</b> and the total real wage bill. Total employment includes working owners, unpaid family <b>workers,</b> and <b>hired</b> <b>workers,</b> both full- and part-time. <b>Hired</b> <b>workers</b> exclude owners and contributing family workers, and the wage bill recorded in the data refers to the value of total compensation paid to <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> only (deflated using state- and industry-specific wholesale price indices). We analyze <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> and the wage bill in order {{to see whether or not}} expansion, if any, occurs chiefly through more family members and working owners being drawn into the informal sector, versus actual job creation in informal enterprises.|$|R
40|$|As well as <b>hiring</b> <b>workers</b> who {{are members}} of the kibbutz and who, therefore, are owners of the means of production, some kibbutz {{factories}} have <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> who are not kibbutz members. Our hypotheses, drawn from the writings of Marx and others, suggest both “individual” and “contextual effects” of ownership on alienation. At the individual level, <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> will feel more alienated than kibbutz workers. Similarly, at the contextual level, persons in factories where some <b>workers</b> are <b>hired</b> will feel more alienated than will persons in factories that do not include <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> whether or not the persons are themselves <b>hired</b> <b>workers.</b> These hypotheses imply intervening variables such as influence by workers that are examined through a path analysis. The analysis indicates only individual effects of ownership on feeling of alienation although ownership does have a contextual effect on aspects of the participativeness of the factor...|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{the last}} three columns in Table  6 show the {{distribution}} of the wage bill across modernity quartiles. Since family helpers and working owners typically do not receive a wage or salary, this distribution is similar to the distribution of <b>hired</b> <b>workers.</b> An even larger share is accounted for by the top quartiles, indicating that <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> in more modern activities earn higher wages, which is not surprising given the higher capital-intensity of these activities. As is the case for <b>hired</b> <b>workers,</b> {{there is no sign of}} modernization when one considers the total wage bill.|$|R

40|$|Syfte: Vi vill med denna undersökning se hur cheferna leder sin inhyrda {{personal}} när arbetsgruppen består av både inhyrd och ordinarie personal.    För att få svar på detta har vi utgått från fyra frågeställningar   Hur ser introduktions- och utbildningsinsatserna ut för de inhyrda? Anpassar ledarna sitt ledarskap gentemot de inhyrda? Hur motiveras de inhyrda? Hur gör ledarna för att få de inhyrda att känna sig delaktiga i organisationen? Metod: Vi har använt en kvalitativ metod. Våra primärdata är intervjuer av ledare. Sekundärdata är insamlade med hjälp av facklitteratur och vetenskapliga artiklar. Därefter har vi låtit den teori vi valt ut möta den empiri vi fått fram.   Resultat & slutsats: Ledarna på de företag vi undersökte ansåg att de inte anpassar sitt ledarskap gentemot den inhyrda personalen. De inhyrda får samma introduktion och motiveras på samma sätt som den ordinarie personalen. Utifrån de forskningsresultat vi tagit del av så anser vi att en viss anpassning bör ske, framförallt vid introduktion av den inhyrda personalen.   Förslag till fortsatt forskning: Hur pass lång bör kontrakttiden vara eller hur pass avancerade bör arbetsuppgifterna vara för att det ska bli lönsamt med en anpassad introduktion för inhyrd personal?   Uppsatsens bidrag: Denna studie visar hur ledarna i de arbetsgrupper vi undersökt leder de inhyrda. Även om man inte kan generalisera utifrån denna forskning anser vi att det går att se en tendens då ledarnas svar ofta överensstämmer.   Aim: We want to {{use this}} study to investigate whether {{the leaders of the}} companies we studied lead the <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> in a different way when the working group includes both hired and ordinary staff.    To answer this we have been based on four issues:   What do the introductions- and training efforts look like for the <b>hired</b> <b>worker?</b> Do the leaders adapt their leadership towards the <b>hired</b> <b>worker?</b> How do they motivate the <b>hired</b> <b>worker?</b> How do the leaders get the <b>hired</b> <b>worker</b> to feel involved in the organization? Method: We have chosen a qualitative method. Our primary data are collected by interviews of leaders. Secondary data are collected with the help of literature and scientific articles. Then we have allowed the theory we have selected to meet the empirical knowledge gained.   Result & Conclusions: In our study, we concluded that the leaders of the companies we surveyed consider that they don’t adapt their leadership towards the <b>hired</b> <b>workers.</b> The <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> got the same introduction and get motivated in the same way. From research we have studied, we believe that some adjustment should be made, especially regarding the introduction of the <b>hired</b> <b>worker.</b>   Suggestions for future research: How long should the contract term be or how advanced tasks should it be to make it profitable with a customized introduction for <b>hired</b> <b>workers?</b>   Contribution of the thesis: This study shows how the leaders of the groups we studied control the <b>hired</b> <b>worker.</b> Even though we cannot generalize based on this research we believe that we can see a trend since the leaders' responses often coincide...|$|R

40|$|This project {{examines}} {{the impact of}} employer-provided financial education for newly <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> on contributions to voluntary retirement savings plans. Using administrative data from five large employers, the researchers {{assess the impact of}} information and delivery methods on the choice to participate in the plans and the deferral amount selected. The researchers collected additional data from one employer-partner covering the two years before and after their automatic enrollment policy was implemented. Average participation rates increased sharply, while the same fraction of workers took advantage of the full employer match once eligible. The researchers also conducted a survey of newly <b>hired</b> <b>workers.</b> The survey measured employees’ understanding of their company’s voluntary retirement savings plan, their assessment of the employer-provided information, and their reasons for limited or non-participation. Nonparticipants demonstrated lower overall financial literacy relative to participants, and many respondents felt that the information provided by their employers was not sufficient. Finally, the largest employer-partner, BB&T, implemented a field experiment where an on-line mailing was sent to a random subset of non-participating newly <b>hired</b> <b>workers.</b> Younger workers receiving the flyer {{were significantly more likely to}} enroll in the 401 (k) plan, while older workers actually had lower initiation rates relative to their control group. The research presented provides insights into the efficacy and importance of financial education provided by employers to newly <b>hired</b> <b>workers</b> and how it impacts their retirement saving decisions. ...|$|R
