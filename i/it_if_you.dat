25|$|Vladimir Putin, {{it was not}} you {{who started}} this war. But you can finish <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have enough courage and {{determination}} of de Gaulle. We offer you a sensible peace based on mutual benefit by the principle independence in exchange for security. In case of troops withdrawal and acknowledgement of independence of Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, we are obliged not to make any political, military, or economic treaties with anyone against Russia, not to accommodate foreign military bases on our territory even temporarily, not to support and not to finance groups or organizations carrying out a military struggle against RF, {{to be present in}} the united ruble zone, to enter CIS. Besides, we can sign a treaty even though a neutral state status is more acceptable to us. We can also guarantee a renunciation of armed struggle against RF by all Muslims of Russia for at least 10 to 15 years under condition of freedom of faith. We are not related to the apartment bombings in Moscow and Volgodonsk, but we can take responsibility for this in an acceptable way.|$|E
25|$|The {{good news}} is, I'm finally {{working on my}} debut retail album. It sounds amazing so far. Everyone is excited about it. The bad news is, no more free music. Odds are, ever. No loopholes. Which means, Vampire Sunlight {{might be the last}} free release, and The Evil Microchip will not drop. Not even on YouTube. Sorry, Markus. But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's helped me this far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time to take things to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E

For this mad melodramatization of a desperate adventure of Bond with sinister characters in Istanbul and on the Orient Express is fictional exaggeration {{on a grand scale}} and in a dashing style, thoroughly illogical and improbable, but with tongue blithely wedged in cheek." ...|$|E

500|$|Olds had {{a highly}} publicized career and life, {{including}} marriage to Hollywood actress Ella Raines. As a young man he was also recognized for his athletic prowess in both high school and college, being named an All-American as a lineman in college football. Olds expressed his philosophy regarding fighter pilots in the quote: [...] "There are pilots and there are pilots; with the good ones, it is inborn.

500|$|Gallagher {{reportedly}} {{blasted the}} organisers of the 2008 Glastonbury Festival for scheduling US hip-hop artist Jay-Z as a headliner for the traditionally guitar-driven festival: [...] "If it ain't broke don't fix <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> start {{to break it}} then people aren't going to go. I'm sorry, but Jay-Z? No chance. Glastonbury {{has a tradition of}} guitar music and even when they throw the odd curve ball in on a Sunday night you go 'Kylie Minogue?' I don't know about it.

500|$|In May 2011, Gaga {{said her}} [...] "emotional connection" [...] {{with the song}} was difficult.

I could delve into <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> turn that (motions to recorder) off... But ultimately the mix and the process of getting the production finished was very stressful for me.

500|$|Musically, Love's {{work with}} Hole and her solo {{efforts have been}} {{characterized}} as alternative rock; Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive punk rock. Spins October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements. In 1998, Love stated that Hole had [...] "always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop. I always talked about <b>it,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> go back... what'll sound like some weird Sonic Youth tuning back then to you was sounding like the Raspberries to me, in my demented pop framework".|$|E
500|$|Chinese {{politicians}} {{within the}} government raised issues with the Constitution in late 2005. Lim Keng Yaik of Gerakan asked for a re-examination of the social contract to ascertain whether Bangsa Malaysia could be achieved. Lim was severely criticised by many prominent Malay politicians, including Khairy Jamaluddin and Ahmad Shabery Cheek. The Malay press, mostly owned by UMNO, also ran articles condemning the questioning of the social contract. Lim responded: [...] "How do you expect non-Malays to pour their hearts and souls into the country, and to one day die for <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> keep harping on this? Flag-waving and singing the 'Negaraku' (national anthem) are rituals, while true love for the nation lies in the heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Based on the premiere, Merrill Barr of Forbes {{felt that}} the show [...] "has grown up a lot since its first year, and with the start of season three, it's hard to imagine what {{complaints}} any fans could possibly still have. If you want overall continuity, you got <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want people with super powers going crazy, it's there. If you want an ensemble cast that brings the broadcast television corner of the MCU to life, then look no further. The point is, with the new season of S.H.I.E.L.D., it's everything one could ask from the show." [...] Vulture's Scott Meslow stated that the premiere was [...] "riddled with [...] visual signifiers, highlighting the ways Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has gradually become sharper, sleeker, and more reliant on the bones of its comic-book source material." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to UB40 and Brown, the soundtrack features reggae music from: Jimmy Cliff, Common Sense, Maxi Priest, Shaggy, Rayvon, and Betty Wright. [...] Mark Mancina wrote a techno track for the soundtrack {{based on his}} film score, titled [...] "Speed TK Re-mix", performed by Japanese musician Tetsuya [...] "TK" [...] Komuro. Other songs recorded specifically for the soundtrack include Priest's cover of [...] "The Tide Is High" [...] and Cliff's re-recording of his 1972 song [...] "You Can Get <b>It</b> <b>If</b> <b>You</b> Really Want". [...] The Speed2: Cruise Control soundtrack album was released by Virgin Records on May 20, 1997, about one month before the film's release.

500|$|In 2017, Getzlaf {{was named}} {{a finalist for the}} Mark Messier Leadership Award along with Calgary Flames defencemen Mark Giordano and Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno. In the 2017 playoffs, Getzlaf surpassed former {{teammate}} Teemu Selänne's franchise record of 35 playoff goals against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 4 of the best of seven series. During the Western Conference finals, Getzlaf was fined $10,000 for using a homophobic slur to insult an on-ice official. He later said, [...] "That's my responsibility to understand that there are eyes and ears on us all the time. Fortunately enough, nobody heard <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can read lips, it's a little bit harder, and I apologize for that. That's a thing that you won't hear from me again.

500|$|Prior to Carey signing {{her record}} deal with Columbia, she and Margulies had written and {{produced}} fourteen songs {{over a three-year}} period, seven of which made the final track listing of her self-titled debut studio album (1990), including [...] "Someday". [...] "Someday" [...] {{was one of the}} four songs which were on the demo tape handed to Mottola prior to her signing the contract. Carey explained the process behind the song's conception, saying that Margulies would play different notes on an electric keyboard with Carey directing him on chord changes, and provided the lyrics, chorus and melody. Producer Ric Wake later recalled that [...] "Someday" [...] was his favorite song from the beginning of recording sessions for the album, saying [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to do it.'
