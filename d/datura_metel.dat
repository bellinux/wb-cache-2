Das amostras coletadas 19 reagiram positivamente, com o PVY em PTA-ELISA e PVYºem DAS-ELISA. Plantas de Chenopodium amaranticolor reagiram com sintoma local e plantas de Nicotiana glutinosa, N. tabacum ‘WB’, N. sylvestris, N. debneyi, N. tabacum ‘Sansun’ reagiram com sintomas de mosaico sistêmico; tomateiros ‘Alambra’ manifestaram sintomas de mosaico-amarelo. Plantas de <b>Datura</b> stramonium, D. <b>metel</b> e C. annuum ‘Magda’ não foram infectadas. A ausência de sintomas em C. annuum ‘Magda’, identificou a presença do PVY patotipo 1 (PVYº 1), nas 19 amostras. Como foi identificada a mesma espécie de vírus nas amostras, optou-se pela inoculação do isolado de tomate ‘Alambra’ de Elias Fausto nos dezenove acessos de Lycopersicon spp. do Banco Ativo de Germoplasma (BAG) - IAC. O delineamento dos experimentos foi inteiramente casualizado. A reação dos acessos foi avaliada pela manifestação dos sintomas, pelos resultados positivos ou negativos após testes de retro-inoculação e PTA-ELISA, pela análise do &# 967; 2 utilizando-se a proporção de plantas sintomáticas e assintomáticas, com resultados positivos ou que não manifestaram sintomas e reagiram negativamente, em PTA-ELISA, constituindo, portanto fontes potenciais de genes de resistência para o PVY em tomate. Samples of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) ‘Alambra’ {{were collected in}} commercial fields of Elias Fausto, Monte-Mor and Mogi-Guaçu, SP. The plants with virus-like symptoms, especially yellow mosaic were submitted, to biological and serological identification tests. For biological tests, the host range was determined by indicator and differential plants in the family Chenopodiaceae and Solanaceae. The serological identification was made by PTA-ELISA with polyclonal antiserum against Tospovirus, Tobamovirus, Potyvirus and Cucumovirus and by DAS-ELISA, by using monoclonal antibodies against PVY common strain (PVYº), PVY chlorotic strain (PVY C) and PVY necrotic strain (PVY N). All the tested samples showed positive reaction in PTA-ELISA with antiserum against PVY and negative reaction with the antiserum against the remaining viruses. In DAS-ELISA, positive reaction occurred with PVY common strain. Among the host plants, Chenopodium amaranticolor reacted with local lesions, while N. glutinosa and N. tabacum ‘WB’ showed systemic mosaic and the ‘Alambra’ reacted with yellow mosaic, while <b>Datura</b> stramonium, D. <b>metel</b> and C. annuum ‘Magda’ were not infected. The reaction on the differential host C. annuum ‘Magda’ permitted to identify the PVY pathotype 1 in all the 19 samples. To evaluate {{the reaction of the}} 19 accesses of Lycopersicon spp. from the IAC active bank of germoplasm, one of the samples of tomato ‘Alambra’ from Elias Fausto was inoculated on tomato accesses and also, the variety ‘Alambra’ was used as a positive control. The experiments delineation was randomized and the plant reaction was evaluated by presence and type of symptoms, and also by positive and negative results after back inoculation and serological tests (PTA-ELISA), and by analysis of &# 967; 2 using the ratios between symptomatic and asymptomatic plants with positive or negative results in ELISA. It was verified that most evaluated accesses were tolerant to PVYº- 1, but the wild species L. peruvianum B, LA- 371 - 2 and radiated 1 C had a great number of asymptomatic plants with negative results by ELISA, constituting potential sources of genes of resistance against PVY in tomatoes...|$|R

D. metel is a closely related Old World plant for which similar effects were described by Avicenna in eleventh century Persia. The closely related Datura stramonium differs in having smaller flowers and tooth-edged leaves, and Datura wrightii in having wider, 5-toothed (instead of 10-toothed) flowers. Datura innoxia differs from D. stramonium, D. metel & D. fastuosa in having about 7 to 10 secondary veins on either side of the midrib of the leaf which anastomose by arches at about 1 to 3 mm. from the margin. No anastomosis of the secondary veins are seen in the other 4 major species of Datura.|$|E

50|$|Vehicle {{registration}} plate numbers are usually assigned in ascending order, {{beginning with a}} starting point such as AAA-001. Thus, someone familiar with the sequence can determine roughly when the vehicle {{registration plate}} was issued. The letters I, O and U {{are not used to}} avoid confusion with 1, 0 and V. Many provinces distinguish their vehicle registration plates through distinctive colour schemes and logos. For example, the <b>Datura</b> <b>metel</b> flower has appeared on every Punjab plate since 2007. In Sindh, plates have long featured the provincial coat of arms with a distinctive yellow background. Islamabad Capital Territory recently unveiled a new plate with Faisal Mosque in the background. Typically, the registration number is embossed. Other identifying information, such as the name of the issuing jurisdiction and the vehicle class, can be either surface-printed or embossed. The Government of Pakistan fixed the size for all their passenger vehicle registration plates at six inches in height by twelve inches in width, although these figures may vary slightly by jurisdiction. Smaller-sized plates are used for motorcycles, scooters and rickshaws.|$|E

Given that Aghori tantrics are charnel ground ascetics who pursue moksha (spiritual liberation) in settings of extreme horror, venerate wrathful deities (principally Bhairava, his consort Bhairavi, Dhumavati and Bagalamukhi) and find in Aconitum ferox a drug with unpleasant somatic effects warning (rightly) of possible death, {{it is clear that the}} experience evoked by the smoking of Aconite in such circumstances is likely to be one of dysphoria (albeit dysphoria sought consciously, in pursuit of the deeper euphoria of advaita or realisation of the oneness of all being).|$|E

CuCl 2. 2 H 2 O and Na 2 CuEDTA at level concentration 0.; 0. 1; 5; 10; 15; and 20 µM. The growth pattern of callus in control showed increasing growth rate in 36 days, whereas exponential stage was reached at 12 - 20 th doi*. Whilst, after 10 doi, the treatment showed constant growth pattern. The absorption rate of the culture was increased by the addition of the CuCl 2. 2 H 2 O at 5 – 15 µM of level concentration but declined at 20 µM. The maximum rate of accumulation of Cu (0, 1519 mg g - 1) was obtained at 15 µM. Instead, the addition of Na 2 CuEDTA at 5 – 20 µM of level concentration showed the significant increment while the maximum accumulation was obtained at 20 µM (0, 1420 mg g - 1). The existence of chelator in copper compound reduced the rate of toxicity while all tolerance index values were between 66, 24 and 97, 28 %. The results suggested the role of callus of D. metel as  that fairly absorbed and accumulated Cu 2 +. Exposure with CuCl 2. 2 H 2 O indicated higher accumulation than Na 2 CuEDTA.
