40|$|Abstract Background This study {{evaluated}} the primary school environment {{in terms of}} being conducive to good nutrition practices, sufficient physical activity and prevention of nicotine use, with the view of planning a school-based health intervention. Methods A sample of 100 urban and rural disadvantaged schools was randomly selected from two education districts of the Western Cape Education Department, South Africa. A situation analysis, which comprised an interview with the school principal and completion of an observation schedule of the school environment, was done at all schools. Results Schools, on average, had 560 learners and 16 educators. Principals perceived the top health priorities for learners to be an unhealthy diet (50 %) and to far lesser degree, lack of physical activity (24 %) and underweight (16 %). They cited lack of physical activity (33 %) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs; 24 %) as the main health priorities for educators, while substance abuse (66 %) and tobacco use (31 %) were prioritised for parents. Main barriers to health promotion programmes included lack of financial resources and too little time in the time table. The most common items sold at the school tuck shops were crisps (100 %), and then sweets (96 %), while vendors mainly sold sweets (92 %), crisps (89 %), and <b>ice</b> <b>lollies</b> (38 %). Very few schools (8 %) had policies governing the type of food items sold at school. Twenty-six of the 100 schools that were visited had vegetable gardens. All schools reported having physical activity and physical education in their time tables, however, not all of them offered this activity outside the class room. Extramural sport offered at schools mainly included athletics, netball, and rugby, with cricket and soccer being offered less frequently. Conclusion The formative findings of this study contribute to the knowledge of key environmental and policy determinants that {{may play a role in}} the health behaviour of learners, their parents and their educators. Evidently, these show that school environments are not always conducive to healthy lifestyles. To address the identified determinants relating to learners it is necessary to intervene on the various levels of influence, i. e. parents, educators, and the support systems for the school environment including the curriculum, food available at school, resources for physical activity as well as appropriate policies in this regard. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Few {{data are}} {{available}} in the literature as to whether an additive-free diet is more nutritious when compared to one that contains azo-dyes. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether there is a significant difference in the nutritional content of an azo-free diet compared to one that contains azo-dyes. This formed part of an extension of a study that looked at the effect of food additives on behaviour of children (Bateman, 2004). Methods: Azo-dyes [(E 102), (E 104), (E 110), (E 122), (E 123), 4 R (E 124), (E 127), (E 128), (E 129), (E 131), (E 132), (E 133), (E 142), (E 151), (E 154), (E 155), (E 180) ] and a preservative [(Sodium benzoate (E 211) ] were eliminated from the diet of children. The study dietitian advised families on how to avoid foods that contain food colours and preservatives such as those found in certain brands of beverages, sweets, cakes, <b>ice</b> <b>lollies,</b> desserts, jam and crisps. To aid compliance to the diet, suitable alternatives were recommended. The parents of 21 children (11 females) aged 8 – 9 years completed a 7 day food diary (baseline) before and during week 3 of the diet period. The food diaries were collected and coded for portion sizes by the study dietitian and analysed using CompEat. Nutrient values were compared to the recommended nutrient intake. The data was analysed using SPSS 12 and paired samples t-test (significance level P £ 0. 005). Results: There was no significant difference in energy, protein or fat intake between baseline diet and the azo-dye free diet. There was a reduction in the mean intake of carbohydrate (P = 0. 000), sugar (P = 0. 000), phosphorous (P = 0. 005), magnesium (P = 0. 002), potassium (P = 0. 005), chloride (P = 0. 003) and vitamin C (P = 0. 002) when an azo-free diet was followed. Discussions: Any dietary manipulation may effect overall nutrient intake. The effect may result in a nutritionally superior diet but this is not always the case (Isolauri et al., 1998). The children in this study showed that eliminating azo-dyes from their diet resulted in their intake of two micronutrients (potassium and magnesium) and one macronutrient (carbohydrate) being below that recommended for their age (Department of Health, 1991). Conclusion: Elimination diets may have a detrimental effect on nutritional intake, even when the food that is eliminated is perceived as unhealthy. Any nutritional manipulation should be made with caution and the resultant diet should be assessed to ensure its nutritional adequacy...|$|R
