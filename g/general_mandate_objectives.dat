40|$|Magister Legum - LLMDespite some {{gains in}} {{economic}} reforms and international commitments, Ethiopia still maintains {{the position of}} one of the poorest countries in the world in the 21 st century with very little power to influence the allocation of resources in the world market. The development problems in many of the sub-Saharan regions are confined within the country including the difficulty to keep up with rapid {{increase in the number of}} primary school enrollments, which has led to a situation of compromised quality; high child mortality and HIV/AIDS, which poses additional challenges to the poor health facilities, gender and regional inequalities and sustainable debt burden. Making matters worse, Ethiopia's political instability, civil war, recurring of drought, and economic mismanagement ties the country to a severe poverty cycle [...] Ethiopia has made important economic, social and political reforms with the support of the World bank and other multilateral institutions, to pave the way for the country to face the challenges posed by globalization. However, these reforms have not been sustained by effective implementation. The response to overcome the problems has also been slow to see rapid growth. In this research paper, the writer explores the challenges regarding Ethiopia's poverty from perspective of the World Bank. The research examines the theoretical and conceptual underpinning of the World Bank's <b>general</b> <b>mandate</b> and <b>objectives</b> on poverty reduction, using Ethiopia as a case study.

The obligation does not mandate the producer to physically do it on his own, but rather allows for networks the producer can set up with various treatment companies or by joining a collective system.

The paper notes that textbooks which employ programmed reading help students progress at a slow but steady rate. It then discusses the hierarchical method of state <b>mandated</b> <b>objectives</b> and testing. Features of the state mandated approach are highlighted, such as the following: state tests are written by those removed from the classroom; the tests tend to measure lower levels of cognition such as recall and comprehension rather than critical and creative thinking; and they are only meaningful if teachers construct instruction based on the tests. The final method of teaching reading considered in the paper is an open ended approach, where teachers pick and choose from textbooks and allow the students some choices. Individualized reading and sustained silent reading are examples of this open ended approach.
