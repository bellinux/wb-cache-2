5|$|Sailing via the longer, but safer {{southern}} route, {{on the way}} to the Middle East {{the convoy}} carrying the Australians made a port call at Durban, South Africa. While there, the battalion marched through the city under arms on 13 December 1940, before re-embarking. Disembarking in Alexandria, Egypt, on 31 December 1940, the battalion went into camp at Ikingi Maryut with 33 officers and 707 men. In February 1941, the battalion was transferred once more, as the 18th Brigade was reassigned to the 7th Division. Around the same time, the brigade was reduced to only three infantry battalions as part of an Army-wide re-organization, and the 2/11th Battalion was transferred to the 19th Brigade. With the 7th Division the battalion fought its first major engagement of the war on 21 March 1941, when it led the 18th Brigade's assault on the Italian fortress at Giarabub, which was held by about 1,500 Italians. Advancing from Siwa in Egypt, the battalion, supported by elements of the 2/10th and 2/12th Battalions, attacked from the south across marshland, while cavalry from the 6th Division Cavalry Regiment feigned an attack against the strongest point of the fortress. Amidst a sandstorm that limited visibility, heavy fighting ensued and the garrison surrendered at around 2:00pm; 250 Italians were killed, while 1,300 were taken as prisoners of war. A total of 17 Australians were killed and 77 were wounded, with the majority of these being men from the 2/9th Battalion. Afterwards, the battalion was sent to Ikingi Maryut and the following month the 2/9th was transported to Tobruk by road and sea to reinforce the garrison there as German forces surrounded the strategic port in an effort to capture it. The 2/9th would remain <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> the next five months as Tobruk fell under siege.|$|E
25|$|Lively {{tries to}} {{drive a wedge between}} Kenehan and the miners by convincing a young widow, Bridey Mae Tolliver, to falsely accuse Kenehan of sexual assault, and he plants a letter which makes Kenehan appear to be the infiltrator. Danny Radnor overhears Hickey and Griggs talking about the scheme but is caught and held by the two men. The agents intend to keep a watchful eye on Danny, but become drunk and are not paying {{attention}} that night when Danny, while preaching at the Freewill church, relates a parable about Joseph that convinces the miners that they have been deceived by a false story. One of the miners hurries to the camp to find Few Clothes (James Earl Jones), who had drawn the short straw for who would kill Kenehan for his assumed treachery. Few Clothes tells Kenehan he is there to guard him when he comments on the gun the black miner has. Asked whether he knows how to use it, Few Clothes says yes, {{that he was in the}} Spanish–American War of 1898. Kenehan tells him that he was in Fort Leavenworth Military Penitentiary in 1917, and saw Mennonites imprisoned for refusing to bear arms passively resist having their beards shaved and rip the buttons off their prison clothes, since all these were against their religion. They were punished by being handcuffed to cell bars for eight hours per day, until the cuffs had cut into their wrists and caused gangrene. Despite it all, they ripped off re-sewn buttons with their teeth, not one giving up. Kenehan says he never saw braver men, and ironically they were <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> refusing to fight. This tale of bravery and injustice leaves Few Clothes conflicted and unsure about his mission to execute Kenehan. Another miner arrives and tells Few Clothes the truth and Kenehan's execution is called off just in time. Meanwhile, Sephus has made his way back to town and informed the others of Lively's betrayal, furiously burning down his restaurant. Lively flees town by swimming across the Tug Fork River.|$|E
25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: You {{had a lot of}} Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>for?</b> What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E

[...] Its instrumentation consists of guitar, piano, violins, and synthesized drums. It has a slow tempo of 72 beats per minute, with Jackson's vocals ranging from G3 to C5. It contains a brief sample from B. T. Express' 1976 version of The Carpenters' 1970 song [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You", written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Jackson described the song as having a [...] "throwback" [...] feel, considered a departure from her other works. Michael Paletta of Billboard described its [...] "opening drum downbeat" [...] accompanied by [...] "swirling string crescendos," [...] considered [...] "the perfect backdrop for Jackson's breathy vocals." [...] It was analyzed to have a [...] "chimes-studded texture" [...] and strings backed by drums, also having [...] "a triangle thrown <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> good measure." [...] Its lyrics focus on longing for an estranged lover and feeling emotionally distraught when apart. Jackson pleads for their affection during its chorus, telling them to [...] "Have your way with me." [...] Tareck Ghoneim of Contactmusic.com stated [...] "The lyrics are simple. She just wants her man and she’s telling it straight," [...] while Plugged In observed it to convey Jackson's [...] "insatiable" [...] desire for intimacy in a [...] "vulnerable and lovesick" [...] manner.|$|E

Kerrie Mills of PopMatters rated the first three series 9/10, opining that the show [...] "does also provide evidence, edgewise between the falling bodily fluids, of a sharp comic intelligence... in fact, it might just {{be one of the}} most successful original comedy shows to appear in years." [...] Stephen Kelly of The Guardian argued that the fourth series had definitively transcended its roots to become not just [...] "the best show on children's television—it's one of the smartest comedies on TV", performed by an [...] "astonishing cast... so superb that even special guest stars such as Chris Addison can look slightly out of their depth." [...] In an article discussing the League of Gentlemen troupe's appearance in the same series, the Radio Times Gareth McLean agreed that [...] "despite nominally being a children's programme, Horrible Histories is one of the best sketch comedies on TV", adding that [...] "ultimately, comedy performers relish [...] madcap, sometimes deliciously silly exuberance, which, thanks to the show's razorsharp writing, educates as well as entertains." [...] Graeme Virtue of The Scotsman called the League's reunion a [...] "coup" [...] for the series: [...] "While Gatiss's American accent was pretty duff, the bickering spark between the three Gentlemen remained." ...|$|E
