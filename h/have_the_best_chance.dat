Seeing {{the effects of}} alcohol, {{he believed that the}} state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> of acting according to their consciences.

25|$|In Darwin's {{theory of}} natural selection, more organisms are {{produced}} than can survive. Some have variations that {{give them a}} competitive advantage, and they <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> of surviving and procreating. The main element lacking in the theory was any mechanism that would allow organisms to pass on these favorable variations. Lacking such a mechanism, {{the theory of evolution}} faced competition from theories such as neo-Lamarckism, in which the environment acted directly on organisms, changing their structures. Darwin did not know that the monk Gregor Mendel was already working on experiments that would explain inheritance in terms of units of heredity that we now call genes.|$|E

25|$|Bachelor {{groups are}} made up of {{adolescent}} and bucks not holding territory. Any new members must perform intimidation displays to enter the group. However, bachelor groups tend to be very loose and members can leave whenever they want. The larger, older males with thick horns <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> of establishing a territory. Conflicts between adult males are usually solved with intimidation displays. The bucks circle each other and swing their necks from side to side, displaying their neck power. Neck strength is important in an actual fight and the male that cannot keep up yields.

Dominant bucks can simply run off subordinates rather than having to display to them.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Senna {{tested for}} Formula One teams Williams, McLaren, Brabham, and Toleman. Peter Warr of Lotus, Ron Dennis of McLaren, and Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and {{presented}} long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on. During his test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) Donington Park circuit, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker {{than the other}} drivers, including Williams's reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg. Neither Williams nor McLaren had a vacancy for the 1984 season. Both Williams boss Frank Williams and McLaren boss Ron Dennis noted that Senna insisted that he got to run their cars before anyone else (other than their regular drivers such as Rosberg) {{so that he would}} <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> of a good showing by having a fresh car.|$|E
25|$|The Winter Line {{proved a}} major {{obstacle}} to the Allies {{at the end of}} 1943, halting the Fifth Army's advance on the western side of Italy. Although the Gustav Line was penetrated on the Eighth Army's Adriatic front, and Ortona captured, blizzards, drifting snow and zero visibility at the end of December caused the advance to grind to a halt. The Allies' focus then turned to the western front, where an attack through the Liri valley was considered to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> of a breakthrough towards the Italian capital. Landings at Anzio during Operation Shingle, advocated by the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, behind the line were intended to destabilise the German Gustav line defences, but the early thrust inland to cut off the German defences did not occur, thanks to the indecisiveness of the American commander (Major General John P. Lucas), and the Anzio forces became bottled up in their beachhead. Lucas was replaced by Major General Lucian Truscott.|$|E

500|$|City {{officials}} {{expressed a}} desire to have SR78 included in the Interstate Highway System in 1985, but this was determined unlikely to succeed by state senator William Craven. In September, the state government agreed to pay $7.5million (about $ in [...] dollars) for the widening between Oceanside and Escondido, but the county and the five cities the route ran through would {{have to pay for the}} rest of the cost. The San Diego County Board of Supervisors endorsed the project that month, in order to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> at getting federal funding. A spike in accidents during that year led to Representative Ron Packard proposing a way to split the costs between the governments; there were 387 accidents from January to August 1985, a sharp increase from 234 in 1984. In recognition for his work obtaining funding, SR78 between Oceanside and Escondido was named the Ronald Packard Parkway in 2000.|$|E

2500|$|A grassed {{waterway}} reduces {{soil erosion}} and captures most nutrients and pesticides {{that would normally}} wash out of crop fields and into major waters. These waterways help to carry surface water at a non-erosive velocity to an area where {{it will have a}} stable outlet. [...] Outlets must be adequate enough to allow water to drain without ponding or flooding the area being protected, while also preventing erosion of the water into the outlet which can be accomplished through the use of riprap. [...] A limitation is during large runoff events, when soil is saturated, grassed waterways will have a very concentrated flow of water making them not as effective during high rainfalls. Grassed waterways require very little maintenance once they are introduced with major upkeep being mowing of the grass and reseeding. Farm machinery and cattle can cross these waterways but it may be hazardous during wet periods. One of the major disadvantages of waterways are actually getting them established. A late summer or early fall seeding when rainfall is minimal is recommended to allow the seed to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> at establishing a root system.|$|E
