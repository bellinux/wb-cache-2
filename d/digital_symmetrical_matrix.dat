Such problem can be formulated as a polynomial minimization via the least squares method. This paper presents a canonical duality theory for solving this challenging problem. It is shown that the nonconvex minimization problem can be reformulated as a concave maximization dual problem over a convex set in a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>matrix</b> space, and hence can be solved efficiently by combining a general (linear or quadratic) perturbation technique with existing optimization techniques. Applications are illustrated by solving some relatively large-scale problems.

40|$|The method given {{below for}} the {{improvement}} of an approximate set of latent roots and modal columns of a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>matrix</b> is essentially the same as Jahn's second method described in (1), but the proof is here set out entirely in matrix notation. The present paper is, in fact, the counterpart of the notes by Collar (2) relating to Jahn's first method. 1. I F M is a modal <b>matrix</b> of a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>matrix</b> A, both M'AM and M'M are diagonals. Thus, if m is an approximation to M, m'Am and m'm will be approximately diagonal, and we can make use of these products to obtain a better approximation to M, as follows, Let m'Am = Ax+o and m'm = Aj+ 6, where Ax and A 2 are the diagonals, and a and 6 the non-diagonal parts, of these matrices. Further, let M = m(I-t-fi). By suitable post-multiplication by a diagonal matrix we can always ensure that I+n has unit diagonal elements. Since such post-multiplication of M leaves it still a modal matrix of A, we can suppose without loss of generality that y. has no diagonal elements. Then (/+/i') (A 1 +o) (7 +^) and (I+ft') At+ b) (I+(i) are diagonals. Expanding these products, and neglecting second- and third-order terms, we see that A 1 -(fi'A 1 -A 1 (x-j-a) and A,+(^i'As+A,y. -b) must be diagonal matrices. But the items in the brackets have no diagonal terms, and so = 0, whence AlfiAt—Aj/iAj = 6 AX—aAj. (1) If the term in the rth row and the «th column of p is (i^, the corresponding term in (A 1 fiAt—AtfjA 1) is (A^A^—A^A^/i,,, where the A^s and A,'s are respectively the elements of Aj and A,. Hence /* „ is derived from the corresponding term in (6 Aj—oA,) by dividing by (A^Aj^—A^A^).

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{shows the}} {{application}} of the multidimensional scaling to discover the intrinsic dimensionality of the substitution matrices. These matrices are used in Bioinformatics to compare amino acids in the alignment procedures. However, the methodology can be used in other applications to discover the intrinsic dimensionality of a wide class of <b>symmetrical</b> <b>matrices.</b> The discovery of the intrinsic dimensionality of substitutions matrices is a data processing problem with applications in chemical evolution. The problem is related with the number of relevant physical, chemical and structural characteristic involved in these matrices. Many studies have dealt with the identification of relevant characteristic sets for these matrices, but few have concerned with establishing an upper bound of their cardinality. The methodology of multidimensional scaling is used to map the substitution matrix information in a virtual low dimensional space. The relationship between the quality of this process and the dimensionality of the mapping provides clues about the number of characteristics which better represents the matrix. To avoid the local minima problem, a genetic algorithm is used to minimize the objective function of the multidimensional scaling procedure. The main conclusion is that the number of effective characteristics involved in substitution matrices is small. ...|$|R
