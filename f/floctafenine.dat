50|$|<b>Floctafenine</b> is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID).|$|E
50|$|<b>Floctafenine</b> and Glafenine are {{a pair of}} {{fenamate}} NSAIDs whose synthesis rely on the Gould-Jacobs reaction.|$|E
50|$|The scheme {{involves}} {{first the}} conversion of ortho-trifluoromethyl aniline (1) to a quinolol. The compound is thus condensed with EMME (Ethoxy Methylene Malonic Diethyl Ester) and cyclized thermally (2). That intermediate is then saponified; the resulting acid is decarboxylated and finally converted to the 4-chloroquinoline (3) by reaction with phosphorus oxychloride. The displacement of chlorine with methyl anthranilate (4) then affords the coupled intermediate (5). An ester interchange of that product with glycerol leads to the glyceryl ester. There is thus obtained the NSAID <b>floctafenine.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Floctafenine</b> 200 mg {{four times}} a day was {{compared}} with placebo in 30 out-patients with osteo-arthrosis in a double-blind controlled study. There was a significant patient preference for, and a greater relief of pain with, <b>floctafenine.</b> Pain on walking and joint stiffness after sitting were significantly less on <b>floctafenine.</b> There were no differences in side-effects between <b>floctafenine</b> and placebo. OF a series of synthetic compounds of the hydroxyquinoline group, several were found to possess analgesic properties during pharmacological screening. <b>Floctafenine</b> seemed to be the best (Allais et al., 1973). Its chemical name is 2, 3 -dihydroxypropyl N-(S-trifluoromethyl- 4 -quinolyl) anthranelate, and its chemical structure is shown below. H-N C- 0 —CH 2 —CHOH—CH 20...|$|E
40|$|A {{double-blind}} placebo-controlled {{trial was}} carried out in 30 out-patients with osteoarthritis of knee and hip. The therapeutic value of <b>floctafenine</b> 1. 2 g daily, a new oral non-narcotic analgesic agent, was compared with that of enteric-coated acetylsalicylic acid (ACSA) (Rougier Inc. —enteric-coated acetylsalicylic acid, tablets of 650 mg) 2. 6 g daily. Every patient successively received the three medications for six weeks according to a Latin-square design. An objective index of improvement of hips and knees was developed and applied to this study. In both objective and subjective assessments of the disease, <b>floctafenine</b> was found to be approximately equivalent to or superior to ACSA and superior to placebo. Both drugs were clinically well tolerated. A consistant but slight decrease in both haemoglobin and red-blood-cell count under <b>floctafenine</b> and ASA was found to be statistically but not clinically significant. <b>FLOCTAFENINE</b> is a drug that has been shown to possess analgesic properties in animals (Pottier et al., 1975) and in man (Morris and Henderson, 1978). In clinical trials, <b>floctafenine</b> has been confirmed effective in rheumatoid arthritis and superior to placebo (Huskisson and Scott, 1977; Hossain et al, 1977). In short-term trials of two weeks and less, Rhind et al. (1978) have demonstrated that <b>floctafenine</b> and ibuprofen bot...|$|E
30|$|Polarization curves {{reveal the}} <b>Floctafenine</b> is a mixed-type inhibitor.|$|E
40|$|In a double-blind, single-dose, {{multiple}} cross-over study, <b>floctafenine</b> (200 mg) {{was shown}} to be an active analgesic and similar in potency to aspirin (600 mg). A graphic rating scale {{was used to measure}} pain relief. The use of such a scale without cut-off points at each end led to problems in the distribution of results. <b>FLOCTAFENINE</b> is a hydroxyquinoline derivative which is active in experimental models of pain and inflammation; it has relatively less tendency to cause gastric ulceration in rats than aspirin and indomethacin (Peterfalvi et al, 1975). Studies with single doses in post-operative pain have shown that <b>floctafenine</b> (200 mg) was superior to placebo (Stenport, 1975) and dextropropoxyphene (130 mg) (Lipton et al., 1975 a), and comparable in potency to aspirin (600 mg) (Lipton et al, 15 a; Stenport, 1975), dihydrocodeine (60 mg) (Lipton et al., 19756) oral pentazocine (50 mg) (Lipton et al., 1975 c), and ibuprofen (200 mg) (Walker and Kay, 1976). Two double-blind cross-over studies have shown that <b>floctafenine</b> given for one week was superior to placebo—Vickers and Akbar (1975) using 600 - 1200 mg <b>floctafenine</b> daily in various chronic painful conditions and Burke et al. (1976) using 800 mg daily in osteoarthritis...|$|E
30|$|The maximum %IE of <b>Floctafenine</b> for the zinc {{metal in}} acidic media is 85.8  %.|$|E
30|$|To {{gain more}} {{information}} about mode of adsorption of <b>Floctafenine</b> on zinc surface in 0.1  M HCl at different temperature, {{attempts were made to}} fit experimental data with several adsorption isotherms like Temkin, Langmuir and Freundlich.|$|E
30|$|Quantum {{chemical}} calculations for <b>Floctafenine</b> {{were carried}} out in gas phase using parametric method 3 (PM 3). The Polak–Rieberre algorithm which is fast and accurate {{has been used for}} computation. The energy parameters in the form of root mean square gradient were kept at 0.05  kcal− 1  A mol and convergence limit at 0.05. These calculations were performed using Hyperchem 7.5 package program (Hypercube Inc., Florida, 2003).|$|E
30|$|Corrosion {{inhibition}} of <b>Floctafenine</b> for zinc in 0.1  M HCl solution was studied using empirical and theoretical methods. Quantum {{studies have been}} utilized for studying the interaction between metal and inhibitor. Empirical methods like potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were adopted to verify the inhibition efficiency of the inhibitor. Adsorption of the inhibitor follows the Langmuir isotherm. Thermodynamic values show the physical adsorption mechanism of the inhibitor. Activation and thermodynamic parameters explain the corrosion mechanism. The effect of temperature on the corrosion behavior of zinc in the given temperature range 303 – 333  K was studied and discussed.|$|E
30|$|The {{majority}} of the inhibitor used to control the corrosion of zinc {{was considered to be}} toxic, and solubility of inhibitor is a major problem in the corrosive medium. So the focus is to use non-toxic medicinal compound to inhibit the corrosion of zinc. Corrosion of Zinc was inhibited using several inhibitor-like guaifenesin [23], ketosulfone [24], <b>floctafenine</b> [25], atenolol [26], N-arylpyrroles [27], anisidines [28], erythromycin [29], and hexamine [2]. The use of pharmaceutical compounds offers interesting possibilities for corrosion inhibition due to the presence of heteroatoms like nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen in their structure and is of particular interest because of their safe use, high solubility in water and high molecular size [30].|$|E
30|$|<b>Floctafenine</b> is a {{class of}} non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug used {{for the treatment of}} inflammatory disorders. The presence of electron-rich N, O, F atoms and π-bonds in its structure might be in favor of its adsorption on the metal surface which gives a scope for its study as a potential corrosion inhibitor. Not only the structure but also the eco-friendly nature is the main criterion to select the potential inhibitor. The significance of the present work is to develop new inhibitor for zinc corrosion. For this purpose corrosion of zinc has been investigated using various chemical and electrochemical techniques. A number of {{attempts have been made to}} understand different aspects of corrosion, such as mechanism of corrosion, kinetics of corrosion, thermodynamics of corrosion, etc.|$|E
30|$|Zinc {{is widely}} used in the industry, {{especially}} for galvanizing process and it is employed as a galvanizing material for steel piping, fencing, nails, electronic goods and many types of machinery. It is also used as bars, plates, slabs to protect ship hulls, pipelines and other structural materials. Zinc is a very active metal and it gives white rust {{in the presence of}} moisture and air [1, 2, 3, 4]. Corrosion is a big challenge and many corrosion control methods have been adopted all over the world. Among these methods, using corrosion inhibitors is a very prominent method [5, 6]. Various types of chemical inhibitors—organic and inorganic compounds, pharmaceuticals drugs, dyes and even plant extracts are developed to control corrosion. Few years back, corrosion inhibition of zinc could be achieved by the chromate treatment. The effluents obtained from this treatment result in more adverse effect on the environment [7, 8, 9]. Therefore, the environment-friendly corrosion inhibitors have been discovered [10, 11, 12, 13]. In the present study, investigator studied the corrosion inhibition effect of environment-friendly corrosion inhibitor <b>Floctafenine</b> on zinc in 0.1  M HCl solution.|$|E
