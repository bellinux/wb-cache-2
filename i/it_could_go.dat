5|$|The {{trial began}} in January 2005; the judge, Mr Justice Mackay, warned that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> {{on for a}} year. On 14 July, the judge {{instructed}} the jury to acquit all defendants on charges of manslaughter. A few days later, Balfour Beatty changed its plea to guilty on {{the health and safety}} charges and, on 6 September, Network Rail was found guilty of breaching health and safety law. Network Rail were fined £3.5 million while Balfour Beatty were fined £10 million. All of the manslaughter charges against the executives were dismissed by the judge.|$|E

25|$|Crawford died in 1857 {{before the}} {{full-size}} plaster model left his studio. The model, packed into six crates, was shipped from Italy {{in a small}} sailing vessel {{in the spring of}} 1858. During the voyage, the ship began to leak and stopped in Gibraltar for repairs. After leaving Gibraltar, the ship began leaking again to the point that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> no farther than Bermuda, where the model was stored until other transportation could be arranged. Half of the crates finally arrived in New York City in December, but all sections were not in Washington, D.C. until late March 1859.|$|E

25|$|Local ambiguities persist {{only for}} {{a short amount of}} time as an {{utterance}} is heard or written and are resolved during the course of the utterance so the complete utterance has only one interpretation. Examples include sentences like The critic wrote the book was enlightening, which is ambiguous when The critic wrote the book has been encountered, but was enlightening remains to be processed. Then, the sentence could end, stating that the critic is the author of the book, or <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on to clarify that the critic wrote something about a book. The ambiguity ends at was enlightening, which determines that the second alternative is correct.|$|E
25|$|Psychosurgery and the {{surgical}} implantation of hormones to reduce male sexual drive {{were classified as}} irreversible treatments {{that could only be}} carried out on consenting patients (section 57 of part IV of the Act); ECT was classified as a slightly less serious treatment that could be given to non-consenting patients if certain procedures were followed (section 58). The patient had to be detained (if they were not already detained), then a psychiatrist from the Mental Health Act Commission had to authorise treatment. If the treating psychiatrist decided there was an urgent need for ECT <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> ahead without authorisation from a Mental Health Act Commission psychiatrist (section 62).|$|E
25|$|If Wilson's {{record as}} prime {{minister}} was soon felt to {{have been one of}} failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callahan's term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular modus vivendi with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that Mrs. Thatcher resoundingly defeated it in 1979.|$|E

500|$|On September 8, 1974, Ford issued , {{which gave}} Nixon {{a full and}} {{unconditional}} pardon for any crimes he might have committed against the United States while President. In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon {{was in the best}} interests of the country, and that the Nixon family's situation [...] "is a tragedy in which we all have played a part. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it.

500|$|The spec {{script was}} chosen as the crew {{believed}} <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> into production quickly. After purchasing it, the production of this episode began a week later. Groener guest starred as Elbrun, the first male Betazoid seen on the show. Michael Cavanaugh appeared as Captain Robert DeSoto, a character that was mentioned in [...] "Encounter at Farpoint" [...] and later in the franchise. The design of Gomtuu was based on an element from The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, while the chair creation special effect was made using reverse motion. [...] "Tin Man" [...] received Nielsen ratings of 10.2 percent. Critical reception has been mixed; while it has been listed in the top 70 of the best episodes of the franchise, other reviewers have called the plot predicable and trite.|$|E

500|$|This airship that {{lifted a}} rider {{consisted}} of a cigar-shaped hydrogen balloon that looked like an inverted boat wrapped in netting. It had a velocipede seat and steering bar for a rider. A cloth screw propeller was operated by the rider through a cog wheel and ratchet attachment operated by the rider pedaling. He first called the hybrid invention an [...] "air bicycle", that navigated through the air like driving a bicycle. He later named it a [...] "gas kite", an [...] "aerial velocipede", an [...] "aerial bicycle", [...] and ultimately a [...] "sky-cycle." [...] The propeller acted like a screw of a boat and propelled the airship forward and up with the backward air current generated. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to a thousand feet, be maneuvered, and brought back at will by the rider. Myers' wife was an expert in sky-cycling.|$|E
500|$|In {{the post-war}} period Poulenc crossed swords with composers {{of the younger}} {{generation}} who rejected Stravinsky's recent work and insisted that only the precepts of the Second Viennese School were valid. Poulenc defended Stravinsky and expressed incredulity that [...] "in 1945 we are speaking as if the aesthetic of twelve tones is the only possible salvation for contemporary music". His view that Berg had taken serialism as far as <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> and that Schoenberg's music was now [...] "desert, stone soup, ersatz music, or poetic vitamins" [...] earned him the enmity of composers such as Pierre Boulez. Those disagreeing with Poulenc attempted to paint him as a relic of the pre-war era, frivolous and unprogressive. This led him to focus on his more serious works, and to try to persuade the French public to listen to them. In the US and Britain, with their strong choral traditions, his religious music was frequently performed, but performances in France were much rarer, so that the public and the critics were often unaware of his serious compositions.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} that Congress would have to approve the NPVIC before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> into effect. Article I, Section 10 of the US Constitution states that: [...] "No State shall, without the Consent of Congress ... enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power." [...] However, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in Virginia v. Tennessee, , and in several more recent cases, that such consent is not necessary except where a compact encroaches on federal supremacy. Every Vote Equal argues that the compact could never encroach upon federal power since the Constitution explicitly gives the power of casting electoral votes to the states, not the federal government. Derek Muller argues that the NPVIC would nonetheless affect the federal system {{in such a way}} that it would require Congressional approval, while Ian Drake argues that Congress is actually prohibited under the Constitution from granting approval to the NPVIC. NPVIC supporters dispute this conclusion and state they plan to seek congressional approval if the compact is approved by a sufficient number of states.|$|E

I was way too young and now I'm already too old".|$|R

2500|$|French {{immigrants}} to the United States (of Huguenot or French Canadian background) often accommodated those unfamiliar with French pronunciations and spellings by altering their surnames in either of two ways: spellings were changed to fit the traditional pronunciation (Pariseau became Parizo, Boucher became Bushey, Mailloux became Mayhew), or pronunciations were changed to fit the spelling (Benoît, pronounced , became [...] ) Benedict. In some cases, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> either way (Gagné, pronounced , became [...] or Gonyea), or something only slightly similar; (Bourassa became Bersaw).|$|E
