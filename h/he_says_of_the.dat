He spoke {{about it on the}} Late Show with David Letterman after coming out of rehab and continued {{to do so in the}} years following. [...] "There was an energy that was created," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time when he was addicted, [...] "a character that was created, that no doubt benefited me. And then there was a stage where it all began to crumble around me." ...|$|E
500|$|Gunn was {{influenced}} in his management philosophy by former Norwich manager Mike Walker. Himself a former goalkeeper, Walker believed—contrary to popular opinion—that goalkeepers can make good managers because their excellent {{view of the}} game enables them to develop a good tactical awareness. Gunn's short time at Norwich remains his only experience of professional football management. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time spent as manager that his only regret is that [...] "there must be a generation of fans who only know me as the manager who lost 7-1 against Colchester… My own memories are different." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Graham-Dixon asserts all Dutch Golden Age landscapists {{could not}} help but search {{everywhere}} for meaning. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windmill in The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede that it symbolises [...] "the sheer hard work needed to keep Holland above water and to safeguard the future of the nation's children". The symmetries in the landscapes are [...] "reminders to fellow citizens always to remain on the straight and narrow". Slive is more reluctant to read too much into the work, but does put The Windmill in its contemporary religious context of man's dependence on the [...] "spirit of the Lord for life". With regards to interpreting Ruisdael's Scandinavian paintings, he says [...] "My own view is that it strains credulity to the breaking point to propose that he himself conceived of all his depictions of waterfalls, torrents and rushing streams and dead trees as visual sermons on the themes of transcience and vanitas".|$|E

2500|$|He {{is highly}} {{critical}} of the policies of Israel towards the Palestinians and its Arab neighbors. His book The Fateful Triangle {{is considered one of the}} premier texts on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict among those who oppose Israel's policies in regard to the Palestinians as well as American support for the state of Israel. He has also accused Israel of [...] "guiding state terrorism" [...] for selling weapons to apartheid South Africa and Latin American countries that he characterizes as U.S. puppet states, e.g. Guatemala in the 1980s, as well as U.S.-backed paramilitaries (or, according to Chomsky, terrorists) such as the Nicaraguan Contras. (What Uncle Sam Really Wants, Chapter 2.4) Chomsky characterizes Israel as a [...] "mercenary state", [...] "an Israeli Sparta", and a militarized dependency within a U.S. system of hegemony. He has also fiercely criticized sectors of the American Jewish community for their role in obtaining U.S. support, stating that [...] "they should more properly be called 'supporters of the moral degeneration and ultimate destruction of Israel'" [...] (Fateful Triangle, p.4). <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Anti-Defamation League (ADL): ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{shooting}} of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African American boy (June 25, 2002 – November 23, 2014), occurred on November 22, 2014, in Cleveland, Ohio. Two police officers, 26-year-old Timothy Loehmann and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, responded {{after receiving a}} police dispatch call of a black male that [...] "keeps pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people". A caller reported that a male was pointing [...] "a pistol" [...] at random people in the Cudell Recreation Center. At {{the beginning of the}} call and again in the middle <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pistol [...] "it's probably fake". [...] Toward the end of the two-minute call, the caller stated [...] "he is probably a juvenile". However, this information was not relayed to Loehmann or Garmback on the initial dispatch. The officers reported that upon their arrival, they both continuously yelled [...] "show me your hands" [...] through the open patrol car window. [...] Loehmann further claimed that instead of showing his hands, it appeared as if Rice was trying to draw the replica: [...] "I knew it was a gun and I knew it was coming out". In response, the officer shot twice, hitting Rice once in the torso. He died on the following day.|$|E

6000|$|Lowell {{suggests}} in this dainty symbolical lyric {{his conception}} of the poet's inspiration. Hebe was cup-bearer to the gods of Olympus, in Greek mythology, and poured for them their nectar. She was also the goddess of eternal youth. By {{an extension of the}} symbolism she becomes goddess of the eternal joyousness of the poetic gift. The [...] "influence fleet" [...] is the divine afflatus that fills the creative mind of the poet. But Pegasus cannot be made to work in harness at will.

6000|$|Other {{questions}} about practices enjoined in the Articles arose.
