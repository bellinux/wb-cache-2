40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the large {{toughness}} variability observed between metallic glasses (MGs), we examine the origin of fracture toughness through bending experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for two binary MGs: Pd_(82) Si_(18) and Cu_(46) Zr_(54). The bending experiments show that Pd_(82) Si_(18) is considerably tougher than Cu_(46) Zr_(54), and the <b>higher</b> <b>toughness</b> of Pd_(82) Si_(18) is attributed to an ability to deform plastically {{in the absence of}} crack nucleation through cavitation. The MD simulations study the initial stages of cavitation in both materials and extract the critical factors controlling cavitation. We find that for the tougher Pd_(82) Si_(18), cavitation is governed by chemical inhomogeneity in addition to topological structures. In contrast, no such chemical correlations are observed in the more brittle Cu_(46) Zr_(54), where topological low coordination number polyhedra are still observed around the critical cavity. As such, chemical inhomogeneity leads to more difficult cavitation initiation in Pd_(82) Si_(18) than in Cu_(46) Zr_(54), leading to a <b>higher</b> <b>toughness.</b> The absence of chemical separation during cavitation initiation in Cu_(46) Zr_(54) decreases the energy barrier for a cavitation event, leading to lower toughness...|$|R

The DM-I weld which is the hardest has the lowest toughness among the three welds, and obviously lower than that of HAZ and the base metal. However, the <b>highest</b> <b>toughness</b> appears at the incompletely-quenched zone where the formation of two phases, ferrite + martensite, increases the resistance to crack propagation.

50|$|To {{construct}} an item with structural integrity, an engineer must first consider a material’s mechanical properties, such as toughness, strength, weight, hardness, and elasticity, and then determine {{the size and}} shape necessary for the material to withstand the desired load for a long life. Since members can neither break nor bend excessively, they must be both stiff and tough.  A very stiff material may resist bending, but unless it is sufficiently tough, it may have to be very large to support a load without breaking.  On the other hand, a highly elastic material will bend under a load even if its <b>high</b> <b>toughness</b> prevents fracture.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{the first}} {{parameter}} for {{the determination of}} fracture toughness in the elasto-plastic region was the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) or [...] "opening {{at the apex of}} the crack" [...] indicated.

He noted that, before the fracture happened, the walls of the crack were leaving and that the crack tip, after fracture, ranged from acute to rounded off due to plastic deformation.

50|$|At higher temperatures, {{the yield}} {{strength}} decreases, {{and leads to}} the formation of the plastic zone. Cleavage is likely to initiate at the elastic-plastic zone boundary, and then link back to the main crack tip. This is usually a mixture of cleavages of grains, and ductile fracture of grains known as fibrous linkages. The percentage of fibrous linkages increase as temperature increases until the linkup is entirely fibrous linkages. In this state, even though yield strength is lower, the presence of ductile fracture and a higher crack tip radius of curvature results in a <b>higher</b> <b>toughness.</b>|$|R

50|$|CoCrFeMnNi {{has been}} found to have {{exceptional}} low-temperature mechanical properties and high fracture toughness, with both ductility and yield strength increasing as the test temperature was reduced from room temperature to 77 K.

As such, it may have applications as a structural material in low-temperature applications or, because of its <b>high</b> <b>toughness,</b> as an energy-absorbing material. However, later research showed that lower-entropy alloys with fewer elements or non-equiatomic compositions may have higher strength or higher toughness.

They make use of anti-grav skimmer vehicles to transport their units around the tabletop without behind hindered by intervening terrain, and these vehicles are some of the fastest of their class in the game. Dark Eldar units typically have much higher initiative statistics than the majority of other Warhammer 40,000 armies, allowing them to attack first in the close-combat phases of the game. They also make extensive use of poisoned weapons, a game mechanic which allows the wielder to damage models with <b>high</b> <b>toughness</b> characteristics just as easily as they would a much weaker opponent.|$|E
