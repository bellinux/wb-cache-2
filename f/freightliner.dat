5|$|After World War II, Nordmann joined Mercedes-Benz in 1950, {{initially}} {{working in}} sales. He later became {{head of the}} sales department and, in 1968, head of worldwide services. In January 1971 he was appointed president of Mercedes-Benz in North America and Canada, retiring in January 1981. Despite his retirement, he continued {{to hold a position}} as company director. During his tenure with Mercedes, Nordmann was an early mentor of Jürgen Schrempp, who later became {{the chief executive officer of}} Daimler AG. Under Nordmann's leadership, Mercedes sales in the United States increased from 30,000 cars in 1970 to 43,600 cars in 1972, a 0.4% U.S. market share. To further expand the market presence in North America, Mercedes in 1976 opened a facility in Jacksonville, Florida. In 1977 Daimler bought the Euclid Company of Ohio and <b>Freightliner</b> Trucks in 1981.|$|E

5|$|The {{goods service}} at {{individual}} stations was also withdrawn after Beeching's report. A <b>freightliner</b> depot opened at Aberdeen in 1966, allowing the Peterhead line to close completely on 7 September 1970. In 1969–70 {{the line between}} Aberdeen and Keith was singled, with passing loops, the line to Fraserburgh closing completely in 1979 and that from Keith to Dufftown in 1985. In the 1969 timetable there were early morning trains between Aberdeen and Inverurie, and five services a day between Aberdeen to Inverness, supplemented by two Aberdeen to Elgin services that by the late 1970s were running through to Inverness. The cross-country DMUs were replaced in 1980 by diesel locomotives hauling Mark I compartment coaches, later Mark II open saloons. These were similarly replaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s by newer DMUs, first the Class 156 Super Sprinter and then Class 158 Express and Class 170 units.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{then returns}} to the trailer park setting, where Azalea rides a lowrider bicycle through the area. She wears a {{perforated}} yellow visor, black brassiere, spiked yellow Louboutins and ethnic slim-fit pants. The video then enters a new scene where Azalea arrives at a dive bar and switches a jukebox on. At the bar, Azalea's two friends from the <b>Freightliner</b> Truck scene are seated at a table, and a long-haired man wearing dark sunglasses awaits her on {{a chair in the}} centre of building. Azalea, dressed in a palm tree bikini and yellow neon shorts, performs a lap dance for the man. She then steals his car keys and runs off with her friends, who drive the man's convertible out into the desert. Azalea is seen standing in the car, waving a thin piece of material in the wind. They drive through a day and night period before arriving in Hollywood in the morning. Azalea's friends then drop her off at a sidewalk, where the video ends with her walking in the city. She wears dark sunglasses, striped black-and-white shorts and a custom-made dalmatian-print blazer in the final scene.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, Ford's heavy trucks {{division}} (Classes 7 and 8) {{was sold}} in 1997 to <b>Freightliner</b> Trucks, which rebranded the lineup as Sterling. <b>Freightliner</b> {{is in the process}} of discontinuing this line.|$|E

40|$|A two part {{research}} project which {{culminated in a}} series of artists'interventions realised at <b>Freightliners</b> Farm near Caladonian Road over 2 days in June. Intended to pragmatically investigate ‘place-based’ practices with a view to an ongoing exchange, the exploratory week scoped the viability of <b>Freightliners,</b> as a partner for future projects with CSM Fine Art as well as a potential site for ongoing artists’ residencies. The artists used the farm as a studio over a week in April with the interest in allowing the artists processes of experimentation, play, testing to be encountered by visitors and trainees at the farm. Formalized reflection on strands of practice deployed in this project are intended to contribute to ongoing discussion about how artists can find ways of working in response to locality...|$|R
25|$|<b>Freightliner</b> {{inherited}} a large fleet of 30 Class 86/6 freight-dedicated locomotives, {{most of which}} had previously been operated by Railfreight Distribution, but some came from Rail Express Systems. The fleet therefore consisted of locomotives in many different obsolete liveries, so from 1995, <b>Freightliner</b> started to apply its newly introduced livery. This {{was based on the}} previous Trainload two-tone grey livery, with the addition of Freightliner's red triangle logo.|$|E
25|$|The Dudley {{railway station}} {{located in the}} town centre was closed under the Beeching Axe in 1964. It opened in 1860 on the {{junction}} between the South Staffordshire and the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton lines, and in its heyday was a hub of services east to Birmingham (via a junction at Great Bridge), Walsall and Lichfield; north to Wolverhampton, Tipton and Coseley; and south-west to Stourbridge, {{as well as a}} line that served the small communities on the way to Old Hill and Halesowen. The site was later used as a <b>Freightliner</b> terminal by <b>Freightliner</b> UK, until an unpopular closure on 26 September 1989.|$|E
25|$|Two other locomotives, nos. 86101/102, {{formerly}} used by Virgin Trains, {{were also}} briefly hired by <b>Freightliner</b> in 2001/2002. Neither of these locomotives were repainted, {{and they both}} retained obsolete InterCity livery. Due to their non-standard nature, both locomotives had been withdrawn by early 2002.|$|E
50|$|<b>Freightliners</b> Farm {{was founded}} on former wasteland behind King's Cross station in 1973. The name was adopted because {{originally}} the animals were housed in railway goods vans. The Farm moved to its present site in 1978 and purpose-built farm buildings were erected in 1988. The site is half a hectare.|$|R
50|$|INKAS's first {{business}} unit was INKAS Security Services. With head offices in Toronto, Ontario, INKAS Security Services {{was created in}} 1995 for the provisioning of armed messenger services. Personnel are armed with weapons and armed vehicles which vary between Dodge Sprinters, Ford Econoline 350s, <b>Freightliners,</b> Ford F-150’s and armored Jeep Cherokees.|$|R
25|$|The Tesla Semi is an all-electric Class 8 {{semi-trailer}} truck first {{mentioned in}} the 2016 Master plan. According to Tesla they have a working prototype that uses ‘a bunch' of Model 3 electric motors. Tesla's Vice President of Vehicle Programs, Jerome Guillen leads the truck program. He was once in charge of <b>Freightliner's</b> Cascadia Diesel Class 8 semi.|$|R
25|$|Unlike many {{traditional}} manufacturers, Tesla operates as an {{original equipment manufacturer}} (OEM), manufacturing powertrain components for other automakers. Tesla has confirmed partnerships with Daimler and Toyota. It also works with Panasonic {{as a partner in}} battery and solar panel research and development. The company supplies battery packs for <b>Freightliner</b> Trucks' Custom Chassis electric van.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} nearby {{stations}} at Invergowrie, Balmossie and Monifieth. Passenger services at Dundee {{are provided by}} Abellio ScotRail, CrossCountry, Caledonian Sleeper and Virgin Trains East Coast. No freight trains serve the city since the <b>Freightliner</b> terminal in Dundee was closed in the 1980s. There are also many intercity bus services offered by Megabus, Citylink and National Express.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{changes to the}} fleet {{occurred}} in late 2002 when Anglia started to hire Class 90 locomotives from <b>Freightliner.</b> This was because at the time, the Class 86 fleet was suffering from reliability problems. In late 2003, Anglia swapped to using English Welsh & Scottish owned Class 90 locomotives, hiring up to five at any one time. Consequently, {{the use of the}} Class 86 fleet was decreased, which subsequently allowed reliability to improve.|$|E
5|$|Train {{operating}} {{companies were}} {{adversely affected by}} the disruption, losing an estimated 19% of revenue in the year following the crash. Freight operator EWS was cancelling up to 400 trains per week as a result, whilst estimates put <b>Freightliner's</b> resultant losses at £1 million per month. The cost to the entire UK economy of the disruption was estimated at £6 million per day.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in 1991, the FL-Series would {{feature a}} full range of {{medium-duty}} trucks in the Class 6-7 range. In place of the FLC112 (and most other <b>Freightliners)</b> named for its BBC (bumper to back of cab length), the initial models of the Business Class were identified by size range. The FL60 was a Class 6 truck; the FL70, a Class 7 truck.|$|R
50|$|In 1988 the Speedlink service {{became part}} of a new BR {{operating}} sector Railfreight Distribution (RfD) together with <b>Freightliners</b> Ltd., BR's intermodal container carrying rail freight subsidiary. The merger was hoped to bring in further business through business synergies between the two subsidiaries, minor differences in the braking systems used by the two companies prevented train operating economies being realised.|$|R
