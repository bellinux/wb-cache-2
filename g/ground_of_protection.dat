They existed mainly for ceremonial use and for internal policing. According to the , Since a chief can neither attack his neighbour nor fall {{out with a}} foreign nation, it follows that he needs no military establishment which is not required either for police purposes or personal display, or for cooperation with the Imperial Government. The treaty made with Gwalior in 1844, and the instrument of transfer given to Mysore in 1881, alike base the restriction of {{the forces of the}} State upon the broad <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> The former explained in detail that unnecessary armies were embarrassing to the State itself and the cause of disquietude to others: a few months later a striking proof of this was afforded by the army of the Sikh kingdom of Lahore. The British Government has undertaken to protect the dominions of the Native princes from invasion and even from rebellion within: its army is organised for the defence not merely of British India, but of all the possessions under the suzerainty of the King-Emperor.|$|E

This paper {{examines}} the scope <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> granted to {{new forms of}} family by Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which guarantees the right to respect for family life. In particular, the paper intends to analyze the complex and evolving interpretive task of the European Court of Human Rights {{in regard to the}} definition of the term “family life” under Article 8. Consequently, this paper assesses Strasbourg’s case-law concerning new forms of family, such as de facto, mono-parental, recomposed, transgender and homosexual families. The case-law analysis carried out in this paper allows us to conclude that the main lines of the Strasbourg Court’s decisions in this field are nothing more than a reflection of the coordinates of the existing Family Law in Europe: equality and pedo-centrism. The principles drawn out by the Court match with an equalitarian and non- discriminatory vision of the law, focused entirely on the child's best interests. In some areas, however, the commitment to the principle of equality is suspended by the European Court of Human Rights on the <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> marriage and the traditional family...|$|R

Central questions have been whether the origins <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> statuses granted in this act are national or international, as the UN convention relating to the status of refugees and also the progress of the European Union’s Common European Asylum System both are affecting the Swedish legislation. The international relation’s theoretical perspectives of realism and liberalism have been applied in the analysis of what ideas and international political backgrounds have been found. The resulting conclusion is that only one category out of three is purely a result of the Swedish legislation. The common European asylum system affects and controls a large part of what is called Swedish asylum policy. It is concluded that liberal political-philosophical ideas of human rights are dominating the ideological background, and that liberal ideas of freedom from economical hindrances and also institutionalism has formed the system we have today. An interesting paradox is seen in the European Union’s growing concern of security and external borders, which is more typical in a realist, state-centered perspective...|$|R

Initially {{it was intended}} to limit these to classic formulations of civil freedoms, as with equality before the law, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of occupation and freedom of religious conscience. In the event particular interests pushed for additional consideration; the Catholic Church (through CDU/CSU representatives) succeeded in inserting protection both for 'Marriage and the Family" [...] and for parental responsibility for children's education; SPD representatives then amended this to protect additionally the rights of children born outside marriage; and Elisabeth Selbert (one of only four women on the 70-strong panel) was eventually successful in a largely lone campaign to gain constitutional protection for gender equality. [...] Notwithstanding this, there was a striking disjunction between the social context of two-parent, family households assumed in the Basic Law, and the everyday reality of German society in 1949; where over half of adult women were unmarried, separated or widowed; where the effective working population was overwhelmingly female; and where millions of expelees, refugees and displaced families were still without permanent accommodation.
