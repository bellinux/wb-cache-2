40|$|The bachelors {{treatise}} {{deals with}} the issue of the state social support regulating the allowances provided to authorised person (family members) in certain socially recognised situation, when the state partly takes over the joint liability for the occurred social situation. The thesis describes the historical development of social allowances paid by the state, contemporary legal regulations concerning the benefits as a. o. child allowance, social benefit, contribution to housing, parental benefit, benefits for foster care, birth grant, <b>death</b> <b>allowance.</b> Moreover it informs of the characteristics of the Act No. 117 / 1995 Coll. of the State Social Allowance, as amended, in connection to present regulation of the life minimum pursuant the Act No. 110 / 2006 Coll. of the Life and Existence Minimum. This concerns also the way of financing of social security and continuity of the Czech system of state social support to that of European Union. The target of the work was to map {{the current state of the}} issue and also to find out the opinions of the employees of the body of state social support on the valid legal regulation including the possible drafts of its possible change and to make up the comparison of changes in providing individual benefits in years 2006, 2007 and 2008. To achieve this goal, the qualitative method of the analysis of the document and questioning was applied. The technique of the research was secondary data analysis and standardised talk. The examined complex consisted of nine respondents with experience in the field of state social support, selected by the method of accidental choice from six different regions of the Czech Republic. These were managers with a long-term practice in the given system. It follows from the research that the changes which came into effect on 1 st January 2008 are being evaluated rather negatively based on the opinion that the Czech system of the state social support causes the growth of dependency of citizens on the state. The proposal of changes, formulated in this treatise based on the results of the research should concern first of all the child allowance, contribution to housing and more strict control concerning providing allowances. Based on the gained information and achieved goals the thesis could serve as incentive for the proposal of legislative change in the system of state social support with a positive impact on this system during its application in practice...|$|E
40|$|Intrauterine {{fetal death}} is a serious medical and nursing problem. Midwifes in the {{delivery}} room do not come across this diagnosis often, so the women in labour should be looked after by sufficiently experienced and educated midwives, who are well aware of the problem and are able to satisfy the needs of the woman in all its complexity. The theoretical part of the Study describes the causes of intrauterine fetal death, the symptoms, the complications, the diagnostical and therapeutical procedures. From the nursing point of view the Study focuses on midwives? care of the woman prior to the delivery, during labour, in the puerperium and in the subsequent ambulatory care. It also deals with the importance of farewell ritual with the child and with the psycho-social aspects of this problem. I have included a chapter on civil legal requirements that arise from this situation. The aim of this Study was to compare nursing care of women with stillbirth in selected maternity hospitals. I compare the midwives´ approach, ways and means of saying goodbye to the child and try to ascertain the level of awareness of the legal requirements relating to this situation amongst the midwives. Qualitative methodological approach was selected for the research. The investigation was conducted through semi-structured non-directive interviews. The results of the interviews were processed, analyzed and arranged into transparent schemes with a description. The research group consists of eight respondents from five different workplaces. The respondents were selected on the condition that they had been working {{in the delivery room}} and have experience with the care of a woman with stillbirth. Upon completing this research, the first research question could be answered. The nursing care of the woman with stillbirth is in all the facilities comparable. The midwife monitors the condition of the woman in labour and the course of the labour. All facilities make an effort to ensure the woman?s privacy, allow the partner?s presence and focus on good analgesia. Empathetic and sensitive approach to the woman is matter of course. The second research question was also answered. It was established that the farewell with the child is not facilitated in most of the monitored delivery rooms. At most workplaces the midwives do not actively offer the farewell with the child to the woman although they believe that this ritual bears great importance. The third research question can be answered that the midwives? awareness of the civil legal formalities in this area is not very high. Almost all respondents knew about the possibility to name and bury the stillborn child, but the midwives? knowledge about the maternity benefits and <b>death</b> <b>allowance</b> is not sufficient. The results of the research show {{that it is important to}} focus on improving the awareness of midwives in the care of a woman with stillbirth. The solution would be to organize a seminar on this topic. In the seminar, the midwives would acquaint themselves with the appropriate approach to the woman in labour, the possibilities of communication, about the importance of the farewell ritual with the child, the possible ways of this ritual and the information about the naming, burial and the maternity benefit. Another suitable method would be to create a training leaflet that would summarize the basic information related to this issue. This work could contribute to raising awareness amongst the midwives and thereby women in labour would receive not only professional care of their basic biological needs but also the adequate support in the psycho-social field. Midwives would become competent accompanying persons in this, for the woman very challenging time of life...|$|E

50|$|Awarded in {{the single}} degree of Knight, a small annuity was granted in favour of those {{recipients}} who did not enjoy an income above their tax allowance, payable to the widow or minor children on <b>death.</b> The <b>allowance</b> was also granted to those that fought in the former Austro-Hungarian armed forces who became Italian citizens after annexation.The order was bestowed by decree of the President of the Republic, its head, {{on the recommendation of}} the Minister of Defence. A Lieutenant General chaired the council, which screened applications made by eligible parties to the municipality of residence. With the death of the last surviving Knights of Vittorio Veneto in 2008, the order fell into abeyance and, in 2010, it was formally wound-up by repeal of the original legislation.|$|R

50|$|During the Age of Enlightenment, {{theologians and}} {{philosophers}} presented various philosophies and beliefs. A notable example is Emanuel Swedenborg who wrote some 18 theological works which describe {{in detail the}} nature of the afterlife according to his claimed spiritual experiences, the most famous of which is Heaven and Hell. His report of life there covers a wide range of topics, such as marriage in heaven (where all angels are married), children in heaven (where they are raised by angel parents), time and space in heaven (there are none), the after-death awakening process in the World of Spirits (a place halfway between Heaven and Hell and where people first wake up after <b>death),</b> the <b>allowance</b> of a free will choice between Heaven or Hell (as opposed to being sent to either one by God), the eternity of Hell (one could leave but would never want to), and that all angels or devils were once people on earth.|$|R
50|$|In {{the midst}} of the argument, Gregers returns, stunned to find that the couple are not overjoyed to be living without such a lie hanging over their heads. Mrs. Sørby arrives with a letter for Hedvig and news that she is marrying Håkon. The letter announces that Håkon is paying Old Ekdal a pension of 100 crowns per month until his death. Upon his <b>death,</b> the <b>allowance</b> will be {{transferred}} to Hedvig for the remainder of her life. The news sickens Hjalmar even further, and it dawns on him that Hedvig may very well be Håkon's child. He cannot stand the sight of Hedvig any longer and leaves the house to drink with Molvik and Relling. Gregers tries to calm the distraught Hedvig by suggesting that she sacrifice the wild duck for her father's happiness. Hedvig is desperate to win her father's love back and agrees to have her grandfather shoot the duck in the morning.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new framework for modelling the joint development over time of mortality rates {{in a pair}} of related populations with the primary aim of producing consistent mortality forecasts for the two populations. The primary aim is achieved by combining a number of recent and novel developments in stochastic mortality modelling, but these, additionally, provide us with a number of side benefits and insights for stochastic mortality modelling. By way of example, we propose an Age-Period-Cohort model which incorporates a mean-reverting stochastic spread that allows for different trends in mortality improvement rates in the short-run, but parallel improvements in the long run. Second, we fit the model using a Bayesian framework that allows us to combine estimation of the unobservable state variables and the parameters of the stochastic processes driving them into a single procedure. Key benefits of this include dampening down of the impact of Poisson variation in <b>death</b> counts, full <b>allowance</b> for paramater uncertainty, and the flexibility to deal with missing data. The framework is designed for large populations coupled with a small sub-population and is applied to the England & Wales national and Continuous Mortality Investigation assured lives males populations. We compare and contrast results based on the two-population approach with single-population results...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between spontaneous abortion (n = 5010), stillbirth without congenital defect (n = 210), {{and working conditions}} was analysed in 22, 613 previous pregnancies of 56, 067 women interviewed, 1982 - 4, immediately after termination of their most recent (current) pregnancy. The 22, 613 previous pregnancies were those in which at time of conception the women were employed 30 or more hours a week. Ratios of observed (O) to expected (E) fetal <b>deaths</b> after <b>allowance</b> by logistic regression for seven non-occupational confounding variables were calculated at four stages of pregnancy in 60 occupational groups and six main sectors for women whose work entailed various physical demands, environmental conditions, and exposure to chemicals. The O/E ratios for abortion were raised in the sales sector (1. 13, p less than 0. 05) and services sector (1. 11, p less than 0. 01) and for stillbirth in the sales sector (1. 50, p less than 0. 1). Substantially increased O/E ratios for late but not early abortion were found in operating room nurses (2. 92, p less than 0. 05), radiology technicians (3. 82, p less than 0. 01), and employees in agriculture and horticulture (2. 40, p less than 0. 05); in all categories the O/E ratio for stillbirth were also raised but only significantly (5. 55, p less than 0. 01) in the latter group. The O/E ratio for stillbirth was also raised in leather manufacture (3. 09, p less than 0. 01). In both individual and grouped analysis (the latter undertaken to minimise the possible effect of recall bias) significantly increased O/E ratios for abortion were found in women exposed to various high levels of physical stress, particularly weight lifting, other physical effort, and standing (p less than 0. 01). Increased ratios for stillbirth at this level of significance (p less than 0. 01) were found for other physical effort and vibration. Noteworthy chemical exposure was identified only in the health, services, and manufacturing sectors; the O/E ratio for stillbirth approached two in women exposed to solvents, almost all in manufacturing (p less than 0. 01). In the latter sector exposed to solvents was also associated with an approximately 20 % increase in abortion ratio at similar probability level...|$|R
