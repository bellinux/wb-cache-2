5|$|Primary lung cancers {{themselves}} {{most commonly}} metastasize to the brain, bones, liver and adrenal glands. Immunostaining of a biopsy is often <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> determine the original source. The presence of Napsin-A, TTF-1, CK7 and CK20 are helpful in confirming the subtype of lung carcinoma. SCLC derived from neuroendocrine cells may express CD56, neural cell adhesion molecule, synaptophysin or chromogranin.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} the fiction is thought by Donald Tuck to have {{generally}} fallen during Santesson's period at the helm, though this was not entirely his faultthere were a great many other magazines competing for stories by the top writers.

5|$|Horses require routine {{hoof care}} from a farrier, {{as well as}} vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental {{examinations}} from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist. If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained. Regular grooming is also <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.|$|E
5|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period}} than normal). A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. In such cases it may be <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. Gastrostomy to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 2007 Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, the inquiry's coordinator, {{was removed}} from his post and {{transferred}} from Portimão to Faro after telling the newspaper Diário de Notícias that the British police had only pursued leads <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> the McCanns, ignoring that the couple were suspects. As an example, he criticized their decision to follow up an anonymous email to Prince Charles that claimed a former Ocean Club employee had taken Madeleine.|$|E

Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked The Guardian to remove the video only because {{it would have been better}} had witnesses not seen it before being questioned.|$|E
5|$|Psychosocial {{interventions}} {{affect the}} amount of pain experienced {{and the degree to}} which it interferes with daily life; and the American Institute of Medicine and the American Pain Society support the inclusion of expert, quality-controlled psychosocial care as part of cancer pain management. Psychosocial interventions include education (addressing among other things the correct use of analgesic medications and effective communication with clinicians) and coping-skills training (changing thoughts, emotions, and behaviors through training in skills such as problem solving, relaxation, distraction and cognitive restructuring). Education may be more <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> people with stage I cancer and their carers, and coping-skills training may be more helpful at stages II and III.|$|E

5|$|Granger and Gregory {{argued that}} the large incisors were used for defence or for {{loosening}} shrubs by moving the neck downwards, thereby acting as picks and levers. Tapirs use their proboscis to wrap around branches while stripping off bark with the front teeth; this ability would have been <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> Paraceratherium. Some Russian authors suggested that the tusks were probably used for breaking twigs, stripping bark and bending high branches and that, because species from the early Oligocene had larger tusks than later ones, they probably had a more bark than leaf based diet. Since the species involved are now {{known to have been}} contemporaneous, and that the differences in tusks are perhaps sexually dimorphic, the latter idea is not accepted today. Herds of Paraceratherium may have migrated while continuously foraging from tall trees, which smaller mammals could not reach. Osborn suggested that its mode of foraging would have been {{similar to that of the}} high-browsing giraffe and okapi, rather than to modern rhinoceroses, whose heads are carried close to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1926–27, Kilner {{declined}} an invitation to tour India by the MCC. The 1927 season, which proved to be Kilner's last, was his least effective {{for several years and}} a disappointing summer for Yorkshire. The county fell to third in the Championship behind Lancashire and Nottinghamshire. He failed to achieve a century, scoring 1,004 runs (average 33.46), and did not reach 100 wickets {{for the first time since}} 1921, taking just 86 wickets at an average of 23.68. Wisden said his bowling had lost its effectiveness and was no longer dangerous even when the pitch was <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> spinners. In the Yorkshire averages, he finished fifth in both batting and bowling. In Kilner's final County Championship match, he scored 91 not out and took eight wickets, including five for 21 in the second innings, helping Yorkshire to a nine wicket victory. In his final first-class match, for Yorkshire against MCC, Kilner scored an unbeaten 51 to guide Yorkshire to an eight wicket win. He ended his first-class career with 14,707 runs at an average of 30.01 and 1,003 wickets at an average of 18.45.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes's most {{successful}} seasons {{in terms of}} wickets were the three seasons from 1900 to 1902. In these years, Rhodes took 725 wickets {{at an average of}} 14.07, taking five or more wickets in an innings 68 times and taking ten or more wickets in a match 21 times, assisting Yorkshire to three consecutive County Championships. In 1900, Rhodes took 261 wickets as bad weather made pitches <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> his bowling. In 1901, the weather was much better, leading to pitches that were good for batting, but Rhodes took 251 wickets, an achievement described by Wisden as astonishing. Against MCC that year, Rhodes scored his maiden first-class century, batting at number nine. In the 1902 season, Rhodes took 213 wickets, fewer than 1901 despite a greater number of favourable pitches in a wet summer. This attracted unfavourable comment from some critics who had expected more.|$|E

30|$|The {{examination}} of angiogenesis in the periprosthetic membrane {{could be a}} <b>helpful</b> tool <b>to</b> differentiate between aseptic loosening and PJI. So far, a study that examines the expression of endoglin in periprosthetic membranes has not been described. This study should create more understanding of the pathogenesis of aseptic loosening and PJI by investigating angiogenesis histologically and immunohistochemically in accordance to the consensus classification of Morawietz. Our hypothesis was that PJI is {{associated with an increased}} neovascularization in the periprosthetic membrane and endoglin is a <b>helpful</b> biomarker <b>to</b> differentiate between aseptic loosening and PJI.|$|R
5|$|The {{bad feeling}} between the McCanns and the Polícia Judiciária reached such a height that Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, {{the officer who}} coordinated the {{investigation}} from May to October 2007, resigned in June 2008 {{to write a book}} alleging that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that the McCanns had faked an abduction. Amaral had been removed from the case in October 2007 after telling a Portuguese newspaper that the British police pursued leads <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> only the McCanns. Three days after the case closed in July 2008, his book, Maddie: A Verdade da Mentira ("Maddie: The Truth of the Lie"), was published in Portugal by Guerra & Paz. By November 2008 it had sold 180,000 copies, and was later translated into six languages. A documentary based on the book was broadcast on TVI in Portugal in April 2009, watched by 2.2 million.|$|E
5|$|Though the National Freeway was {{designated}} as US48, as {{the completion of}} the freeway neared, the possibility of the freeway being designated as an Interstate Highway came up. In the 1980s, the project to improve US50 between Washington, D.C., and Annapolis to Interstate Highway standards had been assigned the designation of I-68. MDSHA, however, later concluded that adding additional route shields to the US50 freeway would not be <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> drivers, since about half the freeway already had two route designations (US50 and US301) and drivers on the freeway were already familiar with the US50 designation. This made the designation to be applied to that freeway more flexible, and so in 1989, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the organization composed of the various state departments of transportation that decides route numbering in the United States, approved MDSHA's request to renumber the US50 freeway from I-68 to I-595. That same year, AASHTO approved changing US48's designation to I-68. This change took effect upon {{the completion of the}} last section of the National Freeway, on August 2, 1991.|$|E
