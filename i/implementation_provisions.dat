40|$|Supervisor: Dr. Claire Kilpatrick, European University Institute. Award date: 20 June 2013 The thesis {{examines}} the innovations {{introduced by the}} United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the international human rights arena. It addresses three separate aspects of the Convention, i. e., its drafting process, its general and substantive provisions, and its provisions on implementation and monitoring. The main focus of the thesis is on the innovative mechanisms for stronger social rights realisation found within the general and substantive provisions of the Convention. The thesis argues that the Convention’s innovative use of nondiscrimination, equality, and social participation mechanisms presents a new tool that moves social rights closer to civil rights and consequently provides an effective framework for their stronger realisation. The drafting process and the <b>implementation</b> <b>provisions</b> are analysed {{to the extent to}} which they relate to the stronger social rights realisation. The thesis argues that the innovations in the drafting process affected the experimental nature of the Convention’s content and explores the future implications of stakeholder participation in the Convention’s drafting process by comparing it to the drafting of other relevant international treaties. The innovations within the implementation and monitoring provisions are relevant to the fostering of social rights, since these provisions are tasked with transforming the Convention’s text into an actual lever of change. The thesis identifies the problems currently faced by the treaty bodies, and provides an overview of the CRPD’s mechanisms to address such problems. The thesis aims to determine whether these innovations are CRPD specific, or part of a broader trend in international human rights law and to offer some concluding remarks on the Convention’s innovative mechanisms, particularly where they relate to fostering the stronger realisation of social rights and their potential to produce effects beyond the scope of disability law...|$|E
40|$|POSTER In Germany organic {{stakeholders}} largely {{reject the}} draft of the revised EU Organic regulation. This was evident at a workshop held {{within the framework of}} the ORGAP project, which brought together leading representatives of the organic sector in March 2006. The objective of the workshop was to develop indicators on the evaluation of the European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming. The concerns voiced by stakeholders on the revision of the regulation were so strong that we consider it appropriate to i) report them and ii) to put them into perspective as a contribution to further discussion. This is the objective of this poster. MANUSCRIPT FOR THE POSTER PRESENTATION (TRANSLATED AND REVISED FROM [URL] Shortly before Christmas of last year, the Commission of the European Union (EU) published {{the draft of}} a new EU Organic Regulation. This draft proposal, which is intended to replace Council Regulation (EEC) 2092 / 91 and supplementary regulations, has provoked substantial criticism from the German organic sector. Thus the German farmers’ union (Deutscher Bauernverband, DBV) spoke of the “massive undermining of consumer protection” which could result from provisions in the draft. The German Federation of the Organic Food Industry (Bund Ökologische Lebensmittelwirtschaft, BÖLW) as the umbrella organization of organic producers, processors and traders rejects the present draft revision outright. The broad rejection of the draft replacement regulation was confirmed at a workshop held in the framework of the EU ORGAP project, which brought together leading representatives of the German organic sector on March 30, 2006 in Berlin. The ORGAP (Evaluation of the European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming) research project is of special interest in connection with the new EU Organic Regulation, since the draft regulation explicitly (and quite unusually) makes specific reference to this project: its results will be drawn upon at a later stage in order to draft the detailed <b>implementation</b> <b>provisions</b> for the regulation. The methodological approach of the ORGAP research project places a very strong emphasis on stakeholder integration. ...|$|E

Therefore, crisis planning is one essential component of an overall safe school and community plan. "Crisis Planning " refers to two distinct components – emergency management and crisis response. Emergency management addresses physical safety, such as the emergency vehicles that will be dispatched, emergency drills, communication methods, on-site medical care, etc.; crisis response addresses the emotional support of the school community, such as grief counseling, media interviews and future prevention efforts. It is important to be comprehensive when creating a crisis plan. For this reason, the following checklist is provided as a tool for developing a personalized crisis plan...|$|R

40|$|Several {{trends in}} SIP {{application}} server deployments exacerbate the classic problem of feature interaction in large enterprise telephony environments: use of distributed feature servers, mixing of legacy and green-field feature servers, and the co-existence of multiple third-party feature <b>implementations</b> <b>provisioned</b> {{in the same}} environment. Next-generation SIP application servers will include an application router (AR) to provide more control over feature sequencing. As we discuss here, the AR can be augmented to incorporate feature interaction detection and resolution logic. We describe a novel design for run-time feature interaction detection and resolution {{in an environment of}} distributed feature servers using a SIP application server with application routing function, such as that defined in JSR 289. The approach is based on the algorithm of the Kolberg-Magill (K-M) method for feature interaction detection. Here we extend the notation of the algorithm to cover advanced call control services, enable the algorithm to work in topologies involving B 2 BUAs and SBCs, and test the approach with a substantial feature set of 32 features...|$|R
