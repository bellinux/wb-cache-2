5|$|Banai {{does not}} appear in the Malhari Mahatmya {{originating}} from the Brahmin (high-priest caste) tradition, which glorifies Khandoba as Shiva and de-emphasizes his earthly connections. In contrast, Banai occupies the central position in the Dhangar folk narrative and Mhalsa's marriage to Khandoba <b>is</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> a passing mention; Marathas and other settled castes give more importance to Mhalsa.|$|E

5|$|As {{coenzyme}} Q <b>is</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> ubiquinol on {{the inner}} side of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.|$|E
5|$|As the {{electrons}} pass through this complex, four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Exactly how this occurs is unclear, {{but it seems}} to involve conformational changes in complex I that cause the protein to bind protons on the N-side of the membrane and release them on the P-side of the membrane. Finally, {{the electrons}} are transferred from the chain of iron–sulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in the membrane. Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it <b>is</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> ubiquinol (QH2).|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stages, {{the patient is}} {{completely}} dependent upon caregivers.

Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately {{not be able to}} perform even the simplest tasks independently; muscle mass and mobility deteriorates {{to the point where they}} are bedridden and unable to feed themselves. The cause of death is usually an external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia, not the disease itself.|$|E

5|$|Gundamma {{is a rich}} widow who ill-treats her {{stepdaughter}} Lakshmi, a selfless {{person who}} <b>is</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> working as a maid. Gundamma has a daughter Saroja and a son Prabhakar. Prabhakar {{is in love with}} Saroja's friend Padma. Gundamma has a half-brother Ghantaiah, a cunning but weak milk vendor. Ghantaiah wants Gundamma to marry off Saroja to his criminal son Bhoopati. To achieve this goal without the knowledge of Gundamma, he spoils every marriage proposal Saroja receives. Saroja's arrogance and Lakshmi's courteous attitude indirectly help Ghantaiah. Gundamma decides to marry off Lakshmi to a vagabond and Saroja to the son of Ramabhadraiah, a wealthy man living in a faraway town.|$|E
5|$|In general, teleosts {{tend to be}} {{quicker and}} more {{flexible}} than more basal bony fishes. Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater lightness. While teleost bones are well calcified, they are constructed from a scaffolding of struts, rather than the dense cancellous bones of holostean fish. In addition, the lower jaw of the teleost <b>is</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> just three bones; the dentary, the angular bone and the articular bone.|$|E

The Vishnu Purana states that one who loathes his father, Brahmins or the gods and who destroys jewels is punished here. This hell is a 100,000 yojana lake filled with worms.
