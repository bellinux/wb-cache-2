40|$|AbstractHydraulic jump is a {{phenomenon}} caused by change in stream regime from supercritical to sub - critical flow with considerable energy dissipation and rise in depth of flow. Hydraulic jump primarily serves as an energy dissipater to dissipate excess energy of flowing water downstream of hydraulic structures, such as spillway, sluice gates etc. This excess energy, if left unchecked, will have adverse effect on the banks and the bed. A review of literature has shown that earlier researcher have studied the hydraulic <b>jump</b> <b>characteristics</b> in terms of approach Froude number (Fr 1) only. In the present paper hydraulic jump in horizontal prismatic channel has been studied and analyzed considering the effect of both approach Froude number and incoming Reynolds number (Re 1).

Several stilling basins and energy dissipating devices have been designed in conjunction with spillways and outlet works to avoid damages in canals’ structures.

The current study is aimed toward introducing the artificial intelligence technique as new modeling tool in the prediction of the accurate design of stilling basins. Specifically, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are utilized {{in the current study}} in conjunction with experimental data to predict the length of the hydraulic jumps occurred in spillways and consequently the stilling basin dimensions can be designed for adequate energy dissipation.

The results obtained from implementing these models showed that ANN technique was very successful in simulating the hydraulic <b>jump</b> <b>characteristics</b> occurred in stilling basins.

Experiments were conducted in a horizontal rectangular basin with gradual expansion 0. 5 m wide and 10 m long. Four physical models were fixed in the flume. The measured characteristics of the hydraulic jump with different divergences ratio (B = b 1 /b 2 = 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1) and the inflow Froude numbers (6 < Fr 1 < 12) were compared {{with each other and with}} the corresponding values measured for the classical hydraulic jump.

The first correction term depends on the instantaneous moments of order up to three, that is, the skewness is taken into account, the next term depends on moments of order four (kurtosis) as well, etc. In empirical studies, the asymptotic formula can be applied without explicit specification of the underlying process: it suffices {{to assume that the}} instantaneous moments of order greater than two are small w. r. t. moments of order one and two, and use empirical data on moments of order up to three or four. As an application, the bond pricing problem in the non-Gaussian quadratic term structure model is solved.
