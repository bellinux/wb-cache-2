He was confined to his room, and it was kneeling by his bedside that Eutacie poured out her thankfulness for her child's preservation, and her own repentance for the passing fit of self-will and petulance. The thought of Rayonette's safety seemed absolutely to extinguish the fresh anxiety that had arisen since it had become evident that her enemies no longer supposed her dead, but were probably upon her traces. Somehow, danger had become almost a natural element to her, and having once expressed her firm resolution that nothing should separate her from her adopted father, to whom indeed her care became constantly more necessary, she seemed to occupy herself very little with the matter; she nursed him as merrily as ever, and left to him and Madame de Quinet the grave consultations as to what was to be done for her security. There was a sort of natural buoyancy about her that never realized a danger till it came, and then her spirit was roused to meet it.|$|E

To directly determine mortality and predation in the endangered western Steller sea lion Eumetopias jubatus, we deployed implanted, satellite-linked post-mortem data transmitters in 21 juveniles. Data recovered from 4 of 5 detected mortalities exhibited precipitous drops in ambient temperatures followed by <b>immediate</b> onset of <b>transmissions</b> (N = 3), or gradual cooling and delayed transmissions (N = 1). Precipitous drop data sets were classified as acute death at sea by trauma. A model to estimate algor mortis (body cooling) as a function of mass and ambient conditions was validated through simulations on 4 carcasses. Model outputs suggest that cooling rate masses can be qualitatively distinguished if well outside the prediction uncertainties. The observed gradual cooling rate was best described by a modeled mass one-sixth the animal’s mass at release, supporting the classification of the fourth event as acute death at sea by trauma. This suggests that at least 4 in 5 detected mortalities likely represent acute deaths at sea, probably due to predation. We conclude that precipitous drop events with <b>immediate</b> <b>transmissions</b> can be classified as acute death likely by predation, but gradual cooling events with delayed transmission should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. In 3 cases that provided both ante-mortem and post-mortem locations from external and implanted transmitters, respectively, these differed by less than 17 km, illustrating that this technique provides spatially explicit data of predation on individual sea lions...|$|R

As mobile phones are constantly carried, camera phones allow for capturing moments at any time. Mobile communication also allows for <b>immediate</b> <b>transmission</b> of content (for example via Multimedia Messaging Services), which cannot be reversed or regulated. Brooke Knight observes that [...] "the carrying of an external, non-integrated camera (like a DSLR) always changes {{the role of the}} wearer at an event, from participant to photographer". The cameraphone user, on the other hand, can remain a participant in whatever moment they photograph. Photos taken on a cameraphone serve to prove the physical presence of the photographer. The immediacy of sharing and the liveness that comes with it allows the photographs shared through cameraphones to emphasize their indexing of the photographer.|$|E

Shefa ("Flow" [...] שפע and its derivative, Hashpoah [...] "Influence" [...] השפעה) is sometimes alternatively used in Kabbalah, a term also used in Medieval Jewish Philosophy to mean Divine influence, while the Kabbalists favour Ohr because its numerical value equals Raz ("mystery"). It is one of the two main metaphors in Kabbalah for understanding Divinity, along with the other metaphor of the human soul-body relationship for the Sephirot. The metaphorical description of spiritual Divine creative-flow, using the term for physical [...] "light" [...] perceived with the eye, arises from analogous similarities. These include the intangible physicality of light, the delight it inspires and the illumination it gives, its apparently <b>immediate</b> <b>transmission</b> and constant connection with its source.

40|$|Abstract Background Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} in Brazil {{is caused}} by the protozoan Leishmania (Leishmania) chagasi and it is transmitted by sandfly of the genus Lutzomyia. Dogs are an important domestic reservoir, and control of the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) to humans includes the elimination of infected dogs. However, though dogs are considered to be an important element in the transmission cycle of Leishmania, the identification of infected dogs representing an <b>immediate</b> risk for <b>transmission</b> has not been properly evaluated. Since {{it is not possible to}} treat infected dogs, they are sacrificed when a diagnosis of VL is established, a measure that is difficult to accomplish in highly endemic areas. In such areas, parameters that allow for easy identification of reservoirs that represents an <b>immediate</b> risk for <b>transmission</b> is of great importance for the control of VL transmission. In this study we aimed to identify clinical parameters, reinforced by pathological parameters that characterize dogs with potential to transmit the parasite to the vector. Results The major clinical manifestations of visceral leishmaniasis in dogs from an endemic area were onicogriphosis, skin lesions, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. The transmission potential of these dogs was assessed by xenodiagnosis using Lutzomyia longipalpis. Six of nine symptomatic dogs were infective to Lutzomyia longipalpis while none of the five asymptomatic dogs were infective to the sandfly. Leishmania amastigotes were present in the skin of all clinically symptomatic dogs, but absent in asymptomatic dogs. Higher parasite loads were observed in the ear and ungueal region, and lower in abdomen. The inflammatory infiltrate was more intense in the ears and ungueal regions of both symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs. In clinically affected dogs in which few or none Leishmania amastigotes were observed, the inflammatory infiltrate was constituted mainly of lymphocytes and macrophages. When many parasites were present, the infiltrate was also comprised of lymphocytes and macrophages, as well as a larger quantity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Conclusion Dogs that represent an <b>immediate</b> risk for <b>transmission</b> of Leishmania in endemic areas present clinical manifestations that include onicogriphosis, skin lesions, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Lymphadenopathy in particular was a positive clinical hallmark since it was closely related to the positive xenodiagnosis. </p...|$|R

For example, this occurs under intermittent interference. We devise the backward retransmission (BRQ) scheme, which uses the delayed CSIT to send the optimal amount of incremental redundancy (IR). BRQ uses fixed-length packets, fixed-rate R transmission codebook, and operates as Markov block coding, where {{the correlation between the}} adjacent packets depends on the amount of IR parity bits. When the delayed CSIT is full and R grows asymptotically, the average throughput of BRQ becomes equal to the value achieved with prior CSIT and a fixed-power transmitter; however, at the expense of increased delay. The second contribution is a method for employing BRQ when a limited number of feedback bits is available to report the delayed CSIT. The main novelty is the idea to assemble multiple feedback opportunities and report multiple SINRs through vector quantization. This challenges the conventional wisdom in ARQ protocols where feedback bits are used to only quantize the CSIT of the <b>immediate</b> previous <b>transmission...</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 1800s Tortola became a key port for the postal {{network in the}} Caribbean. In fact, Road Town, the main port of the Virgin Islands, was the last stop on the return leg of the “Leeward Islands Packet” {{as well as a}} very {{important}} transfer point for mail boats connecting British islands in the Lesser Antilles. This pre-eminence deteriorated during the next 20 years and in 1823 control of the packet service was transferred to the Admiralty, and as contracts expired the packets were replaced with naval brigs. This change had been discussed {{for a number of years}} and the immediate effect on the existing schedules and routes was minimal and did not affect the Virgin Islands. By the mid-1830s the West Indies were still served twice a month by sailing packets, the round trip being almost three months in length. Barbados remained the first port for the packets; and St. Thomas was their last port before they sailed homeward. In St. Thomas they awaited the mail boats from the Leeward Islands. As a result of progress, in 1835 steamers began taking over the mail boat service in the West Indies and a regular steamer service began in 1842, when the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company started a twice-monthly service from Britain between Falmouth and the West Indies. From its very inception the service of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company included a route from St. Thomas to Demerara (via the Leeward Islands and Barbados) and vice versa. Indeed, Tortola was the first stop on the southward leg and the penultimate on the return voyage. The round trip took fourteen days. When a new contract was signed in 1850 the new routes did not include Tortola and the reasons for this decision included the collapse of the local economy following the 1834 emancipation from slavery and the lower volume of mail. The correspondence for Tortola was now transferred at St. Thomas. This is confirmed by the company’s March 1860 schedule which states that the mails for Tortola are to be delivered to the company’s superintendent at St. Thomas, who will be held responsible for their <b>immediate</b> <b>transmission</b> and for the due embarkation of the return mails.|$|E
50|$|The {{big news}} at the Monza Autodrome near Milan was that McLaren {{designer}} John Barnard was leaving to join the Ferrari team. The new AGS was in the paddock {{for the first time}} with Ivan Capelli driving the Motori Moderni-engined chassis (which was, in fact, an old Renault Sport one with AGS bodywork). This had previously been tested by Didier Pironi. Michele Alboreto was in difficulties having crashed a motorcycle and injured his shoulder. The Osella team had replaced Allen Berg with local rising star Alex Caffi but otherwise the field was as normal. Qualifying resulted in the Teo Fabi taking pole in his Benetton with Alain Prost second for McLaren ahead of Mansell's Williams, Berger's Benetton, Senna's Lotus and the second Williams of Piquet. The top 10 was completed by Derek Warwick (Brabham-BMW), Keke Rosberg (McLaren), Alboreto and Riccardo Patrese (Brabham). Before the start Fabi and Prost both had trouble and while Fabi had to start from the back of the grid, Prost went to his spare car in the pitlane. As a result, the front row was gone and this enabled Berger to take the lead from Mansell on the run down to the first corner. Senna suffered an <b>immediate</b> <b>transmission</b> failure and retired. The result of all of this was that Berger led Mansell, Piquet, a fast-starting Rene Arnoux (Ligier), Rosberg and Alboreto. In the early laps Alboreto moved ahead of Arnoux and the front four then began to pull away from the rest of the field. At the end of the seventh lap Mansell went into the lead and he was followed through by Piquet and Alboreto as Berger backed off to conserve fuel. In the meantime Prost and Fabi were charging up through the field, Prost getting to sixth by lap 18. The McLaren was then black-flagged for an illegal switch of cars. It mattered little because his TAG engine blew soon afterwards. During the tires stops Alboreto spun and glanced a barrier and had to stop for repairs. This dropped the Ferrari out of the battle for the lead. Piquet now charged up to Mansell and took the lead, pulling away to win a dominant victory and moved himself back to second in the World Championship. Mansell's second place meant that he was still five points ahead. Johansson finished third with Rosberg fourth, Berger fifth and Alan Jones sixth in the Haas Lola.|$|E
50|$|Statistical {{methods in}} the mobile market {{research}} {{profit from the}} fact that they do not depend on place or time. This means that surveys via mobile phone can be done anywhere and at any time and are therefore much more advantageous compared to surveys via land line phones. Considering that a high amount of participants of the main target groups can not be reached at home at most hours of the day, the chance to get hold of them by mobile phone is much higher.Especially with regard to people under the age of 25 as well as business people, who are often on the way and cannot get hold of easily, the chances of the mobile market research are promising. As most people always carry their mobile phone with them, an <b>immediate</b> <b>transmission</b> of personal impressions of current events, is possible at any time. Thus, the so-called ‘magic moment’ can be captured, which is often very helpful. Surveys concerning product placement and efficiency of sales promotion measures at the point of sale turned out to be perfectly realizable this way. Looking at the topic “Access possibilities to WAP-Surveys” by mobile phone, {{as well as at the}} topic “Getting hold of potential participants”, there are some developments that should be named. The trend towards the increasing distribution of web-enabled mobile phones, and the improved representativity that comes along with it, does still continue: from 2007 to 2008, Nielsen Mobile noticed an increase of the mobile internet usage.With decreasing costs and an improving technology, a further upward tendency can be expected. In addition, the mobile internet usage increases with the rapidly developing distribution of smart phones. According to IM (Mediawork Initiative), already in 2013 more people will log in with their smart phone, than with a PC. Mobile statistics show a high and very fast response rate. As a result of the independency from time and place, answers can be submitted immediately. This also means that results can almost be transmitted in real time. A study from Globalpark shows that approximately 35% of the participants answered a mobile survey within 2 hours. Through the novelty of the form of survey and its playful design, mobile research has a motivating effect on the participants. This applies especially to young, technologically interested male persons. But also iPhone users are considered to be very communicative. As the devices are easy to handle, the users are more likely and more motivated to take part in surveys. A study examining how to best reach mobile respondents published in the Journal Social Science Computer Review underlines the importance of social factors. Especially their subjective belief of how they are seen by significant others, or their intention of how they would like to be seen by significant others seem to play a major role in their mobile phone behavior.|$|E
40|$|Delayed {{onset of}} muscle {{activation}} {{can be a}} descriptor of impaired motor control. Activation onset can be estimated from electromyography (EMG) -registered muscle excitation and from ultrasound-registered muscle motion, which enables non-invasive measurements in deep muscles. However, in voluntary activation, EMG- and ultrasound-detected activation onsets may not correspond. To evaluate this, ten healthy men performed isometric elbow flexion at 20 % to 70 % of their maximal force. Utilising a multi-channel electrode transparent to ultrasound, EMG and M(otion) -mode ultrasound were recorded simultaneously over the biceps brachii muscle. The time intervals between automated and visually estimated activation onsets were correlated with the regional variation of EMG and muscle motion onset, contraction level and speed. Automated and visual onsets indicated variable time intervals between EMG- and motion onset, median (interquartile range) 96 (121) ms and 48 (72) ms, respectively. In 17 % (computed analysis) or 23 % (visual analysis) of trials, motion onset was detected before local EMG onset. Multi-channel EMG and M-mode ultrasound revealed regional differences in activation onset, which decreased with higher contraction speed (Spearman ρ ≥ 0. 45, P < 0. 001).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new cellular architecture for radio access, CDPA {{that can be}} applied to present and future cellular systems, independently of the cell size. It poses as an appealing alternative to systems based on classical bandwidth subdivision methods, namely TDMA, FDMA or CDMA. In these systems, parallelism of communications is achieved by subdividing the band width “a priori ” among cells. In CDPA no bandwidth sub division is operated. All cells and terminals use a single frequency channel and transmit packets on a slotted channel. Parallel transmission in different cells is achieved through the “capture ” capability. A dynamic polling mechanism, C-PRMA, managed by the base station, guarantees almost <b>immediate</b> re <b>transmission</b> of packets that are not captured, thus assuring that packets are eventually correctly received. Analytical evaluations show that CDPA has the potential to provide larger capacity than the other cited systems in the case of continuous traffic sources. Furthermore, as C-PRMA is inherently apt to sustain bursty traffic, the system capacity is easily doubled in the case of packetized voice transmission using silence suppression.

In this review I propose that cultural evolution theory, including both a sophisticated view of human behaviour and a methodological attitude to modelling and quantitative analysis, provides a useful framework to study the effects and the developments of media in the digital age. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆e 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eI will first give a general presentation of the cultural evolution framework, and I will then introduce this more specific research program with two illustrative topics. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆e 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eThe first topic concerns how cultural transmission biases, that is, simple heuristics such as 2 ̆ 2 copy prestigious individuals 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 copy the majority 2 ̆ 2, operate in the novel context of digital media. The existence of transmission biases is generally justified with their adaptivity in small-scale societies. How do they operate in an environment where, for example, prestigious individuals possess not-relevant skills, or popularity is explicitly quantified and advertised? 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆e 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eThe second aspect relates to fidelity of cultural transmission. Digitally-mediated interactions support cheap and <b>immediate</b> high-fidelity <b>transmission,</b> in opposition, for example, to oral traditions. How does this change the content that is more likely to spread? 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆e 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eOverall, I suggest the usefulness of a 2 ̆ 2 long view 2 ̆ 2 to our contemporary digital environment, contextualised in cognitive science and cultural evolution theory, and I discuss how this perspective could help us to understand what is genuinely new and what is not. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a dynamic spectrum access {{system in which}} Secondary Users (SUs) choose to either acquire dedicated spectrum or to use spectrum-holes (white spaces) which belong to Primary Users (PUs). The trade-off incorporated in this decision is between <b>immediate</b> yet costly <b>transmission</b> and free but delayed transmission (a consequence of both the possible appearance of PUs and sharing the spectrum holes with multiple SUs). We first {{consider a}} system with a single PU band, in which the SU decisions are fixed. Employingqueueing-theoreticmethods, we obtain explicit expressions for the expected delays associated with using the PU band. Based on that, we then consider selfinterested SUs and study the interaction between them as a noncooperative game. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a symmetric Nash equilibrium, and characterize the equilibrium behavior explicitly. Using our equilibrium results, we show how to maximize revenue from renting dedicated bands to SUs and briefly discuss the extension of our model to multiple PUs. Finally, since spectrum sensing can be resource–consuming, we characterize the gains provided by this capability. Index Terms—Queueing theory, game theory, decisions in queues, dynamic spectrum access, cognitive radio. I...|$|R
40|$|Malaria parasites produce {{male and}} female life cycle stages (gametocytes) that must {{fertilize}} to achieve successful colonization of the mosquito. Gametocyte sex ratios {{have been shown to}} be under strong selection pressure both as an adaptive response to a worsening blood environment for transmission and according to the number of co-infecting clones in the vertebrate. Evidence for an impact of sex ratio on the transmission success of Plasmodium falciparum has, however, been more controversial. Theoretical models of fertilization predict that increasingly male sex ratios will be favoured at low gametocyte densities to ensure fertilization. Here, we analyse in vitro transmission studies of P. falciparum to Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes and test this prediction. We find that there is a discernible effect of sex ratio on transmission but which is dependent upon the gametocyte density. While increasingly male sex ratios do give higher transmission success at low gametocyte densities, they reduce success at higher densities. This therefore provides empirical confirmation that sex ratio has an <b>immediate</b> impact on <b>transmission</b> success and that it is density-dependent. Identifying the signals used by the parasite to alter its sex ratio is essential to determine the success of transmission-blocking vaccines that aim to impede the fertilization process...|$|R
40|$|All {{space shuttle}} events from launch through solid rocket booster {{recovery}} and orbiter landing are considered {{in terms of}} constraints placed on those operations by the natural environment. Thunderstorm activity is discussed {{as an example of}} a possible hazard. The activities most likely to require advanced detection and monitoring techniques are identified as those from deorbit decision to Orbiter landing. The inflexible flight plan will require the transmission of real time wind profile information below 24 km and warnings of thunderstorms or turbulence in the Orbiter flight path. Extensive aerial reconnaissance and communication facilities and procedures to permit <b>immediate</b> <b>transmission</b> of aircraft reports to the mission control authority and to the Orbiter will also be required...|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{integrated}} gateway for various personal health devices (PHDs). This gateway receives measurements from various PHDs and conveys {{them to a}} remote monitoring server (MS). It provides two kinds of transmission modes: <b>immediate</b> <b>transmission</b> and integrated transmission. The former mode operates if a measurement exceeds a predetermined threshold {{or in the case}} of an emergency. In the latter mode, the gateway retains the measurements instead of forwarding them. When the reporting time comes, the gateway extracts all the stored measurements, integrates them into one message, and transmits the integrated message to the MS. Through this mechanism, the transmission overhead can be reduced. On the basis of the proposed gateway, we construct a u-healthcare system comprising an activity monitor, a medication dispenser, and a pulse oximeter. The evaluation results show that the size of separate messages from various PHDs is reduced through the integration process, and the process does not require much time; the integration time is negligible...|$|E
40|$|Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) {{has already}} been a widely used {{protocol}} in many networks. Recent {{studies show that the}} performance of TCP over ATM networks is severely degraded. In this paper, we propose to apply the buffer reservation technique on TCP traffic over ATM networks. While the ATM block transfer (ABT) method (Boyer, 1992) is to reserve bandwidth for bursts of cells, our proposed buffer reservation scheme is to reserve buffer space for TCP packets. We study the performance achieved by the Delayed Transmission (DT) and the <b>Immediate</b> <b>Transmission</b> (IT) buffer reservation schemes. Simulation results show that under the DT buffer reservation scheme, TCP can achieve better throughput and delay performance compared to the plain TCP and the TCP with Early Packet Discard (EPD) except in the WAN environment with short TCP packet length. In the WAN environment with short TCP packet length, the IT scheme can achieve similar throughput performance but smaller delay compared to the pl [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Low {{orbiting}} satellite communication networks will be competing with geosynchronous satellites for {{a share of}} the communications market. In world-wide communications that do not require <b>immediate</b> real time <b>transmissions,</b> low {{orbiting satellite}}s are competitive with geosynchronous satellites because the system is reliable and low in cost. Since satellites are a clear example of Newtonian laws, the distinct patterns they make in their orbiting process are predictable. Newton 2 ̆ 7 s law states that an object will remain in uniform motion unless acted upon by a force: a satellite remains in motion around the earth because there is no atmosphere to slow it down. A satellite stays in orbit because the pull of gravity inward is balanced by centrifugal energy outward. The rate which a satellite orbits the earth and the lifetime of the satellite depend on its altitude. Low orbiting satellites trace unique paths over {{the surface of the earth}} [...] the satellite is accessible for communication if the path o the satellite comes within 1500 kilometers of a ground station. Unless there are 50 to 80 low orbiting satellites, the system is not useful for exclusive real time communication and thus requires a different operating structure. The low orbiting satellite will use a combination of two modes for communication: the transponder mode, and the store and forward mode...|$|R
