5|$|Davis {{was born}} in Fairview, Kentucky, to a {{moderately}} prosperous farmer, and grew up on his older brother Joseph's large cotton plantations <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> Louisiana. Joseph Davis also secured his appointment to the United States Military Academy. After graduating, Jefferson Davis served six years as a lieutenant in the United States Army. He fought in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), as the colonel of a volunteer regiment. Before the American Civil War, he operated a large cotton plantation <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> owned as many as 74 slaves. Although he argued against secession in 1858, he believed states had an unquestionable right to leave the Union.|$|E
5|$|Mamie Till Bradley {{testified that}} she had {{instructed}} her son to watch his manners <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> that should a situation ever come to his being asked to get on his knees to ask forgiveness of a white person, he should do it without a thought. The defense questioned her identification of her son in the casket in Chicago and a $400 life insurance policy she had taken out on him.|$|E

5|$|President Bush {{declared}} Louisiana {{a federal}} disaster area after the storm, making it eligible for assistance. FEMA set up three locations to apply <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> Louisiana. Applications began pouring in, 153,000 {{by the time}} of the deadline. Over $311million in aid was granted to Louisiana. A total of $50million of that money was in the form of low interest loans, and not actual grants.|$|E
5|$|Till's {{body was}} clothed, packed in lime, placed into a pine coffin and {{prepared}} for burial. It may have been embalmed while in Mississippi. Mamie Till Bradley demanded that the body be sent to Chicago; she later said that she worked to halt an immediate burial <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> called several local and state authorities in Illinois and Mississippi {{to make sure that}} her son was returned to Chicago. A doctor did not examine Till post-mortem.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he took on}} {{a variety}} of jobs {{including}} school bus driver, farmer, deacon and cosmetics salesman, the latter of which he performed well past his 100th birthday. He received the Victory Medal, a special medal from the Mississippi National Guard and the French Légion d'honneur. In 1999, the Mississippi Legislature adopted a resolution recognizing him as an outstanding citizen of Mississippi. At the time of his death, at the age of 112, he was recognized as the oldest combat veteran ever, the oldest male ever recorded <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> the second-oldest man and World War I veteran in the world.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, he was the oldest United States combat veteran ever, the oldest male ever {{recorded}} <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> had outlived at least three of his eight children. It was reported that he had several dozen grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He was also ranked as the sixth-oldest living verified person in the world, the second-oldest man and World War I veteran behind only del Toro and the last African American one. Although he suffered from mild dementia in his later years, he was reported to have been completely lucid through his final days and his death was attributed to natural causes.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{declared}} a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27, and <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> Alabama the following day; he authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action. The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared that a major disaster existed in Louisiana, officially authorizing FEMA to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort.|$|E
5|$|By September 5, the Salvation Army, Red Cross, {{and other}} {{organizations}} had served 100,000 meals to those displaced by the hurricane <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi,</b> <b>and</b> federal food stocks became available {{for the state to}} distribute to storm victims. Still, resources such as food and ice started to run short in the hardest-hit locations, and long lines formed at the first few stores and gas stations to reopen. With dwindling supplies, the Salvation Army had to procure food {{from other parts of the}} region to serve to victims. In the days after the hurricane, an increase in heart attack deaths in the Harrison County area was noted.|$|E

5|$|Gerolmo {{began work}} on the {{original}} script in 1985, after researching the 1964 murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner. He and producer Frederick Zollo took the script to Orion Pictures, and Parker was subsequently hired by the studio to direct the film. Both the writer and director had disputes over the script, which resulted in Orion allowing Parker to make uncredited rewrites. Principal photography commenced in March 1988 and concluded in May of that year with a budget of $15 million. The film was shot {{in a number of}} locales <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> Alabama.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{depression}} was forecast to move ashore as a minimal tropical storm, {{and the threat}} of {{the depression}} prompted state of emergency declarations <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> Louisiana. It was the first tropical cyclone to threaten the New Orleans area since Hurricane Katrina and the destructive 2005 hurricane season. Overall impact from the cyclone was minor and largely limited to light rainfall. However, the precursor system spawned a damaging tornado in Eustis, Florida, where 20houses were destroyed and 30more were damaged.|$|E

Payton proceeded to win the 1977 AP NFL Most Valuable Player Award and won Super Bowl XX with the 1985 Chicago Bears. He retired from football {{at the end of}} the 1987 season having rushed for at least 1,200 yards in 10 of his 13 seasons in the NFL.|$|E
5|$|Late on September 1, {{when the}} storm began to retrograde, {{hurricane}} warnings were reinstated westward along the coast to Grand Isle, Louisiana, as advisories along {{the west coast of}} the Florida Peninsula were allowed to expire. By the time officials lifted evacuation orders, the number of evacuees staying in shelters already decreased significantly due to the rampant eagerness and anxiety. Roughly 250,000 people in the Florida Panhandle, 175,000 in Alabama, 70,000 <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi,</b> <b>and</b> 50,000 in Louisiana—a total of 545,000—were ordered to leave. Several hundred thousand of the people affected by the new string of evacuation orders had also been forced to leave just days earlier, and in extreme cases had one day or less reprieve. Governor Graham's office reported that during the entire storm event, 1.25 million people from Florida evacuated at some point, and state police in Louisiana estimated that figure in their state to be around 400,000. In total, nearly 2 million people fled the storm over its entire course.|$|E
5|$|Outer rainbands began {{affecting}} coastal {{sections of}} the Florida Panhandle by about 12hours prior {{to the formation of}} the depression. Coinciding with the first advisory on the depression, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning from Apalachicola, Florida, westward to the mouth of the Mississippi River. Shortly thereafter, an inland tropical storm warning was issued for Pearl River, Walthall, and Pike counties <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> Washington Parish in Louisiana. Additionally, the New Orleans National Weather Service issued a coastal flood watch for four parishes in southeastern Louisiana. In Mississippi, Governor Haley Barbour {{declared a state of emergency}}. Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for residents in shallow areas and in mobile homes for Jackson, Harrison, and Hancock counties. Officials in New Orleans opened three emergency shelters, citing the potential need of shelter for citizens in about 17,000FEMA trailers after Hurricane Katrina. Due to the threat of the cyclone, Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco declared a state of emergency and placed the state's National Guard and other disaster services on reserve.|$|E

5|$|Over 13,000 {{homes were}} damaged <b>in</b> <b>Mississippi,</b> <b>and</b> 200 were destroyed. Cities {{close to the}} Alabama border—including Pascagoula—experienced {{widespread}} damage to residences, schools, and businesses, and the community of Gautier was effectively isolated from the outside world. Several apparent but unconfirmed tornadoes appear to have exacerbated the damage in the Gulfport area. Wind damage extended into portions of eastern Louisiana. Overall, nine people {{died as a result}} of the hurricane: two in Texas due to drownings in rip currents, three in Florida, two in Louisiana, one in Arkansas, and one in a maritime accident in the Gulf of Mexico. Damage totaled about $1.3 billion, and power outages from the storm affected 550,000 people. In Elena's wake, President Ronald Reagan declared parts of Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida federal disaster areas, making storm victims eligible for financial aid and temporary housing. The name Elena was later retired from the cyclical list of Atlantic hurricane names because of the storm's effects.|$|E
