40|$|ZigBee-style {{networks}} {{began to}} be conceived around 1999, when many installers realized that both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth {{were going to be}} unsuitable for some industrial applications. In particular, many engineers saw a need for self-organizing ad-hoc <b>digital</b> <b>radio</b> <b>networks.</b> The real need for mesh has been cast in doubt since that, in particular as mesh is largely absent in the market. ZigBee protocols are intended for embedded applications requiring low data rates and low power consumption. The resulting network will use very small amounts of power — individual devices must have a battery life of at least two years to pass ZigBee certification. Typical application areas include: automation, advanced temperature control, safety and security, wireless sensor networks, industrial control-embedded sensing. ZigBee devices find applications in corrosion monitoring also such as corrosion fatigue, strain in concrete structures and linear polarization resistance sensors...|$|R
