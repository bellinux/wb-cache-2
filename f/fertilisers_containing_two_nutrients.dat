40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate whether dietary essential oils could affect growth performance, relative organ weights, cecal microflora, immune responses and blood profiles of broiler chickens fed on diets containing different nutrient densities. A total of eight hundred-forty 1 -d-old male broiler chicks were randomly allotted into twenty-eight pens (7 pens per treatment, 30 chicks per pen). There were four experimental diets <b>containing</b> <b>two</b> different <b>nutrient</b> densities and supplemented with or without essential oils. Experimental period lasted for 35 days. No clear interaction between nutrient density and essential oils on any of growth performance-related parameters was observed. Live body weights were affected (p< 0. 05) by nutrient density at 21 days and by dietary essential oils at 35 days. Essential oils significantly (p< 0. 05) increased daily body weight gain and feed conversion ratio during the periods of 22 to 35 and 1 to 35 days, but failed to affect feed intake during the entire experimental period. Daily weight gain at 1 to 21 days and feed intake at 1 to 21 and 1 to 35 days were significantly impaired (p< 0. 05) by nutrient density. There were significant treatment interactions (p< 0. 05) on relative weights of bursa of Fabricius and abdominal fat contents. Finally, either essential oil or nutrient density did not influence the relative percentages of breast and leg meats, the population of cecal microflora, blood parameters and antibody titers against Newcastle disease and infectious bronchitis in broiler chickens. It was concluded that dietary essential oils, independent to nutrient density, failed to stimulate feed intake, but increased growth performance in broiler chickens...|$|R
500|$|From trials {{carried out}} by a {{commercial}} Nepenthes nursery, it appears that micronutrient solutions have [...] "a beneficial effect on plants of improved leaf colouration, with no deleterious effects" [...] as far as can be seen. However, more research is required to verify these results. Actual <b>fertilisers</b> (<b>containing</b> NPK) were, on the other hand, found to [...] "cause damage to plants, promote pathogens and have no observable benefits". Hence, the use of chemical fertilisers is usually not advised.|$|R
50|$|Phosphorus is {{required}} by all plants but is limited in soil, creating a problem in agriculture. In many areas phosphorus must be added to soil for the extensive plant growth that is desired for crop production. Phosphorus was first added as a fertilizer {{in the form of}} single super phosphate (SSP) in the mid-nineteenth century, following research at Rothamsted Experimental Station in England. SSP is non-nitrogen <b>fertiliser</b> <b>containing</b> Phosphate in the form of monocalcium phosphate and Gypsum which is best suited for Alkali soils to supplement Phosphate and reduce soil alkalinity.|$|R
40|$|Canola (Brassica napus) {{has become}} a major crop grown in {{rotation}} with spring wheat and lupins in Western Australia (WA) since the mid 1990 s. Most soils in WA are highly weathered with very low levels of phosphorus (P). The WA soils initially contained adequate indigenous soil potassium (K) for cropping but removal of K over time in the harvested grains has gradually resulted in the some soils becoming deficient in K for grain production. The sulphur (S) status of WA soils was maintained when single superphosphate (containing about 11 per cent S) was widely used as P fertiliser. The increased and widespread use of <b>fertilisers</b> <b>containing</b> lower S levels than single superphosphate, such as DAP and MAP is likely to increase S deficiency in canola. Furthermore, S deficiency has more frequently been identified in canola crops (compared with wheat and lupins). Consequently <b>fertilisers</b> <b>containing</b> P, K and S are now applied to most canola crops. Fertiliser costs represent {{a significant part of the}} variable costs of growing crops in WA. Chen et al. (2009) identified the need for improved soil test interpretation for making fertiliser recommendations due to substantial changes in farming systems, fertiliser practices and crop yield potential since earlier calibrations were developed. The aims of this study were (1) to compile experimental data containing the standard soil test measurements and observed canola crop yield responses for both nil and fertilised treatments across different soil types and seasons from published or unpublished sources, and (2) to critically analyse soil test-crop response relationships to derive better critical soil test values in soils and environments suitable for canola grain production in WA...|$|R

2500|$|Phosphorus is an {{essential}} plant nutrient (often the limiting nutrient), and the bulk of all phosphorus production is in concentrated phosphoric acids for agriculture <b>fertilisers,</b> <b>containing</b> as much as 70% to 75% P2O5. Its annual demand is rising nearly {{twice as fast as}} the growth of the human population. That led to large increase in phosphate (PO43−) production {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Artificial phosphate fertilisation is necessary because phosphorus is essential to all life organisms, natural phosphorus-bearing compounds are mostly insoluble and inaccessible to plants, and the natural cycle of phosphorus is very slow. [...] Fertiliser is often in the form of superphosphate of lime, a mixture of calcium dihydrogen phosphate (Ca(H2PO4)2), and calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4·2H2O) produced reacting sulfuric acid and water with calcium phosphate.|$|R
40|$|Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a {{well known}} chemopreventive {{nutrient}} within diet formulations, {{but it may also}} exert toxic effects on cultured cells, while this is limited when also another relevant nutrient as vitamin E is present. This effect, beside the involvement of the <b>two</b> <b>nutrients</b> in oxidative processes, likely affects the expression of specific genes. To obtain information on combined activities of DHA and vitamin E on some gene products previously resulted to be in vivo regulated from dietary unsaturated fats, the effect of the <b>two</b> <b>nutrients</b> was evaluated in human cell line HepG 2. Independently, DHA and vitamin E resulted to affect only slightly UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 A 1 (UGT 1 A 1) mRNA expression. Nevertheless, their combination produced a considerable reduction of this mRNA. DHA also downregulated stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP- 1) expression, while vitamin E did not affect these products. However, their combination abolished the downregulation of SCD but did not affect that of SREBP- 1. Therefore the effect of the <b>two</b> <b>nutrients</b> is related to specific gene regulation processes resulting in a cooperation which might be related to their physiological effects as dietary components...|$|R
40|$|My {{thesis is}} divided into two main parts. The first part is focused on the {{properties}} of phosphorous and nitrogen that are most important in the eutrophication process, while {{the second part of the}} thesis presents the specifics of the water basin Jezero in Smarjeske Toplice. The first part of the thesis describes the problem of pollution with nutrients in the aquatic environment - eutrophication. Eutrophication is caused by excessive nutrient concentrations in the aquatic environment, which is limited by the lack of one of the <b>two</b> presented <b>nutrients</b> in this thesis. The thesis is focused on <b>two</b> <b>nutrients,</b> namely phosphorus and nitrogen. The thesis presents the basic properties for phosphorus and nitrogen and the circulation of these <b>two</b> <b>nutrients</b> in the environment. It also lists and describes the main anthropogenic activities, which contribute the largest share of these nutrients into the environment. In its next chapters the thesis presents the chemical and biological processes, removal of phosphorus and nitrogen, and some common technologies developed for the purpose of disposing these <b>two</b> <b>nutrients</b> from water. Then it presents some assumptions and actions for reducing the impact of these <b>two</b> <b>nutrients</b> on the environment in the future. The first part of the thesis is concluded with the use of nutrients in Slovenian agriculture in order to improve the productivity of its agricultural land. The second part of the thesis delivers a presentation of the largest water basin in the Dolenjska region – water basin Jezero in Šmarješke Toplice. It describes the legislation, regarding water resources on the European, state and municipal level. It also presents the ways of determining water protection areas, their different variations and its limits and restrictions. There is also a calculation of nutrient concentration in the underground waters in this specific area. The final part of the thesis is a product of collaboration with Komunala Novo mesto. It presents their plans for improving quantitative and qualitative properties of the water that is pumped from the water basin Jezero...|$|R
40|$|Micronutrient disorders, {{especially}} B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, {{have been}} recorded for eucalypts in nearly all the geographical regions where commercial plantations have been established. Whilst micronutrient disorders are often induced by the application of <b>fertilisers</b> <b>containing</b> only macronutrients, instances of primary B deficiency in China and Cu deficiency in Australia have been recently documented. Increasing records of micronutrient disorders in plantation eucalypts suggests that the capacity of micronutrients to limit productivity has not been adequately recognised in the past. Dramatic growth responses can occur with corrective fertilisation particularly where a micronutrient deficiency has been debilitating for growth. However, where deficiencies of elements have resulted in severe crown dieback and loss of form, {{it is very difficult}} to restart growth with good form. This paper describes the visual impact of micronutrient disorders on eucalypts in plantations, their effect on wood production and wood quality, and explores strategies for micronutrient management...|$|R

40|$|Manures are an {{inevitable}} consequence of livestock in agriculture. They represent a valuable source of nutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus and potassium. The industrial production of <b>fertilisers</b> <b>containing</b> these elements {{is associated with}} finite resources and this alone justifies a proper recycling of manures. The N fertiliser replacement value (NFRV) of manures is still insufficiently appreciated and exploited. Mineral fertiliser N supplementation is thus unnecessarily large, to the potential detriment of the environment. The present paper reviews methods to correctly assess the NFRV of manures and presents measures to increase the NFRV. When proper attention {{is given to the}} composition of manures and decisions on rates, timing and application methods are made accordingly, the relative NFRV of manures could rise from the present 20 - 50 percent to 80 percent. This could lead to a further reduction of mineral N fertiliser use, N surpluses and pollution. Under these conditions, 'manure', 'precision farming' and 'environment' should no longer be a contradiction in term...|$|R
