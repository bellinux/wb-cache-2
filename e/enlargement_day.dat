40|$|Since {{fossil fuels}} are {{expected}} to run out within few decades, attention has increasingly been focused on renewable energy sources, including microalgae. Neochloris oleoabundans (Chlorophyta) has a capability to accumulate lipids, in particular triacylglycerols (TAG), useful for biodiesel production; furthermore, it can grow mixotrophically. The present work deals with two fundamental steps of mixotrophic cultivation with glucose (late exponential – 6 days – and late stationary – 14 days – phases of growth), focusing {{on the relationship between}} photosynthesis and lipid production. Results confirmed that the use of glucose induces a high biomass productivity, which is associated to a rapid cell replication until day 6 followed by cell <b>enlargement</b> until <b>day</b> 14. At day 6, mixotrophic cells contained numerous stromatic starch grains, while at day 14 lipids were highly accumulated and starch tended to reduce. Photosynthetic pigment and protein content decreased under mixotrophy. The degree of photoinhibition under high light was not significantly affected by mixotrophic cultivation at both experimental times. The creation of a reducing environment due to the photosynthetic activity, together with alterations of N:C ratio, promoted the lipid synthesis. Neutral lipids increased under mixotrophy and oleic acid was the major component, while linolenic acid decreased; these aspects match requirements for biodiesel production...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Many parasites {{have strong}} {{negative}} impacts on their hosts, but {{the effects of}} single-host, non-trophically transmitted parasites can be subtle and are not well understood. We examined the physiolog-ical response of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) to encystment by the parasitic larvae (glochidia) of the freshwater pearl mussel, Margaritifera margaritifera. Glochidia abundance was positively correlated to host body size and was accompanied by significant spleen <b>enlargement</b> at 31 <b>days</b> postexposure, but not before (15 days) or after (160 days). Compared to controls, encysted gill lamellae were significantly thicker and longer, and tended to have fewer mucous cells which may have facilitated encystment. There were no signif-icant difference in mean blood haematocrit between encysted and uninfected trout, but encysted trout took c. 6 h longer to reach basal ventilation rate than controls suggesting that glochidiosis may impose a respiratory burden to brown trout. These findings may have implications for the artificial propagation of the fresh-water pearl mussel because the effects of glochidia on host respiratory performance appear to be additive. Therefore, aiming for high glochidia loads {{may not be the}} best option for mussel propagation programmes, if this compromises host fitness and hence the probability of successful glochidia excystment...|$|R

MÉTODO: Foram avaliados 75 ratos divididos em dois grupos, papaína (N= 50) e controle (N= 25), submetidos à instilação intratraqueal de papaína e solução fisiológica, respectivamente. Os animais foram sacrificados 30, 60, 90, 120 ou 180 dias após a instilação. Foi realizada gasometria do sangue arterial, análise morfométrica dos pulmões e coração. RESULTADOS: A instilação de papaína produziu destruição do tecido {{alveolar}}, mimetizando alterações morfológicas encontradas no enfisema pulmonar, com diâmetro alveolar médio maior no grupo papaína em relação ao controle em todos os momentos avaliados (p OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to evaluate the occurrence and repercussions of chemically induced pulmonary emphysema and the morphological alterations present in rats' hearts of post-induction and to follow the progression afterwards. METHOD: Seventy five rats divided into two groups: papain (N= 50) and control (N= 25), were submitted to intratracheal instillation of papain and saline solution, respectively, and were evaluated. The animals were sacrificed 30, 60, 90, 120 or 180 days post-instillation. Arterial blood gases and cardiac and pulmonary morphometrical analysis were performed. RESULTS: Papain instillation produced alveolar tissue destruction similar to the morphological alterations observed in pulmonary emphysema. The papain group presented mean alveolar diameter higher than controls in all periods evaluated (p< 0. 05). Right ventricle wall thickness and interventricular septum did not show significant macroscopic alterations until six months after emphysema induction. The right ventricle area presented <b>enlargement</b> 120 <b>days</b> after induction of the pulmonary emphysema, with mean area higher than control at 120 e 180 days (p= 0. 001). The left ventricle presented significant cavity area decrease 90 days after induction of the pulmonary emphysema, followed by slight wall thickening. CONCLUSIONS: The adopted experimental model was efficient to morphologically induce the pulmonary emphysema. The presence of pulmonary emphysema did not provoke morphological changes in the right ventricle wall and interventricular septum.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{metabolism}} of {{pyrrolizidine alkaloids}} {{and other drugs}} was studied with regard to nutritional status and species differences. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are biotransformed to severely toxic metabolites were isolated from tansy ragwort (Senecio jacobaea). Semi-purified alkaloid crystals containing five alkaloids (senecionine, seneciophylline, jacobine, jacoline, and jacozine) were prepared and found {{to be free of}} N-oxide and dihydropyrrolizidine bases. Liver changes occurring with time resulting from a single administration (i. p.) of the alkaloidal preparation were studied. Of the mixed-function oxidases, alkaloid dehydrogenase was inhibited immediately (one hour) and recovered slowly. Inhibition coincided well with levels of liver bound pyrrole. On the other hand, cytochrome P- 450, N-demethylase, and microsomal protein all were significantly depressed after one day but were normal by six days. N-demethylase activity was significantly elevated and liver pyrrole negligible by 57 <b>days.</b> A transient <b>enlargement</b> (six <b>days)</b> of the spleen was also observed. In a second experiment, one hour after a subacute dose of alkaloid, liver sulfhydryls were mildly depleted. A wide range of alkaloid dehydrogenase activities in different species was demonstrated. Nonogastric herbivores (4 amster and rabbit) were highest followed by monogastric species (mouse and rat), ruminant species (cattle and sheep), and avian species (chickens and Japanese quail). With the exception of rabbits and chickens, pyrrole production in vitro generally correlates to the susceptibility of the species resulting from the fed plant. Chronic administration (12 days) of excess levels of selenium, copper, and vitamin A was studied using rats. High selenium caused a significant increase in liver weight, but had no effect on microsomal oxidases. Similarly, high copper had no effect on the oxidases. High vitamin A increased alkaloid dehydrogenase, aniline hydroxylas,:, and liver weight although the effects were not significant. In a separate experiment, rats pretreated with above-normal levels of selenium for five days were less susceptible to acute intoxication from tansy alkaloids. However, fewer of the pretreated animals survived (three weeks) the overall effect. In second-generation-selenium (SGS) deficient rats, low blood glutathione peroxidase (GPXase), poor growth, alopecia, and cataracts were observed. In males, low plasma testosterone and low microsomal protein were concurrent with low levels of microsomal N-demethylase, hydroxylase, and reductase. Alkaloid dehydrogenase was not affected by the deficiency. In SGS-deficient females, neither microsomal protein nor mixed-function oxidase activity was affected. However, phenobarbital treatment (induction) resulted in a greater increase in liver weight and a lesser increase in microsomal protein and alkaloid dehydrogenase in deficient animals. Pentobarbital sleeping time was not different in SGS-deficient males and females. In male rats fed a selenium-deficient diet for 11 months, body weight and blood GPXase were significantly lower. Mild alopecia, immotile sperm, and lower plasma testosterone were observed in some animals. N-demethylase (significantly) and hydroxylase (nonsignificantly) were less active. Phenobarbital treatment of deficient animals resulted in a greater increase in liver size and a substantially lesser increase in alkaloid dehydrogenase and cytochrome P- 450 activity. Mixed-function oxidase activity was studied in selenium-deficient chickens and white-muscle diseased lambs. In chickens, the torula yeast diet produced poor growth and diarrhea. The selenium deficiency was without effect on the microsomal oxidases. All the oxidases were consistently less active in chickens fed a standard diet. In lambs receiving comparable levels of selenium and demonstrating similar GPXase activity, some were stricken with whitemuscle disease. Microsomal oxidases were consistently lower in the diseased individuals...|$|R
30|$|The {{dispersion}} of Fe 3 O 4 NPs exhibited a light brown color, which turned into dark green after forming PB nanoshells followed by PEI coating, while the FPPI NPs displayed a celadon color. XRD characterization {{was applied to}} analyze the crystalline structure of Fe 3 O 4 NPs, Fe 3 O 4 @PB NPs, and FPPI NPs (Fig.  2 e). The XRD pattern of Fe 3 O 4 NPs revealed characteristic peaks at 30.5 °, 35.8 °, 43.5 °, 54 °, and 57.5 ° {{in accordance with the}} XRD standard card (JCPDS No. 85 - 1436), indicating a typical crystalline spine ferrite Fe 3 O 4 phase. Additionally, the characteristic peaks of 17.5 °, 24.7 °, 35.5 °, 39.7 °, 43.5 °, 51.2 °, 54.3 °, and 57.5 ° were found in PB nanocrystals, corresponding to the XRD standard card (JCPDS No. 73 - 0687). The resultant FPPI NPs showed all these characteristic peaks of Fe 3 O 4 and PB nanocrystals without peaks of impurity, suggesting the successful synthesis of FPPI NPs with both crystalline orientations. The Vis–NIR spectra showed strong and broad optical absorbance of FPPI NPs at 700 – 900  nm (Fig.  2 f), suggesting its remarkable potential as a photothermal agent. Particularly, typical absorbance peaks were observed at 780 and 890  nm in accordance with the absorbance peaks of free ICG at 710 and 785  nm. The redshifted absorbance peaks could be due to the formation of ICG dimers or oligomers, also known as J-aggregates [40]. The intensity of optical absorbance was positively correlated with the NPs concentration, indicating their good dispersibility in the aqueous condition (Fig.  2 g). A similar optical absorbance effect of FPPI NPs was observed when dispersed in 1 [*]×[*]PBS, DMEM culture medium, and 10 % FBS (Fig. S 4). Additionally, we monitored the hydrodynamic size variation of FPPI NPs over a prolonged incubation time up to 7  days, where their size did not show notable <b>enlargement</b> until <b>day</b> 6 (Fig.  2 h). These characterizations suggested good stability of FPPI NPs, which would benefit their long-term circulation in the body and thereby enhance the bioavailability in tumor regions. In another aspect, the fluorescence emission of FPPI NPs was measured at an excitation wavelength of 765  nm under aqueous conditions. The fluorescence intensity at 795  nm increased linearly with the concentration of FPPI NPs, doubly confirming their good aqueous dispersibility. In addition, FT-IR spectrometry of the key components (Fe 3 O 4, PB and ICG) was performed to verify the chemical constitution of FPPI NPs (Fig.  2 i). Fe 3 O 4 showed strong absorption near 603 and 1620  cm− 1 ascribed to the Fe–O and H–O–H vibration, respectively [41]. The PB had characteristic peaks near 2071 and 1625  cm− 1, corresponding to the bridge vibration of C–N bending in the Fe 2 +–CN–Fe 3 + and H–O–H stretch, respectively [42]. Additionally, typical peaks at 900 – 1100 and 1400 – 1500  cm− 1 of ICG molecules were attributed to the vinyl stretches and C=C stretches, respectively [43]. The FT-IR spectrum of the final product contained the above characteristic peaks of Fe 3 O 4, PB, and ICG, which further confirmed the successful synthesis of FPPI nanocomposites. ICG loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency in FPPI NPs were calculated as 7.01 % and 69.74 %, respectively. Not surprisingly, the high encapsulation efficiency of ICG was attributed to the strong electrostatic interactions between ICG and PEI. Moreover, less than 10 % of the ICG molecules were leaked from FPPI NPs after a 12 -h incubation in PBS (pH[*]=[*] 7.4 or 6.8), indicating a strong and stable ICG adsorption on FPPI NPs. Additionally, there was no apparent change in the fluorescence spectrum before and after the NIR laser irradiation, verifying the fluorescence stability of the conjugated ICG (Fig. S 5).|$|R
40|$|Differential {{response}} of glomerular epithelial and mesangial cells after subtotal nephrectomy. Recent studies in {{both human and}} experimental chronic renal disease {{suggest that there is}} a linkage between glomerular hypertrophy and glomerulosclerosis. To further define these relationships, we studied the changes in glomerular hypertrophy, procollagen α 1 (IV) mRNA levels and glomerulosclerosis in rats undergoing 12 / 3 nephrectomy (Nx) or sham nephrectomy (SNx). Glomerular hypertrophy, measured biochemically by RNA/DNA and protein/DNA ratios, was significantly increased in Nx compared to SNx two days after subtotal renal ablation (RNA/DNA: Nx = 133 ± 8 %, SNx = 100 ± 3 % of the mean control value, P < 0. 01; protein/DNA: Nx = 164 ± 22 %, SNx = 100 ± 10 %, P < 0. 05) and remained elevated after 7 and 15 days (RNA/DNA: seven days Nx = 155 ± 3 %, SNx = 100 ± 13 %, P < 0. 01; 15 days Nx = 303 ± 21 %, SNx = 100 ± 24 %, P < 0. 001; protein/DNA: seven days Nx = 228 ± 57 %, SNx = 100 ± 18 %, P < 0. 05; 15 days Nx = 341 ± 23 %, SNx = 100 ± 18 %, P < 0. 01). Light microscopic measures of glomerular tuft volume (GTV) were too insensitive to detect glomerular <b>enlargement</b> until 15 <b>days</b> postoperatively, but GTV measured ultrastructurally demonstrated a 20 % increment in Nx compared to SNx as early as two days postoperatively (P < 0. 01). The latter increment in GTV was due exclusively to glomerular visceral epithelial cell (GVEC) expansion. Glomerular procollagen α 1 (IV) mRNA levels were significantly elevated only 15 days after nephrectomy (Nx = 265 ± 58 % of the mean control value, SNx = 100 ± 12 %, P < 0. 05; corrected for β-actin mRNA levels). At this time, exuberant mesangial expansion measured ultrastructurally contributed to a 1. 6 ± 0. 1 -fold increase in GTV (P < 10 - 5), and to a relative decrement in the GVEC contribution to glomerular cells plus matrix (P < 0. 01). Segmental sclerosis was observed only 15 days postoperatively in Nx (Nx = 1. 3 ± 0. 4 % of glomeruli evaluated, SNx = 0. 0 %, P < 0. 05), and there was a strong correlation between the prevalence of segmental sclerosis and the procollagen α 1 (IV) mRNA levels in Nx at 15 days (r = 0. 93, P < 0. 01). There was no significant correlation between the RNA/DNA and protein/DNA ratios and procollagen α 1 (IV) mRNA levels. Thus, glomerular regions responded differentially to subtotal nephrectomy. Early epithelial cell expansion was followed by later mesangial expansion. Glomerular procollagen α 1 (IV) mRNA levels were elevated only during the second (mesangial) phase of glomerular hypertrophy, when it correlated with glomerulosclerosis, but not during the initial (epithelial) phase, a pattern consistent with a mesangial origin of the procollagen α 1 (IV) mRNA...|$|R
40|$|A implantação do ureter no cólon descendente advém da impossibilidade de reimplantá-lo na vesícula urinária, devido a perdas substanciais do tecido {{ureteral}}. O presente trabalho avaliou as alterações macroscópicas, microscópicas e laboratoriais em cães submetidos à ureterocoloanastomose esquerda. Foram utilizados 8 cães adultos, hígidos, de ambos os sexos. A técnica operatória consistiu na ligadura do coto distal do ureter próximo à bexiga e na implantação de um curto seg- mento do coto proximal, através de um túnel submucoso, na face antimesentérica do cólon. Realizou-se dosagens séricas de uréia, creatinina, sódio e potássio no pré-operatório, 2, 7, 15 e 30 dias após a cirurgia. Um total de 6 animais foram observados por 30 dias, e outros dois foram observados durante 7 e 180 dias, res- pectivamente. Todos apresentaram fezes moles durante o decorrer do experimento. Ao exame macroscópico, todos os animais apresentaram dilatação ureteral e pielonefrites. Azotemia transitória e hidronefrose foram observadas no animal mantido por 7 dias, e em mais quatro animais, mantidos por 30 dias, também se observou hidronefrose. O animal mantido por 180 dias demonstrou hidronefrose ao exame ultrasono gráfico aos 30 dias de evolução, mas a mesma não foi observada quando se realizou a necropsia. Em um animal, mantido por 30 dias, houve um aumento nos níveis de creatinina nos dias 7, 15 e 30, entretanto estes permaneceram dentro dos limites fisiológicos. Nenhuma alteração foi observada no exame histológico da mucosa intestinal exposta à drenagem de urina. As poucas alterações encontradas nas análises laboratoriais não comprometeram a saúde dos animais, e, {{considerando que}} não foram encontradas lesões na mucosa intestinal analisada, é possível concluir que a ureterocoloanastomose é um procedimento viável para ser usada por um curto período de tempo. Ureters implantation into the colon is na alternative procedure when great losses of ureteral tissue occur becaming impossible to reimplant {{them into the}} urinary bladder. The main {{purpose of this paper}} was to evaluate gross and histological lesions together with clinical pathology findings in dogs in wich experimental ureterocolonic anastomosis were performed. The surgery was done in 8 healthy adult males and females dogs using the following procedure: ligature of the left ureter distal stumps dose to the urinary bladder and submucous implantation of a proximal ureter short segment (tunneling technique) in the colon antimesenteric region. Serum urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium were measured just before and 2, 7, 15, and 30 days after the surgical procedure. Six animais were clinically observed during 30 days and the other two were observed during 7, and 180 days respectively. After the surgery, it was observed that ali animais had soft stool since the first <b>day.</b> <b>Enlargement</b> of the implanted ureter and pyelonephritis in the left kidney were observed in all animals.
