5|$|Prior to Bonnie moving ashore, 22,000people were {{evacuated}} in Texas and Louisiana. Upon making landfall, Hurricane Bonnie produced a storm surge peaking at 5.2feet (1.5m) at Sabine Pass. Rainfall {{from the storm}} peaked at 13 inches (330mm) in Ace, Texas, which caused some street flooding and destroyed a small dam in Liberty County, Texas. Three fatalities were reported in the Port Arthur, Texas area; two deaths were from separate car accidents and another occurred after a partially paralyzed woman died in a house <b>fire.</b> <b>Flooding</b> also impacted northwestern Louisiana. In the Shreveport area alone, 381homes, 20businesses, and 80major highway intersections were flooded. The hurricane also spawned 11 tornadoes, destroying about 25houses in southwestern Louisiana. Overall, Hurricane Bonnie caused $42 million (1986USD) in damage and five fatalities.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{enhanced}} recovery {{technologies such as}} water flooding, steam flooding, <b>fire</b> <b>flooding,</b> and polymer flooding were employed to increase the declining productivity of the field, and to reach and recover previously submarginal deposits.

5000|$|The {{advent of}} {{tertiary}} recovery techniques in the 1960s made possible another pulse of {{development of the}} field. In 1963, several cyclic steam projects commenced, followed by steam flooding, {{and in some cases}} <b>fire</b> <b>flooding</b> - all techniques for mobilizing heavy, viscous oil relatively close to the surface. [...] At the end of 2009, all of the cyclic steam and steam flood wells were reported to be shut in, while water flood and water disposal wells remained in use on the field.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>flooding</b> {{works best}} when the oil {{saturation}} and porosity are high. Combustion generates the heat within the reservoir itself. Continuous injection of air or other gas mixture with high oxygen content will maintain the flame front. As the fire burns, it {{moves through the}} reservoir toward production wells. Heat from the fire reduces oil viscosity and helps vaporize reservoir water to steam. The steam, hot water, combustion gas and a bank of distilled solvent all act to drive oil {{in front of the}} fire toward production wells.|$|E
50|$|Unlike many of {{the other}} major California oil fields, {{enhanced}} recovery methods have been used minimally at Kettleman Hills.

50|$|A safe deposit box, {{sometimes}} known erroneously as {{a safety}} deposit box, is an individually secured container, usually held within a larger safe or bank vault. Safe deposit boxes are generally located in banks, post offices or other institutions. Safe deposit boxes are used to store valuable possessions, such as gemstones, precious metals, currency, marketable securities, important documents (e.g. wills, property deeds, or birth certificates), or computer data, that need protection from theft, fire, flood, tampering, or other perils. In the United States, neither banks nor the FDIC insure the contents. An individual can purchase insurance for the safe deposit box in order to cover e.g. theft, <b>fire,</b> <b>flooding</b> or terrorist attacks.|$|E
50|$|Emergency {{preparedness}} and {{an emergency}} plan are crucial pieces {{to have in}} place for a museum.

These plans can be expansive, detailing a number of procedures for different contingencies, such as <b>fire,</b> <b>flooding,</b> and even war. Protective measures in an emergency plan should include prevention through risk management, preparedness and response training, and recovery arrangements. An institution should know which staff member's are delegated to a project during a given circumstance, and be able to tell them how they will assess and move forward {{with the help of an}} emergency plan.|$|E
50|$|Given {{the spatial}} {{arrangement}} of small populations in patchily distributed habitat across northern Australia, {{the species is}} potentially vulnerable to decline from loss of fairly small areas of habitat. The purple-crowned fairy-wren's greatest threat is degradation or loss of habitat from introduced herbivores, weeds, <b>fire,</b> <b>flooding</b> and mining. Introduced herbivores seeking water eat and trample riparian vegetation that purple-crowned fairy-wrens rely on for foraging, nesting and shelter. More frequent and/or more intense fires are detrimental as they can modify both the extent and structure of riparian vegetation. Interactions between climate change and habitat degradation are also likely, with the negative impacts of floods likely to be worse for populations living in degraded habitat.|$|E

50|$|Thermally {{enhanced}} oil recovery methods (TEOR) are tertiary recovery techniques that heat the oil, reducing its viscosity {{and making it}} easier to extract. Steam injection is {{the most common form of}} TEOR, and it is often done with a cogeneration plant. This type of cogeneration plant uses a gas turbine to generate electricity, and the waste heat is used to produce steam, which is then injected into the reservoir. This form of recovery is used extensively to increase oil extraction in the San Joaquin Valley, which yields a very heavy oil, yet accounts for ten percent of the United States' oil extraction. <b>Fire</b> <b>flooding</b> (In-situ burning) is another form of TEOR, but instead of steam, some of the oil is burned to heat the surrounding oil.|$|E
5000|$|Ecosystem {{health is}} a metaphor used to {{describe}} the condition of an ecosystem. Ecosystem condition can vary as a result of <b>fire,</b> <b>flooding,</b> drought, extinctions, invasive species, climate change, mining, overexploitation in fishing, farming or logging, chemical spills, {{and a host of other}} reasons. There is no universally accepted benchmark for a healthy ecosystem, rather the apparent health status of an ecosystem can vary depending upon which health metrics are employed in judging it [...] and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment. Advocates of the health metaphor argue for its simplicity as a communication tool. “Policy-makers and the public need simple, understandable concepts like health.” Critics worry that ecosystem health, a “value-laden construct,” is often “passed off as science to unsuspecting policy makers and the public.” ...|$|E
