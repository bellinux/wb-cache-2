He <b>disliked</b> Jane Hubbard, now out walking in the rain with Eustace Hignett. And he <b>disliked</b> Eustace.|$|R

5|$|A {{variety of}} new {{sketches}} were also added, including Sweaty Betty's Burger Bar and QCV' (Quite Cheap Value), a parody of the shopping channel QVC which saw Cawood and Suttie as fictitious presenters Hilary and Ursula, two garishly dressed middle aged women with a strong <b>dislike</b> for each other who would try to promote a useless product whilst making snide digs at each other underneath forced smiles and insincere laughter.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the effects of two types of narcissism on popularity in peer networks. Using data from four groups of well-acquainted students (N = 122), we investigated differential relations of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism with network centrality indicators of liking and <b>disliking.</b> Grandiose narcissists received a larger number of <b>disliking</b> nominations, indicating that they were actively <b>disliked</b> by their peers. In contrast, vulnerable narcissists were not actively <b>disliked,</b> but instead received fewer liking nominations. Both grandiose and vulnerable narcissists had a central position in terms of <b>disliking,</b> as they were <b>disliked</b> by otherwise unconnected network members. In all, these findings indicate that both forms of narcissism are unique predictors of unpopularity in peer-networks...|$|R

5|$|After {{the results}} of the first scrutiny, Cardinal Avila, Philip III of Spain's {{representative}} at the conclave, announced that Philip had vetoed Baronius. Baronius had critiqued the claims of Spanish monarchs in ecclesistical affairs in the volume of his Annales Ecclesiastici that had been published in 1605. This led the Spanish monarchy to have such an intense <b>dislike</b> for him that the publication of the volume which contained his criticism was banned in Spanish territory.|$|E
5|$|Charles finally {{allowed his}} sister to resign. She {{formally}} announced her decision on 24 September 1555 and dismissed her household on 1 October. On 25 October, her authority {{was transferred to}} Philip, who, despite his personal <b>dislike</b> of his aunt, tried to convince her to resume the post. After another quarrel with Philip, Mary retired to Turnhout. She remained in the Netherlands one more year.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play. Young men would gather around the gandingan and gossip about people they <b>dislike,</b> usually “chatting” with other gandingan players further away. Locals says {{much of this}} jovial talk even contained sexual innuendoes, where all kinds of dirty words could be heard penetrating the night air.|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{about other}} people's {{preferences}} {{is essential for}} successful social interactions, but what exactly are the driving factors that determine how well we can predict the likes and <b>dislikes</b> of people around us? To investigate the accuracy of couples' preference predictions we outline and empirically test three hypotheses: The positive valence hypothesis predicts that predictions for likes are more accurate than for <b>dislikes.</b> The negative valence hypothesis predicts the opposite, namely that <b>dislikes</b> are predicted more accurately than <b>dislikes.</b> The base rate hypothesis predicts that preference knowledge critically depends on the base rates of likes and <b>dislikes</b> within a given domain. In {{a series of studies}} we show that predicting likes over <b>dislikes</b> has relatively little effect compared with base rates. That is, accuracy is greater for relatively rare events regardless of whether they are liked or <b>disliked.</b> Our findings further suggest that when predicting preferences, people seem to rely on a combination of general, stereotypical knowledge of common preferences {{on the one hand and}} specific, idiosyncratic knowledge of rare preferences on the other...|$|R

5|$|Irish {{immigrants}} generally remained {{loyal to}} the Democratic Party, but McKinley's promises of sound money attracted German-Americans who were appalled by Bryan's inflationary proposals. German-Americans had long been Democratic; efforts by that party to rebut McKinley, including circulating a statement by Bismarck in support of bimetallism, were ineffective. Many Catholics and recent immigrants favored McKinley because of the <b>dislike</b> the American Protective Association had for him.|$|E

His <b>dislike</b> of the {{defensive}} nature of limited-over cricket led to the Australians placing a full slips cordon for the new ball and employing Test-match style tactics in the tournament.

Meanwhile, Shannon begins to have trouble breathing due to her lack of medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval.

5|$|Bolton's main rivals {{historically}} {{have been with}} near neighbours Bury, though this has lessened since the Second World War as the two clubs have rarely {{been in the same}} league. The club also has a rivalry with Blackburn Rovers, as the two sides are separated by just fifteen miles and are both founder members of the Football League. More recently, Bolton have developed an enmity with Wigan Athletic, whose fans generally regard Bolton as their main rivals. Bolton fans maintain a mutual <b>dislike</b> with the fans of Tranmere Rovers, Burnley, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E

40|$|A perceptual and {{acoustic}} characterization {{was provided}} on {{the expression of}} liking and <b>disliking</b> in the European Portuguese language. Thirty participants identified vocal patterns and judged the intensity of expressed affect in one-word items recorded by six untrained speakers. Listeners consistently associated vocal profiles with the two emotional patterns of liking and <b>disliking.</b> However, liking intonation was easier to recognize than <b>disliking</b> intonation. The feature most commonly associated with liking intonation was a wider and higher F 0 pattern and a rising-falling contour. For <b>disliking,</b> the results revealed a flatter melodic pattern with a fall into the stressed syllable yielding a low plateau. In sum, both prosodic patterns showed different and consistent correlates...|$|R
