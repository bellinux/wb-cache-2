2500|$|The heat {{produced}} by an incinerator {{can be used}} to generate steam which may then be used to drive a turbine in order to produce electricity. The typical amount of net energy that can be produced per tonne municipal waste is about 2/3MWh of electricity and 2MWh of district heating. Thus, incinerating about [...] per day of waste will produce about 400 MWh of electrical energy per day (17MW of electrical power continuously for 24 hours) and 1200MWh of district <b>heating</b> <b>energy</b> each day.|$|E
2500|$|The overall {{energy savings}} from {{changing}} to more efficient lighting {{depends on the}} climate. In warm climates, efficient lighting has the additional energy-saving effect of {{reducing the amount of}} cooling required. In cold climates increased <b>heating</b> <b>energy</b> demand may offset some of the lighting energy saved with efficient lighting. [...] A report published in January 2008 found that in Los Angeles, where incandescent lighting results in increased air conditioning, electricity savings would pay for the initial cost of CFLs four times faster than in Vancouver, where incandescent lighting contributes to space heating. In all climates, there is a net cost saving from changing to compact fluorescent lighting. The cost of CFL and LED bulbs has declined greatly since 2008, which shortens the time needed to pay off their initial cost.|$|E

2500|$|A {{thermal power}} station is a power station in which <b>heat</b> <b>energy</b> is {{converted}} to electric power. [...] In most of the {{places in the world}} the turbine is steam-driven.
