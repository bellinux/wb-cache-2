50|$|Plates can be {{mechanically}} roughened; {{one way is}} to rub fine {{metal filings}} over the surface with a piece of glass; the finer the filings, the smaller the grain of the surface. Special <b>roughening</b> <b>tools</b> called 'rockers' have been in use since at least the eighteenth century. The method commonly in use today is to use a steel rocker approximately five inches wide, which has between 45 and 120 teeth per inch on the face of a blade {{in the shape of a}} shallow arc, with a wooden handle projecting upwards in a T-shape. Rocked steadily from side to side at the correct angle, the rocker will proceed forward creating burrs in the surface of the copper. The plate is then moved - either rotated by a set number of degrees or through 90 degrees according to preference - and then rocked in another pass. This is repeated until the plate is roughened evenly and will print a completely solid tone of black.|$|R

We also analyze red cone opsins in the chromatophore-containing family of chameleons, snakes, zebrafish and goldfish, where short- and long-range (BLAST and hydropathic) aa correlations are found with values as large as 97 - 99 %.

However, progenies of this variety obtained from selfed and open pollinated flowers have not, as observed to date, produced plants with characteristic rugose <b>or</b> definitely <b>roughened</b> leaves. This lack of rugose leaves in the seedling progeny of the variety rugosa led to the present cytological investigation to determine whether rugose leaves {{might be due to}} differences in the polyploid nature of the component leaf layers. Chromosome counts were made in cells of tissue obtained from root tips of seedlings and from root tips from stem cuttings, and from very young leaf buds. Chromosomes were also counted in the microsporocytes and in the microspores. The results of the cytological observations indicate that in the plant tissues examined there was an average number of 44 chromosomes. The counting of chromosomes in the coffee leaf buds was difficult due to the small size of the chromosomes. Observations also showed that microsporogenesis in the variety rugosa was normal and that the microspores contained 22 chromosomes. The results of this investigation show that Coffea arabica L. var. rugosa is a tetraploid plant, as are several other varieties of C. arabica that have been studied. The cytological observations also show that the rugose or rough condition of the leaves is not due to the presence of tissue layers of different polyploid nature...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Cardiovascular device-centered {{infections are}} {{a major cause of}} {{hospital}} morbidity, mortality, and expense. Caused by opportunistic bacteria, this phenomenon is thought to arise because of a defect in neutrophil bacterial killing. We have shown that neutrophils that adhere to polystyrene remain viable, whereas neutrophils that adhere to the vascular biomaterials expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and Dacron undergo a rapid nonapoptotic death. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that surface topography is a determinant of the nonapoptotic death response of neutrophils to biomaterials. Methods: We took advantage of the ease with which a polystyrene surface can be manipulated to examine the effect of surface topography on neutrophil viability. Neutrophils were exposed to smooth <b>or</b> <b>roughened</b> polystyrene surfaces both in vivo and in vitro. Changes in cell membrane permeability and production of reactive oxygen species by individual cells were monitored with fluorescent dyes. Results: Host cells and isolated human neutrophils died rapidly after adhesion to roughened polystyrene. Neutrophils adherent to roughened surfaces produced more reactive oxygen intermediates than those adherent to smooth surfaces and were first to die. The cell death response precipitated by expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, Dacron, <b>or</b> the <b>roughened</b> surfaces was significantly reduced with treatment of the neutrophils with catalase, diphenylene iodonium, or the src kinase inhibitor PP 2 before adhesion. Conclusions: Neutrophil adhesion to roughened materials triggers rapid production of reactive oxygen species and precipitates a nonapoptotic cell death. Understanding the material properties that trigger these responses is essential to development of the next generation of implantable biomaterials. (J Vasc Surg 2003; 37 : 1082 - 90. ...|$|R

It appeared to be possible to remove the multilayer coating, including the SRL, without any damage <b>or</b> <b>roughening</b> of the substrate surface. The SRL was spin-coated at 1500 to 6000 rpm on different substrate types (Si, quartz, Zerodur) with diameters up to 100 mm. For this range of parameters, the multilayer centroid wavelength value remained unchanged, and its reflectivity loss on applying the SRL was limited typically to 0. 7 %. The latter was shown to be caused by a minor increase of the SRL surface roughness in the high-spatial-frequency domain. The roughness, characterized with an atomic force microscope, remained constant at 0. 2 nm during all stages of the substrate recovery process, independent of the initial substrate roughness.
