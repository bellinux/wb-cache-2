40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the question of}} the relationship between private labour regulation and workers' capacity to take collective action through the lens of an empirical study of the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) 'performance standards' system of social and <b>environmental</b> <b>conditionality.</b> The study covered some 150 IFC client businesses in four world regions, drawing on data made public by the IFC as well as the results of a dedicated field survey that gathered information directly from workers, managers and union representatives. The study found that the application of the performance standards system has had remarkably little impact on union membership and social dialogue. In those few cases where change could be causally linked to the standards, the effect depended on the presence of workers' organizations that already had the capacity to take effective action on behalf of their members. The study also uncovered some prima facie evidence of breaches of freedom of association rights occurring with no reaction from IFC. The study concludes that the lack of impact is largely due to the private contractual structure that supposedly guarantees standards compliance...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} Regulation (EU) No 1307 / 2013 of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council, a new component, i. e. the {{greening}} payment, has been included into the Union direct support scheme rendering direct support conditional upon applying by farmers the compulsory agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment. The legal nature of the greening payment and consequences of noncomplying with the set obligations are being analyzed. The new <b>environmental</b> <b>conditionality</b> of direct support is considered by referring to the existing system of the cross-compliance principle. The requirement of farmer’s declaration on compliance with the environmental obligation already at the stage of application for payment {{should be seen as}} an important achievement on the path of setting a compulsory link between the common agricultural policy and the environmental policy of the Union; numerous exceptions from applying environmental practices might however weaken the system.

40|$|Magister Educationis - MEdThis study {{investigates the}} factors that {{conditioned}} the establishment of, and responses to, a centrally coordinated, institution wide change initiative aimed at promoting equity in the academic workplace in an historically white South African university. It is examined by presenting two kinds of analyses, firstly, an institutional analysis that explores the <b>environmental</b> and managerial <b>conditionalities</b> that influenced the reception, interpretation and responses to the national policy framework. Secondly, a bottom-up analysis that explores the distinctive disciplinary contexts that conditioned {{the responses of the}} participants. The study reveals that top-down approaches to managing change have limited capacity to influence the nature and pace of change on the ground, despite the best intentions of institutional managers. The study illustrates that the distinctive disciplinary context conditioned the responses to, and outcomes of the change initiative. In this study, the authority of the academic project powerfully trumps the legitimacy and credibility of the institutional transformation initiative...|$|R
30|$|PES is a market-based scheme whose {{concept is}} {{based on the premise that}} those who provide {{environmental}} services (managers or sellers) by conserving natural ecosystems are compensated or incentivized by those who benefit from the services (the buyers). The term PES is used broadly aiming at ES enhancement through compensatory or rewards arrangement (van Noordwijk and Leimona (2010). However, Wunder (2005) and Engel et al. (2008) define PES as mechanisms which fits five sets of conditions; a voluntary transaction where, a well-defined environmental service (or land use likely to secure that service), is being “bought” by at least one buyer, from an environmental service provider, if, and only if, the environmental service provider secures <b>environmental</b> service provision (<b>conditionality).</b> The voluntary agreement between sellers and buyers of PES schemes is important, and incentives to farmers motivate them to sustainably adopt alternative PES farm practices (Ruto and Garrod 2009). Nevertheless, compensation or reward for environmental services (CRES) envisages efficient, equitable use and conservation of natural resources through contingent contracts between sellers and buyers of ecosystem services (Swallow et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, {{the growth}} of marine tourism is {{creating}} opportunities for financing marine protected areas (MPAs), but what these financial arrangements look like {{and how they can}} be governed at larger scales, and in equitable and transparent ways, is unclear. This paper examines the governance arrangement of two region-wide successive entrance fee systems established since 1997 in Raja Ampat, Indonesia, to finance a network of MPAs delineated under the auspices of two big international non-governmental organizations (NGO), namely Raja Ampat Entrance Fee and Raja Ampat Ecosystem Service Stewardship Fee. These two successive entrance fee systems can be viewed as payment for environmental services (PES) arrangements. The PES-like entrance fee arrangements improved in terms of participation, transparency and equity. In the second scheme, local communities in Raja Ampat were involved {{in the design of the}} disbursement of the community fund, and the criteria for disbursement became more clear and transparent. However, in both schemes there is no clear connection between the distribution of the funds and activities that improve <b>environmental</b> services provision (<b>conditionality).</b> In addition, the latter scheme is still facing equity challenges as some communities with customary rights over marine tourism hotspots are asking for additional user-fees from tourists and tourism operators...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{and performance}} of a business depend on the interactions between a set of related activities, such as planning, development, production, output/input flows, etc. The ways of organising communication flows between these activities and the knowledge-processing mechanisms are extremely important for the decision-making processes. Knowledge is not the fruit of a passive acquisition, but is instead proactively built up, through endless exchanges {{between the individual and}} his physical and social environment. The institutions, in the broadest sense, are external facilities (external scaffoldings) which {{play a key role in}} expanding as well as reducing the intellectual horizon of a business or individual; from a cognitive perspective, such entities are veritable “extensions of the human mind "(Lombardi, 2001). A business moves within a “socio-technical landscape” which is determined by situations and events that go beyond the range of the national policies and direct their technical and technological adaptations to ethically-orientated productive models (Brunori et al, 2008). In this scenario, the need for training/information about <b>environmental</b> issues and <b>conditionality</b> has become a strategic theme for the institutions in charge of planning and management training. On the other hand, adaptations are possible and effective insofar as they are accepted and shared and if what seem to be constraints are turned into challenges by the business itself. This paper analyse the level of knowledge of environmental problems on a global scale and the level of sharing and awareness of individual responsibilities in connection with the conditionality principle and analyse the information flow within the socio-technical system the farms belong to, the preferred channels for the acquisition of knowledge/information, and the role attributed to the main players in the relational system built around the farms...|$|R
