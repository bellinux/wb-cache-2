40|$|Since 1999, {{regional}} {{retail and}} wholesale gasoline {{markets in the}} United States have experienced significant price volatility, both intertemporally and across geographic markets. In particular, gasoline prices in California, Illinois and Wisconsin have spiked occasionally well above gasoline prices in nearby states. The three chapters of my thesis study the relationship between gasoline price spikes, environmental regulation of gasoline content, unanticipated refinery outages and other recent structural changes in the domestic oil market. In the first chapter, I detail current regulations related to gasoline content. Implemented regionally to address local mobile-source emissions, gasoline content regulations increase costs to refiners, transporters and distributors of gasoline, as well as reduce the fungibility of gasoline across different regions. Chapter one provides {{a summary of the}} regulations and a qualitative description the costs the regulations impose on refiners, transporters and distributors of gasoline. In chapter two, I estimate two distinct effects of gasoline content regulations in California, Illinois and Wisconsin: (i) the effect of increased production costs due to supplementary regulation, and (ii) the effect of incompatibility between these blends and gasoline meeting federal reformulated gasoline standards. Using a structural model based on the production optimization problem of refiners, I simulate wholesale prices for jet fuel, diesel and four blends of gasoline in each geographic market. I then specify a counterfactual in which gasoline in the three states met federal requirements. (cont.) Using a similar methodology, I also estimate the effect of two structural changes in the domestic oil market, (i) changes in refinery ownership and (ii) limited expansion of domestic refining capacity. I estimate the effect of increased refining costs is 4. 5, 3. 0 and 2. 9 cents per gallon in California, Illinois and Wisconsin. The effect of incompatibility with federal RFG criteria, conditional on an in-state refinery outage, is 4. 8, 6. 6 and 7. 1 cents per gallon in California, Illinois and Wisconsin. Controlling for the magnitude of local outages in these areas, I estimate that 72, 92 and 91 percent of price spikes created by local refinery outages could be mitigated by compatibility with federal RFG standards. In chapter three I study the challenge faced by regulators of differentiating strategic withholding of capacity from unreliable production. If a regulator cannot verify "unplanned" outages, the regulator cannot credibly distinguish between strategic behavior by producers and unlucky realizations of <b>facility</b> <b>reliability.</b> I specify a model in which a firm's choices of production and maintenance affect <b>facility</b> <b>reliability</b> and study how incentives arising from ownership of more than one facility affect <b>facility</b> <b>reliability.</b> I then statistically test whether the pattern of incidents is consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model. I find statistically significant evidence that ownership of other local refining capacity is correlated with the probability of an outage at a given refinery. In addition, the relationship between ownership and incident likelihood is greatest for markets with special gasoline formulations, where a refinery outage has the largest effect of gasoline prices. In these markets, expected incident likelihood is 30 percent greater for a refinery affiliated with another refinery that it is for an unaffiliated refinery. by Erich Johann Muehlegger. Thesis (Ph.

30|$|Park-and-ride (P&R) {{facilities}} can {{alleviate the}} traffic burden in central urban areas by enabling car drivers to {{park at the}} perimeter of congested areas and continue their journeys with public transportation (e.g., metro and bus rapid transit). Whether a P&R scheme is successful depends on its attractiveness to car users. This paper presents an evaluation method for the reliability analysis of P&R mode. Two indices, P&R reliability and mode reliability, are introduced to represent the reliabilities of a transfer point and an entire trip, respectively. Then, a systematic reliability analysis is conducted for a stochastic P&R network, where travelers can complete their journeys via two options: auto mode or P&R mode. A variational inequality (VI) model is proposed and solved by a heuristic solution algorithm. Numerical {{results show that the}} P&R <b>facility</b> <b>reliability</b> is significantly influenced by the capacity of parking facilities, the dispatching frequency of the connecting metro, and the metro fare. In addition, a higher level of total demand in the network has significant negative impacts on P&R mode’s attractiveness compared to auto mode.|$|E
40|$|In {{nuclear power}} {{engineering}} {{a need to}} justify an operability of products and their components is of great importance. In high-temperature gas reactors, the critical element affecting the <b>facility</b> <b>reliability</b> is the fuel rod cladding, which in turn leads {{to the need to}} gain knowledge in the field of gas dynamics and heat transfer in the reactor core and to increase the detail of the calculation results. For the time being, calculations of reactor core are performed using the proven techniques of per-channel calculations, which show good representativeness and count rate. However, these techniques require additional experimental studies to describe correctly the inter-channel exchange, which, being taken into account, largely affects the pattern of the temperature fields in the region under consideration. Increasingly more relevant and demandable are numerical simulation methods of fluid and gas dynamics, as well as of heat exchange, which consist in the direct solution of the system of differential equations of mass balance, kinetic moment, and energy. Calculation of reactor cores or rod bundles according these techniques does not require additional experimental studies and allows us to obtain the local distributions of flow characteristics in the bundle and the flow characteristics that are hard to measure in the physical experiment. The article shows the calculation results and their analysis for an infinite rod lattice of the reactor core. The results were obtained by the technique of modelling one rod of a regular lattice using the periodic boundary conditions, followed by translating the results to the neighbouring rods. In channels of complex shape, there are secondary flows caused by changes in the channel geometry along the flow and directed across the main front of the flow. These secondary flows in the reactor cores with rods spaced by the winding wire lead to a redistribution of the coolant along the channel section, which in turn results in a heat flow from the more heated rods to the less heated ones. The largest vector values of the transversal velocity are observed near the rod surface immediately behind the fin that passes in the section under consideration. These features lead to the exchange of mass and heat between the conjugate cells of the bundle of rods. The distribution of the transversal velocity in the gap between the rods has a periodic saw-tooth pattern, which can be justified {{by the fact that the}} fins pass periodically through the gap. Thus, the maximum of the flow is achieved immediately after passing the fins through the gap when the maximum transverse velocities can be observed directly behind the fins, and the minimum occurs when the fins move to meet each other, and before the fins in the gap is formed a region with the minimum values of the transversal velocity. </p...|$|E

Finally, a case study is discussed demonstrating the application and results of RCM for distribution underground systems. I. HISTORY Clearly fiom the perspectives of the customer, regulator and the stockholder, effectively managing underground reliability is becomingly increasingly important. There is a fine line to balance between managing cost and performance. Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) is a systematic approach to defme optimal strategies of routine maintenance where system functionality can be preserved in the most cost-effective manner [I]. Historically, underground distribution systems have been maintained in a reactively where cable is repaired after failure; the process may repeat numerous times before replacement occurs. Now, however, the actual condition of cable can be assessed with predictive diagnostics. With the resulting information, RCM principles can be utilized to manage distribution underground facilities to prioritize maintenance activities. This new approach avoids outage...|$|R
40|$|National audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{integrated}} facility location and supplier selection decisions {{for the design of}} supply chain network with reliable and unreliable suppliers. Two problems are addressed: (1) facility location/supplier selection; and (2) <b>facility</b> location/supplier <b>reliability.</b> We first consider the facility location and supplier selections problem where all the suppliers are reliable. The decisions concern the selection of suppliers, the location of distribution centres (DCs), the allocation of suppliers to DCs and the allocation of retailers to DCs. The objective is to minimise fixed DCs location costs, inventory and safety stock costs at the DCs and ordering costs and transportation costs across the network. The introduction of inventory costs and safety stock costs leads to a non-linear NP-hard optimisation problem. To solve this problem, a Lagrangian relaxation-based approach is developed. For the second problem, a two-period decision model is proposed in which selected suppliers are reliable in the first period and can fail in the second period. The corresponding <b>facility</b> location/supplier <b>reliability</b> problem is formulated as a non-linear stochastic programming problem. A Monte Carlo optimisation approach combining the sample average approximation scheme and the Lagrangian relaxation-based approach is proposed. Computational results are presented to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approaches...|$|R
40|$|Risk and {{reliability}} dominate water supply discussions in the arid western United States. In the past, water managers built additional storage to mitigate supply risk. The optimal, least expensive storage sites {{have now been}} taken, and there are strong, environmental objections to new <b>facilities.</b> <b>Reliability</b> of existing supplies is further diminished due to concerns about endangered species and global climate change. Thus water agencies increasingly turn to contractual mechanisms such as dry-year options to manage supply risk in advance of need. However, although a few water agencies across the West have implemented dry-year options, sufficient data for conventional econometric analysis do not yet exist. We thus utilize experimental economics to analyze the effect of annual dry-year options on water markets. How do market structure (competitive versus market power) and option contract availability affect water price and allocation within a market? Experiment participants trade stochastic realizations of water in a non-uniform double auction parameterized to resemble the California water market. We find that realized gains from trade are on average higher when options can be traded, by 11 % in competitive markets and by 21 % in dominant buyer markets. Findings in this analysis may assist policymakers in preparing for the next multi-year drought in California. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|Supply chain {{management}} {{deals with the}} management of information and material in a network of producers, retailers and customers. This task is rather complex since {{a high degree of}} uncertainty occurs in reality {{due to the fact that}} key factors such as product demands, stock availability, prices, <b>facilities</b> <b>reliability,</b> all have significant stochastic components. Stochastic programming is main representative approach to capture some aspects of the uncertainty due to the limited knowledge of the model input parameters. Although it has many contributions in supply {{chain management}}, they are mainly focused on the strategic decision level, where there is not enough concrete information about the features of uncertainties on which to base long-term decisions. Within a current research, it is supposed that the most of the uncertainty could be handled adequately using a stochastic modeling approach precisely at the tactical planning level, mostly employing stochastic values for customer demand, supplier lead times, production costs and/or price fluctuations. The paper illustrates the application of stochastic programming approach for inventory optimization under uncertain demand and lead time. The mathematical model is created and tested by using the algebraic modeling language AMPL, which uses the large-scale optimization solver CPLEX. The developed inventory model is tested, leading to the conclusion that stochastic programming provides superior planning decisions in comparison with deterministic equivalent. The effect of the scenario number on the model performance is evaluated.

This requires affordable zero emission, heat and transport systems. This research answers the question whether solar and wind generated electricity, with the integration of fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen as energy carrier, can provide a smart city area with 100 % renewable, reliable and cost effective power, heat and transport. Technology and cost parameters are analysed for all system components in a Near Future and Mid Century scenario. An energy system that is designed in previous work is modelled and simulated with actual climate data from the northern location Hamburg and a southern location Alicante. This is done on an hourly basis to provide detailed insight in the requirement of renewable electricity generation and storage <b>facilities,</b> <b>reliability</b> of fuel cell electric vehicle integration, and the system costs. Not sufficient solar electricity can be generated in the smart city area to cover the building demand, expect for Alicante in Mid Century.

40|$|Reliable {{facility}} location models consider unexpected failures with site-dependent probabilities, as well {{as possible}} customer reassignment. This paper proposes a compact mixed integer program (MIP) formulation and a continuum approximation (CA) model to study the reliable uncapacitated fixed charge location prob-lem (RUFL) which seeks to minimize initial setup costs and expected transportation costs in normal and failure scenarios. The MIP determines the optimal facility locations {{as well as}} the optimal customer assignments, and the MIP is solved using a custom-designed Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) algorithm. The CA model predicts the total system cost without details about facility locations and customer assignments, and it provides a fast heuristic to find near-optimum solutions. Our computational results show that the LR algorithm is efficient for mid-sized RUFL problems and that the CA solutions are close to optimal in most of the test instances. For large-scale problems, the CA method is a good alternative to the LR algorithm because of prohibitively long running times.

40|$|Reliability is the {{probability}} of equipment or processes to function without failure, when operated correctly, for a given interval of time, under stated conditions. Reliability numbers, by themselves, lack meaning for making improvements. For business, the financial issue of reliability is controlling the cost of unreliability from equipment and process failures which waste money. Reliability issues are understandable when converted into monetary values by using actual plant data. Several reliability engineering tools are discussed. Reliability Definitions Reliability has many definitions (Omdahl 1988). If repairs are not possible, reliability is the duration or probability of failure-free performance under stated conditions. If repairs are possible, reliability is {{the probability}} that an item can perform its intended function for a specified interval under stated conditions.

40|$|AbstractAn {{effective}} application for hydrogen technologies at {{nuclear power plants}} is proposed, which improves the plant maneuverability during normal operation, and provides for in-house power supply during the plant blackout. The reliability of the NPP's emergency power supply was assessed probabilistically for the plant blackout conditions with the simultaneous use of an auxiliary full-time operating steam turbine and the emergency power supply system channels with diesel generators. The proposed system with an additional steam turbine {{makes it possible to}} use the reactor core decay heat for the reactor shutdown for 72  h. During the blackout at a plant with several units, the additional steam turbine power required for the unit cool down is maintained by additional steam generated by the combustion of hydrogen in oxygen. It has been shown that the proposed flowchart with an auxiliary full-time operating small-power steam turbine installed at the NPP, combined with an integrated hydrogen <b>facility,</b> improves the <b>reliability</b> of the NPP in-house power supply during blackout accidents...|$|R
