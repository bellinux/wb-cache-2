5000|$|Spotless {{has become}} the focus of a {{high-profile}} industrial relations test case in Australia after claims of bullying and harassment surrounding Spotless’ use of individual flexible agreements (IFAs), were raised by members of United Voice. United Voice is the union that represents contract cleaners employed by Spotless at shopping centres, CBD buildings and other privately and publicly owned buildings. The case will be heard by the Federal Court of Australia, where United Voice will argue that Spotless is in breach of the Fair Work Act as it leaves cleaners worse off than they would be without the IFAs. United Voice will also tell Fair Work Australia and the Federal Court that cleaners have reported that they have been unduly pressured into signing the agreements and were allegedly told if they refuse to sign the IFAs they were warned that their hours would be cut or that they would be refused overtime hours which they have enjoyed under the Cleaning Services Award. [...] United Voice will also claim Spotless misrepresented the IFAs to its workers. The Union says Spotless' use of IFAs in these circumstances is contrary to the spirit and intent of the Individual <b>Flexibility</b> <b>provisions</b> under the Fair Work Act and that Spotless are trying to re-introduce WorkChoices AWAs by the back door.|$|E

I argue that flexibility mechanisms—;commonly used to advance international cooperation—should be employed to make the institutional design project of global democracy more tractable.

Second, heightened flexibility takes seriously potential concerns about path-dependent institutional development. Finally, deliberately shortening the time horizons of agents by employing <b>flexibility</b> <b>provisions</b> has cognitive benefits as it forces designers to focus specifically on issues of feasibility as well as desirability.

50|$|Under the {{planting}} <b>flexibility</b> <b>provision</b> of the Agricultural Act of 1949, {{as amended by}} the 1990 farm bill, producers could choose to plant up to 25% of the crop acreage base in other Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC)-specified crops (except fruits and vegetables) without a reduction in crop acreage bases on the farm, but receive no deficiency payments on this acreage. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 further amended the 1949 Act to make a 15% reduction in payment acreage mandatory. The remaining 10% was optional flex acreage. Optional flex acreage was eligible for deficiency payments when planted to the program crop.

40|$|International audienceDue to the {{increasing}} penetration of distributed generation and new high-power consumption loads – such as electric vehicles (EVs) – distribution system operators (DSO) are facing new grid security challenges.

Flexible loads, with EVs at their forefront, can modulate their consumption or even inject power back to the grid depending on current grid conditions.

Their findings suggest that national political objectives and possibly deeper cultural ties influenced project selection. This characterization differs from the market-based assumptions that underlie well-known estimates of cost-savings related to the Protocol's flexibility mechanisms. The authors conclude that if approaches developed under the AIJ programs to approve projects are retained, benefits from Kyoto's <b>flexibility</b> <b>provisions</b> will be less than those widely anticipated.

40|$|A {{considerable}} {{challenge for}} the creators of international environmental agreements is how to design mechanisms that deter defection without deterring participation. Relatively ‘‘soft’ ’ law often garners widespread participation, but it creates few con-crete incentives for states to improve behavior. ‘‘Harder’ ’ commitments make shirking more difficult, but these institutional features may deter from joining the very states whose practices are least consistent with the treaty’s requirements.

40|$|Near-future {{electric}} {{distribution grids}} operation {{will have to}} rely on demand-side flexibility, both by implementation of demand response strategies and by taking advantage of the intelligent management of increasingly common small-scale energy storage.

30|$|Two final {{considerations}} are, firstly, the general {{failure of the}} modern literature to address the endogeneity of collective bargaining (for an exception, see Boeri and Burda 2009) and, relatedly, the sparse consideration accorded wage moderation under decentralization vis-à-vis individual wage negotiations. In the latter context, and {{on the basis of}} German data, Ochel (2005) concludes that {{there is no indication that}} the growth of company-level collective agreements has led to more moderate settlements. He also argues that agreements based on contractual opt-out clauses have not resulted in more moderate wage contracts than at the branch level while achieving wage flexibility. However, as we have seen, it is all too easy to miss the wage cuts that result from the application as opposed to the existence of opening clauses and the nature of the insurance function. Moreover, research by Garloff and Guertzgen (2012) suggests that <b>flexibility</b> <b>provisions</b> under sectoral agreements do affect the sensitivity of wages to local firm conditions once account is taken of more poorly performing firms. The latter study also reminds us that rising wages are not destructive of the decentralization argument, a result that is underscored by emerging evidence on favorable productivity development under successor pacts.|$|E
40|$|Bilateral and {{regional}} agreements concluded with the European Union (EU) and the United States are extensive and include {{high levels of}} IP protection and enforcement standards.

This paper analyses how DCs should best address trade negotiations in which high standards of IP protection and enforcement are sought and few balancing (safeguard and <b>flexibility)</b> <b>provisions,</b> or such that can stimulate technology transfer, are on offer. The Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition’s “Principles for Intellectual Property Provisions in Bilateral and Regional Agreements” cover many issues that are worth discussing as to how these can be incorporated in the negotiating process. Data collected from the CARIFORUM region when negotiating the EU-CARIFORUM Economic Partnership Agreement reconfirm the Principles’ main recommendations; so do the experiences from India, Central American countries, Colombia and Peru in negotiations with the EU. The argument made here, however, is that a crucial factor in achieving more favourable outcomes for DCs is through an increase of their bargaining power. It will be examined what structural factors influence bargaining power and how this impacts the use of negotiating strategies...|$|E
40|$|We analyse the {{interaction}} between different labour market institutions in Germany, {{a country with a}} long tradition of strong bargaining partners. A number of studies have established that industry-level bargaining exerts a moderating role on firm-level co-determination: works councils generate rather than redistribute rents in plants covered by collective bargaining agreements. This work analyses whether these findings still hold, given recent developments in the German system of industrial relations towards more bargaining decentralisation, such as opening clauses or company-level pacts for employment. In addition, we provide evidence pertaining to whether labour market reforms targeted at one institution (a push of collective bargaining agreements towards more flexibility) are counteracted by altering the effects of other, unaffected institutions (the rent-seeking behaviour of works councils). Analysing institutional changes and augmenting a theoretical model provides hypotheses, which are then tested using empirical analysis of representative German plant level data. We find that the existence of <b>flexibility</b> <b>provisions</b> in collective bargaining agreements do not drive works council behaviour towards rent-seeking. Regarding rent-generation, we find an amplifying effect: works council existence is associated with higher productivity in plants covered by industry-level contracts. These findings, however, depend on the level of collective bargaining: they do not hold in plants covered by firm-level contracts...|$|E

40|$|The {{electricity}} supply {{will become more}} volatile in energy systems with increasing shares of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Since electricity demand varies as does the supply by RES, the remaining residual load must be covered by flexible technologies that are required to balance {{the different types of}} fluctuations. In this study, these flexibility options are divided into three categories: increasing the residual load, decreasing the residual load and shifting the electricity demand / supply temporally or spatially. Furthermore, typical technological options are discussed for each category, and four flexibility criteria are used to compare their technical and economic characteristics. These include the activation time, duration of <b>flexibility</b> <b>provision,</b> number of activations and activation costs. The study reveals that various options exist and no one technology dominates. However, within the flexibility categories, it can be shown that some appliances have advantages in three of the four categories compared to the other options. Ultimately, the choice of the most appropriate flexibility option depends on the requirements of the energy system. It can be concluded that a mix of technologies will be needed to cover the future flexible demand that may include short-term changes of the residual load as well as long-term downturns of RES generation...|$|R
40|$|The {{record of}} {{traditional}} safeguard {{provisions of the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization provides useful information about how a special agricultural safeguard might be made effective. The success of existing safeguard or <b>flexibility</b> <b>provisions</b> to sustain long-run liberalization programs stems from their requiring objective, transparent, and participatory decisions on {{the application of the}} import restrictions they allow. The proposed special agricultural safeguard expands by arithmetic formula the bounds within which a Member may impose a new import restriction. Analysis reported here suggests that the formulas provide a poor guide for policy, indicating that they would frequently prescribe action that is not needed and fail to prescribe action when it would be appropriate. Analysis of the existing agricultural safeguard, to which the special agricultural safeguard is similar, indicates that it has functioned not as an allowance for occasional response to unusual situations but as an expansion of the limits Members have accepted through tariff bindings. To be useful, the special agricultural safeguard should do more than provide formulas for import restrictions. It should provide for objective and participatory processes that would bring forward relevant information and guide an objective and balanced accounting of the interests at play.

40|$|Many {{international}} environmental agreements (IEAs) have adopted differentiated rules {{for groups of}} countries, based on {{the recognition of the}} different circumstances of parties, such as special needs of certain parties (especially developing countries), or the different contribution of parties to the environmental problem at hand. The resulting differential treatment usually consists of differences in the stringency of obligations, different timing of their application, and/or international financial, capacitybuilding or technological assistance. The existence (and design) of preferential treatment for some groups of parties may be a precondition for their entering the agreement in the first place. But in the long term, some types of preferential treatment may lead to new incentives that make broader (and deeper) cooperation more difficult, as observed for the climate change regime by Castro et al. (2011). In this article, I consider the relationship between the existence of differential treatment of parties to an IEA and the outcomes of the bargaining process that led to the adoption of the IEA as well as its effectiveness in terms of compliance and problem-solving. Following the literature on the rational design of international agreements, I regard country differentiation as akin to other <b>flexibility</b> <b>provisions</b> that are expected to facilitate deeper cooperation among parties.

40|$|We analyse {{the rules}} {{provided}} in the National Allocation Plans of the EU Member States (MS) for the first period (2005 - 2007) of the EU emission trading system (EU-ETS) {{with respect to their}} impact on energy efficiency and innovation and on technology variety. The allocation rules considered are total quantity of allowances allocated, allocation methods (auction versus grandfathering), rules for banking of left-over allowances into the second period (2008 - 2012), allocation to newcomers and closures of installations, and information about future allocation. Since the overall allocation appears rather generous, allowance prices are expected to be low, in particular since almost all MS prohibit banking into the second period. Thus, price-induced innovation effects will be weak. Similarly, the auction shares are too small to have any innovation effects. Closures result in a stop of further allocation, providing disincentives for innovation. In several MS these disincentives are softened because allowances may be transferred to new installations. However, new entrants typically receive allowances for free based on specific emissions and projected output. These specific values are either based on benchmarks for homogenous product groups or depend on best available technologies. In some countries a plethora of benchmarks within the same product categories threaten to thwart the <b>flexibility</b> <b>provisions</b> of the EU-ETS. Finally, future allocation rules are vastly unknown, amplifying the uncertainty about the benefits of new investments. In conclusion, existing allocation rules provide only modest incentives for innovation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} decarbonise the energy system, {{alternative}} transition pathways were assessed {{in recent years}} that agree on the crucial role of the heating sector, due to its potential to increase the renewable-based share of energy demand and to improve energy efficiency. Simultaneously, the increasing share of fluctuating renewable energy sources (RES), such as wind and photovoltaic, raises the hourly volatility in the energy system and challenges energy utilities. To balance energy demand and RES in an optimal manner storage-based heating systems can be used as flexible loads. This study discusses to what extent smart residential heating systems can contribute to the integration of RES and quantifies the trade-off between electricity savings and <b>flexibility</b> <b>provision,</b> when replacing storage heaters by heat pumps. To answer these research questions a simulation-based scenario analysis is conducted until 2050 encompassing France, Germany and the United Kingdom. These countries are of specific interest due to their substantial share of electric heating as well as their exponentially rising wind and photovoltaic (PV) generation capacities. The study reveals that the long-term potential of heating technologies for the integration of RES is relatively limited in countries such as France or Germany, given the improved insulation of buildings and the seasonal offset between PV generation and heat demand. However, in the short- to medium-term, or in countries with low shares of PV generation but high shares of wind power (such as the UK), heating technologies may facilitate the integration of RES, especially in the absence of alternative flexibility options...|$|R
