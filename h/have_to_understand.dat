500|$|Having {{experienced}} both {{avenues of}} recording {{on a major}} label and later choosing to be an independent artist, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music. [...] He {{spends most of his}} time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. [...] "I'm my own boss. I can do what I want. I can change directions", he told West Central Tribune's Anne Polta. [...] As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said. [...] "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. You just have to be well-rounded in both areas. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> publishing. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how you make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent." [...] "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said. [...] "It has allowed me to create CDs. It separates you from the million other great players." ...|$|E

So, it's really hard to fix, but we are working on it. And we continue to work on it. We have tried several 'things', none of them quite get to the key, turning of the 40-foot tower inside of a finished building, but we are working on it...

In an interview in 1997 {{when he was asked}} about why he visited Blair he replied, [...] "I've taken a lot of flack for going to No. 10 Downing Street but the thing about that is, I never considered myself a rebel anyway. I wasn't going there representing the 'Indie community'. I wasn't representing anyone. I was going there for me. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that from when I went to school and from when I was born all we ever knew was conservative, Tory, right-wing government. What people don't mention is, they say 'He went to meet Tony Blair.' No. I went to meet the Labour prime minister. Our parents always drummed into us that the Labour Party was for the people and the Tory Party was not. I went to meet the Labour prime minister." ...|$|E
500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> and people need to understand, that {{you have to go through}} everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, he was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 at the end of the year. [...] By early 2014, McCain's apostasies were enough that the Arizona Republican Party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been [...] "disastrous and harmful". [...] McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama's foreign policy, however, and in June 2014, following major gains by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president's entire national security team to resign. [...] McCain said, [...] "Could all this have been avoided? ... The answer is absolutely yes. If I sound angry it's because I am angry." ...|$|E
