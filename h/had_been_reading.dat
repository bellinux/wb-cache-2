5|$|India Knight, {{a novelist}} and {{columnist}} for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> The Cuckoo's Calling {{and thought it}} was good for a début novel. In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that the author was Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply. Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation. After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym. Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%, and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand. , a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (£2,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (£3,950).|$|E

25|$|On October 24, 1844, Meusebach wrote {{a letter}} to Count Castell to express his {{interest}} in moving to the Republic of Texas in order to pursue his love of geology, botany and horticulture. He had become fascinated by Texas and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> everything about the area. At the suggestion of his brother Carl, he read Texas: The Rise, Progress, and Prospects of the Republic of Texas by author William Kennedy and became intrigued by a place named Enchanted Rock.|$|E
25|$|Years have passed, Michael is {{divorced}} {{and has a}} daughter from his brief marriage. He is {{trying to come to}} terms with his feelings for Hanna, and begins taping readings of books and sending them to her without any correspondence while she is in prison. Hanna begins to teach herself to read, and then write in a childlike way, by borrowing the books from the prison library and following the tapes along in the text. She writes to Michael, but he cannot bring himself to reply. After 18 years, Hanna is about to be released, so he agrees (after hesitation) to find her a place to stay and employment, visiting her in prison. On the day of her release in 1983, she commits suicide and Michael is heartbroken. Michael learns from the warden that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> books by many prominent Holocaust survivors, such as Elie Wiesel, Primo Levi, Tadeusz Borowski, and histories of the camps. The warden, in her anger towards Michael for communicating with Hanna only by audio tapes, expresses Hanna's disappointment. Hanna left him an assignment: give all her money to the survivor of the church fire.|$|E

500|$|Mustaine {{elaborated}} {{on possible}} lyrical themes, revealing that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> about world history and [...] "crazy science stuff". Both Mustaine and Ellefson had {{indicated that the}} album would feature a different musical and stylistic approach from the previous album, including a move away from a radio-oriented sound, [...] which was subsequently characterized as a move back towards a thrash-oriented sound. Mustaine also stated his belief that the album sound and songwriting would be influenced by his 2014 guest performance alongside the San Diego Symphony.|$|E
500|$|On September 4, 2014, a 14-year-old girl in Port Richey, Florida, {{allegedly}} set her family's {{house on}} fire {{while her mother}} and nine-year-old brother were inside. Police reported that the teenager <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> online stories about Slender Man as well as Atsushi Ōkubo's manga Soul Eater. Eddie Daniels of the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said the girl [...] "had visited the website that contains {{a lot of the}} Slender Man information and stories [...] It would be safe to say there is a connection to that." ...|$|E

500|$|Naming {{the train}} was a task that was very seriously taken by Budd. [...] He wanted a name that started with the letter Z because this train was {{intended}} to be the [...] "last word" [...] in passenger service; Budd and his coworkers looked up the last words in their dictionaries, but neither zymurgy nor zyzzle conveyed the meanings that Budd was looking for. [...] The name of the new train came from The Canterbury Tales, which Budd <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading.</b> The story begins with pilgrims setting out on a journey, inspired by the budding springtime and by Zephyrus, the gentle and nurturing west wind. Budd thought that would be an excellent name for a sleek new traveling machine—Zephyr.|$|E
500|$|About {{two weeks}} later, the {{battered}} ship and starving crew landed in Lough Swilly, Ireland. For {{several weeks before}} the storm, Newton <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> The Christian's Pattern, {{a summary of the}} 15th-century The Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis. The memory of his own [...] "Lord have mercy upon us!" [...] uttered during a moment of desperation in the storm did not leave him; he began to ask if he was worthy of God's mercy or in any way redeemable as he had not only neglected his faith but directly opposed it, mocking others who showed theirs, deriding and denouncing God as a myth. He came to believe that God had sent him a profound message and had begun to work through him.|$|E
500|$|According to {{literary}} critic Frank Kermode, The Coral Island [...] "could {{be used as}} a document in the history of ideas". A scientific and social background for the novel is found in Darwinism, of the natural and the social kind. For instance, published a year before Origin of Species (whose ideas were already being circulated and discussed widely), Charles Darwin's 1842 The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs was one of the best-known contemporary accounts of the growth of coral. Ballantyne <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> books by Darwin and by his rival Alfred Russel Wallace; in later publications he also acknowledged the naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes. The interest in evolutionary theory was reflected in much contemporary popular literature, and social Darwinism was an important factor contributing to the world view of the Victorians and their empire building.|$|E

500|$|The {{operation}} was compromised by poor staff work and excessive {{confidence in the}} [...] "invulnerable" [...] Enigma machine. The British intelligence, namely Ultra, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> the German codes, forewarned the French. On 30 May they intercepted a message sent by Grauert discussing the arrangements he was making for his Corps. Adding to this leak, the units involved received incomplete orders for the assault. Oberst Johann-Volkmar Fisser, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of KG 77 complained about this. He asked the Headquarters of VIII Fliegerkorps, {{only to be told}} that the target was [...] "Paris". Sperrle responded to his request by removing KG 77 from the order of battle. The British intercepted Frisser's request to VIII Fliegerkorps, and passed it to the French. The French had intercepted similar messages and in response they doubled their aircraft strength to 120 fighters.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s Brown {{had grown}} {{dissatisfied}} with his drawing style. [...] He began simplifying it after bringing Ed the Happy Clown to an end, as he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> work by cartoonists with simpler styles such as John Stanley and Brown's friend Seth. [...] He abandoned the grid layout that he had used and arranged panels on the page in a varied, organic manner. [...] He made the drawings first and only afterwards laid down panel borders, which conform to the shapes of the pictures they enclose and are in a wobbly free-hand–much like those of the Hernandez brothers or Robert Crumb. [...] Brown distorted his images to convey emotion, but not in traditional cartoonish ways. [...] For example, when the adolescent Brown encounters friends of his parents, he does not physically shrink with embarrassment, but does so through distortion of perspective.|$|E
500|$|Bono and guitarist The Edge <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> {{works by}} {{cyberpunk}} author William Gibson, {{who wrote about}} a futuristic urban environment known as [...] "The Sprawl". [...] Gibson was an influence in {{the texture of the}} song, which Bono described as [...] "fucked up sci-fi". [...] Bono wanted to use noise to create a visual setting for the song, similar to Gibson's futuristic world, filled with advertisements on LED displays and neon signs, as in the 1982 film Blade Runner. [...] With [...] "Zooropa" [...] as the album's opening song, Bono stated that he wanted the album's music to be like [...] "legal drugs" [...] that would create a trip where [...] "you come out of the other end and you feel like you've been on some kind of a journey". The closing song on the album, [...] "The Wanderer", features Johnny Cash on vocals, and was intended on being the [...] "antidote" [...] to the futuristic-sounding opener.|$|E

500|$|On April 7, 1972 McCoy staged {{the best-known}} of the {{so-called}} [...] "copycat" [...] hijackings (see above). He boarded United Airlines' Flight855 (a Boeing727 with aft stairs) in Denver, and brandishing what later {{proved to be a}} paperweight resembling a hand grenade and an unloaded handgun, he demanded four parachutes and $500,000. After delivery of the money and parachutes at San Francisco International Airport, McCoy ordered the aircraft back into the sky and bailed out over Provo, Utah, leaving behind his handwritten hijacking instructions and his fingerprints on a magazine he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading.</b> He was arrested on April 9 with the ransom cash in his possession, and after trial and conviction, received a 45-year sentence. Two years later he escaped from Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary with several accomplices by crashing a garbage truck through the main gate. Tracked down three months later in Virginia Beach, McCoy was killed in a shootout with FBI agents.|$|E
500|$|Townshend <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> Universal Sufism founder Inayat Khan's The Mysticism of Sound and Music, which {{referred}} to spiritual harmony and the universal chord, which would restore harmony to humanity when sounded. Townshend realised that the newly emerging synthesizers {{would allow him}} to communicate these ideas to a mass audience. He had met the BBC Radiophonic Workshop which gave him ideas for capturing human personality within music. Townshend interviewed several people with general practitioner-style questions, and captured their heartbeat, brainwaves and astrological charts, converting the result into a series of audio pulses. For the demo of [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", he linked a Lowrey organ into an EMS VCS 3 filter that played back the pulse-coded modulations from his experiments. He subsequently upgraded to an ARP 2500. The synthesizer did not play any sounds directly as it was monophonic; instead it modified the block chords on the organ as an input signal. The demo was completed by Townshend overdubbing drums, bass, electric guitar, vocals and handclaps. Overall, the song ran at a slower pace to the version later recorded by the Who.|$|E
500|$|U2's manager Paul McGuinness recounted that The Joshua Tree {{originated}} from the band's [...] "great romance" [...] with the United States, {{as the group}} had toured the country {{for up to five}} months per year {{in the first half of}} the 1980s. Leading up to the album sessions, lead vocalist Bono <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reading</b> the works of American writers such as Norman Mailer, Flannery O'Connor, and Raymond Carver so as to understand, in the words of Hot Press editor Niall Stokes, [...] "those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream". Following a September–October 1985 humanitarian visit to Egypt and Ethiopia with his wife Ali, Bono said, [...] "Spending time in Africa and seeing people in the pits of poverty, I still saw a very strong spirit in the people, a richness of spirit I didn't see when I came home... I saw the spoiled child of the Western world. I started thinking, 'They may have a physical desert, but we've got other kinds of deserts.' And that's what attracted me to the desert as a symbol of some sort." ...|$|E
