5|$|The Nation Alliance Party was {{guided by}} a support for multiculturalism. Specifically, the party sought to {{increase}} translation services <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> could not read or speak English or people whose first language is not English, equivalency of academic standards, more supportive immigration services that assist transition into Canadian society, and better working conditions for recent immigrants and migrant labourers.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} occur with treatment; for example a {{granuloma}} can form at the suture site. Also, the sutured wound can tear again, as occurs {{when there is}} excessive pressure in the airways from ventilation. However, <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> do receive surgery soon after the injury to repair the lesion, outcome is usually good; the long-term outcome is good for over 90% {{of people who have}} TBI surgically repaired early in treatment. Even when surgery is performed years after the injury, the outlook is good, with low rates of death and disability and good chances of preserving lung function.|$|E

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{are unwilling}} or unable to take {{medication}} regularly, long-acting depot preparations of antipsychotics may be used to achieve control. They reduce the risk of relapse to a greater degree than oral medications. When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment. The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> need rapid {{reversal}} of warfarin such as due to serious bleeding or need emergency surgery, {{the effects of}} warfarin can be reversed with vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in addition to intravenous vitamin K. Blood products should not be routinely used to reverse warfarin overdose when vitamin K could work alone. PCC {{has been found to}} be better than FFP when rapid reversal is needed.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Monomethylhydrazine, {{as well as}} its {{precursors}} methylformylhydrazine and gyromitrin and raw Gyromitra esculenta, {{have been}} shown to be carcinogenic in experimental animals. Although Gyromitra esculenta has not been observed to cause cancer in humans, it is possible there is a carcinogenic risk <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> ingest these types of mushrooms. The toxins may be cumulative and even small amounts may have a carcinogenic effect. At least 11 different hydrazines have been isolated from Gyromitra esculenta, and it is not known if the potential carcinogens can be completely removed by parboiling.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia {{in people who}} have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.|$|E
