Blue Book was also upgraded in status from Project Grudge, with the creation of the Aerial Phenomenon Branch.|$|E

Jefferies said: [...] "At the time <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if the police were deliberately playing a game - promising the ordeal would soon be over and then finding it necessary to prolong the wait.

At such times the mind plays tricks, and one starts to believe that perhaps one is a criminal without knowing it and that, as in some Kafkaesque nightmare, guilt has been pre-ordained and the sentence is inescapable." ...|$|E

500|$|The game {{received}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Critics compared Rymdkapsel gameplay to Tetris and SimCity. Of its visual style, The New York Times published {{that the game}} makes others in the real-time strategy genre [...] "feel needlessly garnished". Reviewers generally appreciated the game's simplicity and challenge, but not its brevity and slow start. IGN's Steve Watts thought that the game made too many [...] "design concessions" [...] to its minimalism, though he considered the style [...] "gorgeous", and {{felt that he was}} never fully in control of his base. Eurogamer Tom Bramwell said that the game's minimalism extended to its core gameplay, where the player should strive to [...] "play the game less and less". Joseph Leray of TouchArcade described the game's balance and pacing as [...] "impeccable". He gave Rymdkapsel a perfect score and wrote that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if it were custom-made for iOS. Bryan Vore of Game Informer criticized the game's lack of features and thought that it [...] "fizzled out with no fanfare" [...] as a [...] "creative" [...] idea but without sufficient [...] "polish". The Verges Trent Wolbe called the soundtrack [...] "a minimalist achievement". Jonasson announced that the game had sold 200,000 copies as of December 2, 2013, {{due in large part to}} its inclusion in a Humble Bundle sale.|$|E

500|$|On June 1, 1978, {{following}} the monthly meeting of general {{authorities in the}} Salt Lake Temple, Kimball asked his counselors and the ten members of Quorum of the Twelve Apostles then present to remain behind for a special meeting. Kimball began by describing his studies, thoughts, and prayers on removing the restriction and on his growing assurance that {{the time had come}} for the change. Kimball asked each of the men present to share their views, and all spoke in favor of changing the policy. After all present had shared their views, Kimball led the gathered apostles in a prayer circle to seek final divine approval for the change. As Kimball prayed, many in the group recorded feeling a powerful spiritual confirmation. Bruce R. McConkie later said: [...] "There are no words to describe the sensation, but simultaneously the Twelve and the three members of the First Presidency had the Holy Ghost descend upon them and they knew that God had manifested his will.... I had had some remarkable spiritual experiences before... but nothing of this magnitude." [...] L. Tom Perry described: [...] "I felt something like the rushing of wind. There was a feeling that came over the whole group. When President Kimball got up he was visibly relieved and overjoyed." [...] Gordon B. Hinckley later said: [...] "For me, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if a conduit opened between the heavenly throne and the kneeling, pleading prophet of God who was joined by his Brethren." ...|$|E
500|$|The 2nd Law was {{primarily}} recorded at AIR Studios in London, England and Eastwest Studios in Los Angeles, California, with additional recording {{taking place at}} Shangri La Studios in Malibu, California and Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. In an interview with Billboard on 18 October 2011, the band's manager Anthony Addis revealed that Muse had begun recording their sixth album in London and that he {{expected it to be}} released by October 2012. Muse bassist Christopher Wolstenholme had stated in an interview with BBC Radio 1 that they had aimed to begin recording The 2nd Law in either September or October 2011. During the recording of the album, band frontman Matt Bellamy jokingly described the album as a [...] "christian gangsta rap jazz odyssey, with some ambient rebellious dubstep and face-melting metal flamenco cowboy psychedelia" [...] on his Twitter account. In an interview with Kerrang! on 14 December 2011, Wolstenholme stated that the next Muse album would be [...] "something radically different" [...] from their prior releases. He also said that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if the band were [...] "drawing a line under a certain period" [...] of their career with their sixth album. In another interview Chris mentioned that the band had experimented with music and sounds in particular. It was revealed via Muse's publicist Tom Kirk on his Twitter account that composer David Campbell was helping the band compose the album. In an interview in the April 2012 issue of NME, Bellamy said that the band were set to include elements of electronic music, with influences coming from acts such as French house duo Justice and UK dance-punk group Does It Offend You, Yeah?.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Perala from Anchorage Daily News complimented the video, saying [...] "If {{you have}} a secret fondness for pop singer Madonna, {{you would want to}} check out her Ciao Italia, the singer's concert film from Italy. You can be pleasantly {{surprised}} at how amazing she is." [...] Heather Phares from Allmusic said: [...] "Madonna's Ciao Italia: Live From Italy captures a performance from her 1988 world tour and features hits like 'Lucky Star', 'True Blue', 'La Isla Bonita', 'Like a Virgin', and 'Material Girl'. A much simpler, less choreographed performance than her later extravaganzas like The Girlie Show World Tour, Ciao Italia is still entertaining in its own right, and will definitely please fans nostalgic for some old-school Madonna hits." [...] Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times gave a positive review, saying [...] "A festive Italian stadium show featuring the Material Girl, who's turned into a first-rate entertainer, strutting and singing in flashy production-number renditions of her recent most Billboard topping songs, is indeed a delight. The video captures the enormity of Madonna as a performer, and her theatrics, oomph and chutzpah." [...] Tom Shales from The Washington Post said that [...] "Ciao Italia works wonderful because it makes Madonna look like she's at home, with her Italian family all around her. [...] A Turin soccer stadium became the sexual center of the universe last year when Madonna, one of our naughtiest superstars, taped this concert there before 75,000 gyrating Italians. Ebullient and insouciant, Madonna sings her hits-including the darkly beautiful 'Live to Tell'—in cavernous stereo; dances engagingly with 14-year-old Chris Finch, the quintessential Lucky Little Boy; and crowns herself queen of teases, bending over to reveal 'Kiss' printed on her underpants [...] Sheer showmanship is present in her performances as well as the camera work of this video." [...] Jim Farber from Rolling Stone said that [...] "this version of Madonna's Who's That Girl Tour returns the star to the medium where she excels best. On videocassette, however, Madonna makes manipulation seem like an exciting message indeed." [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide however, gave a negative review of the album, saying [...] "Possibly the biggest problem with Ciao Italia regarded the sloppy manner in which the program was assembled. I can’t recall if Italia appeared as a TV special that aired live or if it was taped and edited specifically for future broadcast screenings, but it certainly looked like something that was created on the fly. Sloppy camerawork and editing abound, as those two factors don’t flow together terribly well. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though they tried their best to get appropriate material at the time but that they failed to massage it after the fact." ...|$|E

Not everything lands, but the parts that do are outstanding. One thing did seem {{to get lost in}} the move to PS4, though: Tearaway on Vita was an intimate experience. Holding the device close to my face, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though I was privy to a secret directly from Media Molecule. I’m glad to see the adventure on the big screen, but the console experience feels less personal, and the journey loses {{a little bit in the}} transition.

2500|$|The EL {{served as}} a {{facelift}} of its predecessor, the EF Falcon, which began production in 1994. The [...] "E-series" [...] architecture can trace its roots back to 1988 with the EA.

2500|$|Webster {{was born}} in 1960 in Doncaster, England. [...] He was raised in Brierley. [...] His first {{instrument}} was piano which he began playing {{at the age of}} 6. [...] Four years later he began playing his current instrument the cornet. [...] The piano was gradually pushed aside as he progressed with the cornet at Grimethorpe Colliery Junior Band. [...] Before becoming a professional musician, he worked down the coal mines and prior to that as a Laboratory technician. However, it wasn't until 1988 that he began to turn his hobby into a job. [...] In this year he was invited to join Black Dyke, one of the world's greatest brass bands, as principal cornet. [...] He stayed here for 5 years before deciding to pursue a solo career. [...] He did however contest during his solo period with CWS Glasgow band, arguably the top band in Scotland. [...] Webster continues to play on occasions with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. [...] In 2000 he was once again invited to join Black Dyke Band, and accepted saying <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though he had [...] "seven years off for personal development". It was during this time that he received a master's degree in Music at the University of Leeds, and went on to complete his PhD in psychology The stay once again lasted five years with him leaving rather suddenly in December 2005. [...] Within days he joined Grimethorpe Colliery Band after the band manager, invited him to join, as the principal cornet had left only as few days previously. [...] In his first contest for Grimethorpe they came first beating his former band by one point whilst also picking up the best soloist award Roger left Grimethorpe in December 2008 along with several colleagues and is currently busy performing as a soloist and orchestral trumpeter (receiving great critical acclaim for his flugal playing in Mahler 3 and trumpet work in Gregson's Dream Song.). Webster worked for Besson whilst they were situated near London, and continues to work for them following their take-over by Buffet Crampon. Roger rejoined Grimethorpe recently on Principal cornet in a bid to help Grimethorpe become as successful as their recent history, when Webster was last in the band Roger has recently been awarded a Professorship at the RNCM. [...] In 2012 Webster released his first solo CD in eight years, however, this CD was for the Charity Help For Heroes, and he was accompanied by The Guards' Brass Band [...]|$|E
