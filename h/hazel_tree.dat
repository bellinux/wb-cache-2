25|$|Oak forests, {{above all}} of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), {{are the most}} common in the Atlantic zone. They {{represent}} the typical forest floor formation of basal trees, extending to an altitude of some 600 metres. In higher regions, as one ascends the mountains, they yield to beech forests; {{at the bottom of the}} valleys they are replaced by ash trees and <b>hazel</b> <b>tree</b> groves. There are two main types of oak: the pedunculate oak and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). The latter extends furthest into the interior and highest in altitude, but plays a secondary part; in general, when the climate begins to show its continental character, these oak forests are replaced by Pyrenean oak.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland, Anzac Day {{is remembered}} by the {{expatriate}} New Zealand and Australian communities. In {{the absence of}} an official World War I remembrance, and in honour of Irish soldiers who fought and perished in the Dardanelles and elsewhere, Anzac Day commemorations are also attended by members of veterans groups and historical societies, including the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, O.N.E.T., the Royal British Legion, UN Veterans, and more. Since the mid-1980s, an evening service has been organised by the New Zealand-Ireland Association, which currently takes place in St Ann's Church, Dawson St, Dublin 2. For the 90th anniversary in 2005, a daylight service was held {{for the first time in}} the re-furbished Grangegorman Military Cemetery, Dublin 7. A Turkish <b>Hazel</b> <b>tree,</b> planted by the Ambassadors of Australia, New Zealand and Turkey, commemorates this occasion. It can be found to the south of the limestone Memorial Wall. Since this date, a dawn service has been held at this location. At the Ballance House in County Antrim, the official New Zealand centre in Northern Ireland, a midday Anzac reception and act of remembrance takes place.|$|E

60|$|I {{heard from}} Nelly Bordman {{only a few}} days before {{receiving}} your letter, and so far from preparing me for all this sadness and gloom, she pleased me with her account of you whom she had lately seen--dwelling upon your retrograde passage into youth, and the delight you were taking in the presence and society of some still more youthful, fair, and gay monstrum amandum, some prodigy of intellectual accomplishment, some little Circe who never turned anybodies into pigs. I learnt too from {{her for the first time}} that you were settled at Hampstead! Whereabout at Hampstead, and for how long? She didn't tell me that, thinking of course that I knew something more about you than I do. Yes indeed; you do treat me very shabbily. I agree with you in thinking so. To think that so many hills and woods should interpose between us--that I should be lying here, fast bound by a spell, a sleeping beauty in a forest, and that you, who used to be such a doughty knight, should not take the trouble of cutting through even a <b>hazel</b> <b>tree</b> with your good sword, to find out what had become of me. Now do tell me, the <b>hazel</b> <b>tree</b> being down at last, whether you mean to live at Hampstead, whether you have taken a house there and have carried your books there, and wear Hampstead grasshoppers in your bonnet (as they did at Athens) to prove yourself of the soil.|$|E

50|$|Black {{truffles}} are {{now also}} cultivated in Australia, New Zealand, Chile, North America, and South Africa.

50|$|Lactarius pyrogalus {{is fairly}} common and is {{generally}} {{found at the}} base of <b>hazel</b> <b>trees</b> alone or in scattered groups.

Like Piper nigrum, the fruits contain the alkaloid piperine, which contributes to their pungency. Another species of long pepper, Piper retrofractum, is native to Java, Indonesia. The fruits of this plant are often confused with chili peppers, which belong to the genus Capsicum, originally from the Americas.|$|E
50|$|The Revelation: Cinderella's {{stepmother}} and stepsisters (in some versions {{just the}} stepsisters and, {{in some other}} versions, a stepfather and stepsisters) conspire to win the prince's hand for one of them. In the German telling, the first stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off a toe, but the doves in the <b>hazel</b> <b>tree</b> alert the prince to the blood dripping from the slipper, and he returns the false bride to her mother. The second stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off her heel, but the same doves give her away.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{phenomenon}} of natural asexual spread, also known in plants as vegetative reproduction. It is a plant propagation strategy and the complex of individuals formed by a mother plant and all its clones produced form a single genetic individual, a genet. The plant suckers are clones from the mother plant. The plant will have a genome identical to that from which it arose. Many species of plant reproduce through vegetative reproduction, such as the Canada thistle, cherry, Apple, Ligustrum, <b>hazel,</b> <b>Tree</b> of Heaven, Asimina triloba. The guava, a tropical tree, is also known to propagate through basal shoots.|$|E
50|$|Several of the estates {{around the}} city had grand linden alleys in the 18th century: Stubljan, Linderud, Søndre Bjølsen (currently Bjølsenparken) and Nordre Skøyen hovedgård.

25|$|Cloning is {{a natural}} form of {{reproduction}} that has allowed life forms to spread for more than 50 thousand years. It is the reproduction method used by plants, fungi, and bacteria, and is also the way that clonal colonies reproduce themselves. Examples of these organisms include blueberry plants, <b>hazel</b> <b>trees,</b> the Pando trees, the Kentucky coffeetree, Myricas, and the American sweetgum.|$|R
