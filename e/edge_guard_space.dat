It was previously established [3] that e/ 12 are sometimes necessary and e/ 6 always suffice. In contrast to the closed edge guardsused for these bounds, we introduce a new model, open <b>edge</b> <b>guards</b> (excluding the endpoints of the edge), which we argue are in some sense more natural in this context. After quantifying the relationship between closed and open <b>edge</b> <b>guards,</b> we improve the upper bound to show that, asymptotically, (11 / 72) e (open or closed) <b>edge</b> <b>guards</b> suffice, or, in terms of r, that (7 / 12) r suffice.

40|$|Guarding {{and searching}} {{problems}} have been of fundamental interest since {{the early years of}} Computational Geometry. Both are well-developed areas of research and have been thoroughly studied in planar polygonal settings. In this thesis we tackle the Art Gallery Problem and the Searchlight Scheduling Problem in 3 -dimensional polyhedral environments, putting special emphasis on <b>edge</b> <b>guards</b> and orthogonal polyhedra. We solve the Art Gallery Problem with reflex <b>edge</b> <b>guards</b> in orthogonal polyhedra having reflex edges in just two directions: generalizing a classic theorem by O'Rourke, we prove that r/ 2 + 1 reflex <b>edge</b> <b>guards</b> are sufficient and occasionally necessary, where r is the number of reflex edges. We also show how to compute guard locations in O(n log n) time. Then we investigate the Art Gallery Problem with mutually parallel <b>edge</b> <b>guards</b> in orthogonal polyhedra with e edges, showing that 11 e/ 72 <b>edge</b> <b>guards</b> are always sufficient and can be found in linear time, improving upon the previous state of the art, which was e/ 6. We also give tight inequalities relating e with the number of reflex edges r, obtaining an upper bound on the guard number of 7 r/ 12 + 1. We further study the Art Gallery Problem with <b>edge</b> <b>guards</b> in polyhedra having faces oriented in just four directions, obtaining a lower bound of e/ 6 - 1 <b>edge</b> <b>guards</b> and an upper bound of (e+r) / 6 <b>edge</b> <b>guards.</b> All the previously mentioned results hold for polyhedra of any genus. Additionally, several guard types and guarding modes are discussed, namely open and closed <b>edge</b> <b>guards,</b> and orthogonal and non-orthogonal guarding. Next, we model the Searchlight Scheduling Problem, the problem of searching a given polyhedron by suitably turning some half-planes around their axes, in order to catch an evasive intruder. After discussing several generalizations of classic theorems, we study the problem of efficiently placing guards in a given polyhedron, {{in order to make it}} searchable. For general polyhedra, we give an upper bound of r^ 2 on the number of guards, which reduces to r for orthogonal polyhedra. Then we prove that it is strongly NP-hard to decide if a given polyhedron is entirely searchable by a given set of guards. We further prove that, even under the assumption that an orthogonal polyhedron is searchable, approximating the minimum search time within a small-enough constant factor to the optimum is still strongly NP-hard. Finally, we show that deciding if a specific region of an orthogonal polyhedron is searchable is strongly PSPACE-hard. By further improving our construction, we show that the same problem is strongly PSPACE-complete even for planar orthogonal polygons. Our last results are especially meaningful because no similar hardness theorems for 2 -dimensional scenarios were previously known...|$|R

We transform the problem of guarding a piecewise convex polygon to the problem of 2 -dominating a properly defined combinatorial triangulation graph with edges or diagonals, where 2 -dominance requires that every triangle in the triangulation graph has at least two of its vertices in its 2 -dominating set.
