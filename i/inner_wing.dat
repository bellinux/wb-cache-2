5|$|Six {{external}} hardpoints {{were located}} {{along the bottom}} of the helicopter, with two under each wing and two on the fuselage under the sponsons. The two <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> hardpoints could carry pods of three TOW anti-tank missiles. 2.75-inch (70mm) rockets in 7-rocket or 19-rocket launchers could be carried on the four wing hardpoints. The two fuselage mounts were dedicated to carrying external fuel tanks. The wing hardpoints were also plumbed to allow the carriage of additional fuel tanks if required.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake is {{sympatric}} {{with the}} African crake on the wintering grounds, {{but can be}} distinguished by its larger size, paler upperparts, tawny upperwing and different underparts pattern. In flight, it has longer, less rounded wings, and shallower wingbeats than its African relative, and shows a white leading edge to the <b>inner</b> <b>wing.</b> In both the breeding and wintering ranges {{it is unlikely to}} be confused with any other rails, since sympatric species are smaller, with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and shorter bills. A flying corn crake can resemble a gamebird, but its chestnut wing pattern and dangling legs are diagnostic.|$|E
5|$|The MOD {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} multi-beam sonar surveys to image the wreck and appraise its condition. The high-resolution sonograms showed Royal Oak to be lying almost upside down with her top works forced into the seabed. The tip of the bow had been blown off by U-47s first torpedo and a gaping hole on the starboard flank {{was the result of}} the triple strike from her second successful salvo. Following several years of delays, Briggs Marine was contracted by the MoD to conduct the task of pumping off the remaining oil. Royal Oaks mid-construction conversion to fuel oil had placed her fuel tanks in unconventional positions, complicating operations. By 2006, all double bottom tanks had been cleared and the task of removing oil from the <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> tanks with cold cutting equipment began the next year. By 2010, some 1600 tonnes of fuel oil had been removed, and the wreck was declared to be no longer actively releasing oil into Scapa Flow. Operations continue at a reduced pace to tackle the oil known to be remaining (state for 2012).|$|E

25|$|To reduce fuel {{vaporisation}} at {{the high}} altitudes of photographic reconnaissance variants, the central and <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> tanks were pressurised. The pressure venting cock located behind the pilot's seat controlled the pressure valve. As the altitude increased, the valve increased the volume applied by a pump. This system was extended to include field modifications of the fuel tank system.|$|E
25|$|Pilots of 87 Squadron, {{including}} Arthur Vigers, experimentally fitted some aircraft {{with two}} forward firing, unsynchronized Lewis guns mounted {{on top of}} the lower wing, just inboard of the <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> struts. These guns could fire incendiary ammunition, which could not be used with the synchronized Vickers guns. The 97-round ammunition drums could not be changed once empty, nor could the pilot clear gun jams and the field modification did not become standard.|$|E

2500|$|The wing possessed great {{structural}} strength, provided {{plenty of}} room for fuel tanks and a heavy armament, while allowing the aircraft to be a steady gun platform. Each of the <b>inner</b> <b>wings</b> incorporated two fuel tanks; the [...] "main" [...] tanks, housed in a bay outboard and {{to the rear of the}} main undercarriage bays, had a capacity of 40 gallons; while the [...] "nose" [...] tanks, built into the wing leading edges, forward of the main spar, had a capacity of 37 gallons each. Also incorporated into the <b>inner</b> <b>wings</b> were inward-retracting landing gear with a wide track of 13ft 6¾ in.|$|R
25|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> {{normally}} {{consisted of}} a living room, a kitchen and a wooden-floored central hall. More rooms may be attached to this. Poorer farmers would not have any outer wing. Floor heating (온돌, ondol) {{has been used in}} Korea since prehistoric times. The main building materials are wood, clay, tile, stone, and thatch. Because wood and clay were the most common materials used in the past not many old buildings have survived into present times.|$|E
25|$|The wings {{were covered}} with Madapolam fabric and doped {{in a similar manner}} to the fuselage. The wing was {{installed}} into the roots by means of four large attachment points. The engine radiators were fitted in the <b>inner</b> <b>wing,</b> just outboard of the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag. The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an oil cooler section outboard, the middle section forming the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the cabin heater.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Korean houses can be {{structured}} into an <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> (안채, anchae) and an outer wing (사랑채, sarangchae). The individual layout largely {{depends on the}} region and the wealth of the family. Whereas aristocrats used the outer wing for receptions, poorer people kept cattle in the sarangchae. The wealthier a family, the larger the house. However, it was forbidden to any family except for the king to have a residence of more than 99 kan. A kan is the distance between two pillars used in traditional houses.|$|E

25|$|The initial Canberra PR3 {{model was}} shortly succeeded by the {{improved}} PR7 variant. The PR7 featured greater fuel capacity via wing storage, {{the more powerful}} RA.7 model of the Avon engine, and Maxaret anti-lock braking system. The Canberra PR9 was the final photo reconnaissance version; this aircraft was furnished with a new crew compartment, a redesigned <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> section, and much more powerful RA.24 Avon engine. In later service, bomber models of the Canberra were often converted with cameras and other equipment suited for reconnaissance purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Bf 109H was {{intended}} to be a high-altitude fighter, developed from the F-series. The wingspan was increased through the addition of new, constant-chord <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> panels to 11.92m (39.11ft), and the widened stabilizer again received a supporting strut leading from the fuselage, like the B through E models. Maximum speed was 750km/h (470mph) at 10,100m (33,140ft). A small number of Bf 109 H-1s were built, flying several sorties over Britain and France. Bf 109H-2 and H-5 developments were also planned, but the entire H-series was scrapped because of wing flutter problems.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{asymmetrical}} thrust {{has been}} used for directional control: if the left engine is idled and power is increased on the right side this will result in a yaw to the left, and vice versa. If throttle settings allow the throttles to be shifted without affecting the total amount of power, then yaw control can be combined with pitch control. If the aircraft is yawing, then the wing on the outside of this yaw movement will go faster than the <b>inner</b> <b>wing.</b> This creates higher lift on the faster wing, resulting in a rolling movement, which helps to make a turn.|$|E

50|$|Belalyev and V.I. Yukharin, at the Kazan Aviation Institute (KAI), {{designed}} a tandem seat single engined research aircraft {{to investigate the}} properties of Belyayev's forward swept wing with raked tips, used on the Belyayev DB-LK, particularly the resistance to structural instability and aileron reversal. The aircraft was to have had quite sharply swept forward <b>inner</b> <b>wings,</b> with the outer third swept back at a similar angle, all with ailerons, except for flaps on the inner half of the <b>inner</b> <b>wings.</b> Relatively small tail surfaces were envisioned {{at the end of}} a relatively long fuselage. The pilot and observer sat in enclosed cockpits, with the observer's cockpit halfway between the pilot's cockpit and the tail unit.Further work on the Babochka was abandoned after the German invasion.|$|R
25|$|A {{tricycle}} undercarriage was fitted, with the nosewheel retracting forwards. The single-wheel main legs retracted into coverless fairings in the wings, {{so that the}} sides of the wheels could be seen even when retracted. The wings themselves, unusually, had a different airfoil cross-section on the <b>inner</b> <b>wings</b> than the outer.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} design soon matured {{into the more}} conventional Westland W.34, with the 3,500hp (2,610kW) Eagle engine in the nose driving large contra-rotating propellers and the pilot sitting high in a humped fuselage to improve visibility. The design was otherwise orthodox, with a low wing, tailwheel undercarriage and double-folding wings fitted with both Youngman flaps on the <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> section and conventional flaps on the outer section. The W.34 was to be armed with four Hispano 20 mm cannon in the wings and {{have the ability to}} carry a torpedo under the fuselage or a selection of bombs and rockets under the wings.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{structure}} of the Hurricane's cantilever wing consisted of two steel spars, which possessed considerable strength and stiffness. The wing was described by aviation publication Flight as being relatively straightforward to manufacture, employing simple vertical jigs to attach the two spars, after which the wing ribs would be installed using horizontal bolts, forming separate units between the front and rear spars. Hydraulically-actuated split trailing edge flaps were present on the inner end of the wings. The original wing was predominantly fabric-covered, like the fuselage, while some use of lightweight metal sheets was made upon the exterior surface of the <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> and its leading edge. The majority of the Flight control surfaces, such as the Frise-type ailerons, also had fabric coverings.|$|E
25|$|From the outset, each Meteor was {{constructed}} from several modular sections or separately produced units, a deliberate design choice {{to allow for}} production to be dispersed and for easy disassembly for transport. Each aircraft comprised five main sections: nose, forward fuselage, central section, rear fuselage and tail units; the wings were also built out of lengthwise sections. The forward section contained the pressure cabin, gun compartments, and forward undercarriage. The center section incorporated much of the structural elements, including the <b>inner</b> <b>wing,</b> engine nacelles, fuel tank, ammunition drums, and main undercarriage. The rear fuselage was of a conventional semi-monocoque structure. Various aluminium alloys were the primary materials used throughout {{the structure of the}} Meteor, such as the stressed duralumin skin.|$|E

40|$|Measured high-dispersion {{center and}} limb {{profiles}} of the solar Mg II h and k resonance lines are compared with synthetic spectra computed with a partial-redistribution formalism and based on several upper-photosphere and lower-chromosphere temperature distributions. Profiles of the analogously formed Ca II K resonance line are also synthesized for the same atmospheric models. The spectrum-synthesis approach is outlined, and the collisional and fixed radiative rates appropriate to the adopted model atoms and solar atmosphere are discussed. It is found that the HSRA and VAL models predict systematically lower intensities in the h, k, and K <b>inner</b> <b>wings</b> than observed and that models with a somewhat higher minimum temperature (about 4450 K) can reproduce the measured <b>inner</b> <b>wings</b> and limb darkening.

25|$|Across the Meteor's {{production}} life, various {{different companies}} were subcontracted to manufacture aircraft sections and major components; {{due to the}} wartime workload on producing fighter aircraft such as the Hawker Hurricane and Hawker Typhoon, neither Gloster nor the wider Hawker Siddeley Group were able to internally meet the production demand of 80 aircraft per month. Bristol Tramways produced the forward fuselage of the aircraft, the Standard Motor Company manufactured the central fuselage and <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> sections, the Pressed Steel Company produced the rear fuselage, and Parnall Aircraft made the tail unit. Other main subcontractors included Boulton Paul Aircraft, Excelsior Motor Radiator Company, Bell Punch, Turner Manufacturing Company, and Charlesworth Bodies; {{as many of these}} firms had little or no experience producing aircraft, both quality and interchangeability of components were maintained by contractually enforced adherence to Gloster's original drawings.|$|E
25|$|Qantas Flight 32 was a Qantas {{scheduled}} passenger {{flight that}} suffered an uncontained engine failure on 4 November 2010 {{and made an}} emergency landing at Singapore Changi Airport. The failure {{was the first of}} its kind for the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. It marked the first aviation occurrence involving an Airbus A380. On inspection it was found that a turbine disc in the aircraft's No.2 Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine (on the port side nearest the fuselage) had disintegrated. In addition to destruction of the engine, this caused damage to the nacelle, wing, fuel system, landing gear, flight controls, the controls for engine No.1 and a fire in the left <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> fuel tank that self-extinguished. The failure was determined to have been caused by the breaking of a stub oil pipe which had been manufactured improperly.|$|E
25|$|The C.205 was a single-seat, all-metal, {{monoplane}} fighter, {{intended primarily}} as an interceptor but with ground attack and escort capabilities. The long nose housed the DB605 engine which drove a three-blade, constant-speed metal propeller, {{with the main}} fuel tank situated between the engine and the cockpit. The radiator was located under the centre section of the fuselage beneath the cockpit while the short rear section housed the radio equipment, oxygen cylinder and an 80L (20US gal) reserve fuel tank. The wings were made of light aluminium alloys and steel, having two spars and three sections, housing two additional fuel tanks, and the fully retractable wide-set main undercarriage gear. Apart from the all-metal flaps in the <b>inner</b> <b>wing,</b> all the other control surfaces were metal-framed and fabric-covered. Veltros had self-sealing fuel tanks, an armoured seat, and armoured windscreen as standard. The cramped cockpit possessed a limited field-of-view, but some examples were fitted with a rear-view mirror.|$|E
