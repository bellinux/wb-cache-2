5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of <b>its</b> <b>actual</b> location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing itself out of the ground as a spring.|$|E

5|$|New York State Route220 (NY220) is a {{state highway}} located in Chenango County, New York, in the United States.

The western terminus of NY220 is at an intersection with NY41 near the western county line in the town of Smithville. Its eastern terminus is the junction with NY12 in Oxford village.|$|E
5|$|Originally made {{by farmers}} {{to reduce the}} amount of waste from their milk, clotted cream has become so deep-rooted in the culture of {{southwest}} Britain that it is embedded as part of the region's tourist attraction.

5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} <b>its</b> <b>actual</b> scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E

5|$|Berzelius {{made some}} initial characterisations {{of the new}} metal and its {{chemical}} compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (<b>its</b> <b>actual</b> value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 amu); it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic thorium was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.|$|E

Heading ashore, the storm began to quickly deteriorate, and both the JTWC and the BoM declared it dissipated on 10 January as it continued southward. Throughout the storm's course, the JTWC's intensity estimates were below that of the BoM.

5|$|Compared to the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy {{appears to}} have {{predominantly}} more old stars with ages >7 years. The estimated luminosity of Andromeda Galaxy, , is about 25% {{higher than that of}} our own galaxy. However, the galaxy has a high inclination as seen from Earth and its interstellar dust absorbs an unknown amount of light, so it is difficult to estimate <b>its</b> <b>actual</b> brightness and other authors have given other values for the luminosity of the Andromeda Galaxy (including to propose it is the second-brightest galaxy within a radius of 10 mega-parsecs of the Milky Way, after the Sombrero Galaxy, with an absolute magnitude of around -22.21 or close).|$|E
5|$|However, {{the true}} authorship of the work, <b>its</b> <b>actual</b> date, and its purpose, {{have long been}} matters for {{controversy}} amongst historians and scholars, ever since Hermann Dessau in 1889 rejected both the date and the authorship as stated within the manuscript. Major problems include {{the nature of the}} sources it used, and how much of the content is pure fiction. For instance, the collection contains in all about 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations. Virtually all of these are now considered to be fraudulent.|$|E

But the Rouennaise did not forget the tram's services rendered, organising a first-class funeral: Just before the last scheduled run, a parade of honour made up of three trams ran from the Hôtel de ville to the Trianon depot, cheered by the crowds.|$|E

While McGregor is distracted, the six are freed by Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse, and the sack filled with rotten vegetables by Benjamin and Flopsy.

5|$|The {{black stork}} is {{considered}} to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but <b>its</b> <b>actual</b> status is uncertain. Despite its large range, it is nowhere abundant, and it appears to be declining in parts of its range, such as in India, China and parts of Western Europe, though increasing in others such as the Iberian Peninsula. Various conservation measures have been taken for the black stork, like the Conservation Action Plan for African black storks by Wetlands International. It is also covered under the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{noted for its}} heft, in terms of <b>its</b> <b>actual</b> page numbers, {{exhaustive}} research, and dense academic language. The writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some plain language. Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts, theology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, and communication theory. The book was described as sociobiology. The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in social progress.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} delayed {{numerous}} times before <b>its</b> <b>actual</b> release. Work {{on the game}} was extended because the development staff wanted to perfect the game due to high expectations from the fans and because the team only consisted of about 35 people.

Horii stated in an interview that the team focused more on puzzle solving than the game's story. Being the first game in the series to include 3D graphics, the team was also initially reluctant to include CG movies and cinematics due to letters written to Enix by fans fearing that doing so would change the overall feeling of the series.|$|E

5|$|The {{sea mink}} (Neovison macrodon) is a {{recently}} extinct species of mink {{from the eastern}} coast of North America in the family Mustelidae, the largest family in the order Carnivora.

The main justification for a separate species designation is the size difference between the two minks, but other distinctions have been made, such as its redder fur. The only known remains are fragments unearthed in Native American shell middens. <b>Its</b> <b>actual</b> size is speculative, based largely on tooth remains.|$|E
