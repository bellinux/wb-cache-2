50|$|Although {{the firm}} still served the textile industry, Murray began to {{consider}} how the design of steam engines could be improved. He wanted to make them simpler, lighter, and more compact. He also wanted the steam engine to be a self-contained unit that could readily be assembled on site with pre-determined accuracy. Many existing engines suffered from faulty assembly, which took much effort to correct. One problem that Murray faced was that James Pickard had already patented the crank and flywheel method of converting linear motion to circular motion. Murray ingeniously got round this difficulty by introducing a hypocycloidal gear. This consisted of a large fixed ring with internal teeth. Around the inside of this ring a smaller gear wheel, with half the outer one's diameter, would roll driven by the piston rod of the steam engine, which {{was attached to the}} gear's rim. As the piston rod moved backwards and forwards in a straight line, its linear motion would be converted into circular motion by the gear wheel. The gear wheel's bearing was attached to a crank on the flywheel shaft. When he used the hypocycloidal gear he was able to build engines that were more compact and lightweight than previous ones. However, Murray ceased to use this type of motion as soon as Pickard's patent expired.In 1799 William Murdoch, who worked for the firm of Boulton and Watt, invented a new type of steam valve, called the D slide valve. This, in effect, slid backwards and forwards admitting steam to one end of the cylinder then the other.

40|$|This {{project will}} {{investigate}} {{the economic and}} technical potential of decoupled drive structures for servo presses. The original working hypotheses about economic potentials that decoupling leads to -higher dynamics, -Energy savings and -lower cost, were undetectable. These effects occur only to a small extent {{even in the best}} case. Nevertheless, one can see in the decoupling of the drive trains economic potential. This refers mainly to the development of universal drive modules. Through such modules, possibly designed by modular principle, the design and manufacturing costs for servo presses can be reduced. Another aspect is the possibility of the flexible arrangement of these modules without geometric restrictions that result from the coupling elements. For analysis of the technical potential of decoupled drive structures initially a property analysis of the coupled machine was performed and their tilting behavior was determined. It was found that the resulting tilt of the plunger is determined by three effects 1. translational stiffness of the drive trains (<b>eccentric</b> <b>gear,</b> connecting rod, stroke adjustment, overload protection); 2. translational stiffness of the press frame; 3. rotatory stiffness of the coupling shaft. The synchronization of the drive train is of significant importance for the decoupled drive structure. There have been developed and implemented various concepts for the synchronization control. The classic synchronization concept shows almost the same tilting behavior as the coupled drive structure. This behavior was expected, since in this case only the coupling shaft has been replaced by an "electric shaft". An extension of this concept by a superimposed tilt controller, which is to compensate the influence of the translational stiffness, proved to be problematic. The reason is the strong tendency to instability of this controller, caused by clearance and non-linearities in the drive train. The expected improvement of the tilting behavior could not be detected...|$|E
40|$|Generally speaking, {{the studies}} of noncircular gears have been just begun; of course {{we have a few}} reports about them, but very few of {{theoretical}} research. 　In this paper, the writer introduced two relations mathematically; one is the relation between the base curve and the pitch curve, and the other between the pitch curve and the tooth profile. These mathematical relations are very simple; therefore, both the tooth profile and the base curve to any given pitch curve are very easy to get, which are shown in the illustrations. 　Especially the elliptic gears, most widely used in noncircular gears, were studied minutely as an initiative step in the <b>eccentric</b> <b>gears...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{and design of}} the <b>eccentric</b> <b>gears</b> with the same tooth numbers and eccentricity on both gears is reported. The distance between the centers of the gears varies as they rotate, so the profile shifted gears must {{be used to make}} them rotate {{in the state of the}} minimum center distance. So far, the relation between the minimum center distance and the eccentricity has not been studied. 　In this paper, it is proved that the limit of the eccentricity in possible rotation is determined in terms of the pressure angle of a cutter and that the minimum center distance is obtained as a function of the eccentricity within the limit. By the diagram about these relations and other conditions, the most suitable coefficient of profile shift and tooth numbers to any eccentricity are obtained. Furthermore, a_h= 20 ^o system is more desirable than a_h= 14. 5 ^o system...|$|R

Our {{planet is}} {{continuously}} being depleted of its natural resources {{leading to a}} need to conserve energy and the environment. One of the major energy consumers is the conventional internal combustion engine. Many {{attempts have been made}} to make these conventional internal combustion engines more efficient focusing mostly on the combustion side of the engine. The focus of this study is on the modification of the reciprocating and rotating components of the sub-assembly of a conventional internal combustion engine. An in-depth review was carried out on the fundamentals of spark ignition internal combustion engines and savings on fuel consumptions. A prototype single piston internal combustion engine was developed that can adjust its stroke length. Lengthening or shortening the stroke and simultaneously extending or retracting the connecting rod's travel distance, allows the internal combustion engine to function very efficiently consequently reducing the free space between the piston and cylinder head at TDC position. This allows the internal combustion engine to alter its power capability on demand whilst maintaining relatively high compression efficiency. The method of altering the stroke length is achieved by manipulating gears situated internally and externally of the engine sub-assembly. The control of these <b>eccentric</b> <b>gears</b> lowers or lifts the crankshaft in a radial motion.

50|$|All {{the driving}} wheels have an {{out-of-balance}} {{which is caused}} by their off-center crank pins and attached components. The main driving wheels have the greatest unbalance since they have the biggest crankpin {{as well as the}} revolving portion of the main rod. They also have the valve <b>gear</b> <b>eccentric</b> crank and the back end of the eccentric rod. In common with the linked driving wheels they also have their own portion of the side rod weight. The part of the main rod assigned a revolving motion was originally measured by weighing it supported at each end. A more accurate method became necessary which split the revolving and reciprocating parts based on the position of the center of percussion. This position was measured by swinging the rod as a pendulum. The unbalance in the remaining driving wheels is caused by a crankpin and side rod weight. The side rod weights assigned to each crankpin are measured by suspending the rod on as many scales as there are crankpins or by calculation.|$|R
40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering for the MSc (Major component of research) in Electronic and TelecommunicationVision or visual perception is the most, prominent moans of observation in human beings and primates. The potential of visual perception has caused a substantial research effort {{to be put in}} to machine vision. But still, harnessing the full power of vision is only a fiction than reality. The main reason for this is the over whelming amount of information and complexity that has to be handled. In this context the concept of active vision has attracted t he interest of researchers. An active vision system can be defined as a system capable of manipulating its visual parameters in order to extract useful information about the scene. The main contribution of the this work is the creation of 7 degrees of freedom binocular camera platform with its own optimized FPGA based controller. The objective is to use the created platform to further the knowledge-base in active vision. It consists of two eye modules and a neck module where the two eyes are mounted. The system is able to look at. a particular point in space at a given time and to trace a given trajectory. The camera platform has three degrees of freedom in its neck and two degrees of freedom in its each eye. Stepper motors are used to drive all the degrees of freedom. Stepper motors are used in a closed loop control system with sequential optical encoders to provided feedback information 011 position. Custom built gearwheels are used to increase the torque provided by the motors. since a large number of inputs and outputs have to be handled in parallel and the architecture can be optimized for the types of mathematical calculations required, a FPGA based microprocessor was developed to control the Stereo Camera Platform. it interprets the instructions given by the user and calculates, the angle of rotation for individual degrees of freedom, and the required acceleration. The generation of pulses to drive the stepper motors is also done by the controller. Optical encoder feed back was used by the controller t o correct any error resulting from, step missing of stepper motors or backslash of gear trains. Results show that the velocity profiles, of individual degrees of freedom quite closely follow the expected velocity profiles. The deviations may be due to mechanical deficiencies like uneven friction, and <b>eccentric</b> ness of <b>gear</b> wheels and shafts...|$|R
