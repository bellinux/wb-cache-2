40|$|Aims: This paper {{evaluates the}} {{interactions}} between <b>forest</b> <b>area,</b> CO 2 emissions, rainfall and arable production at a national scale in Cameroon. Methodology: The data used for this analysis was essentially time series data for all the variables spanning the period 1961 - 2000. It uses regression analysis to determine {{the most important of}} these variables that affects CO 2 emissions and uses correlation analysis and coefficient of determination to verify the nature of {{the interactions between}} the variables. Results: The results show that as <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> reduces there is an increase in CO 2 emissions concentration in the air in Cameroon. On the other hand, as <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> and rainfall reduce arable production also reduces but <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> is seen to be more responsible for changes in arable production than rainfall. Conclusion: The study concludes that the interactions between CO 2 and <b>forest</b> <b>area,</b> arable production and <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> seem to be the most significant while rainfall is denoted as very variable from year to year...|$|R

5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and five species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.|$|E

40|$|There {{is plenty}} of forests in Northeast China which {{contributes}} {{a lot to the}} conservation of water and land resources, produces timber products, and provides habitats for a huge number of wild animals and plants. With changes of socio-economic factors as well as the geophysical conditions, there are dramatic changes on the spatial patterns of <b>forest</b> <b>area.</b> In this sense, it is of great significance to shed light on the dynamics of <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> changes to find the underlining reasons for shaping the changing patterns of <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> in Northeast China. To explore the dynamics of <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> change in Northeast China, an econometric model is developed which is composed of three equations identifying forestry production, conversion from open forest to closed forest and conversion from other land uses to closed forest so as to explore the impacts on the <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> changes from demographic, social, economic, location and geophysical factors. On this basis, we employ the Dynamics of Land System (DLS) model to simulate land-use conversions between <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> and non-forest cover and the land-use conversions within the sub-classes of <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> for the period 2000 - 2020 under business as usual scenario, environmental protection scenario and economic growth scenario.

40|$|Forests on {{the urban}} areas are of a great {{importance}} for the biodiversity of this territory. Moreover, they play numerous functions in the environment and constitute, at present, on important element of the ecological urban system. Nevertheless, the changes of the <b>forest</b> <b>areas</b> {{in the city of}} Poznań have never been discussed so far. This article presents the results of research of the changes of <b>forest</b> <b>areas</b> in Poznań within the administrative borders of Poznań in 2004. It was performed for the period 1830 – 2004 for six selected moments in which topographic maps of this area were prepared i. e. 1830, 1888, 1940, 1960, 1979 and 2004 During this period <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> increased by 2367 ha.

In order to increase forest road density, the following must be done: (1) construct connecting roads to the inaccessible <b>forest</b> <b>areas</b> and (2) construct new forest roads with different density in the excluded inaccessible <b>forest</b> <b>areas.</b> The model provides the minimum size of the inaccessible area located at least 300 m away from the existing forest and public road.
