5|$|In 1982, {{a bronze}} state of Brunel was erected {{on the station}} concourse. It was sculpted by John Doubleday and funded by the Bristol and West Building Society. Between 1989 and 1999, the Lawn was re-roofed and {{separated}} from the concourse by a <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> wall. It is surrounded by shops and cafes on several levels.|$|E
5|$|A <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> {{separated}} {{the first class}} platform and circulating area from the platform and circulating area for third class passengers. The third class section was entered from the secondary entrance in Newnham Terrace, and was more sparsely furnished and not equipped with lifts. From the Newnham Terrace entrance a staircase led to a single communal waiting room on the first floor, and to the third class platform on the second floor, much shorter than the first class platform.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 the {{congregation}} constructed its current building at 115 North Market street, a contributing property to the Gospel Hill historic district.

25|$|The {{tradition}} of hanging presidential portraits in this hall dates to President Ulysses S. Grant. The Buchanan administration first began the {{tradition of}} keeping paintings of presidents for the White House collection. The Grants added to this collection, and hung portraits of presidents from Washington to Lincoln in the Cross Hall behind a <b>glass</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
25|$|The station {{concourse}} {{was again}} altered in 1983-4, {{with the total}} cost of refurbishment estimated at £7.4 million. This work included the construction of the black glass building which partially surrounds platforms 1 to 6, and the <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> which separates the concourse from platforms 7 to 9. The alterations also coincided {{with the opening of the}} International Garden Festival. The new development was officially opened by Princess Anne on 29 November 1984.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{project to}} rebuild the site with a modern glass steel complex has been dropped after civic protest in 2007. Since 2009 an archeological park covers the site. Steel {{elements}} indicate the former walls of the early fortified church {{supposed to have been}} the original form of the archiepiscopal see. 39 white benches indicate the likely locations of the former columns of the 5-naved main hall. A single found fundament of one of them can be seen through a <b>glass</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E

25|$|A similar {{device is}} present in Volkov's series. There, it is given as a present to the Scarecrow by the Good Witch of the South. It is a box of pink wood with a thick frosted <b>glass</b> <b>screen.</b> The device is {{password}} activated, and limited in range to the Magic Land (with the exception of deep underground caverns and certain types of magical interference). The box is shown to be virtually indestructible; it withstood repeated abuse from a villain attempting to use it.|$|E
25|$|With Frank Barnes, the university's first {{business}} manager, and {{the generosity}} of individual benefactors, Roy Simpson initiated the commissioning of paintings by Gareth Jones-Roberts, Leonard Lloyd Annois and Charles William Bush to establish the Art Collection. Major sculptural works, such as Allen David's monumental <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> that graces the main entrance to the University Library, were {{also included in the}} original design. The further installation of sculpture in the grounds and paintings throughout the buildings were proposed in the original master plan, and were made possible with funds raised through the 1976 Retirement Appeal for the inaugural vice-chancellor, David Myers.|$|E
25|$|In 1853 Thomas U. Walter {{installed}} a cast iron and clear <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> between the Entrance Hall and Cross Hall to reduce drafts, and a complexly patterned Minton encaustic tile floor. In 1869 Constantino Brumidi, the fresco painter {{who had recently}} painted The Apotheosis of Washington in {{the ceiling of the}} new rotunda and Senate wing of the Capitol, applied highly ornamental painted decoration to the walls and ceilings including profile portraits of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. On the ceiling Brumidi painted allegorical figures of Union and Liberty. They have survived and are displayed in the ground floor of the White House in the Palm Room.|$|E

5|$|The {{station and}} parking tower {{are the main}} {{architectural}} structures. They are the landmarks of Zuoying, and their scale meets {{the conditions of the}} environment. As the major public construction in the city, the station applies <b>glass</b> <b>screens</b> to frame Half-Screen Mountain in the backdrop, a technique referred to as “scenery-borrowing.” The <b>glass</b> <b>screens</b> are supported by a colonnade on the ground floor. As one of the architectural characteristics of southern Taiwan, the colonnade here can relieve the pressure the building might bring to the streets.|$|R

25|$|A {{program of}} {{restoration}} at the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent began in October 2012, and {{is projected to}} last five years. The restoration is {{carried out by the}} Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage (KIK-IRPA) and the onsite project coordinator is Bart JC Devolder. Only the panels being worked on are in the museum at any one time, with the others remaining on display in the cathedral. At the museum the public can see the work in progress from behind a <b>glass</b> <b>screen.</b> The last previous major restoration was conducted in 1950–51, after damage sustained during its stay in the Austrian mines during WWII, during which newly developed techniques, such as x-ray, were applied to the panels.|$|E
25|$|On 20 November 2013, a Class 221 Super Voyager {{diesel-electric}} {{multiple unit}} from London Euston to Chester {{collided with the}} buffer stops on platform 1, riding up over them and smashing a <b>glass</b> <b>screen.</b> There were no injuries, although one passenger was taken to hospital for checks. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch report stated that the incident was due to exceptionally slippery rails, but that {{the consequences of this}} were made more severe by the buffer stop being of an older design, which did not absorb the impact energy effectively. The report further stated that that particular stop had not undergone a risk assessment within the previous ten years, and was possibly not appropriate for class 221 units.|$|E
25|$|Lourdes {{water flows}} from a spring {{at the same}} spot where it was {{discovered}} by Bernadette. The original spring can be seen within the Grotto, lit from below and protected by a <b>glass</b> <b>screen.</b> Pilgrims drink Lourdes water due to its reputed healing power. The water is accessed from individual tap located between the grotto and the baths, The water from Lourdes was thoroughly analysed by independent chemists in 1858 and 1859, and {{does not appear to}} have a latent power to cure and has no special scientific or medicinal properties. Despite this, the water is itself a strong symbol of devotion for Lourdes pilgrims, and many buy statues and rosary beads containing small vials of it, and take home large plastic containers of it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the base}} of the building, the banking hall, now called the Millennium Hall Ballroom, is used as {{function}} space. Separated by a metal and <b>glass</b> <b>screen,</b> the mezzanine levels are used as pre-function space and dining areas. Located by the 12th Street entrance on the ground floor, the lobby is decorated by the original vault door from the third-floor mezzanine, the bronze ceiling from the safe deposit box area, and the tellers' counters from the banking hall. Designed to mimic the building's original style, the lobby contains stainless-steel columns that replicate the ones found on the mezzanine, and the walls are of wood and marble. The ground floor also contains a Solefood Restaurant, Bar, and Lounge and a street-level, glass-walled news studio for the NBC affiliate WCAU.|$|E
25|$|In 1881 Tiffany did the {{interior}} {{design of the}} Mark Twain House in Hartford, Connecticut, which still remains, but the new firm's most notable work came in 1882 when President Chester Alan Arthur refused {{to move into the}} White House until it had been redecorated. He commissioned Tiffany, who had begun {{to make a name for}} himself in New York society for the firm's interior design work, to redo the state rooms, which Arthur found charmless. Tiffany worked on the East Room, the Blue Room, the Red Room, the State Dining Room, and the Entrance Hall, refurnishing, repainting in decorative patterns, installing newly designed mantelpieces, changing to wallpaper with dense patterns, and, of course, adding Tiffany glass to gaslight fixtures and windows and adding an opalescent floor-to-ceiling <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> in the Entrance Hall. The Tiffany screen and other Victorian additions were all removed in the Roosevelt renovations of 1902, which restored the White House interiors to Federal style in keeping with its architecture.|$|E

[...] Arthur took this step to ensure {{procedural}} compliance; {{there had been a}} lingering question about whether a state court judge (Brady) could administer a federal oath of office. He initially took up residence at the home of Senator John P. Jones, while White House remodeling he ordered was carried out, including the addition of an elaborate fifty-foot <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> made by Louis Comfort Tiffany, which remained in a White House corridor until it was dismantled in 1902.|$|E
500|$|The first design, the Mark I, had a {{fuselage}} with {{a circular}} cross-section {{and a small}} round window in the nose for pilot vision. A [...] armored shell protected most of the fuselage. The pilot {{would have been in}} a prone position in the very cramped cockpit (the cross-section was , or approximately a quarter of the cross-section of the Messerschmitt Bf 109.) behind a removable [...] bullet-resistant <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> mounted in front of the pilot. Two small bulges were located {{on the sides of the}} fuselage for the pilot's elbows. Three C-Stoff tanks surrounded the pilot, with the T-Stoff oxidizer tank in the center section between the pilot and the engine. The aircraft had straight wings, mounted at the top of the aircraft. In the dorsal area (at the wing mounts), the fuselage humped to accommodate a [...] blister for a single MK 108 [...] cannon and 60 (other writers say 45) rounds. The Walter HWK 109-509A single-chamber rocket engine was mounted beneath the aft fuselage, which also carried a twin-fin empennage and the drogue parachute housing.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} June 23, 1980, at La Rochelle, France, with scenes involving the Nazi submarine, {{which had been}} rented from the production of Das Boot. The U-boat pen was a real one from World War II. The crew moved to Elstree Studios for the Well of Souls scenes, the opening sequence temple interiors and Marion Ravenwood's bar. The Well of Souls scene required 7,000 snakes. The only venomous snakes were the cobras, but one crew member was bitten on set by a python. The bulk of the snakes' numbers were made up with giant but harmless legless lizards known as Scheltopusiks (Pseudopus apodus) which occur from the Balkan Peninsula of southeastern Europe to Central Asia. Growing to 1.3 m they are the largest legless lizards {{in the world and}} are often mistaken for snakes despite some very obvious differences such as the presence of eyelids and external ear openings, which are both absent from all snakes, and a notched rather than forked tongue. In the finished film, during the scene in which Indiana comes face-to-face with the cobra, a reflection in <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> that protected Ford from the snake was seen, an issue that was corrected in the 2003 digitally-enhanced re-release. Unlike Indiana, neither Ford nor Spielberg has a fear of snakes, but Spielberg said that seeing all the snakes on the set writhing around made him [...] "want to puke".|$|E
