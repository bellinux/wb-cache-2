2500|$|Synchronous {{dynamic random-access memory}} (SDRAM) is any dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) {{where the}} {{operation}} of its external pin interface is coordinated by an externally supplied clock signal. DRAM integrated circuits (ICs) produced from the early 1970s to mid-1990s used an asynchronous interface, in which <b>input</b> <b>control</b> signals have a direct effect on internal functions only delayed by the trip across its semiconductor pathways. SDRAM has a synchronous interface, whereby changes on control inputs are recognised after a rising edge of its clock input. [...] In SDRAM families standardized by JEDEC, the clock signal controls the stepping of an internal finite state machine that responds to incoming commands. These commands can be pipelined to improve performance, with previously started operations completing while new commands are received. The memory is divided into several equally sized but independent sections called banks, allowing the device to operate on a memory access commands in each bank simultaneously and speed access in an interleaved fashion. [...] This allows SDRAMs to achieve greater concurrency and higher data transfer rates than asynchronous DRAMs could.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the use of Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) to effectively manage fishing impacts on all ecosystem components, as required under Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) principles. A consequence of changing from <b>input</b> <b>controls</b> to output-based (catch) management is that {{the control of the}} regulating authority tends to be reduced, which may affect the outcomes for ecosystem management. This study reviewed the use of <b>input</b> <b>controls</b> across six fishing methods in 18 ITQ fisheries, which have been independently accredited as ecologically sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council (12 fisheries) or under Australian environmental legislation for Wildlife Trade Operation (six fisheries). <b>Input</b> <b>controls</b> were retained across a range of ITQ fisheries, with non-selective fisheries such as trawl, gillnet and line employing more <b>input</b> <b>controls</b> than selective fisheries such as purse-seine, pot/trap and dredge. Further case-studies confirmed the widespread and recent use of <b>input</b> <b>controls</b> (spatial and temporal closures) with the aim of managing ecosystem impacts of fishing. The retention of <b>input</b> <b>controls,</b> particularly closures affects the security (quality of title) characteristic of the fishing use right and the theoretical ability of fishers to manage their right for their future benefit. The security characteristic is weakened by closures through loss of access, which undermines industry trust and incentive for long-term decision making. By reducing the security of ITQs, individual fisher incentives and behaviour may separate from societal objectives for sustainability, {{which was one of the}} foremost reasons for introducing ITQ management.

40|$|Variations in the {{efficiency}} of demersal trawlers operating in the English Channel were examined through the estimation of a stochastic frontier production function. The most important measurable factor affecting efficiency was {{the age of the}} vessel. However, unmeasurable factors accounted for about 65 % of the variation in efficiency, and as much as 9 % of the total variation in catches between boats. It is postulated that most of this variation was due to differences in skipper and crew skill. In contrast, “luck ” accounted for around 11 % of the variation in catches between boats. Key words: fisheries management, stochastic production frontier, technical efficiency. <b>Input</b> <b>controls</b> are a common feature of most fisheries management programs throughout the world. An assumption of <b>input</b> <b>controls</b> is that restricting input use indirectly leads to a target level of output being achieved. How-ever, <b>input</b> <b>controls</b> are restricted to inputs that are readily measurable, such as boat size, en-gine power, gear use, and days fished. When other factors affect the level of output, the use-fulness of <b>input</b> <b>controls</b> in achieving target output levels may be limited. For example, when skipper or crew skill is a major factor determining the output of the vessels, con-trolling other inputs may be largely ineffec-tive for many of the boats. Variations in skip-per and crew skill are likely to contribute to the overall technical efficiency of the ves-sel, along with other potentially uncontrolla-ble inputs. The contribution of these inputs to the production process will influence the po-tential success of management through <b>input</b> <b>controls.</b> Early attempts at examining variations i...|$|R

The open loop F- 18 longitudinal control system is stabilized using H 2 and H-infinity singular value loop shaping for a multivariable feedback control system. The H 2 and H-infinity control theories involve suppressing the sensitivity matrix transfer function {{at the lower}} frequencies for high gain performance and suppressing the transmissivity at higher frequencies, i. e., loop shaping. The singular value Bode plot is used for MIMO systems in analogy with the classical Bode frequency analysis for SISO (Single Input Single Output) systems.
