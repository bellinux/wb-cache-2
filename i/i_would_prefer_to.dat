500|$|Following Red 2, Zeta-Jones {{took another}} sabbatical from acting, saying: [...] "If I'm {{going to leave}} my family {{for any length of}} time it had better be for a role that I haven't played before, [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> stay at home". She found the role {{opposite}} Bill Nighy and Toby Jones in the British war comedy film Dad's Army (2016), based on the television sitcom of the same name. She was cast as a glamorous journalist reporting on a British Home Guard platoon based in Walmington-on-Sea. Catherine Bray of Variety found the film to be an [...] "amiable but creaky resurrection" [...] of the popular sitcom, and thought that while Zeta-Jones [...] "hits the required single note with some spirit" [...] she was [...] "generally underused" [...] in it. Zeta-Jones returned to television the following year by portraying the actress Olivia de Havilland in the first season of Ryan Murphy's anthology drama series Feud, subtitled Bette and Joan, about the rivalry between the actresses Joan Crawford and Bette Davis (played by Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, respectively). Dominic Patten of Deadline.com found Zeta-Jones to be [...] "wonderfully cast" [...] and Sonia Saraiya of Variety praised her for providing [...] "the best turn in the show". Displeased with an [...] "unauthorized use of her name and identity" [...] in the series, de Havilland, at 101 years old, sued the network and producers of Feud for invasion of privacy and other personality rights.|$|E
2500|$|... 56 {{years after}} the 1924 Paris Olympics, Scotsman Allan Wells won the 100 metre sprint at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. When asked after the victory if he had run the race for Harold Abrahams, the last 100 metre Olympic winner from Britain (in 1924) who had died two years previously, Wells replied, [...] "No, ... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> {{dedicate}} this to Eric Liddell".|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "state secret" [...] {{refers to}} any {{information}} that, if disclosed publicly, would be reasonably {{likely to cause}} significant harm to the national defense or foreign relations of the United States. Few judges, reading this language, will be likely to challenge the government. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> add a second sentence to the definition: [...] "The assertion of a state secret by the executive branch is to be tested by independent judicial review." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aderca was {{similarly}} troubled by philosemitism. He believed that positive discrimination was counterproductive, and favored race blindness: [...] "When [...] secretly confesses philosemitism, {{all of a}} sudden I have a hunch. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> know he is indifferent." [...] Looking back on Romanian antisemitism, Aderca sided with other Jewish thinkers who looked favorably on ethno-nationalists such as Mihai Eminescu. He argued that Eminescu's work was not particularly antisemitic, and evidenced those traits which gave it universal appeal.|$|E
2500|$|After a brief tour, John K {{decided to}} rejoin Biomechanical full-time. In an interview, John said [...] "I found my self giving Biomechanical less that [...] 100% and {{that bothered me}} a lot... As a {{musician}} {{you have something to}} say and I think you can easily lose direction by playing in two or three bands. I personally find it disorientating and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> focus in my band only." [...] The decision was amicable and the band continued to work on other projects.|$|E
2500|$|Khan has a {{reputation}} for avoiding award ceremonies and not accepting any popular Indian film awards. Though nominated many times, Khan has not attended any Indian film award ceremonies and has stated that [...] "Indian film awards lack credibility". When asked about the selection procedure and authenticity of popular Indian film awards, Aamir Khan said, [...] "Fact is that I have no objections to film awards per se. I just feel that if I don't value a particular film award, then I won't attend it either. Apart from the National Film Awards, I don't see any other award ceremony that I should give value to. My personal experience about these award ceremonies is that I don't trust them. I have no faith in them so <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> stay away." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1996, Bopol {{was living}} in the United States. [...] Georges Collinet {{reported}} on an edition of his radio program Afropop Worldwide devoted to Les Quatre Etoiles, [...] "After more than ten years living in France, Bopol and Nyboma have now come to the US, looking for a new base, because they say that in America, business is business, while in France, people are always looking at the color of your skin." [...] Collinet continued, translating from his interview in French with Bopol for the program, [...] "Bopol says, if there were good studios in Zaire <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> work there, because there I have lots of inspiration -- you can see what people are doing. [...] We compose our songs by observing people around us. [...] In Europe it's very difficult; you have a different life." ...|$|E

Fool for a Lifetime album in its {{entirety}} in Santiago in November 2011. Mike Patton recently sung on the Secret Chiefs 3 song [...] "La Chanson de Jacky" [...] in 2012 giving further speculation by fans on the chance of a reunion. Despite this, Trevor Dunn stated in a February 2013 interview with SF Weekly that there will be no Mr. Bungle reunion, saying, [...] "I've heard the faintest murmurings about it, but honestly I don't think anyone is interested. It's nothing personal, either. We all feel like that band said what it needed to say. It would feel weird and awkward to play that music again. It would take a pant-load of money to make it happen, and honestly, I don't want to do it for that reason. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> let go of it, respectfully." [...] When asked about Mr. Bungle reuniting in an interview published in February 2014, Patton responded by saying, [...] "Who knows? It certainly doesn't seem like it's on the tip of anyone's lips, but I could have said the same thing - and in fact, I did say the same thing - about Faith No More, and that happened. And I think it happened for the better." ...|$|E

"I am called Sancho Mundo, Señores, at your service--sometimes Sancho of the ship-yard-gate, though <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> now <b>to</b> {{be called}} Sancho of the Indies, unless, indeed, it should suit his Excellency Don Christopher {{to take that}} appellation--his claim being {{somewhat}} better than mine." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, during CNN {{coverage}} of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he confronted Sen. Mary Landrieu, Sen. Trent Lott, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about {{their perception of the}} government response. As Cooper said later in an interview with New York magazine, “Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> not <b>to</b> be emotional and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> not <b>to</b> get upset, but it's hard not to when you’re surrounded by brave people who are suffering and in need.” As Broadcasting & Cable magazine noted, [...] "In its aftermath, Hurricane Katrina served to usher in a new breed of emo-journalism, skyrocketing CNN's Anderson Cooper to superstardom as CNN's golden boy and a darling of the media circles because of his impassioned {{coverage of}} the storm." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{must not}} ask me," [...] said the other. [...] "I shall not {{interfere}} with anything that concerns Mrs. Chance.

6000|$|... "I almost think," [...] he said reflectively, [...] "if I was a {{great friend}} of this Englishman's <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> him <b>to</b> {{fall into the hands}} of--such a man as I am. In that case, he would, at least, be {{prevented}} from going back to the bush, which is just now unsafe for him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Just as {{you think}} fit, captain. It will give him time to think over his misdeeds, which no doubt are pretty numerous, for I dare say his career has been a black one.

6000|$|... "But I {{must confess}} that I agreed with her, though <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> {{postpone}} it till {{we heard from}} your family."
