5|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>drive</b> is a {{technique}} for changing wild populations, for instance to combat insects so they cannot transmit diseases (in particular mosquitoes {{in the cases of}} malaria and zika).|$|E
25|$|For example, in rat the murine {{rhodopsin}} <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> {{the expression}} in AAV2, GFP reporter product was {{found only in}} rat photoreceptors, not in any other retinal cell type or in the adjacent RPE after subretinal injection. On the other hand, if ubiquitously expressed immediate-early cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer-promoter is expressed {{in a wide variety}} of transfected cell types. Other ubiquitous promoters such as the CBA promoter, a fusion of the chicken-actin promoter and CMV immediate-early enhancer, allows stable GFP reporter expression in both RPE and photoreceptor cells after subretinal injections.|$|E
50|$|As a result, the <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> {{insertion}} in {{the genome}} will re-occur in each organism that inherits one {{copy of the}} modification and one copy of the wild-type gene. If the <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> is already present in the egg cell (e.g. when received from one parent), all the gametes of the individual will carry the <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> (instead of 50% {{in the case of}} a normal gene).|$|E

5000|$|Following {{surprisingly}} fast {{advances in}} CRISPR editing, an international summit proclaimed in December 2015 {{that it was}} [...] "irresponsible" [...] to proceed with human gene editing until issues in safety and efficacy were addressed. One of the mechanisms that CRISPR can cause existential risk is through <b>gene</b> <b>drives,</b> which {{are said to have}} potential to [...] "revolutionize" [...] ecosystem management. <b>Gene</b> <b>drives</b> are a novel technology that have potential to make genes spread through wild populations like wildfire. They have the potential to quickly spread resistance genes against malaria in order to rebuff the malaria parasite P. falciparum. These <b>gene</b> <b>drives</b> were originally engineered in January 2015 by Ethan Bier and Valentino Gatz - this editing was spurred by the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9. In late 2015, DARPA started to study approaches that could halt <b>gene</b> <b>drives</b> if they went out of control and threatened biological species.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>drives</b> {{may provide}} a {{powerful}} tool to restore balance of ecosystems by eliminating invasive species. Concerns regarding efficacy, unintended consequences in the target species as well as non-target species have been raised particularly in the potential for accidental release from laboratories into the wild. Scientists have proposed several safeguards for ensuring the containment of experimental <b>gene</b> <b>drives</b> including molecular, reproductive, and ecological. Many recommend that immunization and reversal drives be developed in tandem with <b>gene</b> <b>drives</b> in order to overwrite their effects if necessary. [...] There remains consensus that long-term effects must be studied more thoroughly particularly in the potential for ecological disruption that cannot be corrected with reversal drives.|$|R
5000|$|... {{introduce}} a genetic modification in laboratory populations; once a strain or a line carrying the <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> has been produced, the drive {{can be passed}} on to any other line simply by mating. Here the <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> is used to achieve much more easily a task that could be accomplished with other techniques. It requires reinforced confinement of the lab populations to prevent an accidental release of the <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> into the wild.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>drive</b> {{could be}} used to {{eliminate}} invasive species and has, for example, been proposed as a way to eliminate invasive species in New Zealand; in response others have raised the standard objections to the use of <b>gene</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
50|$|Several {{molecular}} mechanisms can mediate <b>gene</b> <b>drive.</b> Naturally occurring <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> mechanisms {{arise when}} alleles evolve molecular mechanisms that {{give them a}} transmission chance greater than the normal 50%. Synthetic genetic modules with similar properties have been developed as a technique for genome editing of laboratory populations. This entry focuses on endonuclease-based <b>gene</b> <b>drive,</b> the most versatile and actively developing molecular backend for synthetic gene drives. Since gene drives function only in sexually reproducing species, they cannot be used to engineer populations of viruses or bacteria.|$|E

50|$|In genetics, <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> is the {{phenomenon}} {{in which the}} inheritance of a particular gene or set of genes is favorably biased. <b>Gene</b> <b>drive</b> can arise {{through a variety of}} mechanisms and results in its prevalence increasing in a population.

5000|$|At the {{molecular}} level, endonuclease <b>gene</b> <b>drives</b> {{work by cutting}} chromosomes that do not encode the drive at a specific site, inducing the cell {{to repair the damage}} by copying the drive sequence onto the damaged chromosome. This is derived from genome editing techniques and similarly relies on the fact that double strand breaks are most frequently repaired by homologous recombination if a template is present, and less often by non-homologous end joining. The cell then has two copies of the drive sequence. To achieve this behavior, endonuclease <b>gene</b> <b>drives</b> consist of two nested elements: ...|$|R

5000|$|... a {{template}} sequence {{used by the}} DNA repair machinery after the target sequence is cut. To achieve the self propagating nature of gene drives, this repair template contains at least the endonuclease sequence. Because the template must be used to repair a double-strand break at the cutting site, its sides are homologous to the sequences that are adjacent to the cutting site in the host genome. By targeting the <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> to a gene coding sequence, this gene will be inactivated; additional sequences can be introduced in the <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> to encode new functions.|$|E

5000|$|CRISPR-Cas9 {{is being}} used in {{conjunction}} with <b>gene</b> <b>drives</b> as a potential to alter the traditional Mendelian laws of inheritance. Researchers have successfully used CRISPR-Cas9 <b>gene</b> <b>drives</b> to modify <b>genes</b> associated with sterility in A. gambiae, the vector for malaria. [...] If used widespread, this technique could suppress A. gambiae populations and with it malaria. Alternate genes are being researched that effect the vectors ability to carry the disease instead of causing intentional sterility and possible extinction. This technique has further implications in eradicating other vector borne diseases such as yellow fever, dengue, Zika, West Nile, Schistomiasis, Leishmaniasis and Lymes disease.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the number}} of generations {{required}} for a <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> to spread in an entire population, it may require under a year for some invertebrates, but centuries for organisms with years-long intervals between birth and sexual maturity, such as humans.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{recombinant}} DNA viruses to transfer genes into hematopoietic cells has been explored. A recombinant simian virus 40 (SV 40) {{in which the}} early region had been replaced with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) <b>gene</b> <b>driven</b> by the promoter from Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), was constructed. This virus transferred the CAT gene more efficiently into mouse and human bone marrow cells and into the K 562, MEL, and WEHI hematopoietic tissue culture cell lines, than the classical calcium phosphate DNA transfer procedure, as shown by assay for CAT activity 48 hr after infection. Recombinant SV 40 virions were also shown {{to be capable of}} stably transforming Chinese hamster ovary cells by use of an early region recombinant containing the methotrexate-resistant dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) <b>gene</b> <b>driven</b> by the RSV promoter. The entire DHFR transcriptional unit could be detected in the genome of transformed cells that were also shown to be resistant to methotrexate. A recombinant adenovirus stock containing the neomycin-resistance <b>gene</b> <b>driven</b> by the SV 40 early promoter was used to infect the K 562 and MEL hematopoietic cell lines to resistance to the antibiotic G 418. Transformation frequency was 10 - to 100 -fold higher than that obtained with calcium phosphate-precipitated DNA. Most or all of the recombinant adenovirus genome was integrated as 1 - 3 copies in the transformed cells. These studies show the feasibility of using DNA viruses for introduction of new genetic material into hematopoietic cells...|$|R
40|$|The two tissue-specific mRNAs {{encoding}} the isozymes of rabbit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) {{are generated}} from the same gene by alternative choice of two transcription initiation sites 5. 7 kb apart. In the current study, we have characterized the regulatory sites controlling the transcription of the larger pulmonary isozyme mRNA. For this purpose, reporter <b>genes</b> <b>driven</b> by varying lengths of upstream region of the ACE gene were transfected into ACE-producing cells. Our results demonstrated that the transcription of this <b>gene</b> is primarily <b>driven</b> by positive elements within the first 274 bp DNA upstream of the transcription initiation site. The reporter <b>gene</b> <b>driven</b> by this region was expressed in two ACE-producing cells but not in two ACE-non-producing cells thereby establishing its tissue specificity. Our experiments also revealed {{the existence of a}} strong negative element located between - 692 and - 610 positions. This element suppressed the expression of the reporter gene in a dose-dependent and position and orientation-independent fashion thus suggesting that it is a true silencer element. It could also repress the expression of a reporter <b>gene</b> <b>driven</b> by the heterologous strong promoter of the beta-actin gene. The repressing effects of the negative element could be partially overcome by cotransfecting the isolated negative element along with the reporter gene containing the negative element. This result was possibly due to the functional removal of a limiting trans-acting factor which binds to this element. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the negative element can form several complexes with proteins present in the nuclear extract of an ACE-producing cell line. At least part of the negative element is strongly conserved in the upstream regions of the human and mouse ACE genes...|$|R
50|$|Applications of <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> include {{preventing}} {{the spread of}} insects that carry pathogens (in particular, mosquitoes that transmit malaria, dengue, and zika pathogens), controlling invasive species, or eliminating herbicide or pesticide resistance. The technique {{can be used for}} adding, disrupting, or modifying genes, such as to cause a crash in the populations of a disease vector by reducing their reproductive capacity.|$|E
50|$|Since it {{can never}} more than double in {{frequency}} with each generation, a <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> introduced in a single individual typically requires dozens of generations to affect a substantial fraction of a population. Alternatively, releasing drive-containing organisms in sufficient numbers can affect the rest within a few generations; for instance, by introducing it in every thousandth individual, it takes only 12-15 generations {{to be present in}} all individuals. Whether a <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> will ultimately become fixed in a population and at which speed depends on its effect on individuals fitness, on the rate of allele conversion, and on the population structure. In a well mixed population and with realistic allele conversion frequencies (≈90%), population genetics predicts that gene drives get fixed for selection coefficient smaller than 0.3; in other words, gene drives can be used not only to spread beneficial genetic modifications, but also detrimental ones as long the reproductive success is not reduced by more than 30%. This is a great contrast with normal genes, which can only spread in large populations if they are beneficial.|$|E
50|$|Because of CRISPR/Cas9's {{targeting}} flexibility, the derived gene drives could theoretically be used {{to engineer}} almost any trait. Unlike previous designs, they could be tailored to block the evolution of drive resistance in the target population by targeting multiple sequences within appropriate genes. CRISPR/Cas9 could also permit a variety of <b>gene</b> <b>drive</b> architectures intended to control rather than crash populations. Noticeably, RNA-guided gene drives could be designed with other RNA-guided endonuclease such as CRISPR/Cpf1.|$|E
