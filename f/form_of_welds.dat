These irregular shapes are surface non-conformances in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>welds,</b> traces or repairs of various forms. Improvement of the aerodynamic {{performance of the}} guide vanes requires understanding {{of the impact of}} these technological features on the flow field and aerodynamics. Experimental study is performed in a linear cascade facility at Chalmers University. In focus of current work are non-conformances in form of welding traces.

The influence of these non-conformances on the cascade aerodynamics is evaluated and validation of CFD results obtained by the k-ε realizable and k-ω SST turbulence models is performed...|$|E
50|$|Unlike other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>welding</b> such as {{arc welding}} (which was {{developed}} in the late 19th century), explosion welding was developed relatively recently, in the decades after World War II. Its origins, however, go back to World War I, when it was observed that pieces of shrapnel sticking to armor plating were not only embedding themselves, but were actually being welded to the metal. Since the extreme heat involved in other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>welding</b> did not play a role, it was concluded that the phenomenon was caused by the explosive forces acting on the shrapnel. These results were later duplicated in laboratory tests and, not long afterwards, the process was patented and put to use.|$|R

50|$|Induction <b>welding</b> is a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>welding</b> {{that uses}} {{electromagnetic}} induction {{to heat the}} workpiece. The welding apparatus contains an induction coil that is energised with a radio-frequency electric current. This generates a high-frequency electromagnetic field that acts on either an electrically conductive or a ferromagnetic workpiece. In an electrically conductive workpiece, the main heating effect is resistive heating, {{which is due to}} induced currents called eddy currents. In a ferromagnetic workpiece, the heating is caused mainly by hysteresis, as the electromagnetic field repeatedly distorts the magnetic domains of the ferromagnetic material. In practice, most materials undergo a combination of these two effects.|$|R

Joining them by fusion welding without or with preheating, controlled cooling under protective gas shield leads to thermal shock failure or porosity at the weld interface. In the present work, a filler material of (ZrB 2 –SiC–B 4 C–YAG) composite with oxidation resistance and thermal shock resistance was produced in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>welding</b> wire.
