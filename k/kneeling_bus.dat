2500|$|Compressed {{natural gas}} (CNG) powered 60-foot Neoplan USA and {{diesel-electric}} hybrid New Flyer articulated buses are {{used on the}} SL4 and SL5 services for greater capacity than that provided by standard buses. Standard (40-foot, non-articulated) diesel and CNG buses are used at night and during snowstorms. As with SL1 and SL2, these buses are wheelchair ramp-equipped, using <b>kneeling</b> <b>bus</b> technology and a flip-out ramp. (See MBTA accessibility for more information.) ...|$|E
2500|$|From South Station to Silver Line Way the Neoplan USA AN460LF {{dual-mode}} 60 foot {{articulated buses}} on these services operate as trolleybuses, powered by overhead electrical wire, to avoid generating internal combustion fumes in the tunnel, and continue on thereafter on diesel power, which {{is converted to}} electrical power to run the same electric motors used when running on overhead power. These buses provide higher capacity than standard 40-foot buses. Both the rear and center wheels are powered by electric motors, which permits these buses to continue operation even through snow. These buses are wheelchair ramp–equipped, using <b>kneeling</b> <b>bus</b> technology and a flip-out ramp. (See MBTA accessibility for more information.) ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to picture {{perceived}} problems amongst older citizens in the traffic environment. Moreover, answers to the question why measures that are known to be efficient concerning the mobility of senior citizens are often not implemented. Eight EU countries participated in the study, involving both senior citizens and experts (researchers, decision makers and practitioners who deal with all aspects of seniors' mobility). Focus group interviews and personal interviews involving 487 senior citizens and 225 experts were carried out in order to chart problems. These were followed by quantitative surveys with 3, 309 senior citizens and 490 experts that had the scope to measure the distribution of charted problems in the population. Finally, five workshops were carried out in order to discuss results and to formulate assumptions why promising measures are not implemented, as it appears. Barriers to mobility are by both experts and senior citizens attributed to traffic and infrastructure characteristics, to legal issues, to vehicle design problems, to inter-personal and inter-generational frictions, to lacking lobby power, but also to individual health problems. In order to improve mobility it is suggested by both senior citizens and experts to enforce vehicle speeds. Both groups also agree that public transport vehicles should be brought into an appropriate standard (low floor vehicles, <b>kneeling</b> <b>busses).</b> Senior citizens more than the experts ask for measures to support the sense of security and safety in the public space (police should be visible, appropriate design of infrastructure, public lighting) ...|$|R
50|$|Low-floor buses {{may also}} be {{designed}} with special height adjustment controls that permit a stationary bus to temporarily lower itself to ground level, permitting wheelchair access. This {{is referred to as}} a <b>kneeling</b> <b>bus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{drawbacks}} include longer length, {{which limits}} their turning radius {{and ability to}} use some lifts or wheelchair-designed access technologies such as <b>kneeling</b> <b>bus</b> lifts. The longer length may also {{make it difficult to}} reach door-opener buttons or doorknobs. Some mobility scooter have low ground clearance which can make it difficult to navigate certain obstacles, such as travelling in cities without proper curb cuts. Navigating in restricted spaces, whether in the home or in public spaces and buildings can also be a problem.|$|E
50|$|Although buses can be {{designed}} any way regardless {{of the number of}} articulations, common bi-articulated bus designs resemble rail vehicle ones—in terms of how it operates—more than standard buses; in particular, considerations such as rapid passenger entry/exit (train type doors—usually elevated) vs. the traditional bus doors (with steps, including <b>kneeling</b> <b>bus)</b> often found on extra long traditional buses. By pushing payment issues (and their delays) to a BRT bus station, physically separating paid passengers by fare gates, and eliminating passenger or bus vertical movement to get on/off the bus, it frees the conductor from delays and complications. This increases throughput, speed, and schedule reliability. The trade-off is the cost of building bus stations vs. simply using a marking or pole to indicate where stops are. Other issues include turning radius and drive control.|$|E

(See MBTA accessibility for more information.)On June 18, 2014,the MBTA contract with Maine Military Authority was approved {{to overhaul the}} 32 Dual-Mode Articulated buses.In November 2014,1112,1117,1125 & 1132 were shipped to Maine as Pilot buses.Pilot bus 1132 was the first bus to complete overhaul.It returned in October 2015 on MBTA property to begin testing.1132 re-entered service on November 11, 2015.In September 2016-November 2016,the MMA haulted the overhaul due to under-bidding.In January 2017,the MBTA had a renegotiated contract with MMA to overhaul the remaining 21 buses (at that time they were 11 overhauled buses).As of May 2017,the overhaul resumed and by June 16, 2017,the first overhauled bus in the renegotiated bid (which would be originally the 12th overhauled bus)re-entered service.Production delivery of buses from MBTA to MMA is to have every bus being delievered every 2.5 weeks (17 consecutive days).Overhaul is currently ahead of schedule.|$|E
