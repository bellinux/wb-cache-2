This study investigates the impact of management earning forecasts on thelong run performance of IPOs in Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). It hypothesizes that the relative accuracy,which is revealed {{at the end of}} IPO year, will affect the pricing process in the market that in turn will affect theIPO 1 year performance. Unlike most prior studies, this study uses relative forecast bias, as the direction of thebias will have different impact on the IPO after-market performance. Using 94 IPOs that went public in 2000 - 2008 in IDX, this study finds some interesting results. In general, the sample shows an average of negativeforecast bias. The upward bias IPOs has a better 1 -year performance than the downward bias IPOs. They alsoappear to have a higher initial performance. Finally, the cross section analysis result shows a robust evidenceto support the research hypothesis that the relative accuracy of management earnings forecast is positivelyrelated to the IPO 1 -year performance...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: We distinctively employ fixed-effects and two-stage least squares regressions to innovatively investigate {{the association between}} the presence of monitoring board committees and <b>market</b> <b>valuation.</b> Findings: We find a significant positive connection between the presence of monitoring board committees and <b>market</b> <b>valuation,</b> but only in corporations that have independent monitoring board committees and/or all three monitoring board committees that we have investigated simultaneously.

40|$|Drawing on {{particular}} socio-economic theories, this paper discusses {{the implications for}} regional studies of the experience economy approach through the broader question of <b>market</b> <b>valuation.</b> Different forms of market construction are identified and compared with regard to distinct models of regional development. It is observed that most of established territorial innovation models give prominence to a technical form of <b>market</b> <b>valuation</b> driven by technological change, by localized innovative production and by the mobility of goods and services. Conversely, experiential valuation primarily points to alternative models of development focusing on the local capacity to set attractive and engaging stages and to exploit consumer mobility. While the former models have mainly been applied to export-based manufacturing, the latter have essentially been applied to leisure, entertainment and tourism activities. The {{second part of the}} paper discusses the limits of technical as well as experiential <b>market</b> <b>valuation</b> {{in the case of the}} Swiss watchmaking industry. In such a case, experience in consumption and technology in production appears as strategic economic resources but what is primarily valued is authentic watchmaking.

40|$|From an Australian {{perspective}} {{there are}} no theoretical concerns with the principle of current <b>market</b> <b>valuation</b> in measuring direct investment equity flows and stocks.

This would ensure that there is a single standard for valuation of direct investment equity, while recognising that different approaches would need to occur in practice. The main issue of concern to be resolved is whether the <b>market</b> <b>valuation</b> standard should be compromised because of practical compilation difficulties by accepting a dual standard (i. e. market price and book value) or the <b>market</b> <b>valuation</b> standard should be strengthened by providing clearer guidance to compilers on how best to approximate current market value.
