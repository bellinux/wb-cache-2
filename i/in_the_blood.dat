5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} tocopherol derivatives and ascorbic acid on methemoglobin formation by nitrite ion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloods</b> of normal and acatalasemic mice were examined.

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome depends on findings such as rapid development of muscle paralysis, absent reflexes, absence of fever, and a likely cause. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (through a lumbar spinal puncture) and nerve conduction studies are supportive investigations commonly {{performed in the}} {{diagnosis of}} GBS. Testing for antiganglioside antibodies is often performed, but their contribution to diagnosis is usually limited. Blood tests are generally performed to exclude the possibility of another cause for weakness, such as {{a low level of}} potassium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> An abnormally low level of sodium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> is often encountered in Guillain–Barré syndrome. This has been attributed to the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, leading to relative retention of water.|$|E

40|$|After giving blood depletion, phenylhydrazine, {{hydrochloric}} acid hydroxylamine, carbon tetrachloride, and carbon black to rabbits the author estimated {{the number of}} Heinz bodies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circulating <b>blood</b> of each animal {{and the number of}} Heinz bodies appearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vitro accelerating test, and studied {{the relationship between the two}} appearances. 1. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> circulating <b>blood</b> of normal rabbits no Heinz body can be recognized. By <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vitro accelerating method erythrocytes containing Heinz bodies amount ot 66. 7 per cent. 2. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> circulating <b>blood</b> of <b>the</b> rabbits depleted of blood once in a small or a large amount, or successively depleted of blood in an intermediate amount no Heinz body can be found. <b>the</b> circulating <b>blood</b> of <b>the</b> rabbits depleted of its blood once in a large amount a few Heinz bodies can be detected. By <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vitro method Heinz bodies appear in an inverse proportion to the number of erythrocytes, but there seems to be no relation with the number of Heinz bodies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circulating <b>blood.</b> 3. When phenylhydrazine is injected, Heinz bodies appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circulating <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> various forms according to the dose of the injection. However, by <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vitro method <b>the</b> greater majority of Heinz bodies appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circulating <b>blood</b> are destroyed, and many Heinz bodies observable in this instance are the ones produced anew in vitro. 4. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case injected with {{hydrochloric acid}} hydrocylamine, Heinz bodies appearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circulating <b>blood</b> are more distinct and erythrocytes themselves are more brilliant than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case injected with phenylhydrazine. Even by <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vitro accelerating method Heinz bodies appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circulating biood are destroyed in a lesser number than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of the phenylhydrazine injection. 5. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> rabbits administered with carbon tetrachloride Heinz bodies can be recognized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circualting <b>blood</b> soon after <b>the</b> injection but they are a few in number and small <b>in</b> size. By <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vitro method <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> taken from 10 to 12 days after the injection an intermediate number of Heinz bodies are formed. 6. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case injected repeatedly with carbon black Heinz bodies appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circulating <b>blood</b> 2 to 4 days after the initiation of the injection, and by <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vitro accelerating method Heinz bodies increase as long as the injection is kept up, but they decrease <b>in</b> number at <b>the</b> cessation of the injection. It seems that the function of the reticuloendothelial system is responsible for the formation of Heinz bodies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circulating <b>blood</b> while <b>the</b> carbon black injection itself is greatly responsible for the appearance of Heinz bodies by <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vitro method. From these, <b>the</b> Heinz body <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circulating <b>blood</b> has <b>the</b> characteristic traits that are different from those of the Heinz body appearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vitro accelerating method. Therefore even the latter is present in vivo in a preparatory state, it is believed that the latter will not immediately be transformed into <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vivo Heinz body...|$|R
