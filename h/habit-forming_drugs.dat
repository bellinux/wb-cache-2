5000|$|For {{years the}} {{government}} has been debating the subject of peyote use. In 1949 peyote use was condemned by the American Medical Association because findings in their study led them to believe that it was <b>habit-forming</b> <b>drug.</b> Congress then attempted to regulate the use of peyote in 1963 with little success, but under the Drug Abuse Control Act in 1965 it was on the list of forbidden psychedelic drugs. Under this act it did not place this on Native American peyotists who were using it for religious practice, though some suffered still under the hands of the state governments for having it in their possession. State laws differed from the United States government standards with states outlawing the use of peyote. “By 1970, of the seventeen states that still had anti-peyote laws, only five did not provide exemptions for Indians to use peyote ritually.” These were amended under the pressure from the Native American Church member if the members showed proof that they were at least 25 percent Native American. The states laws were generally similar to those of South Dakota, which says that [...] "when used as a sacrament in services of the Native American Church in a natural state which is unaltered except for drying or curing or slicing", peyote use is permitted. In 1978 the American Indian Religious Freedom Act there was mention of protection for peyote users, but this did not change the fact that they could still be charged. Because it is an “established religion of many centuries’ history...not a 20th century cult nor a fad subject to extinction at a whim”, it continues to be somewhat protected under the law.|$|R

This study also aimed at instituting an educational-preventive program and evaluating its efficacy. The subjects’ mean age was 29. 17 years (sd = 11. 40; n = 95). From all subjects (n = 102), 72. 54 % had the habit of eating between meals, and 69. 60 % did not utilize dental floss. The observed DMFT was 14. 88 (sd = 6. 38; n = 86). The initial PHP was 2. 34 (sd = 0. 69; n = 14) and, after 3 months, it was reduced to 1. 91 (sd = 0. 74; n = 14). The initial salivary flow was 1. 31 ml/min (sd = 0. 7; n = 97). Due to the fluctuation of this group, only 13 of the original subjects were reevaluated after 3 months, when a salivary flow of 1. 13 ml/min (sd = 0. 49) was registered.

50|$|The lateral {{hypothalamus}} and medial forebrain bundle {{has been}} the most-frequently-studied brain-stimulation reward site, particularly in studies {{of the effects of}} drugs on brain stimulation reward. The neurotransmitter system that has been most-clearly identified with the habit-forming actions of drugs-of-abuse is the mesolimbic dopamine system, with its efferent targets in the nucleus accumbens and its local GABAergic afferents. The reward-relevant actions of amphetamine and cocaine are in the dopaminergic synapses of the nucleus accumbens and perhaps the medial prefrontal cortex. Rats also learn to lever-press for cocaine injections into the medial prefrontal cortex, which works by increasing dopamine turnover in the nucleus accumbens. Nicotine infused directly into the nucleus accumbens also enhances local dopamine release, presumably by a presynaptic action on the dopaminergic terminals of this region. Nicotinic receptors localize to dopaminergic cell bodies and local nicotine injections increase dopaminergic cell firing that is critical for nicotinic reward. Some additional <b>habit-forming</b> <b>drugs</b> are also likely to decrease the output of medium spiny neurons as a consequence, despite activating dopaminergic projections. For opiates, the lowest-threshold site for reward effects involves actions on GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, a secondary site of opiate-rewarding actions on medium spiny output neurons of the nucleus accumbens. Thus GABAergic afferents to the mesolimbic dopamine neurons (primary substrate of opiate reward), the mesolimbic dopamine neurons themselves (primary substrate of psychomotor stimulant reward), and GABAergic efferents to the mesolimbic dopamine neurons (a secondary site of opiate reward) form the core of currently characterized drug-reward circuitry.|$|E

30|$|Initial {{evaluation}} of obese patients {{for inclusion in}} the study was done at their first scheduled preoperative assessment. Inclusion criteria were written informed consent and age >  18  years. Exclusion criteria were history of psychiatric disease or mental disorder, use of marijuana or other <b>habit-forming</b> <b>drugs</b> and inability to follow preoperative orders. All patients were instructed to quit smoking at least 8  weeks before scheduled surgery. On admission to the hospital, patients were asked if they followed preoperative instructions and quit smoking before their operation (Warner 2006). All patients stated they quit smoking at least 2  months (= 8  weeks) before surgery. All patients were evaluated with standardized anesthetic preoperative assessment (The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland 2007). This was important because morbidly obese patients can have profound cardio-respiratory dysfunction which remains asymptomatic due to limited mobility. Preoperative assessment also included screening for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is common in morbidly obese patients and can predispose to hypoventilation, difficult mask ventilation, shunt with rapid arterial oxygen desaturation. In addition, OSA warrants particular attention during emergence from anesthesia, extubation and in the immediate postoperative period.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was {{the description of the}} work of the Child and Adolescent Detoxification Centre in Prague, its importance in the treatment drug addiction among children and adolescents. Another objective was to find out about the interrelationship of the work of regional coordinators for the prevention of risk behaviour and forms of follow-up therapy according to individual needs and nature of Child and Adolescent Detoxification Centre in Prague. The research conducted in the period from January to March 2010. Mapping the variants of follow-up therapy of the clients using <b>habit-forming</b> <b>drugs</b> in different regions of the Czech Republic and the forms of prevention are other objectives. The theoretical part of the thesis contains the description of the establishment of the Hospital of Sisters of Mercy of St. Charles Borromeo, in the premises of which the Child and Adolescent Detoxification Centre (CaADC) in Prague is located, as well as the description of the CaADC, and its medical and other personnel. The thesis describes the process of hospitalization, tests which preceded it and the necessary procedures to ensure successful completion of the hospitalization. Part of the theoretical block is dedicated to the care provided by a social worker, psychologist and therapists. Related legislation that forms the basis of prevention methods of individual regional drug coordinators and the centre itself {{is an integral part of}} the work. Prevention is a critical form of struggle against the abuse of psychotropic substances by children and adolescents. It is described in detail here, as well as the factors involved in the development of addiction. Other related terms only complement the mosaic of the studied issue. Within quantitative research, a content analysis of the data from the statistics of the Child and Adolescent Detoxification Centre in Prague was used to verify set hypotheses. The responses of regional drug coordinators to a set of open and semi-open questions, which were formulated for this purpose, were also used. Another source was the results of standardized interviews with three doctors at the Child and Adolescent Detoxification Centre in Prague. Hypotheses 1, 3 and 5 have not been confirmed. On the contrary, hypotheses 2 and 4 have been confirmed. The set objectives have been met. Unfortunately, our country still lacks a sufficient number of facilities that provide follow-up care of child drug addicts, as is clear from the research...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{problems}} of hazardous behavior with adolescents {{are getting into}} the foreground of the wide public. The problem of hazardous behavior with children, adolescents or young people is very real, {{not only in the}} Czech Republic, but all over the world, at prezent, it is a worldwide problem representing a substantial social problem with which many specialists in the field of psychologists, psychiatrics, educators, politics and other participating institucions, World Health Organization, are dealing. The Publisher results of research are pointing to a non- decreasing occurrence of hazardous behavior, where it comes to a basic shifting to a lower age group {{from the point of view}} of the gender eguality, when the girls and boys engage in hazardous behavior with different circumstances, conditions and occurrence. A whole range of research on this theme exists, but it does not fully concern the hazardous behavior, for instance in connection with information technologies, cell phones and using of <b>habit-forming</b> <b>drugs.</b> The thesis is divided in the theoretical and the practical part. In the theoretical part, the selected forms of hazardous behavior with children and the gender problems are described. In the practical part, the quantitative research method has been chosen,a method of gathering data by means of a questionnaire. The research summary for questionnaire inquiry was created by pupils attending the 7 th to 9 th school year of the primary schools in the South Bohemian region. The aim and purpose of the thesis was to find the appearance of selected risk behaviour with the children from the point of view of the gender, and to map the differences with a view to the gender problems. The aim was accomplished. There were four hypothesis stated. H 1 : The boys are a more endangered group in occurance of a hazardous behavior in connection with alkohol than the girls. H 2 : There is a higher risk in connection with usaje non-legal drugs about boys than about girls. H 3 : Boys are more endangered in the occurrence of a hazardous behavior in connection with habit-forming behavior relating to virtual milieu. H 4 : Girls are more endangered in connection with communication technology. The thesis may be used as an information survey of a selected hazardous behavior with the children and with the gender problems. The results of the research can be used as informative material for the lay public, for children and adolescents, for parents and other specialists (anti-drug coordinator, methodic of school prevention and not least for the education or as basics for a further following research aktivity. Further, the results of the research can be used for a closer determination of suitable prevention programs. For this reason, the results of the research were given to schools, where the research observation proceeded for the purpose of enhancement of the primarily preventive activity...|$|E
