40|$|In this {{dissertation}} we aim {{to explore}} how line managers can contributeto bringing about an effective Human Resource Management (HRM) in the organisation. More specifically, our objectives are to investigate (1) the prerequisites of <b>effective</b> HRM <b>implementation</b> by line managers and (2) the importance of HRM implementation by exploring the link between (in) <b>effective</b> HRM <b>implementation</b> by line managers and employee outcomes. We add to Strategic HRM literature by focusing on line management; a neglected but important HR actor. We also add to HR devolution literature -which has up till now been rather descriptive and a-theoretical - by providing a theoretical base that can explain how <b>effective</b> HRM <b>implementation</b> is realised, and why it is {{important in terms of}} employee and organisational outcomes. A first important finding is that HRM implementation effectiveness differs between line managers and that both organisational and individual prerequisites of <b>effective</b> HRM <b>implementation</b> seem to be of importance. Furthermore, an <b>effective</b> HRM <b>implementation</b> by linemanagers is positively related to employees' affective commitment to the organisation, above and beyond the leadership behaviour of the line manager. Finally, we found evidence that the HR department should remain directly accessible to employees - even {{in the case of an}} advanced HRM implementation responsibility for line managers in the organisation - since employees' perceptions of the service quality by the HR department arealso positively related to their organisational commitment. nrpages: 163 status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|There remain {{several areas}} in which {{systemic}} problems appear to delay resolution of cases. Mexico has no implementing legislation integrating the Convention into the Mexican legal system. The Convention, therefore, is implemented under existing state family code and varies from state to state. This lack of a legal structure facilitating the Convention's operation is a major obstacle to the Convention's <b>effective</b> <b>implementation</b> in Mexico. Significant processing delays have occurred {{in at least two}} of the states. However, one of these states has recently notified the Mexican Central Authority that the primary judicial concern delaying cases has been resolved and has pledged to process cases more expeditiously. The Department is also encouraged by recent discussions with the Mexican Central Authority concerning plans for the development of implementing legislation.|$|E
25|$|No {{matter how}} {{sustainable}} a building {{may have been}} in its design and construction, it can only remain so if it is operated responsibly and maintained properly. Ensuring operations and maintenance(O) personnel are part of the project's planning and development process will help retain the green criteria designed {{at the onset of the}} project. Every aspect of green building is integrated into the O phase of a building's life. The addition of new green technologies also falls on the O staff. Although the goal of waste reduction may be applied during the design, construction and demolition phases of a building's life-cycle, it is in the O phase that green practices such as recycling and air quality enhancement take place. O staff should aim to establish best practices in energy efficiency, resource conservation, ecologically sensitive products and other sustainable practices. Education of building operators and occupants is key to <b>effective</b> <b>implementation</b> of sustainable strategies in O services.|$|E

Dunham awarded the game 8.3 out of 10 and called the plot twists [...] "shocking and clever". Kasavin rated it 6.1 out of 10 and wrote that, [...] "n its own merits, Quarantine isn't a bad game, and [...] should find it to have a satisfying conclusion that, sure enough, leaves the possibility for further adventures in The World". He also called Bandai's decision to add 60 to 80 hours of padding to the game, split it into four full-priced products, and release these as a series disappointing. Nutt was similarly disappointed with the final game, awarding it two stars out of five. He wrote that the story was well-presented and excellent, {{but that it was}} only present in the game's first and last quarters. He was satisfied by the game's ending and loved its story, style, and characters, but grew tired of the game's [...] "endless chains of chambers, these easily-defeated enemies, this total lack of strategy". The Game Informer reviewer hoped to see a more <b>effective</b> <b>implementation</b> of [...]hacks concept in the future. Japanese magazine Famitsu Weekly gave the [...]hack games scores in the 29 to 30 out of 40 range, indicating average reviews.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} reveals that strategy implementation is {{an important component of the}} strategic management process. Research indicates that the ability to implement a strategy is viewed as considerably more important than strategy formulation, and that strategy implementation, rather than strategy formulation, is the key to superior organisational performance. However, the high failure rate of strategy implementation efforts is well documented, and many barriers to <b>effective</b> strategy <b>implementation</b> exist. A lack of leadership, and specifically strategic leadership, at the top of the organisation has been identified as one of the major barriers to <b>effective</b> strategy <b>implementation.</b> In turn, strategic leadership is also viewed as a key driver to <b>effective</b> strategy <b>implementation.</b> In the light of the identified problem, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the perceived role of strategic leadership in strategy implementation in South African organisations. The conclusion is that strategic leadership positively contributes to <b>effective</b> strategy <b>implementation</b> in South African organisations.

500|$|The Dreamcast {{controller}} {{includes both}} an analog stick and a digital pad, four action buttons, and two analog triggers. The system has four ports for controller inputs, {{although it was}} bundled with only one controller. The design of the Dreamcast's controller, described by the staff of Edge as [...] "an ugly evolution of Saturn's 3D controller," [...] was called [...] " [...] that great" [...] by 1UP.com's Sam Kennedy and [...] "lame" [...] by Game Informers Andy McNamara. [...] The staff of IGN wrote that [...] "unlike most controllers, Sega's pad forces the user's hands into an uncomfortable parallel position." [...] In contrast to the Sega CD and Sega Saturn, which included internal backup memory, the Dreamcast uses a 128 kbyte memory card called the VMU (or [...] "Visual Memory Unit") for data storage. The VMU features a small LCD screen, audio output from a one-channel PWM sound source, non-volatile memory, a directional pad, and four buttons. The VMU can present game information, {{be used as a}} minimal handheld gaming device, and connect to certain Sega arcade machines. [...] For example, players use the VMU to call plays in NFL 2K or raise virtual pets in Sonic Adventure. Sega officials noted that the VMU could be used [...] "as a private viewing area, the absence of which has prevented <b>effective</b> <b>implementation</b> of many types of games in the past." [...] After a VMU slot was incorporated into the controller's design, Sega's engineers found many additional uses for it, so a second slot was added. This slot was generally used for vibration packs providing force feedback like Sega's [...] "Jump Pack" [...] and Performance's [...] "Tremor Pack", although it could also be used for other peripherals including a microphone enabling voice control and player communication. Various third-party cards provide storage, and some contain the LCD screen addition.
