40|$|IntroductionEvidence-based {{technical}} assistance {{may be needed}} to implement recent federal policy to prevent childhood obesity through the schools. The Healthy Schools Program is the largest school-based obesity prevention program in the United States. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the role of the program's training and {{technical assistance}} and to explore other contributing factors in changing school policies, practices, and environments. MethodsWe analyzed interim progress of schools recruited during the 2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009 school years as of December 2010. Schools reported progress through an online inventory of policies, practices, and school environment. We compared baseline inventories to the most recent follow-up and tracked both training attendance and contact with national experts. To identify the factors associated with progress, we performed regression analysis on school level and <b>demographics,</b> <b>number</b> of months between baseline and follow-up, and technical assistance. ResultsThe amount of training and technical assistance was significantly associated with school progress, controlling for school level and <b>demographics,</b> <b>number</b> of months between baseline and follow-up, and school status at baseline. Although all types of schools saw progress, schools in the South had the most progress and urban schools had the least progress.

40|$|Background: Although {{foreign body}} {{ingestion}} {{is a common}} problem, poor knowledge for the treatment still remains a major obstacle, especially in preventing complications. Phosphate enemas were applied for chronic constipation {{for a long period}} of time. This study aims to evaluate the effect of a single dose of phosphate enema on bowel movements in patients who suffer from foreign body ingestion. Materials and Methods: Forty consecutive patients admitted to our emergency unit for foreign body ingestion were randomized into two groups. Patients in both groups were followed up with daily imaging and physical examinations. Cases in Group SP received daily doses of sodium phosphate enemas, while Group C did not. <b>Demographics,</b> <b>number</b> of X-rays, radiation dose, and period of the foreign body passage were recorded and compared between two groups. Also, data of patients who ingested pins (Group P) were compared with of those who ingested other materials (Group O). Results: There was no statistical difference between groups (Group SP vs. Group C and Group P vs. Group O) comparing <b>demographics,</b> <b>number</b> of X-rays, total amount of radiation doses (p > 0. 05 for all comparisons). The period of foreign body passage was shorter in Group SP (3. 4 ± 1. 6 days vs. 6. 2 ± 3. 8 days; p = 0. 005). Also, patients who ingested pins were compared to patients who ingested other materials. Pins were ingested by 23 (65 %) patients. These were older (16. 6 ± 9. 4 years vs. 4. 8 ± 3. 5 years; p = 0. 001) and generally females (78. 3 % vs. 29. 4; p = 0. 006). Contrary to the other cases, pins were less frequently confirmed in stool in patients who ingested pins (p = 0. 02). Conclusion: A single dose of phosphate enema use may hasten the passage of the foreign bodies. Ingestion of pins is the more common especially in young females. The evacuation of pins is generally recognized with direct examination of the stool, so daily imaging may not be necessary for this group of patients...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we measure}} the main factors {{explaining}} nominal output growth and deviations from trend output in Switzerland {{over the period}} 1980 to 2001. The decompositions {{are based on the}} GDP function and its dual, the national income function. The results indicate that whereas nominal output growth frequently reflects movements in domestic prices, it is capital formation that makes the largest contribution to real output growth, followed by gains in total factor productivity and improvements in the terms of trade. Deviations of real output from trend appear to have been driven by deviations of labour utilization, of productivity and, during the first decade, of the terms of trade from their respective long-run trends. The important role attributed to productivity and the terms of trade support the view that the customary measures of the output gap should be used with caution when formulating monetary policy.
