40|$|Bubble content {{influences}} magma rheology and, thus, {{styles of}} volcanic eruption. Increasing magma vesicularity affects the bulk viscosity of the bubble-melt suspension {{and has the}} potential to promote non-Newtonian behavior in the form of shear localization or brittle failure. Here, we present a series of high temperature uniaxial deformation experiments designed to investigate the effect of bubbles on the magma bulk viscosity. The starting materials are cores of natural rhyolitic obsidian synthesized to have variable vesicularity (φ= 0 - 66 %). The <b>foamed</b> <b>cores</b> were deformed isothermally (T= 750 °C) at atmospheric conditions using a high-temperature uniaxial press under constant displacement rates (strain rates between 0. 5 - 1 × 10 - 4 s- 1) and to total strains of 10 - 40 %. The viscosity of the bubble-free melt (η 0) was measured by micropenetration and parallel plate methods to establish a baseline for experiments on the vesicle rich cores. At the experimental conditions, rising vesicle content produces a marked decrease in bulk viscosity that is best described by a two-parameter empirical equation: log 10 ηBulk=log 10 β 0 - 1. 47 [φ/(1 -φ) ] 0. 48. Our parameterization of the bubble-melt rheology is combined with Maxwell relaxation theory to map the potential onset of non-Newtonian behavior (shear localization) in magmas as a function of melt viscosity, vesicularity, and strain rate. For low degrees of strain (i. e. as in our study), the rheological properties of vesicular magmas under different flow types (pure vs. simple shear) are indistinguishable. For high strain or strain rates where simple and pure shear viscosity values may diverge, our model represents a maximum boundary condition. Vesicular magmas can behave as non-Newtonian fluids at lower strain rates than unvesiculated melts, thereby, promoting shear localization and (explosive or non-explosive) magma fragmentation. The extent of shear localization in magma influences outgassing efficiency, thereby, affecting magma ascent and the potential for explosivity...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sandwich plates used {{in marine}} {{structures}} {{are made of}} laminated face sheets bonded to a structural <b>foam</b> <b>core.</b> Low-velocity impact by a stiff indenter may cause local deflection of the face sheet and permanent deformation or crushing of an underlying volume of the <b>foam</b> <b>core.</b> Upon unloading, the face sheet tends to spring back, while the permanent strain in the core gives rise to residual stresses that may nucleate local interfacial cracks. Extension of such interfacial cracks by applied loads can compromise structural integrity. This article examines the protective effect of thin, ductile interlayers, inserted between the face sheet and the <b>foam</b> <b>core,</b> that absorb the face sheet deflection and thus prevent or reduce the extent of damage to the <b>foam</b> <b>core.</b> Finite element solutions are obtained for a stiff, incompressible, and very ductile polyurethane (PUR) interlayer, and also for a compliant and compressible elastomeric foam (EF) layer, in a sandwich plate made of quasi-isotropic AS 4 / 3501 - 6 laminated face sheets and H 100 PVC core. Loading is applied by a concentrated force acting on a rigid cylindrical indenter. Results show that the PUR interlayer better supports the impacted face sheet than does the <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> or the EF interlayer. The PUR layer also reduces the extent of permanent deformation of the <b>foam</b> <b>core.</b> At a given magnitude of applied load, the energy release rate for cracks extended by residual stresses at the interface between the <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> and either interlayer is much lower than that at the interface between the face sheet and the <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> in the conventional design.

40|$|AbstractAnalytical {{predictions}} {{are presented}} for the plastic collapse strength of lightweight sandwich beams having pin-reinforced <b>foam</b> <b>cores</b> that are loaded in 3 -point bending. Both polymer and aluminum <b>foam</b> <b>cores</b> are considered, whilst the facesheet and the pins {{are made of}} either composite or metal. Four different failure modes are account for: metal facesheet yield or composite facesheet microbuckling, facesheet wrinkling, plastic shear of the core, and facesheet indentation beneath the loading rollers. A micromechanics-based model is developed and combined with the homogenization approach to calculate the effective properties of pin-reinforced <b>foam</b> <b>cores.</b> To calculate the elastic buckling strength of pin reinforcements, the pin-reinforced <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> is treated as assemblies of simply supported columns resting upon an elastic foundation. Minimum mass design of the sandwich is then obtained {{as a function of}} the prescribed structural load index, subjected to the constraint that none of the above failure modes occurs. Collapse mechanism maps are constructed and compared with the failure maps of foam-cored sandwich beams without pin reinforcements. Finite element simulations are carried out to verify the analytical model and to study the performance and failure mechanisms of the sandwich subject to loading types other than 3 -point bending. The results demonstrate that the weaker the foam is, the more optimal the pin-reinforced <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> becomes, and that sandwich beams with pin-reinforced polymer <b>foam</b> <b>cores</b> are structurally more efficient than foam- or truss-cored sandwich beams...|$|R

This problem is more difficult with lower stiffness <b>foam</b> <b>cores</b> under high shear loading because the core is typically the weakest component of the structure and {{is the first one}} to fail in shear under the assuming of perfect contact between the skin and the <b>foam</b> <b>core.</b> In the present study, the shear response of the composite sandwich panels with Polyvinylchloride (PVC) <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> was investigated.
