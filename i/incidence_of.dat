5|$|Despite these differences, {{the leading}} causes {{of death in the}} United States are remarkably similar for men and women, headed by heart disease, which {{accounts}} for a quarter of all deaths, followed by cancer, lung disease and stroke. While women have a lower <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> death from unintentional injury (see below) and suicide, they have a higher <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> dementia (Gronowski and Schindler, Table I).|$|E
5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> seizures.|$|E
5|$|The <b>{{incidence}}</b> <b>of</b> TBI {{varies by}} age, gender, region and other factors.

The annual <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> mild TBI {{is difficult to determine}} but may be 100–600 people per 100,000.|$|E
30|$|The <b>incidences</b> <b>of</b> {{drought in}} the study area {{indicate}} that, out of 32  years under study, only 12  years were free from drought. The first (1986 – 1995) and third (2006 – 2017) decades experienced very high <b>incidences</b> <b>of</b> droughts, particularly mild to severe droughts, thus making the decades the driest period. However, the second decade (1996 – 2005), witnessed the least <b>incidences</b> <b>of</b> droughts, thus making the period relatively wet compared to other decades. Some of the droughts that occurred during the period of study were localized, while other <b>incidences</b> <b>of</b> droughts affected the entire study area with serious negative consequences on the vital life support systems (rivers, wetlands and rangelands) that provide means of livelihood to the households.|$|R
