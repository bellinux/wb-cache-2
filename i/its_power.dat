40|$|Name: A {{governing}} body acting beyond <b>its</b> <b>powers</b> Recodification of civil law {{has changed the}} way in which business corporations have been acting. Governing body members are currently representing trade corporation as its representatives. This shift, which is that {{governing body}} members became the representatives of business corporations opened the possibility of discussion about the nature of authorization of governing body to act on behalf of the trade corporation and about the possibility of acting beyond <b>its</b> <b>powers.</b> My thesis was called "A governing body acting beyond its powers". I used as a base for this work the wide authorization that governing body possesses in acting on behalf of the trade corporation and its possible limitations by law. Besides governing body acting beyond <b>its</b> <b>powers</b> I focused in this work on two other types of acts that although they are done within its competence, aren't done in accordance with the law and the partnership agreement. Work has been divided into three main chapters. In the chapter about governing body acting beyond <b>its</b> <b>powers</b> I examined the possibility of governing body to act beyond <b>its</b> <b>powers</b> in relation to limitation of authorization that governing body possesses in acting on behalf of the trade corporation and the applicable law.
