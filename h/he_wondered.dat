5|$|On {{the same}} day the Red Sox won Game 3, The Boston Globes Dan Shaughnessy wrote that, as this win brought the Red Sox on the verge of winning a World Series, <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> how many people in New England were {{thinking}} about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox and hoping that one day, they would see the Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E
5|$|After {{resuming}} production, Navarro {{questioned the}} methods of the Chili Peppers' recording procedures. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> why such {{a considerable amount of}} jamming was involved with the album's conception. Various qualms followed, and the process soon became uncomfortable for the band. Months went by, and only small amounts of material were written. Kiedis made a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan in December, where his family realized he'd resumed an active addiction once again. He returned to Hollywood in late January 1995, when he finally finished recording his vocals. The rest of the recording was completed within the next month.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 Nuttin {{published}} his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 {{with the help}} of Hilde Sas. Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying affective and cognitive processes at work. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.|$|E

5|$|When Terra's {{character}} was first revealed, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish found {{him to be}} very similar to Zack Fair from Final Fantasy VII to the point where <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> whether he would actually be Zack. However, when considering Terra's weapon being a Keyblade in contrast to all the other Final Fantasy characters shown in previous Kingdom Hearts games, he thought he may not be Zack. Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central found there have been various speculations regarding the similarities between Terra and Zack, but thought it would not be strange considering the existence of Nobodies in the series. Selecting Terra for a demo of Birth by Sleep IGN's Ryan Clements agreed with Parish, finding only minor differences between their outfits.|$|E
5|$|Johnson began {{thinking}} of life after basketball while still {{playing with the}} Lakers. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> why so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he {{had a meeting with}} Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2006-07, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.|$|E

25|$|If Blackmun's dissent {{recognized}} that, <b>he</b> <b>wondered,</b> {{how could}} the majority not have? The ensuing decision in Rodriguez suggested to him that it did. Lower courts, he concluded, must in such cases be free to use anticipatory overruling.|$|E
25|$|Nearly 100 years ago, Harvey Cushing, {{the father}} of neurosurgery, noted that {{pituitary}} gland problems often cause mental health disorders. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> whether the depression and anxiety he observed in patients with pituitary disorders were caused by hormonal abnormalities, the physical tumor itself, or both.|$|E
25|$|Solomon {{believes}} {{that his son}} is alive, just perhaps not in the U.S. In spring of 2011, after the visit to the doctor {{that was the last}} independent record of Sky's presence outside of Biryukova's household, he recalled that her estranged father came from Ukraine to visit her. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> to the Weekly if the older man could have taken the boy back to that country with him at the time. But he admitted that by 2013 {{he did not know how}} that could have happened.|$|E

25|$|McGovern {{had failed}} to act quickly when he learned of the mental health {{problems}} (though not their severe extent) because his own daughter was seriously depressed and <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> what effect dumping Eagleton because of his depression would have on her. Ultimately, Eagleton threatened that if McGovern tried to force him off the ticket, he would fight the move. Eagleton conditioned his resignation on McGovern's releasing a statement, written by Eagleton, that Eagleton's health was fine and that McGovern had no issues with Eagleton's mental status.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Scottish Football Association invited Drummond {{to write}} and record a theme song for the Scotland {{national}} football team's 1998 FIFA World Cup campaign. Drummond decided against doing it (Del Amitri got the job) but <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> if he had twisted fate by declining, because the other major football songs of that year were made by associates of his: Keith Allen ("Vindaloo") and Ian Broudie ("Three Lions"), two men he had met {{on the same day}} when working on Illuminatus! in 1976, and former protege Ian McCulloch.|$|E
25|$|John Dean {{believed}} that he, Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman {{could go to}} the prosecutors, tell the truth, and save the presidency. Dean wanted to protect the president and have his four closest men take the fall for telling the truth. During the critical meeting between Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president’s depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up. It was during this meeting that Dean felt that he was being recorded. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> if this was due to the way Nixon was speaking, {{as if he were trying}} to prod attendees’ recollections of earlier conversations about fundraising. Dean mentioned this observation while testifying to the Senate Committee on Watergate, exposing the thread of what were taped conversations that would unravel the fabric of the conspiracy.|$|E

25|$|Andersen {{was the son}} of Knut Severin Andersen b. Grothaug (1882–1948), from Hornindal in Nordfjord, who was a {{gardener}} in Stavanger, and Elise Andersen b. Rafoss (1890–1987) from Stavanger (Kvinesdal). Because his father was {{a gardener}} they had a car, which was rare at the time, and using this they went on skiing in the winter and fishing in the summer. He enjoyed going for long skiing tours in the mountains in Stavanger, when he was young, and several times he crossed Trollgaren in Ryfylke, this marvelous moraine that is appropriate to its name. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> how it was formed, and was told by the local farmer that it was really Trolls that had set up the meandering fence of huge boulders, far above the tree line. The curiosity for this natural phenomenon in addition to many others in turn led to his interest for the Ice Age.|$|E
25|$|Between 1603 and 1613 Sir Walter Raleigh was a {{prisoner}} in the Tower of London awaiting execution; in this period he wrote {{a history of the}} world in five volumes where he described his American experiences and adventures, in it <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> whether all the new species discovered in the new continent could have found their place on Noah's Ark. A very serious question at the time, he postulates that only animals from the old continent found place on the Ark; eventually, after the Flood, some of these animals would migrate to the new continent and, under environmental pressure, change their appearances to create new species. Fifty years later, Matthew Hale went even further, and said that only the prototypes of all animal species were welcomed on the Ark; these would eventually differentiate after their release. Many clergymen were happy with Raleigh and Hale ideas since they appeared {{to solve the problem of}} the Ark's tonnage.|$|E
25|$|However, Bohr {{had argued}} that the {{uranium-235}} isotope was {{far more likely to}} capture neutrons and fission even from neutrons with the low energies produced by fission. Frisch began experimenting uranium enrichment through thermal diffusion, a process first demonstrated in Germany by Klaus Clusius. Progress was slow; the required equipment was not available, and the radar project had first call on the available resources. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> what would happen if he were able to produce a sphere of pure uranium-235. When he used Peierls' formula to calculate its critical mass, he received a startling answer: less than a kilogram would be required. Frisch and Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum in March 1940. They reported that a 5 kilogram bomb would be the equivalent to several thousand tons of dynamite, and even a one kilogram bomb would be impressive. Because of the potential radioactive fallout, they thought that the British might find it morally unacceptable.|$|E

500|$|University of Arizona law {{professor}} Gabriel J.
