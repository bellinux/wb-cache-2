40|$|Numerous {{epidemiologic}} {{studies have}} reported associations between measures of power-line electric or magnetic fields (EMFs) and childhood leukemia. The basis for such associations remains unexplained. In children, acute lymphoblastic leukemia represents approximately three-quarters of all U. <b>S.</b> <b>leukemia</b> types. Some risk factors for childhood leukemia have been established, and others are suspected. Pathogenesis, as investigated in animal models, {{is consistent with the}} multistep model of acute leukemia development. Studies of carcinogenicity in animals, however, are overwhelmingly negative and do not support the hypothesis that EMF exposure is a significant risk factor for hematopoietic neoplasia. We may fail to observe effects from EMFs because, from a mechanistic perspective, the effects of EMFs on biology are very weak. Cells and organs function despite many sources of chemical "noise" (e. g., stochastic, temperature, concentration, mechanical, and electrical noise), which exceed the induced EMF "signal" by a large factor. However, the inability to detect EMF effects in bioassay systems may be caused by the choice made for "EMF exposure. " "Contact currents" or "contact voltages" have been proposed as a novel exposure metric, because their magnitude is related to measured power-line magnetic fields. A contact current occurs when a person touches two conductive surfaces at different voltages. Modeled analyses support contact currents as a plausible metric because of correlations with residential magnetic fields and opportunity for exposure. The possible role of contact currents as an explanatory variable in the reported associations between EMFs and childhood leukemia will need to be clarified by further measurements, biophysical analyses, bioassay studies, and epidemiology...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} whether expression of NER DNA repair genes affects development of drug resistance and relapse in ALL. Background. Relapse in ALL {{is associated with}} the development of resistance to primary therapy. NER is a metabolic pathway that protects cells from the effects of genotoxic agents, such as chemotherapy drugs. Methods. We studied the role of NER in ALL by secondary analysis of 2 independent gene expression microarray studies: Staal et al. (Set A) and Hogan et al. (Set B). Both studies analyzed matched diagnosis-relapse leukemic cells of ALL patients (41 and 49 pairs, respectively). Results. In Set A we found that 17 / 20 NER genes were overexpressed at time of relapse, 4 of which were individually significantly increased: ERCC 1, ERCC 8, ERCC 4 and DDB 1. Subset analysis of Set B, based on patients who have early (3 ̆c 3 years) vs. late (3 ̆e 3 years) relapse gave distinct results. NER gene expression at the time of diagnosis of patients in the early relapse group was increased in all 20 NER genes when compared to the late group (p= 0. 001). 7 genes showed individually significant increases in expression: XPE, DDB 1, RPA 3, RPA 2, ERCC 2, ERCC 1 and ERCC 8. In Set A, 18 / 20 NER genes were upregulated at the time of diagnosis in early relapse patients vs. the late group. 4 genes were significantly increased: RPA 1, CCNH, DDB 1 and RPA 2. Conclusion. We have discovered that early relapse in ALL is associated with elevated NER gene expression at the time of diagnosis. Pharmacogenomic targeting of such patients might include dose escalation.

40|$|Objective. The {{overall goal}} of this project is to assess the role of Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) in {{pediatric}} Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) relapse using genomic methods. We hypothesize that ALL relapse in the patient, {{after a period of}} remission driven by primary chemotherapeutic treatment with genotoxic chemotherapy agents, will show increased expression of NER genes and therefore increased capacity for repairing DNA damage. Background. Deficiencies in NER genes are responsible for the hereditary cancer-prone diseases xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome, and we have previously demonstrated functional and molecular alteration of this pathway in breast cancer. Methods. We performed a detailed analysis of gene expression microarray data from 41 matched primary and relapsed pediatric ALL samples from colleagues in the Netherlands. We analyzed expression data for the 20 canonical NER (a. k. a. “long-patch” DNA repair) genes. Results. Our findings demonstrate that 18 of the 20 genes studied had higher expression in the relapsed samples (P = 0. 003). Six genes showed an individual significant increase in gene expression, CCNH (P = 0. 020), DDB 1 (P = 0. 026), CSA (P = 0. 033), ERCC 1 (P = 0. 015), hHRAD 23 B (P = 0. 039), and CDK 7 (P = 0. 012), with two additional genes very close to statistical significance, XPB (P = 0. 094) and RPAp 70 (P = 0. 080). Conclusion. These data are similar to what we have found in breast tumors of increasing stage, and are consistent with the idea that relapsing neoplastic disease is inherently capable of greater DNA repair, resulting in functional drug resistance.

Precursor-B ALL comprises 80 % of cases, and the CD 19 antigen {{is expressed in}} nearly all precursor-B ALL patients. Bispecific T-cell-engaging antibodies are novel bioengineered proteins. The bispecific T-cell-engaging antibody blinatumomab engages polyclonal T cells to CD 19 -expressing B cells. By binding to both CD 3 and CD 19, blinatumomab physically brings these T cells {{in close proximity to}} malignant B cells and potentiates T-cell-induced cytotoxic cell kill. Blinatumomab requires continuous intravenous infusion due to its short half-life, the need for continuous exposure for the drug to exert sufficient efficacy, and lessened toxicity. A phase II trial of B-cell ALL patients with persistent or relapsed minimal residual disease demonstrated an 80 % rate of complete molecular remission. Cytokine-release syndrome and central nervous system events, such as seizures and encephalopathy, are reversible toxicities.

40|$|T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is {{a genetically}} complex and {{aggressive}} hematologic cancer caused by accumulation of somatic mutations in developing T-cells. In {{order to better}} understand the genetic defects present in T-ALL, we performed whole exome sequencing on 67 T-ALL samples. The most significant new finding of this study was the identification of somatically acquired mutations in the ribosomal protein L 5 (RPL 5) and L 10 (RPL 10) genes in about 10 % of pediatric patients. RPL 5 and RPL 10 encode essential proteins of the 60 S ribosomal subunit. Mutations in several ribosomal proteins have been described in a series of inherited disorders, known as ribosomopathies, that result in hematopoietic defects and a predisposition to develop leukemia and solid tumors. Our findings provided however the first genetic evidence directly linking ribosomes to cancer. A series of additional somatic ribosome defects have recently been discovered in cancer, yet their underlying oncogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we investigated the pathogenic role of the recurrent arginine to serine mutation at position 98 (R 98 S) in RPL 10, found in 7. 9 % of pediatric T-ALL patients. We show that engineered mouse lymphoid cells as well as T-ALL xenografts samples expressing RPL 10 -R 98 S display elevated expression of components of the oncogenic JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Of biological relevance, these cells also display enhanced Jak-Stat pathway activation upon cytokine stimulation and increased sensitivity to JAK-STAT inhibitors. Interestingly, RPL 10 -R 98 <b>S</b> positive <b>leukemia</b> patients showed a nearly mutually exclusive mutation pattern between RPL 10 -R 98 S and JAK-STAT lesions, suggesting that RPL 10 -R 98 S also modulates this cascade in human T-ALL. Mechanistically, besides transcriptional changes, we observed reduced proteasome activity, reduced degradation of Jak 1, and enhanced sensitivity to clinically used proteasome inhibitors in RPL 10 -R 98 S expressing cells. Additionally, we observed RPL 10 -R 98 S associated reduction of apparent programmed ribosomal frameshifting, an emerging mechanism to regulate the expression of cytokine receptors, at several identified ribosomal frameshift signals in mouse and human JAK-STAT genes. We thus highlight modulation of the oncogenic JAK-STAT cascade as a novel cancer-promoting activity of a ribosomal mutation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{announcement}} of findings: Occupational Energy Research Program (presented at October 2008 DOE worker briefing). Why was this study done? Employees at the Savannah River Site {{worked with a}} number of hazardous agents, including ionizing radiation and asbestos. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is a federal agency that works to improve {{the health and safety of}} America's workers. NIOSH provided funding to researchers from the University of North Carolina to find out if working with hazardous agents may have led to more deaths at the Savannah River Site than would be expected in the general population. Though researchers did not estimate exposures to all hazardous agents at the Site, they did look more closely at exposure to ionizing radiation in workers who died from leukemia. This was done to see if radiation exposure may or may not be associated with death from leukemia. Who was included in the study? People employed by the DuPont Corporation, who worked at the Savannah River Site between 1950 and 1986, were included in this study. These 18, 883 workers were employed for at least 90 days at the Savannah River Site, worked in operations, and had not worked for any other Department of Energy facility. How was the study done? Government records were used to find out how many of the 18, 883 workers had died, and what were the causes of death. The records used (e. g., death certificates) did not provide any medical information other than cause of death. From these records, researchers determined the number of workers that died from each cause of death and compared this to the number of deaths that would be expected in the U. S. general population and in the South Carolina general population. Using radiation exposure records, researchers were also able to get information on recorded radiation doses for individual workers. Radiation doses of the workers who died from leukemia were then compared to radiation doses of a sample of workers who were still alive at that time. From this comparison, researchers were able to examine the possible link between leukemia death and recorded radiation doses. This is called the "dose-response" relation. This study only examined radiation doses from external exposures to ionizing radiation and internal exposures to tritium (tritium that was inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin). Researchers did not estimate workers' doses from other radionuclides that may have been inhaled, ingested, or absorbed. Researchers also did not estimate exposures to other hazardous agents. What did the researchers find? Overall, researchers found the death rates for workers at the Savannah River Site were generally lower than U. S. death rates. However, more male workers at the Site died from pleural cancer and from leukemia than would be expected in the general population (information about these two types of cancer can be found in the "Additional Information" section). Researchers found that the higher the recorded radiation dose, the higher the chance of fatal leukemia. The chance of fatal leukemia was 25 % higher in workers exposed to one rem of radiation, though this risk was found to lessen 15 years after the exposure. What does this mean? This study suggests that compared to the general population, Savannah River Site workers have a higher chance of dying from pleural cancer, a disease often linked to asbestos exposure. This study also suggests that for 15 years after exposure to radiation at the Site, workers have a higher chance of dying from leukemia than if they were not exposed. Leukemia is a rare disease, which means that if a person were exposed to one rem of radiation it is still unlikely that they will get leukemia. At the Savannah River Site, asbestos and radiation exposures are generally lower today than during the years of operation covered by this study. What should you do? If you currently work with radioactive materials or non-radioactive hazardous materials, contact your health and safety representative or employer if you have questions on how to best protect yourself from exposure. Share this information with your doctor if you are concerned about your health or have questions about these illnesses.

The H- 2 b phenotype and the TL phenotype of the Tlab allele of the B 6 strain, which is expressed only by leukemia cells, were retained by the variant. Southern blotting with an H- 2 cDNA probe that identifies restriction fragment polymorphisms distinguishing alleles of the H- 2 and Tla regions of the B 6 and A strains indicates that both the H- 2 a and Tlaa alleles are missing from the genome of this H- 2 a:Tlaa negative variant. Since the variant has two apparently unaltered chromosomes 17, where the H- 2 :Tla complex is situated, and since the intensity of bands in Southern blotting is suggestive of H- 2 b homozygosity, it is considered that loss of the H- 2 a:Tlaa haplotype by the variant was accompanied by duplication of the H- 2 b:Tlab haplotype. The implied change from heterozygosity to homozygosity that the variant has undergone with respect to H- 2 :Tla was not paralleled by a similar change at the three other loci tested, since the variant retained heterozygosity for Pep- 3 (chromosome 1), Gpi- 1 (chromosome 7), and Es- 1 (chromosome 8) ...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear domain 10 (ND 10 <b>s),</b> or promyelocytic <b>leukemia</b> protein (PML) nuclear bodies, are spherical nuclear {{structures}} that require PML proteins for their formation. Many viruses target these structures during infection. The E 4 Orf 3 protein of adenovirus 5 (Ad 5) rearranges ND 10 s, causing PML to colocalize with Orf 3 in nuclear tracks or fibers. There are six different PML isoforms (I to VI) present at ND 10 s, all sharing a common N terminus but with structural differences at their C termini. In this study, PML II {{was the only}} one of these six isoforms that was found to interact directly and specifically with Ad 5 E 4 Orf 3 in vitro and in vivo; these results define a new Orf 3 activity. Three of a series of 18 mutant 003 proteins were unable to interact with PML II; these were also unable to cause ND 10 rearrangement. Moreover, in PML-null cells that contained neoformed ND 10 s comprising a single PML isoform, only ND 10 s formed of PML II were rearranged by Orf 3. These data show that the interaction between Orf 3 and PML II is necessary for ND 10 rearrangement to occur. Finally, Orf 3 was shown to self-associate in vitro. This activity was absent in mutant Orf 3 proteins that were unable to form tracks and to bind PML II. Thus, Orf 3 oligomerization may mediate the formation of nuclear tracks in vivo and may also be important for PML II binding...|$|R

We report here the generation of SARS CoV <b>S</b> protein-pseudotyped murine <b>leukemia</b> virus (MLV) vector particles. The wild-type S protein pseudotyped MLV vectors, although at a low efficiency. Partial deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of S dramatically increased infectivity of pseudotypes, with titers only two- to threefold lower than those of pseudotypes generated in parallel with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. S-pseudotyped MLV particles were used to analyze viral tropism. MLV(SARS) pseudotypes and wild-type SARS CoV displayed similar cell types and tissue and host restrictions, indicating that the expression of a functional receptor is the major restraint in permissiveness to SARS CoV infection. Efficient gene transfer could be detected in Vero and CaCo 2 cells, whereas the level of gene marking of 293 T, HeLa, and HepG 2 cells was only slightly above background levels. A cat cell line and a dog cell line were not susceptible. Interestingly, PK- 15, a porcine kidney cell line, and primary porcine kidney cells were also highly permissive for SARS S pseudotypes and wild-type SARS CoV. This finding suggests that swine may be susceptible to SARS infection and may be a source for infection of humans. Taken together, these results indicate that MLV(SARS) pseudotypes are highly valuable for functional studies of viral tropism and entry and, in addition, can be a powerful tool for the development of therapeutic entry inhibitors without posing a biohazard to human beings...|$|R

With the advent of increasingly high-throughput and precise RNA-sequencing techniques within the last two decades, it has become well established that miRNAs can regulate almost all cellular processes through their ability to post-transcriptionally regulate a majority of protein-coding genes and countless other non-coding genes. In cancer, miRNAs have been demonstrated to play critical roles by modifying or controlling all major hallmarks including cell division, self-renewal, invasion, and DNA damage among others. Before the introduction of anthracyclines and cytarabine in the 1960 <b>s,</b> acute myeloid <b>leukemia</b> (AML) was considered a fatal disease. In decades since, prognosis has improved substantially; however, long-term survival with AML remains poor.

Herein, we describe the roles miRNAs can play in drug resistant AML and we describe miRNA-transcript interactions found within other cancer states which may be present within drug resistant AML. We describe the mechanisms of action of these miRNAs and how they can contribute to a poor overall survival and outcome as well. With the precision of miRNA mimic- or antagomir-based therapies, miRNAs provide an avenue for exquisite targeting in the therapy of drug resistant cancers...|$|R
40|$|The {{protein that}} is {{investigated}} {{in this thesis}} is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand activated transcription factors. The nuclear receptors share three conserved structural domains, the N-terminal transactivating domain, the central DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal ligand-binding domain. Glucocorticoids are well known for their anti-inflammatory and apoptotic effects and are therefore used as treatment for a multitude of diseases including, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and <b>leukemia</b> <b>s.</b> GR mediates the effects of glucocorticoids {{not only by the}} activation and repression of specific target genes that play important roles in several physiological processes such as metabolism, cell proliferation and inflammatory and immune responses but also through protein-protein interactions with other signalling pathways, referred to as cross-talk mechanisms. In the first study, we described a method to investigate new GR interacting proteins on a large scale using two dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. We found 27 novel potentially important proteins that interacted with the GR receptor complex. Our data suggests that those interactions are variable depending on {{the presence or absence of}} glucocorticoids and that they also are present in different GR multiprotein complexes of different composition, indicating the existence of new GR cross-talk mechanisms. In the second study, we characterized the interaction between GR and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt 3). We showed that the DNA-binding domain of GR is sufficient for the Flt 3 interaction. Addition of Flt 3 ligand also proved to be necessary for potentiation of glucocorticoid dependent transcription. The data presented in the third study aimed to detect glucocorticoid regulated genes from blood samples within a short time frame. We also measured the amount of GR in different subpopulations of peripheral blood leucocytes with flow cytometry. Together these results serve as a starting point for a quick determination of glucocorticoid responsiveness in patients. In the fourth study, we characterized the functional properties of the two GR mutations, R 477 H and G 679 S. We showed that both R 477 H and G 679 S have a dominant negative effect on wild-type GR and that R 477 H has impaired DNA-binding which explains the severe clinical phenotypes of cortisol resistance that are associated with these mutations...|$|R

40|$|Therapy {{resistance}} {{is still a}} major obstacle to successful treatment in {{a significant number of}} pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients. It has been previously demonstrated that children with ALL whose leukemia cells exhibit in vitro resistance to single or a combination of drugs have a significantly worse prognosis compared to patients with sensitive leukemic cells (Ramakers-van Woerden N, et al Leukemia 18 (3) : 521 – 9 2004 [Medline]). Ion channels are becoming one of the potential targets for cancer therapy and putative biochemical modulators of conventional chemotherapy (Conti M, J Exp Ther Oncol. 4 (2) : 161 – 6, 2004 [Medline]). In particular, K+ channels belonging to the hERG 1 family are attracting most attention, since they are over-expressed in a broad range of primary acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) as well as in both myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cell lines (Pillozzi <b>S,</b> et al <b>Leukemia</b> 16 : 1791 – 1798, 2002 [Medline]; Smith GA, et al, JBC 227 : 18528 – 18534, 2002). hERG 1 channel expression confers a greater capacity to engraft the bone marrow and invade the bloodstream in NOD/SCID mice injected with AML cells. This fact corresponds to a greater malignancy (shorter overall survival and higher probability to relapse) in hERG 1 positive AML patients (Pillozzi S, et al Blood 110 : 1238 – 1250, 2007 [Abstract/Free Full Text]). It was also recently shown that the expression of hERG 1 is related to the chemosensitivity of cancer cells to vincristine, paclitaxel, and hydroxy-camptothecin (Chen SZ, et al Cancer Chemother Pharmacol 56 (2) : 212 – 20, 2005 [Medline]). We studied the expression and role of hERG 1 channels in various B lymphoid leukaemia cell lines and primary childhood B lymphoid leukaemia samples. It emerged that: hERG 1 K+ channels are expressed in both all the leukaemia cell lines and primary childhood B leukaemia samples; the N-terminus deleted, herg 1 b isoform was preferentially expressed in both cell lines and primary samples; in childhood leukaemia patients, the level of herg 1 b expression correlated with response to therapy. B lymphoid leukaemia cell lines were co-cultured on human bone marrow stromal cells, a system known to enhance leukaemia cell survival and escape from drug-induced apoptosis. In these cultures, the addition of a specific hERG 1 inhibitor, E 4031, induced a significant apoptosis in leukaemia cells, bypassing the protective effect of the bone marrow microenvironment. We hypothesise that hERG 1 channels can represent a novel molecular device regulating drug sensitivity in childhood acute leukaemia cells, and that targeting of hERG 1 channels can restore a proper pro-apoptotic response to chemotherapy in resistant B lymphoid leukemic cells...|$|R
40|$|Familial {{aggregation}} {{of cancer}} may be due either to environmental factors shared by family members, or to shared genes. Familial clustering has been an avenue {{to the understanding of}} the etiology of cancer and has been a basis for clinical decisions and counseling, as well as guiding the identification of cancer-related genes. The nation-wide Swedish Family-Cancer Database was created by linking the Statistics Sweden Multi- Generation Register with the Swedish Cancer Registry, national census data and death notifications. All Swedes born after 1931 and their parents are included in the Database, which encompasses over 10 million individuals. Cancer cases were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Registry from the years 1958, including over 1 million primary cancers and in situ tumors (paper I). The Family-Cancer Database was used as the source of family and cancer data, according to the premise that comparisons can be done based on different probands: parental probands are informative of dominant effects in offspring, whereas analysis of risks between siblings who lack affected parents provides clues about possible recessive effects. With specific reference to lung cancer, in paper II, we used the Family-Cancer Database to examine the time trends of lung cancer in Sweden by histological type, with specific reference to gender, birth cohort, years of diagnosis (period), and age. The incidence rates of squamous cell carcinoma and other subtypes in men peaked in the period 1980 - 1990, and then decreased slightly thereafter. In contrast, the incidence rates of adenocarcinoma have continued to increase throughout the period. In women, all subtypes except squamous cell carcinoma have been increasing linearly. The incidence ratio of male to female for all cases of lung cancer was 2. 8. For squamous cell carcinoma, the ratio was 12. 4 in the beginning and 3. 6 at the end. For adenocarcinoma, the ratio was stable at about 1. 5 for the whole period. In paper III, the standardized incidence ratio was 1. 87 (95 % CI 1. 66 - 2. 10) for all offspring (0 66 years old) when parents had lung cancer. The proportion of familial affect was 6. 39 %, and the population-attributable risk of all lung cancers was 2. 97 %. Lung cancer in offspring was associated with parental rectal, cervical, kidney, urinary bladder and endocrine gland tumors. Age-specific, histology-specific familial risks for lung cancer were analyzed in paper IV. For offspring diagnosed before 50 years, the SIRs for histological types of lung cancer between offspring and parents were 1. 98 for adenocarcinoma (offspring) and small cell/large cell carcinoma (parents), 2. 66 for squamous cell carcinoma and small/large cell carcinoma (offspring/parents), 3. 54 for small cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and 3. 70 for large cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. At a young age, risks between siblings were higher than those between offspring and parents. The SIR ratio (sibling risk/offspring risk) was 2. 92 for all lung cancers. The early onset familial component accounted for 29. 4 % of familial adenocarcinoma and 33. 3 % of familial small and large cell carcinoma. The proportion was lowest for squamous cell carcinoma (13. 3 %). In papers III and V, for multiple primary lung cancers we also found that risk of lung cancer was increased after upper aerodigestive tract, breast, cervical, kidney, urinary bladder or squamous cell skin cancer, or non- Hodgkin s lymphoma, Hodgkin <b>s</b> disease or <b>leukemia,</b> through all follow-up periods in men and women. Patients had an increased familial risk when their first-degree relatives were diagnosed with two lung cancers compared to those whose first-degree relatives were diagnosed with one lung cancer, and vice versa. In summary, we suggested that there is an equal sensitivity of both genders to tobacco-induced lung cancer. Familial history of lung cancer was associated with increased risk of lung cancer; the population-attributable fraction of familial lung cancer was 2. 97 %. A large proportion of lung cancers before 50 years of age appear to be heritable and are probably due to a high-penetrant recessive gene or genes that predispose to tobacco carcinogens. Familial risks for multiple primary lung cancers have also suggested that there is an inherited susceptibility...|$|R
