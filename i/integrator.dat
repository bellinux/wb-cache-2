25|$|The semi-implicit Euler is a first-order <b>integrator,</b> {{just as the}} {{standard}} Euler method. This means that it commits a global error {{of the order of}} t. However, the semi-implicit Euler method is a symplectic <b>integrator,</b> unlike {{the standard}} method. As a consequence, the semi-implicit Euler method almost conserves the energy (when the Hamiltonian is time-independent).

30|$|The {{number of}} unique <b>integrators</b> for both kind of {{contributors}} is roughly similar in {{four out of}} the five analyzed project (e.g., the linguist project has 15 internal <b>integrators</b> and 17 external). The only exception to this trend is the project hubot, in which 11 (78 %) of the <b>integrators</b> are external developers (which corroborates {{with the findings of}} the “RQ 1.1. Are internals the top contributors of company-owned OSS projects?” section, that indicates a large proportion of internals are casual contributors for this particular project). Regarding the amount of work devoted to each kind of contributor (either internal or external), we observed that internal <b>integrators</b> processed more pull requests on projects atom, hubot, and electron. In particular, internal <b>integrators</b> of project electron processed 28 × more pull requests than their counterparts. Moreover, although the project hubot has more unique external <b>integrators</b> (11 externals and 3 internals), internal <b>integrators</b> are responsible for managing the majority of the pull requests (internals <b>integrators</b> processed 3 × more than external ones). On the other hand, on projects linguist and git-lfs, external <b>integrators</b> processed more pull requests than internals (3.26 × and 1.82 ×, respectively).|$|R

40|$|Variational <b>integrators</b> are momentum-preserving and {{symplectic}} numerical {{methods used}} to propagate the evolution of Hamiltonian systems. In this paper, we introduce {{a new class of}} variational <b>integrators</b> that achieve fourth-order convergence despite having the same integration scheme as traditional second-order variational <b>integrators.</b> The new class of <b>integrators</b> are created by replacing a dynamical system's Lagrangian in the variational integration algorithm with its surrogate Lagrangian. By incorporating the surrogate Lagrangian the propagation errors induced by variational <b>integrators,</b> up to a given order, are eliminated. Furthermore, no assumption on the Lagrangian's structure is made and, therefore, the proposed approach is applicable to a large range of dynamical systems. In addition, surrogate variational <b>integrators</b> are also constructed for Hamiltonian systems subjected to holonomic constraints and external forces. Finally, the methodology is extended to derive higher-order surrogate variational <b>integrators</b> that achieve an arbitrary order of accuracy but retain second-order complexity in the integration scheme. Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Comment: 19 page...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} generalized Galerkin variational <b>integrators,</b> {{which are}} a natural generalization of discrete variational mechanics, whereby the discrete action, {{as opposed to the}} discrete Lagrangian, is the fundamental object. This is achieved by approximating the action integral with appropriate choices of a finite-dimensional function space that approximate sections of the configuration bundle and numerical quadrature to approximate the integral. We discuss how this general framework allows us to recover higher-order Galerkin variational <b>integrators,</b> asynchronous variational <b>integrators,</b> and symplectic-energymomentum <b>integrators.</b> In addition, we will consider function spaces that are not parameterized by field values evaluated at nodal points, which allows the construction of Lie group, multiscale, and pseudospectral variational <b>integrators.</b> The construction of pseudospectral variational <b>integrators</b> is illustrated by applying it to the (linear) Schrödinger equation. G-invariant discrete Lagrangians are constructed in the context of Lie group methods through the use of natural charts and interpolation {{at the level of the}} Lie algebra.
