The causative {{agent of the}} abortion is investigated if more than 2 % of abortions in pregnant animals are registered within the herd. The amount of suspect material to be delivered for examination ranges from 12 % to 21 % of all registered abortions. Our research was carried out at the territory of AP of Vojvodina. Over a three-year-period we investigated 367 serum samples obtained from sheep that have aborted. Serum samples were examined for brucellosis, leptospirosis, listeriosis, toxoplasmosis, enzootic abortion (chlamydiosis), Q-fever, salmonellosis. All examined sera were negative to brucellosis. Leptospirosis was diagnosed in 3. 2 % cases. Specific antibodies were detected for L. hardjo and L. <b>grippotyphosa.</b> <b>Serotype</b> L. hardjo was first identified in cattle at the territory of Vojvodina, and {{in the recent years}} it has been also registered in sheep. T. gondii was detected in 7. 1 % abortions in sheep. Presence of specific antibodies against C. burnetii was established in 19. 6 % of investigated serum samples. Vojvodina is considered endemic region for Q-fever, and sheep are the primary reservoir of C. burnetii that was confirmed in this research. Key words: abortions, sheep, infectious disease...|$|E
40|$|In a 5 {{year period}} 48748 swine blood samples were examined, or 24. 52 % of the {{breeding}} stock. The samples were {{examined by the}} method of microscope agglutination, with "live" antigen of 8 leptospira serotypes: L. pomona, L. icterohaemorrhragiae, L. grippotyphosa, L. sejroe, L. tarassovi, L. australis, L. bataviae and L. canicola. During the investigation specific antibodies for leptospira were diagnosed in 280 (0. 57 %) samples of swine sera. The highest level of seroprevalence for leptospirosis in swine was in the year 1998 with 130 (1. 27 %) seropositive swines. The lowest seroprevalence level was detected in the years 1999 and 2000 with only 13 seropositive animals (0. 13 - 0. 14 %). During this period {{the highest number of}} seropositive swines was found in the Beƒçej area, 241 (0. 92 %). In this period 3 serotypes of leptospira were present: L. pomona, L. icterohaemorrhagiae and L. <b>grippotyphosa.</b> <b>Serotype</b> L. icterohaemorrhagiae was most present on the investigated area (in 94. 32 % cases), followed by L. pomona (5. 31 %) while serotype L. grippotyphosa appeared only sporadically in only 0. 35 % cases. In this period a trend of slight decrease was noticed in swine prevalence for leptospirosis amounting to 0. 048 % annually. Based on these analyses, it may be expected with 95 % certainty that the level of prevalence for leptospirosis in the coming period in this epizootiological area will range from 0. 00 % to 0. 82 % of the infected animals...|$|E
