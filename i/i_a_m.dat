50|$|Around {{the year}} 1500 Francisco Henriques came to Portugal from Bruges, where {{he may have}} been a disciple of Gerard David. It is thought that his first work in Portugal was the main altarpiece of Viseu Cathedral (1501 - 1506, now in the Grão Vasco Museum in Viseu), leading a {{workshop}} that included Portuguese painter Vasco Fernandes, then in the beginning of his career.

50|$|One {{theory of}} Master I. A. M.'s {{identity}} points to Johan van den Minnesten (also spelled Mynnesten, b. ca. 1440, d. 1504) {{as the artist}} behind the engravings.

The only link between him and Master <b>I.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>M.</b> is a record that his son, also named Johan, was paid to print several engravings for the city of Zwolle in 1545; these were possibly plates inherited from his father.|$|E

5000|$|Master <b>I.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>M.</b> {{produced}} {{original and}} inventive compositions {{in a style}} that has been variously described as [...] "lively", [...] "dramatic", [...] "turbulent" [...] "refined" [...] and marked by [...] "Dutch swagger". [...] His engraving technique was careful and neat but tending to dryness. Later prints show more dramatic use of tonal contrasts, in drapery and other areas. His faces mostly have Dutch peasant features, sometimes bordering on the grotesque.The major influence upon Master I. A. M.'s early work {{appears to have been}} Rogier van der Weyden, although he was also influenced by Martin Schongauer. Hieronymous Bosch, a contemporary, also appears to have influenced the grotesque figures in The Betrayal of Christ: Bosch's Christ Carrying the Cross of Vienna is particularly similar.|$|E

The name given to him refers to his monogram, which is a W followed by a key symbol. Eighty-two works signed with that monogram are extant. Many of these are ornament prints, depicting elements of gothic architecture and decorative objects, and were probably marketed mainly as patterns for other craftsmen to follow. He also produced prints of ships, the first known. He influenced several other contemporary Dutch engravers, most notably Master <b>I.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>M.</b> of Zwolle. He probably worked for Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy, and his ship series may have been [...] "portraits" [...] of the ducal fleet.|$|E

Call ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE. ENV 4 -CT 97 - 0656.) As results of the project an Integrated Landscape Assessment Model (AIAM) was created. AIAM is a resource modelling system focusing on the generation of a decision support system application oriented to provide criteria in order to evaluate effects and to optimise location of low density residential settlements. The Model includes a Landscape multicriteria analysis merged with spatial analysis tools set in a GIS Environment. The A. <b>I.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>M.</b> provides data structures, user interface components, and output mechanism witch allows the user to apply the knowledge acquired for Artemis Project. One of the main goals of the A. <b>I.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>M</b> is to give a landscape view of the territory including variables that are usually not considered in planning and environmental impact assessment processes. Also the models gives a sustainable support both to planner and designers projects. A. <b>I.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>M.</b> gives the data structure to define a residential patterns, the parameters through which a pattern is adequately described. This pattern definition allows comparison between the oneis of the reference area and so, extract conclusions about divergence between them...|$|E
