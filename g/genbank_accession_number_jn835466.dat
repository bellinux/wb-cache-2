30|$|Microbial {{growth curves}} and {{mathematical}} models can provide useful information to understand microorganism’s growth behavior and select the optimal growth conditions. Turbidimetric method {{is a good}} alternative used to study bacterial growth since optical density (OD) measurement gives a real time values of bacterial population and have practical significance when dealing with bacteria samples in high cell densities (Carlos et al. 2009; Dalgaard and Koutsoumanis 2001). Estimation of microbial growth parameters based on absorbance measurements has the advantages of being rapid, non-destructive, inexpensive and relatively easy to automate {{as compared to the}} other techniques such as classical viable counts methods (Dalgaard and Koutsoumanis 2001). In present research, turbidimetric method with Bioscreen C was used to determine how different growth conditions affected LAB growth and bacteriocin production. Four bacteriocinogenic LAB strains, Arla- 10 (<b>GenBank</b> <b>accession</b> <b>number</b> JX 275803), JFR- 1 (<b>GenBank</b> <b>accession</b> <b>number</b> JX 275814), JFR- 5 (<b>GenBank</b> <b>accession</b> <b>number</b> JX 275817) and TSB- 8 (<b>GenBank</b> <b>accession</b> <b>number</b> JX 275827), isolated from cheeses and yogurt products with anti-listerial effect were selected (Yang et al. 2012). The influences of culture media, initial pH of culture media and temperature on LAB growth and bacteriocins production were investigated, and the relationship between growth kinetics and bacteriocins production were determined.|$|R

40|$|Chicken {{taxonomy}} and pedigree investigation {{are important}} parts {{to understand the}} domesticationprocess occurred on chicken in Indonesia. The Indonesian native chickens have very different clade with thechickens from other Asian countries and others. This {{study was conducted to}} construct phylogeny junglefowls (red and green jungle fowls) and Indonesian native chickens, in order to know their relationship. Among the available DNA marker, the region D-loop on DNA mitochondria is the most effective markerused in the investigation. Mitochondrial DNA D-loop (hypervariable- 1 segment) was PCR amplified andsubsequently sequenced for a total 33 individuals of green jungle fowls (Gallus varius), 9 individuals of redjungle fowls (Gallus g. gallus) from Indonesia, and 30 individuals of Indonesian native chickens (Lombok,Cemani, Kedu, Kedu Putih, Nunukan, Kate, Pelung, Gaok, Merawang, dan Sentul). Seventy two (72) sequences were used for analysis. Seven (7) published reference D-loop sequences of genus Gallus fromGenBank were also included in the analysis: Gallus varius (<b>GenBank</b> <b>accession</b> <b>number</b> D 64163 danD 82912), Gallus gallus (<b>GenBank</b> <b>accession</b> <b>number</b> AB 098668), G. gallus spadiceus (GenBank accessionnumber AB 007721), Gallus gallus bankiva (<b>GenBank</b> <b>accession</b> <b>number</b> AB 007718), Gallus lafayetti(GenBank <b>accession</b> <b>number</b> D 66893), and Gallus sonneratii (<b>GenBank</b> <b>accession</b> <b>number</b> D 66892).

Pedigree investigation {{is an important}} part to understand the process of chicken domestication in Indonesia. Molecular DNA approach using D-loop Mitochondrial DNA marker (hypervariable 1 segment) was used in this analysis.
