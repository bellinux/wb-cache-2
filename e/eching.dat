Additional aim was to find an agent(s) to promote <b>ECH</b> absorption and oral bioavailability among two efflux proteins and three absorption promoters. Methods: <b>ECH</b> absorption behaviors were investigated by everted gut sac model in vitro and single-pass intestinal perfusion model in situ. Pharmacokinetics study was performed to investigate the influences of verapamil and clove oil on <b>ECH</b> bioavailability in vivo. All samples were measured at different time intervals by high performance liquid chromatography. Results: The {{results showed that the}} effective permeability coefficient (Peff) and apparent permeability coefficient of <b>ECH</b> were 0. 83 × 10 - 6 – 3. 23 × 10 - 6  cm/s and 2. 99 × 10 - 6 – 9. 86 × 10 - 6 cm/s, respectively. The Peff among duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were not statistically different, but they were higher than colon (P< 0. 01), which demonstrated that intestinal <b>ECH</b> absorption was poor and site dependent. Additionally, verapamil and clove oil significantly increased the jejunal Peff of <b>ECH</b> both in situ and in vitro. Moreover, the bioavailability of <b>ECH</b> in combination with verapamil and clove oil were increased by 1. 37 -fold (P< 0. 05) and 2. 36 -fold (P< 0. 001), respectively, when compared to <b>ECH</b> group.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{observed}} toxicity and carcinogenicity of 1, 3 -dichloro- 2 -propanol (DCP) in rodents {{is thought}} to be due to the formation of reactive metabolites, epichlorohydrin (<b>ECH)</b> and dichloroacetone (DCA). However, there is no direct evidence for the formation of these metabolites from exposure to DCP in rodents due to the challenges of measuring these reactive intermediates directly in vivo. The objective of this work was to investigate the metabolism of DCP to <b>ECH</b> and DCA in vivo by first developing a sensitive analytical method in a suitable biological matrix and analyzing samples from rats administered DCP. DCA reacted rapidly in vitro in rat blood, plasma, and liver homogenate, precluding its detection. Because <b>ECH</b> rapidly disappeared in liver homogenate, but was relatively long-lived in plasma and blood in vitro, blood was selected for analysis of this metabolite. Following a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg DCP in male or female Harlan Sprague−Dawley rats, <b>ECH</b> was detected in blood with a maximum concentration reached at ≤ 13. 7 min. <b>ECH</b> was cleared rapidly with a half-life of ca. 33 and 48 min in males and females, respectively. Following a single oral dose of 25 mg/kg <b>ECH</b> in male and female rats, the elimination half-life of <b>ECH</b> was ca. 34 and 20 min, respectively; the oral bioavailability of <b>ECH</b> was low (males, 5. 2 %; females, 2. 1 %), suggesting extensive first pass metabolism of <b>ECH</b> following oral administration.
