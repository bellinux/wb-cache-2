25|$|Under the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Plan's Enhanced Station Initiative, three {{stations}} on the line—Prospect Avenue, 53rd Street, and Bay Ridge Avenue—were {{selected to}} undergo a complete overhaul. All three stations would be entirely closed for up to 6 months in order to speed up renovations, unlike in previous station renovations conducted by the MTA, where parts of the stations would have been closed and renovated piece-by-piece. Updates included cellular service, Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, <b>interactive</b> <b>service</b> advisories and maps, improved signage, and improved station lighting. From January to May 2016, Grimshaw Architects worked on a design for the stations' renovation, with Arup Group acting as a consultant.

In addition it was nominated for two BAFTA Interactive Awards, with Spooks Interactive winning one of them.

2500|$|Warner Communications {{launched}} the Gridtronics service on April 1, 1973. Included among its initial offerings was the Warner Star Channel (the [...] "Warner" [...] brand was subsequently excised from the name), a network {{developed as a}} vehicle to promote the Warner Bros. film library (notably excluding the pre-1950 film library that was owned by United Artists). The channel was initially offered on systems operated by Warner Cable Communications (later Time Warner Cable, which is currently branded as Time Warner Cable Spectrum as it is being folded into the Charter Spectrum systems owned by Charter Communications), and was eventually made available on Warner-Amex's experimental QUBE <b>interactive</b> <b>service</b> when the company launched it in 1977. Cable providers sometimes experienced technical problems trying to transmit the delivered tapes to viewers, especially when the tapes jammed during playback.|$|E
2500|$|As ITV Digital had collapsed, {{the rights}} reverted to the {{regulator}} and the ITC invited bids {{for the space}} on Multiplexes B, C and D. The Freeview consortium was formed by the BBC, transmitter company National Grid Wireless (known {{at the time as}} Crown Castle UK) and BSkyB. This consortium (legal name DTV Services Ltd and trading under the [...] "Freeview" [...] brand) won and launched a new service. Dropping the failed ITV Digital business model, Freeview launched on 30 October 2002 with free television channels only, and made digital radio stations available on television receivers for the first time. The BBC controlled one Multiplex (B) for its own services, and Crown Castle/National Grid the other two (C & D) for commercial services, though the Community Channel also operated on Multiplex B. The BBC's second multiplex has allowed it to televise BBC Parliament where it had previously only been available in sound, allowed BBC Knowledge and its successor, BBC4, to stop renting space from SDN for coverage, and allowed for special video screens in its <b>interactive</b> <b>service</b> BBCi, for use during sporting events such as Wimbledon and carrying loops of news headlines and weather, (services already provided on digital satellite) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The {{challenge}} of multimedia communications {{is to provide}} applications that integrate text, image, and video information {{and to do it}} in a way that presents ease of use and interactivity. This paper deals with trends in <b>interactive</b> <b>services</b> for digital television infrastructure from the point of view of return channel and flow of information. We start with a short overview concerning previous work on this hot topic. Then, we deal with the <b>interactive</b> <b>services</b> in digital television infrastructure. After that adequate solutions for return channel are presented. Finally, flow of information in the <b>interactive</b> TV <b>services</b> for mobile devices is described including applications on mobile devices.

30|$|Many {{applications}} {{prefer to}} divide large jobs into multiple small tasks to better utilize the limited resources and provide better service quality. As stated in [10], most <b>interactive</b> <b>services</b> such as web search, social networks, online gaming, {{and financial services}} now are heavily dependent on computations at data centers because their demands for computing resources are both huge and dynamic. <b>Interactive</b> <b>services</b> are time-sensitive as users expect to receive a complete or possibly partial response within {{a short period of}} time. Thus, a job should be preemptive and it can be divided into many small tasks (we call this as multi-task problem) in order to provide <b>interactive</b> <b>services</b> and improve the utilization ratio of the computing resources.|$|R
