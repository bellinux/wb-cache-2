When {{he is not}} at work sacking another {{assistant}} or trying to avoid fellow-dentist Roger, he is at home trying to relax (which never works). Ben isn't a bad man; behind his sardonic exterior he does really love his family and <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with being bossed about and manipulated by his wife Susan and continually fleeced for money by his children.|$|E

It’s kind of the next step: You were on a reality show, {{now you have to}} put out a song." [...] He {{said that he}} felt a personal connection with the recording process as he had [...] " [...] own soundtrack to [...] life that [...] play everyday". During an interview, he also described the single as a part of his experimentation with music.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{win against}} Matthysse, {{negotiations}} {{for a fight}} against Kaizer Mabuza began. Both sides eventually agreed to a March 5 bout, with the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title on the line. Former champion Pernell Whitaker joined Judah's training camp to help him prepare for the match. Whitaker said: [...] "I don't train guys to be like me. I help guys {{to do the things}} that work for them. If I can teach you how to hit and not get hit, that's a blessing for you. Zab has the same abilities I have, but Zab still <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it together and do it the way that Zab knows how to do it." [...] On March 5, 2011, Judah defeated Mabuza via technical knockout in the seventh round, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, claiming the IBF title again after almost ten years.|$|E

500|$|The {{cast and}} crew of TGS with Tracy Jordan gather to watch the season finale of Jack's summer reality show hit MILF Island, a series the plot of which is {{described}} as [...] "25 Super-Hot Moms, 50 eighth grade boys, no rules." [...] The staff soon discover {{that one of them}} told a reporter for The New York Post that Jack was a [...] "Class A Moron" [...] and that [...] "He can eat my poo." [...] They then spiral into an argument as they try to find out who made the statement. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) later recalls that he heard Liz, in an elevator, making the statement to the journalist. Liz makes a false promise that she will tell Jack that it was her to avoid him hearing the truth from Kenneth. Liz finally reveals the truth to Jack only to find out that he already knew it was she who said it, and he's not going to fire her—instead, she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> together a new TV series for MILF Islands manipulative competitor Deborah.|$|E
500|$|On game night, coach Taylor gives a {{pep talk}} where he warns the players against taking the opponents – Westerby High School – too lightly. They say their {{rallying}} cry, [...] "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose!" [...] and enter the field. The first half is problematic for the Panthers, {{and at the end}} of the second half, the visitors make a potentially game-winning interception. Street is the only one left to make a tackle. He succeeds, but the tackle is so hard that he remains prone on the ground. The crowd is left in silence as the starting quarterback does not move, and has to be taken off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance. Coach Taylor now <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in the highly unprepared Saracen, who initially makes several silly mistakes. The coach tells him to relax and focus, and Saracen manages to connect with Smash, who scores a touchdown. Riggins recovers the ensuing onside kick for the Panthers. In the final seconds of the game, Saracen throws a long pass to a receiver, who makes it to the end zone for another touchdown. As the Panthers win the game, both teams gather at mid-field to pray for Jason Street. Team members then head over to the hospital, where Street's condition is still unclear. Riggins and Smash reconcile, while Julie tries to comfort Lyla. In a voice-over, coach Taylor is heard saying that [...] "We are all vulnerable, and we will all at some point in our lives fall." ...|$|E
500|$|Occasional successes notwithstanding, Holst {{found that}} [...] "man cannot live by {{composition}} alone"; he took posts as organist at various London churches, and continued playing the trombone in theatre orchestras. In 1898 {{he was appointed}} first trombonist and répétiteur with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and toured with the Scottish Orchestra. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor Hans Richter, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the [...] "White Viennese Band", conducted by Stanislas Wurm. Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing rubato from players. Nevertheless, longing to devote his time to composing, Holst found the necessity of playing for [...] "the Worm" [...] or any other light orchestra [...] "a wicked and loathsome waste of time". Vaughan Williams did not altogether agree with his friend about this; he admitted {{that some of the}} music was [...] "trashy" [...] but thought it had been useful to Holst nonetheless: [...] "To start with, the very worst a trombonist <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with is as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure; and secondly, Holst is above all an orchestral composer, and that sure touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely {{to the fact that he}} has been an orchestral player; he has learnt his art, both technically and in substance, not at second hand from text books and models, but from actual live experience." ...|$|E

Contained within are fake news stories poking fun at The Daily Tar Heel and the North Carolina Tar Heels. [...] The Daily Tar Heel typically publishes former columnist Ian Williams' [...] "Insider's guide to hating Duke" [...] for the two basketball match-ups each year. [...] There is a longstanding agreement that if Duke wins the first matchup, The Daily Tar Heel's masthead is printed in Duke blue, and if Carolina wins the first matchup, The Chronicle's masthead is painted Carolina blue.

According to author Jason Bailey, [...] "Quentin {{thought it would be}} funny to have this casual {{observer}} who just happened to be there. All of this was born out of the experience of, when you go to someone's house to buy drugs, there are always people who are just there." [...] Gallagher recalled favorable experiences of working with Tarantino for the film: [...] "Pulp Fiction was just being {{in the right place at}} the right time. After The Commitments, a couple of us got representation in LA and it was mostly rubbish. They drive you around to meet about 30 different people, but I was never the Hollywood starlet those people wanted. The only time I ever fitted into anybody's blueprint was with Tarantino. He was the man. Bring on the freaks! Bring out the people, now deemed shells, whose career is over. But he is unique. He's such a wonderful director and such a nice bloke. It was the only time I didn't feel like the odd one out over there." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, MDNA received an average score of 64, based on 34 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Andy Gill from The Independent {{felt that the}} album represented a [...] "determined, no-nonsense restatement" [...] of Madonna's brand of music, after the underwhelming response she had received for Hard Candy. Rolling Stone writer Joe Levy rated the release 3.5 out of 5 stars, describing it as a [...] "disco-fied divorce record". He found naughtiness in {{the music and the}} compositions, however there was also depth in the content, which Levy felt deserved repeated listening of the record. Priya Elan of NME called MDNA as [...] "a ridiculously enjoyable romp", also listing the depth of the songs and their intimate lyrics as [...] "some of the most visceral stuff [...] ever done". Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani found the album to be [...] "surprisingly cohesive" [...] in spite of the multiple producers, and commended the singer and Orbit's compositions as among the best. For Shirley Halperin from Billboard, it was better that Madonna did not produce retro sounding music as many of music veterans end up creating. [...] "Always {{one step ahead of the}} latest sounds and production trends... her brand of dance music meets delectable pop comes at a perfect time, just as EDM <b>has,</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it plainly, taken over," [...] Halperin theorized.|$|E
2500|$|Wade Vroom, an [...] "occasional teacher" [...] at Delta {{alternative}} school, [...] "pinned up brochures {{meant to}} advise gay bar and bath house patrons on safe sex procedures" [...] in a grade seven and eight classroom. Liz Sandals, the minister for education, {{stated that it}} was [...] "totally inappropriate." [...] Sandals also stated, [...] "clearly, from what was described in the media, the materials that were being used are totally inappropriate and are in no way connected to the Ontario health and phys ed curriculum" [...] and [...] "I’m relieved that Toronto District School Board (TDSB) has gotten rid of the material and that the teacher {{is no longer in}} the classroom." [...] He had been [...] "ordered [...] to work from home pending an investigation." [...] Sandals called it a [...] "one off." [...] Sandals stated how this type of material would not be included in the new Ontario curriculum. Lisa MacLeod, the critic for education from the Progressive Conservative Party, stated [...] "parents have not asked for this type of sexually explicit information to be made available to their children. The fact that an Ontario teacher felt comfortable enough to post it speaks to the cozy relationship the Liberal government has with their unions." [...] MacLeod feels that the Toronto District School Board is [...] "clearly out of control when it comes to this." [...] She also stated that [...] "this {{is not the first time}} something like has occurred there - and I think the government really <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> their foot down and make it known that that type of material is unacceptable." [...] A spokesman for the school board claimed that the teacher had [...] "good intentions." [...] MacLeod criticized the spokesman and thinks that the school board should fire someone for the material being posted. The AIDS Committee of Toronto, who published one of the brochures, stated that the intended material published by them was for adults. The Toronto Sun asked in an article, [...] "if the teacher now being paid to be at home, or any adult, were to pass out this material in a park, would the police not be called?" [...] and when is the TDSB going to notify police about a brochure teaching children?"safer sucking tips?" [...] A spokesman for the board stated, [...] "At this time, police have not been notified." [...] Toronto Police Service investigated the brochures and decided that no charges would be pressed against Vroom because it [...] "didn't meet Criminal Code criteria to lay charges for exposing children to obscene material or corrupting the morals of children." [...] Vroom was later reinstated after the issue had been [...] "resolved." ...|$|E
