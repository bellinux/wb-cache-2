For transport of passengers' baggage four containers were used. These containers were loaded in London or Paris and carried to ports, Dover or Calais, on flat {{cars in the}} UK and [...] "CIWL Pullman Golden Arrow Fourgon of CIWL" [...] in France. At the Second World Motor Transport Congress in Rome, September 1928, Italian senator Silvio Crespi proposed the use of containers for road and railway transport systems, using collaboration rather than competition. [...] This would be done {{under the auspices of}} an international organ similar to the Sleeping Car Company, which provided <b>international</b> <b>carriage</b> of passengers in sleeping wagons. In 1928 Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) started regular container service in the northeast United States. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929 in New York and the subsequent Great Depression, many countries were without any means of transport for cargo. The railroads were sought as a possibility to transport cargo, and there was an opportunity to bring containers into broader use. Under auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris in Venice on September 30, 1931, on one of the platforms of the Maritime Station (Mole di Ponente), practical tests were done to assess the best construction for European containers as part of an international competition.|$|E

40|$|Topical {{issues of}} the {{regulation}} of <b>international</b> air <b>carriage</b> The main purpose of this work is to provide its readers with {{an overview of the}} many facets of passenger rights in such dynamic area as <b>international</b> air <b>carriage.</b> Development in this area has given rise to issues and challenges, including the overlapping of legal and geographical scopes of different air passenger protection instruments. Over the last decades, several air passenger protection regimes have developed across the world, in particular on international, European Union and national level. But does the patchwork work? The history of multilateral regulation in the field of international air transport with regard to air passenger rights could be said to have begun in 1929 when the Warsaw Convention was originally signed. The importance of the convention lies in unification of the rules concerning the documents of carriage and the liability of air carriers. In 1955 the Warsaw Convention was amended by the Hague Protocol, which substantially redrafted, modernized and simplified rules relating to the documents of carriage as well as doubled the limit of carrier liability with respect to persons. The Warsaw Convention's application was subsequently extended to the carriers actually performing the transport by air when a passenger [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Colombia {{is not a}} Member State of the Maritime Carriage Conventions {{currently}} in force (Hague-Visby Rules and Hamburg Rules) and it is uncertain whether it will ratify the Rotterdam Rules in the upcoming future. Pursuant to the foregoing, the regulation of the contracts of carriage of goods by sea is governed by the Colombian Code of Commerce. Accordingly, the Colombian Code of Commerce provides certain provisions which particularly regulate {{the carriage of goods}} by sea under bill of lading. Amongst those provisions, Article 1644 is of paramount significance for the liability of the carrier, considering that it allows in situations where there is no declaration {{of the value of the}} goods in the bill of lading, the possibility to apply the limitation of liability agreed by the parties in the carriage contract. However, the case law in Colombia has never concerned the limitation of the carrier’s liability in the context of an <b>international</b> multimodal <b>carriage</b> contract that includes a sea leg. In that respect, Article 16 of Decision 331 of 1993 of the Andean Community sets forth that when a damage or loss to the goods carried occurs in a stage of an <b>international</b> multimodal <b>carriage</b> contract where an international convention applicable or a mandatory national law provides a higher limit of liability for the carrier that the one agreed by the parties in the carriage contract, the limit of liability sets forth either by the international conventions or mandatory national law shall prevail upon the one agreed in the contract. According to the foregoing legal framework, the aim of this master thesis is to determine whether in accordance with Article 16 of Decision 331 of 1993 of the Andean Community and Article 1644 of the Colombian Code of Commerce the limitation of liability provided either in the Hague-Visby Rules or the Hamburg Rules shall apply compulsory in the Colombian jurisdiction in a situation of localized loss or damage to the goods sustained during the sea leg of an <b>international</b> multimodal <b>carriage</b> contract, in order to adjust Colombian jurisdiction with international standards on this subject matter.

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceSalmonella <b>carriage</b> and {{cutaneous}} {{contamination of}} pigs at slaughter {{are a major}} risk for carcass contamination. They depend on Salmonella prevalence at farm, but also on transmission and skin soiling among pigs during their journey from farm to slaughterhouse. To better understand and potentially control what influences Salmonella transmission within a pig batch during this transport and lairage step, we proposed a compartmental, discrete-time and stochastic model. We calibrated the model using pork chain data from Brittany. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to evaluate {{the impact of the}} variability in management protocols and of the uncertainty in epidemiological parameters on three model outcomes: prevalence of infection, average cutaneous contamination and number of new infections at slaughter. Each outcome is mainly influenced by a single management factor: prevalence at slaughter mainly depends on the prevalence at farm, cutaneous contamination on the contamination of lairage pens and new infections on the total duration of transport and lairage. However, these results are strongly affected by the uncertainty in epidemiological parameters. Re-excretion of carriers due to stress does not {{have a major impact on}} the number of new infections...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} receive full {{compensation}} for damage caused during air transportation, plaintiffs try {{to get around the}} liability limitations of the Warsaw regime, inter alia, by alleging willful misconduct {{on the part of the}} carrier or its agents and servants under Article 25 of the Warsaw and Hague Conventions. On their part, carriers have an interest in limiting their potential liability under the said regime, and in avoiding any possibility of breaking the stipulated monetary limitation. Consequently, the said provisions are litigated frequently without, however, bringing uniform results in different jurisdictions of the world. This thesis makes a study of the application and interpretation of the willful misconduct exception (Article 25) of the original Warsaw Convention as well as its subsequent amendments. The study reviews the treatment accorded to the relevant provisions in different common and civil law jurisdictions. Further, the problem is examined from the point of view of Muhammadan Islamic jurisprudence. This paper also traces the legislative history of the relevant provisions of the original treaty and its subsequent amendments.

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceFaecal <b>carriage</b> of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was {{investigated}} by selective plating and PCR identification test, among healthy captive snakes from zoological and private collections from France {{as well as}} from wild snakes from Guinea. P. aeruginosa faecal carriage among captive snakes was high (72 out of 83 individuals), but low among wild specimen (3 out of 23 individuals). Genetic diversity analyses of the isolates, based on SpeI-PFGE profiles, evidenced five dominant clones or clonal complexes spreading among snakes within a site and between sites and persisting over time. Similar clones or clonal complexes were detected from mouth swabs of the owners and from water and preys used to feed the snakes, evidencing various sources of snake colonization and the first cases of P. aeruginosa crosscontamination between snakes and owners. These observations led to the conclusion that P. aeruginosa behaves as an opportunistic species within snakes in captivity and that colonization and dissemination occurs consecutively to processes similar to those identified within the hospital. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that most isolates had a wild-type resistance profile except for one persistent clone isolated from both snakes and preys that harboured multiple antimicrobial resistance genes mediated by an integron carrying the qacH, aadB, aadA 2 and cmlA 10 cassettes, and a tetA(C) -carrying transposon.

On the other hand, for decades there is an urgent call from the commercial practice to revise the legal background in order to clarify its standpoint concerning new challenges, namely the possible acceptance and interpretation of electronic document interchange {{in the realm of}} transport documents. Hence, the paper points out some cornerstones where commerce and law need to agree in order to furnish the most suitable environment for carriage of goods by sea...|$|R
40|$|At present {{there are}} several {{instruments}} that regulate air carrier's liability in international transportation. These international treaties are collectively known as the Warsaw System. Unfortunately, not all States are parties to the same instruments. In this thesis, four possibilities will be introduced for amendment of the System. These possibilities are as follows: ratification of the Guatemala City Protocol through the Montreal Protocol No. 3, an international treaty instrument, meant to update and amend the whole Warsaw System; the Italian solution, a national "remedy" taken without international consultations; the Japanese action, Japanese air carriers have waived entirely the Warsaw System's limits of liability; and finally, a recommendation to the EC Commission on a regional remedy {{in the form of}} a multilateral agreement where carriers raise the liability limits but otherwise the Warsaw provisions apply. Each possibility will be thoroughly examined in order to determine whether it is the best solution to the present crisis that the System is facing. At the end of this thesis one solution will be recommended for Iceland and other States to update the System. Other solutions are available but will not be discussed since they are not considered desirable for the aim of unification of air carrier's liability in <b>international</b> air <b>carriage.</b> What must be kept in mind when the four possibilities are being examined is that the aim of this thesis is to find a solution that unifies the air carrier liability regime and sometimes, in order to reach a uniform solution, a compromise must be reached.

50|$|The Dutch State Railways uses {{a single}} royal {{carriage}} {{to transport the}} king and his family. It was ordered by the Dutch royal family in 1991, and construction was finished in 1993. It replaced a previous two-carriage royal train built in 1930, which is currently {{on display in the}} Dutch Railway Museum. In 2012 two more carriages were added to the royal train. These former first class passenger carriages were slightly modified and painted blue for use in the royal train. However, they are not available for international use, unlike the royal carriage itself, which is an <b>International</b> Coach Regulations <b>carriage</b> allowed in 16 different countries. When the king travels by train, a single (diesel) locomotive travels ahead to explore the tracks. The train itself is composed of two ordinary locomotives of the Dutch State Railways (head and tail of the train), the royal carriage itself, and, since 2012, the two slightly modified first class passenger carriages for staff, press and other guests. Before 2012, instead of the two extra carriages, two ordinary first class passenger carriages were added. Usually those carriages were the most luxurious type NS had available.|$|R
