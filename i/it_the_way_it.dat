500|$|After a {{performance}} opening for evangelist Billy Wayne Arrington in Dublin, Virginia, Arrington invited Bunn and Reedy {{to join his}} touring band. [...] Bunn credits Arrington with helping to alter the band's focus: [...] "We were playing music for God, but we didn't really know why we were doing it. [...] It was more so to be 'rock stars', per se, and just use God {{as a way to}} get there. [...] And so he really helped us flip-flop that and get <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> should be." ...|$|E
500|$|The Badmotorfinger logo {{consists}} of a jagged, cyclone-like design. In {{the center of the}} logo is a triangle with the album's title, containing a spark plug. The album's cover art was illustrated by guitarist Mark Dancey from the Sub Pop band Big Chief. Thayil suggested the title Badmotorfinger as a joke on the Montrose song [...] "Bad Motor Scooter". Regarding the title, Thayil said, [...] "It was sort of {{off the top of my}} head. I simply like it because it was colorful. It was kinda aggressive, too... It conjures up a lot of different kinds of images. We like the ambiguity in <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> sounded and the way it looked." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} Andy Milonakis reprising {{his role}} as N.E.P.T.R., a character that was last seen in the first season episode [...] "What is Life?" [...] The short rap [...] "Working for the Master" [...] that is sung by N.E.P.T.R. was written by Sugar. She had originally planned for her demo version to merely be a filler track, as she expected Milonakis to want to write his own rap. To her surprise, however, Milonakis enjoyed her version and wanted to perform <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> was written. Sugar's father, Rob, later released her demo version on his YouTube channel. Series composer Tim Kiefer produced the song's instrumental. Inspired by Wu-Tang Clan's penchant for sampling, Kieffer took his music from the season one episode [...] "What is Life?" [...] and edited it substantially, creating the [...] "clattery bumpin' beat" [...] featured in the episode.|$|E

500|$|In July 1996, {{brothers}} Christopher and Jonathan Nolan took {{a cross-country}} road trip from Chicago to Los Angeles, as Christopher was relocating his {{home to the}} West Coast. During the drive, Jonathan pitched the story for the film to his brother, who responded enthusiastically to the idea. After they arrived in Los Angeles, Jonathan left for Washington, D.C., to finish college at Georgetown University. Christopher repeatedly asked Jonathan to send him a first draft, {{and after a few}} months, Jonathan complied. Two months later, Christopher {{came up with the idea}} to tell the film backwards, and began to work on the screenplay. Jonathan wrote the short story simultaneously, and the brothers continued to correspond, sending each other subsequent revisions of their respective works. Christopher initially wrote the script as a linear story, and then would [...] "go back and reorder <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> is on screen to check the logic of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Once complete, the {{painting}} {{was presented to the}} Royal Serbian Government. As part of his contract, Jovanović granted the government the right to print reproductions of {{the painting}}. Jovanović felt {{the painting was}} his [...] "most beautiful composition", but was displeased that he {{had not been able to}} complete <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> was originally envisaged. He had originally intended for the finished work to be painted on woven tapestry. The version that went on display in Paris was an oil on canvas that Jovanović had only meant to use as a model for the tapestry painting. He later recalled that King Alexander had gambled away the money he had promised to provide for the tapestry painting's completion. Disappointed, Jovanović pledged to repaint it to his own liking, though he did not begin work on a revision until 1925–26, by which time he was in his sixties. He went on to complete a total of seven different versions of the painting in his lifetime. The first version is in the possession of the National Museum of Serbia, in Belgrade. Another, measuring , is on permanent display at the Belgrade City Museum.|$|E
2500|$|... "Sexhibition" [...] is an electro-funk song {{composed}} of [...] "cleverly crafted" [...] verbal puns, delivered with [...] "saucy assertiveness." [...] The song opens with rattling tablas and stuttering guitars. In the lyrics, Jackson again sings {{from the point}} of view of [...] "Damita Jo", in [...] "intermittent vocal bubbles" [...] to discuss the pleasures she intends to provide. Jackson states [...] "Relax, it's just sex", at the song's closing. The fourth track, [...] "Strawberry Bounce", depicts Jackson method acting a sensual display as alter ego [...] "Strawberry." [...] Characterizing herself as a one-woman gentleman's club, Jackson asks her partner to [...] "Let me be your playground." [...] The song morphs a sample of Jay-Z's vocals into its instrumentation of chimes, snapping rhythms, and synthesizers. Fusing new-school hip-hop with pop, Jackson sings [...] "watch the way I pump <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> works is gonna keep you comin'", in a feverish pant. Jackson's looped chorus hook, and the song's [...] "tasty" [...] beat, were described to compose an [...] "insanely catchy number", which merits repeats and [...] "begs to be remixed, flipped, and stripped." ...|$|E
