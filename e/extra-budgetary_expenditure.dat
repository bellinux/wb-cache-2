40|$|Fiscal {{incentive}} {{is closely}} related with the extra-budgetary revenues. Based on our definition of 'fiscal incentive', we explore the impacts of fiscal incentives under decentralisation on responsiveness of public good provision to real local needs. There are also some problems in fiscal decentralisation in China : first, with a huge basis of extra-budgetary revenue, the size of local government would be expanded, resulting in a heavier burden {{on the shoulder of}} local citizens and peasants; second, there exist some decreasing return to scale in local extra-budgetary expenditure; thirdly, 'urbanisation' (measured as the ratio of rural population to the total population) is negatively correlated with the local <b>extra-budgetary</b> <b>expenditure</b> on urban maintenance, indicating that in China, the process of industrialisation and urban construction are not consistent.

40|$|At present, {{representatives of}} the scientific, political, {{military}} circles and the civil society of the most {{countries of the world}} are taking part in the antiterrorist activity. The formation and implementation of the state policy of terrorism prevention in Ukraine provide for realization of the measures package of the legislative and executive power, the society and individual citizens of Ukraine. The article: • identifies problems of terrorism combating policy in the context of research on the causes and economic impact of terrorist activities; • reveals that appearance of evaluation categories in the field of terrorism resulted in a formation of a specific world market - a terrorism market; • considers problems related to the effectiveness of budgetary and <b>extra-budgetary</b> <b>expenditure</b> linked to threats of international terrorism in the countries of the integrated world; • highlights the economic losses incurred by Ukraine because of the terrorist activity in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions in 2014; • defines theoretical aspects of anti-terrorist Ukrainian policy analysis in the context of international, especially European and Euro-Atlantic, anti-terrorism cooperation; The conducted analysis shows that one of the priority tasks of the state regarding to improving the efficiency of antiterrorist activity should be the construction of the system of prevention of terrorism as a complex, multidimensional phenomenon, including by means of creating a system of regulatory actions of authorized authorities and other institutions of civil society in this area...|$|E
40|$|The {{excess of}} actual imprest {{expenditures}} over the overhead cost budgets of Cross River State Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies {{has not been}} given the attention it deserves despite the high frequency of its occurrence. More emphasis seems {{to be placed on}} the effects of the overall government budget on the actual general expenditure at the neglect of the effects which overhead cost budgets of MDAs have on imprest expenditures in the State. This study was therefore, carried out to fill this gap. Primary and secondary data were collected using questionnaires and office records respectively. Five hypotheses were formulated and tested by specifically applying inferential and parametric statistics to the primary data. The secondary data were specifically used to provide evidence for the identified research problem. The study revealed that overhead cost budgets, special imprests and additional imprests were ineffectively used. Secondly, even though previous studies showed that financial malpractices and poor budget monitoring were strongly associated with <b>extra-budgetary</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the 3 tiers of governments in Nigeria, the current study indicated that these two variables have little or no association and weak association respectively with <b>extra-budgetary</b> imprest <b>expenditures</b> in Cross River State MDAs. Inaccuracies in the overhead cost budgeting system were strongly associated with the <b>extra-budgetary</b> imprest <b>expenditures.</b> The study therefore, recommended that efficient and effective overhead cost budgeting system and regular budget review be put in place. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was commissioned by}} the Public Management and Transparency Network of the Regional Policy Dialogue for the 7 th Hemispheric Meeting celebrated on May 8 th and 9 th, 2006. The {{purpose of the study}} was to assess the planning, implementation, programming, budgeting and evaluation of <b>extra-budgetary</b> and tax <b>expenditures</b> in four countries in the region, and propose recommendations if necessary. The countries chosen were Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and Mexico, with Mexico being the country in charge of coordinating the study. Over the past few years, countries have recognized the need to tighten the rules which regulate off-budget operations. Brazil, Chile, and Mexico have made important progress in regularizing these operations, while Ecuador shows less progress experiencing some backpedaling as a result of the 1999 - 2000 economic crisis and political instability.
