50|$|This ‘zero download’ {{solution}} delivers instant {{high quality}} speech from an easy-to-use, <b>floating</b> <b>toolbar.</b> New Features Include: MP3 Maker, Text Magnifier, Screen Mask, New ‘Expressive’ Voices (43 in total), Improved PDF Reading, Improved Secure Site Reading, Improved Panel and Extended and Scrollable Toolbars. Continued Functionality Includes: Pronunciation Control, Voice Selection and Language Selection. Browsealoud uses dual-colour highlighting which highlights the block of text in one colour and {{the spoken word}} in another to give {{a clear indication of}} what text is being read aloud.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of fingerprint based authentication, there is now support for an official fingerprint API that allows users to unlock their phones and perform app purchases in Google Play. Android 6.0 Marshmallow also allows website owners to set a preferred app to open their links in, and allows users greater control over this behavior. Sharing has been improved with a feature called [...] "Direct Share", which allows information {{to be sent to}} a contact directly, rather than to a third party app first. On screen volume controls have also been simplified, with more extensive control exposed via a tap. Text selection has been redesigned to show a <b>floating</b> <b>toolbar</b> next to the highlighted text, replacing the actionbar which existed {{on the top of the}} screen in previous versions of Android.|$|E
40|$|Large {{open source}} {{software}} repositories are polluted with incomplete or inadequately functioning projects having scarce or poor descriptions. Developers often search these repositories to find sample applications containing implementations of relevant features. While relying on software search engines that retrieve germane applications based on direct matches between user queries and words in the descriptions (or source code files), {{it is difficult to}} warrant that retrieved applications contain functionality described by their authors in project summaries. We propose a novel approach called K 9 that helps users evaluate if recommended applications implement functionality, which is described by the authors in project summaries. Using programmers ’ queries describing high-level concepts (e. g., sql server, <b>floating</b> <b>toolbar,</b> or smart card), K 9 uses information retrieval and program analysis techniques to evaluate recommended applications based on how they implement these high-level concepts. We conjecture that K 9 will effectively support developers in evaluating functionality of the retrieved applications. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|E

5000|$|Without an MDI frame window, <b>floating</b> <b>toolbars</b> {{from one}} {{application}} can clutter the workspace of other applications, potentially confusing users with {{the jumble of}} interfaces.|$|R
5000|$|... progeCAD (originally called [...] "ProgeSOFT IntelliCAD" [...] until 2005) is a Computer-Aided Design {{software}} platform developed by ProgeSOFT. progeCAD {{is described as}} [...] "a Professional, native DWG 2D/3D CAD, supplied with Applications, Libraries and Services at remarkably low cost.". progeCAD is developed using ITC IntelliCAD, ACIS and Open Design Alliance programming toolkits. The user interface emulates certain versions of AutoCAD, including <b>floating</b> <b>toolbars</b> and a command line supporting AutoLISP and VBA scripting. The [...] "Professional" [...] version includes several enhancements, such as information tables, basic dynamic block support, 3D solid modeling, rendering and PDF import & printing. As of 2011, progeCAD also began including their 3D architectural design technology, [...] "EasyArch". progeCAD currently uses OpenGL hardware graphics technology, with limited GDI support for older video cards. There is no current support for DirectX hardware acceleration.|$|R
50|$|Aloha Editor {{is built}} to {{facilitate}} editing of content {{within the same}} layout that is shown to readers. In this respect, it is different from most other web-based WYSIWYG editors. Aloha features a <b>floating</b> contextual <b>toolbar</b> that hovers over content that the user is actively editing. Aloha Editor tries to implement its functionality respecting the HTML5 Specification Draft.|$|R
50|$|The ContentTools editor allows text content, images, {{embedded}} videos, {{tables and}} other page {{content to be}} edited, resized, or moved via drag and drop directly within the page. The ContentTools editor features a <b>floating</b> context-sensitive <b>toolbar</b> which can be repositioned by the user and which offers functionality {{and ease of use}} similar to a word processing application.|$|R
2500|$|Even {{though the}} ribbon can be hidden, PC World {{wrote that the}} new [...] "ribbon" [...] {{interface}} crowds the Office work area, especially for notebook users. Others have called its large icons distracting. Essentially, the GUI-type interface of the ribbon contrasts sharply with the older menus that were organized according to the typical functions undertaken in paper-based offices: for instance, the old [...] "File" [...] menu dealt with opening, (re-)naming, saving, and printing a file, and the old [...] "Edit" [...] menu dealt with making changes {{to the content of}} the file. As a result, users who were more familiar with the logic of the old menus would be somewhat frustrated with the new, more visually oriented ribbon. PC World has stated that upgrading to Office 2007 presents dangers to certain data, such as templates, macros, and mail messages. The ribbon cannot be moved from the top {{to the side of the}} page, as <b>floating</b> <b>toolbars</b> could be.|$|R
50|$|Fireworks' user {{interface}} {{is consistent with}} the rest of Adobe Creative Suite, similar to that of Adobe Photoshop. On Mac OS X, it is possible to display the application in multiple document interface mode or the standard viewing mode where all <b>toolbars</b> <b>float</b> freely on the screen.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011 {{a review}} in PC World said the results with clearly printed sheet music were accurate, {{but that the}} {{interface}} had too many <b>floating</b> and docked <b>toolbars.</b> The reviewer said there was [...] "no more effective musical OCR/editor on the market", but that PhotoScore 6 Ultimate gave superior results with handwritten music.|$|R
