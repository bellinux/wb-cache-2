In this study, we turn the conventional view on its head, fixing consumption rather than labour input. Specifically, we design a basket of basic consumption goods and compute the working year of rural and urban day labourers required to achieve that.

40|$|In data envelopment analysis, {{there are}} several methods for {{measuring}} efficiency change over time, e. g. the window analysis and the Malmquist index. However, they usually neglect carry-over activities between consecutive two terms. These carry-overs {{play an important role}} in measuring the efficiency of decision making units in each term as well as over the whole terms based on the long-term viewpoint. Dynamic DEA model proposed by Färe and Grosskopf is the first innovative contribution for such purpose. In this paper we develop their model in the slacks-based measure (SBM) framework, called Dynamic SBM (DSBM). The SBM model is non-radial and can deal with inputs/outputs individually, contrary to the radial approaches that assume proportional changes in inputs/outputs. Furthermore, according to the characteristics of carry-overs, we classify them into four categories, i. e. desirable, undesirable, free and fixed. Desirable carry-overs correspond, for example, to profit carried forward and net <b>earned</b> <b>surplus</b> carried to the next term, while undesirable carry-overs include, for example, loss carried forward, bad debt and dead stock.

40|$|The recent {{growth in}} {{contract}} farming schemes particularly {{in developing countries}} has sparked controversy over its economic and welfare impacts on participating smallholders. This {{has given rise to}} a body of literature that analyses various aspects of the phenomenon. However, the question of why smallholders choose to participate in a contract farming scheme has not been thoroughly explored. Seldom are smallholders themselves asked explicitly why they choose to produce on contract for agribusiness firms, as many studies take it axiomatic that smallholders produce on contract solely because of the income benefits they expect to derive. This study explores the motivational factors behind smallholders decision to produce traditional staple foods on contract for local agribusiness firms in Tampola, a typical farming community in the north-eastern part of Ghana. The goal is to ascertain and highlight smallholder constraints that are embedded in such motivational factors to enhance agricultural policy intervention. Using a qualitative research method, I find among other things that, the volatility of the mainstream input and output markets for agriculture were sources of motivation for smallholders to produce on contract. I also find that the urge to sell farm produce in weight rather than in volumes was another motivating factor. The desire to <b>earn</b> <b>surplus</b> food induced by the high yields potential of contract farming for household consumption was also another source of motivation for smallholders. The study concludes with some recommendations for agricultural policy that are meant to address some smallholder constraints that emanates from the motivational factors. Among them is the need for the state and other development agencies to give the needed attention to the development of food crop value chains, not only to enhance food security, but also the creation of non-farm employment opportunities for smallholders...|$|R

When extraction capacity is limited, a competitive equilibrium can exist if each firm <b>earns</b> sufficient <b>surplus</b> to cover its set-up costs. Moreover, if firms choose extraction capacity, the optimal capacity choice ensures existence of a competitive equilibrium. The resulting competitive equilibrium price either grows at the rate of interest when total extraction is below capacity or is constant when capacity is fully utilized.

40|$|We {{show that}} if actors {{are defined as}} more {{knowledgeable}} when they possess more information, and if actors are defined as more powerful when they can extract greater surplus while exchanging resources, {{there is a fundamental}} trade-off in the social structural foundations of power and knowledge. This trade-off derives from the opposing implications of having redundant (i. e., directly or indirectly linked) contacts. Insofar as ego's alters are nonredundant, ego can be expected to become more knowledgeable more quickly. And such nonredundancy can also be the basis for great power as ego monopolizes the flow of resources (including information) between ego's alters. However, the very same mechanism that is behind ego's power as a provider of resources—i. e., the possession of nonsubstituitable resources on the part of disconnected contacts—also implies that that ego's alters will themselves be monopolists, thus weakening ego as an acquirer of resources. Furthermore, while the <b>surplus</b> <b>earned</b> from providing resources on monopoly terms is potentially much greater than the <b>surplus</b> <b>earned</b> from acquiring resources on competitive terms, the former strategy carries the risk that socially distant actors will not value one another's resources. Beyond elucidating the trade-off in the social structural foundation of knowledge and power, our framework also shows how the opposing implications of redundancy are the basis for a broad family of well known trade-offs (cosmopolitanism versus localism; exploration versus exploitation; insider versus stranger; robust versus simple identities) whose relationships with one another and with power and knowledge have not been appreciated. For all such trade-offs, the greater potential returns afforded by nonredundancy are balanced by the surer returns available from redundancy. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{theoretical}} {{literature on}} payment system models {{such as a}} two-sided market, emphasize the role of interchange fees in balancing demand by cardholders and merchants to maximize network benefits (Baxter 1983; Rochet and Tirole 2003, 2004). One of the earliest studies on two-sided markets is Baxter (1983). He uses a four-party model involving financial transactions using checks, debit cards, and credit cards. The paper analyzed interbank pricing, {{as well as the}} regulatory framework that supports it. Rochet and Tirole (2004) establish that, because pricing to one side is designed with an eye on externalities on the other side, standard pricing principles often do not apply. Platforms must perform the balancing act between both the sides and not only with respect to the price structure. These platforms, therefore, often regulate the terms of the transactions between end-users, screen members in non-price related ways, and monitor intra-side competition. Wright (2003) determines the limits {{on the extent to which}} interchange fees can matter. When merchants <b>earn</b> negligible <b>surplus</b> (due to intense retail competition), interchange fees cannot play their normal reallocative role. Instead, facing the no-surcharge rule, merchants will specialize in catering either to cash- or card- paying customers. With merchant surcharges allowed, merchants surcharge excessively, resulting in too little holding and usage of cards. In the case consumers first face a membership cost of joining the card network, the undersubscription can be extreme.|$|R

The results substantiate the hypothesis that nonprofit decisionmakers consciously plan to increase their organization's equity. Currently, evidence of continued equity buildup is not sufficient to call into question a nonprofit's exempt status, because federal tax laws assume that surplus accumulations will ultimately be used in support of program mission.
