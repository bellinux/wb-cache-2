Slocum spent 42 days in jail awaiting trial. At his trial he pleaded [...] "no contest" [...] and was released for time-served.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a sum of squares (SOS) {{approach to the}} stability analysis of networked control systems (NCSs) incorporating time-varying delays and time-varying transmission intervals. We will provide mathematical models that describe these NCSs and transform them into suitable hybrid systems formulations. Based on these hybrid systems formulations we construct Lyapunov functions using SOS techniques that can be solved using LMI-based computations. This leads to several advantages: (<b>i)</b> we <b>can</b> <b>deal</b> with nonlinear polynomial controllers and systems, (ii) we can allow for non-zero lower bounds on the delays and transmission intervals in contrast with various existing approaches, (iii) we allow more flexibility in the Lyapunov functions thereby possibly obtaining improved bounds for the delays and transmission intervals than existing results, and finally (iv) it provides an automated method to address stability analysis problems in NCS...|$|R
60|$|I {{shall be}} accused of using very strong {{language}} against the newspaper press of America. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only say that I {{do not know how}} to make that language too strong.

In writing on such a subject, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>deal</b> with the whole as a whole. During my stay in the country, I did my best to make myself acquainted with the nature of its newspapers, knowing in how great a degree its population depends on them for its daily store of information; for newspapers in the States of America have a much wider, or rather closer circulation, than they do with us. Every man and almost every woman sees a newspaper daily. They are very cheap, and are brought to every man's hand, without trouble to himself, at every turn that he takes in his day's work. It would be much for the advantage of the country that they should be good of their kind; but, if I am able to form any judgment on the matter, they are not good.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a sum of squares (SOS) {{approach to the}} stability analysis of networked control systems (NCSs) incorporating bounded time-varying delays, bounded time-varying transmission intervals and a shared communication medium. A shared communication medium imposes that per transmission only one node, which consists of several actuators or sensors, can access the network and transmit its corresponding data. Which node obtains access is determined by a network protocol. We will provide mathematical models that describe these NCSs and transform them into suitable hybrid systems formulations. Based on these hybrid systems formulations we construct Lyapunov functions using SOS techniques that can be solved using LMI-based computations. This leads to several beneficial features: (<b>i)</b> we <b>can</b> <b>deal</b> with plants and controllers which are described by nonlinear (piecewise) polynomial differential equations, (ii) we can allow for non-zero lower bounds on the delays and transmission intervals in contrast with various existing approaches, (iii) we allow more flexibility in the Lyapunov functions thereby obtaining less conservative estimates of the maximal allowable transmission intervals (MATI) and maximal allowable delay (MAD), and finally (iv) it provides an automated method to address stability analysis problems in NCS. Several numerical examples illustrate the strengths of our approach...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 49 - 50) Many therapists {{express a}} dislike {{to working with}} children, specifically adolescents and teenagers, in a formal therapy setting. Such comments as ???You couldn???t pay me enough to work with kids??? or ???<b>I</b> <b>can</b> barely <b>deal</b> with my own kids, much less someone else???s!??? serve {{as an indication of}} this aversion. The purpose of this project is to provide a handbook for therapists who wish to work with adolescents and teenagers. To this end, a review was done on relevant literature focusing on ???resilient adolescents??? and ???natural mentors??? in an effort to ascertain concrete methods through which a therapist may build a strong, positive therapeutic relationship with a teenage or adolescent client. Much of the information contained herein is sourced from studies focusing on the effect of non-parent adult mentors (???natural mentors???) have in positively changing the life of a resilient adolescent. Personal author experience with children, combined with the literature, provided the foundation to establish a set of suggestive guidelines that a therapist could turn to when working with adolescents and teenagers. The aim of these suggestions is focused primarily on therapists who have not worked with or have specifically avoided this demographic. This handbook can also be used by therapists who are experienced in working with adolescents and are interested in expending their skills...|$|R

The whole furniture and arrangements of the room were plain almost to meanness.

Behind this cupboard, and completely hidden by it, was the post which Louis assigned to Quentin Durward; and after having ascertained, by going to different parts of the room, that he was invisible from all quarters, he gave him his last charge: [...] "Remember the word, Posse, en avant; and so soon as ever I utter these sounds, throw down the screen--spare not for cup or goblet, and be sure thou take good aim at Crevecoeur--if thy piece fail, cling to him, and use thy knife--Oliver and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>deal</b> with the Cardinal." ...|$|E
60|$|The first {{answer is}} simply to say that I am a rationalist. I like to have some {{intellectual}} justification for my intuitions.

But I am in this matter yet more definitely a rationalist. I do not propose to turn this book into one of ordinary Christian apologetics; I should be glad to meet at any other time the enemies of Christianity in that more obvious arena. Here I am only giving an account of my own growth in spiritual certainty. But I may pause to remark that the more I saw of the merely abstract arguments against the Christian cosmology the less I thought of them. I mean that having found the moral atmosphere of the Incarnation to be common sense, I then looked at the established intellectual arguments against the Incarnation and found them to be common nonsense. In case the argument should be thought to suffer from the absence of the ordinary apologetic I will here very briefly summarise my own arguments and conclusions on the purely objective or scientific truth of the matter.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{subspace}} iteration method for the efficient computation of several smallest eigenvalues of the generalized eigenvalue problem Au = lambda Bu for symmetric positive definite operators A and B. We call this method successive eigenvalue relaxation, or the SER method (homoechon {{of the classical}} successive over-relaxation, or SOR method for linear systems). In particular, there are two significant features of SER which render it computationally attractive: (<b>i)</b> it <b>can</b> effectively <b>deal</b> with preconditioned large-scale eigenvalue problems, and (ii) its practical implementation does not require any information about the preconditioner used: it can routinely accommodate sophisticated preconditioners designed to meet more exacting requirements (e. g. three-dimensional elasticity problems with small thickness parameters). We endow SER with theoretical convergence estimates allowing for multiple and clusters of eigenvalues and illustrate their usefulness in a numerical example for a discretized partial differential equation exhibiting clusters of eigenvalues. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main reason}} {{that this story}} is so {{difficult}} for others to receive and consider, is that when a unique idea regarding the mind is put to a person {{the first thing the}} receiver will do is try to validate the logic by engaging it in their own mind. The problem with this is it that to engage this type of thought causes the receiver to become overwhelmed which is what this story is all about; what happens when the mind becomes overwhelmed. It is specifically about what causes the mind to become overwhelmed and how the mind deals with this situation. It is about a type of thought that when accessed, is impossible to engage without losing concentration. It is about the way the mind protects us from entering a state where we can no longer negotiate our physical environment. It is this same protection that makes it difficult for me to maintain concentration on the writing of this book.
