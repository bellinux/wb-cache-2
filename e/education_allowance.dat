The key lesson might be for those who design new systems of education and training: for example, the postgraduate <b>education</b> <b>allowance</b> system in general practice was felt to fail the profession because it did not include needs assessment and so led to ad hoc education to fulfil the time requirements of the system rather than the needs of individual doctors or the profession as a whole.

40|$|MBA thesis - WBSTo be {{successful}} in a globalised environment, it is necessary not {{only to have the}} free flow of capital and technology, but also the ability to relocate human capital across borders. Expatriates cost corporations three to five times more than local employees and the costs of expatriate failure can be high. It is therefore important for multinational corporations to attract and retain a competent and motivated cadre of expatriates. Since compensation {{plays an important role in}} employee motivation and retention, it is necessary to identify those remuneration aspects perceived to be important by expatriates. Experts in expatriate remuneration were interviewed to identify the variables that are important in expatriate remuneration. From these interviews, a questionnaire was designed, piloted and sent to expatriates in seven South African multinational companies. Conjoint analysis was used to examine the relative importance of the identified variables. The relative importance of these variables was also examined according to different demographic characteristics of the sample. The results show that of the compensation package variables, base salary is perceived to be the most important followed by benefits, currency in which the expatriate is paid, equity, taxation method, and lastly the cost of living adjustment.

40|$|This thesis elaborates a {{critical}} empirical and theoretical exposition {{of the impact}} of the Irish welfare to education programme, the Back to <b>Education</b> <b>Allowance,</b> on classbased exclusion. In doing so, it contributes to a broader understanding of dynamics of welfare to education programmes in the era of the post-welfare state. It adopts a strong ‘structural’ position, which sees the source of social exclusion as lying in the structured inequality of the labour market and the state (Morris 1994, p. 80). It rejects arguments that social exclusion can be addressed by promoting policy that adopts a weak ‘cultural’ position (Morris 1994, p. 80), ultimately blaming the excluded for their own misfortune. The thesis proposes the provision of education, and 3 rd level education in particular, as a key means of addressing social exclusion. Education is theoretically situated in terms of its relationship with the economy and broader state policy, which has (ultimately) resulted in the commodification of education (Mulderrig, 2003). The education system controls levels of social mobility (Drudy and Lynch 1993, p. 26) and by extension I argue that education can affect social exclusion. However the education system as it stands at present serves as a means to reproduce society’s inequalities The thesis situates the Back to <b>Education</b> <b>Allowance</b> (BTEA) in its macro level (global) context. It examines the system of welfare provision that exists in Ireland and how that system emerged. It locates the emergence of Neoliberalism as the dominant political discourse in the 1980 s, before focusing on how the construction of status beliefs and the ‘New Right’ ideology of personal responsibility have justified the rolling back of the welfare state and the promotion of welfare to work over welfare to education programmes in western societies. In doing so, the thesis argues that welfare recipients have been constructed as the ‘undeserving’ poor. It is held that this construction, which is part of a Neoliberal project to retract the welfare state, has offered a justification for the short-term approach which this thesis finds is being adopted in relation to the BTEA. This thesis finds that initiatives to facilitate access to 3 rd level education for welfare recipients (on a macro level) are restricted in scope and substantially modified in practice (on a micro level) as a result of the dynamics of interactions between welfare recipients and welfare officers, interactions which are lent great significance by the administrative nature of the BTEA. It has been found that BTEA participants require certain levels of cultural and / or social capital to overcome obstacles created by the DSFA and accordingly those who are most distant from the labour market, and who possess less capital, are considerably less likely to be able to access the BTEA. The thesis concludes by highlighting the positive impact of participation in the BTEA upon participants’ class situation, economic capital and levels of cultural capital. The latter is in turn used to acquire more sustainable and secure employment, offering welfare recipients the tools to combat their own social exclusion and potentially that of their children. However, I find that the effectiveness of the BTEA in addressing more than individual exclusion is limited by the requirement for cultural and social capital in order to negotiate the system and access the benefits it can offer. This finding informs an evaluation of the state response to the BTEA as minimalist; the documented lack of will to maximize the BTEA’s potential is held to be reinforced by dominant Neoliberal ideologies...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I offer a {{critical}} {{appraisal of the}} value of welfare to education programmes in alleviating the social exclusion of welfare recipients in Ireland. Education is located as a key resource to be utilised in the fight against social exclusion. The paper suggests the function of education with regards to social inclusion is to promote relative social mobility. It is noted that in modern capitalist societies educational credentials are a key determinant of one’s social class. Consequently education has a dual role in improving the individual's class position and additionally in potentially reducing the gap between those {{at the top of the}} hierarchy of economic power and those at the bottom. The paper takes the view that it is beneficial to society as a whole to specifically fund access to third level education for people on welfare. It is suggested that funding access for these groups is more likely to result in employment for them, more likely to sustain employment, and furthermore it will reduce time spent unemployed in the future. Additionally the paper demonstrates from a financial viewpoint welfare to education programmes will provide the state with a larger return on its initial investment. However it is apparent that internationally welfare to education is seen as a luxury, and subservient to welfare to work programmes. This is increasingly becoming the case in Ireland. The final part of the paper is concerned specifically with the Back to <b>Education</b> <b>Allowance</b> (BTEA) third level option. It finds that the BTEA has aided social inclusion to a certain extent by moving sections of the population off welfare and into sustainable quality work and to a positio...|$|E
40|$|This article {{critically}} appraises the success	of the Back To <b>Education</b> <b>Allowance</b> (BTEA) {{in removing}} barriers to participation	in 3 rd level education for welfare recipients in Ireland. The paper {{is based on}} empirical data from focus group	and in-depth qualitative interviews with 3 rd level students on the	BTEA. This study argues that it is beneficial to society to specifically	fund access to third level education for people on welfare as it provides the	State with a larger return on its initial investment than traditional welfare	to work programmes. However BTEA participants perceived that the effectiveness	of the scheme in providing access falls short in	the face of the class inequalities that exist in 3 rd level education	in Ireland, which are assisted by a general acceptance of the 2 ̆ 7 new right 2 ̆ 7 	ideology of personal responsibility. It is argued that the specific targeting	of individuals for the scheme {{and the provision of}} direct assistance in	applying for 3 rd level courses would maximise the schemes potential. It is argued that	welfare recipients are still seen as 2 ̆ 7 Undeserving 2 ̆ 7 (MacGregor, 1999 : 110). This mindset allows short-termism to	prevail in relation to the progression and administration of the BTEA. This	ideology allows the civil service to take personal ownership of decisions	affecting the participants on the scheme. The data shows how these elites	restrict the effectiveness of the BTEA, with a functionalist approach being	taken to both the design and implementation of the scheme. The strong appeal of	the functionalist approach is its ability to appear compassionate, helpful and	promising while simultaneously posing no real risk to the status quo (George	& Wilding 1985, p. 9). At all stages of their participation in the BTEA	scheme the respondents have come up against obstacles. Subsequently when	assessing the overall effectiveness of the BTEA in achieving its primary	objective, the paper finds the scheme has not removed the barrier but simply	lowered it.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the socio-economic {{consequences of the}} rapid deregulation of the Swedish taxi sector in the early 1990 s. The deregulated taxi sector is illustrative of the ethnic labour market segmentation {{brought about by the}} evolution of the Swedish model from the universal welfare state, relying on -decommodifying- social policies, towards flexible solutions and related recommodifying labour market policies. We analyse the income, education and ethnic background of those workers for whom the taxi sector was the largest source of income during the period 1990 - 2004. An important result of our analysis is that since deregulation it has been more usual for foreign-born citizens to become involved in the taxi business, mainly because discriminatory entry barriers have been removed. But our findings also indicate that they have not been integrated in the sector under the same conditions as Swedish-born workers. Although better educated, they derive smaller incomes from the taxi sector than their Swedish-born colleagues. They also receive a higher proportion of social insurance allowances, higher unemployment benefits, and less income from <b>education</b> <b>allowances</b> than the Swedish-born. Altogether, foreign-born workers in the sector have smaller disposable incomes than their Swedish-born counterparts. Compared with the general foreign-born population, however, they have on average fewer social insurance allowances, more unemployment benefits, and less income from <b>education</b> <b>allowances.</b> It seems that an ethnically segmented labour market nevertheless makes it more profitable for the foreign born to work in the taxi sector than in other sectors or to remain unemployed. Finally, our findings show how sectors with deteriorating working conditions on the one hand appear to offer attractive employment opportunities for foreign-born citizens, while on the other hand they have another (un) intended consequence: foreign workers are the most severely affected by the changing relations between the labour market and social policy.   Original Publication:Zoran Slavnic and Susanne Urban, Socio-Economic Trends in the Swedish Taxi Sector -Deregulation, Recommodification, Ethnification, 2008, International journal on multicultural societies, (10), 1, 76 - 94, www. unesco. org/shs/ijms/vol 10 /issue 1 /art 5.
