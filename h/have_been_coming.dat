25|$|Books {{were also}} {{published}} containing information gathered from this recorded material, such as The Spanish Tradition in Louisiana, written by Samuel G. Armistead {{to ensure its}} preservation over time. This Isleño material relates {{not only to the}} Canary Islands, but also to several other regions of Spain and perhaps Portugal, as immigrants from these places <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> to Louisiana since the 19th century and mixing with the Isleño communities.|$|E

Indeed, in the next scene they have set Baron up with a cop in drag to entrap him with procurement of prostitutes.|$|E
25|$|Almost a {{third of}} all {{immigrants}} in the U.S. were born in Mexico, being the source of the greatest number of both authorized (20%) and unauthorized (56%) migrants who come to the U.S. every year. Since the early 1990s, Mexican immigrants are no longer concentrated in California, the Southwest, and Illinois, but <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> to new gateway states, including New York, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, and Washington, D.C., in increasing numbers. This phenomenon can be mainly attributed to poverty in Mexico, the growing demand for unskilled labor in the U.S., the existence of established family and community networks that allow migrants to arrive in the U.S. with people known to them.|$|E
500|$|A {{student in}} an {{adjacent}} classroom, Sanna Orpana, {{said that her}} class had heard [...] "shooting {{and a kind of}} a rumble like tables falling down." [...] Orpana believed {{at the time that the}} noise may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> from a toy gun, and two other students went to investigate the noise. Saari shot at them, and the remaining students in Orpana's classroom hid under a table before running upstairs. At some point between 10:45–11:00 Saari ran down a corridor and threw a petrol bomb into a language laboratory. He then shot out all of the windows in the school's main corridor, that extended through the building. It was during this time that he also took aim at Forsberg.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 16 years old, Samiya Yuusf Omar was {{the only}} female athlete {{competing}} for Somalia at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Prior to the competition, she trained at the Mogadishu Stadium on a gravel track pitted by mortar craters. She explained {{that she would be}} routinely harassed while training by local militia groups, fighting in the Somali Civil War, and both friends and family had been pressuring her to stop training. She explained, [...] "Traditionally Somalis view the girls as corrupted if they join in with things like sports and music. It's because they sometimes wear transparent clothes or shorts. Therefore I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> under pressure from all different sides." [...] She continued to practice following encouragement from her mother, although had not expected to be chosen for the Games due to her age and as she was from a minority ethnic group.|$|E
500|$|In March 1993, {{military}} incursions by Azeri {{forces and}} artillery barrages {{were reported to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> from the region, prompting military leaders to announce an offensive against the rayon. [...] However, a different reason was given by the Armenians' most successful commander of the conflict, Monte Melkonian. [...] According to Melkonian, {{the commander of the}} southern front in Martuni (Khojavend), the decision to take the town was a matter of certainty rather than choice. He stated, [...] "This is a historical issue... of course this is historical Armenia... And we'll vindicate that reality [...] with our guns. Unfortunately! It would be nice if the Azeris would understand that reality is reality, agree and say OK, it's yours, and that's that." [...] Questioned on the possibility of a large expulsion of civilians if the region was captured, Melkonian responded, [...] "A lot of blood has been spilled on both sides... The emotions are high and that isn't conducive to living together in near or medium future." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Williamburg's Southside, {{also known}} in Spanish as [...] "Los Sures", {{which is the}} area south of Grand Street, there exists a sizable Puerto Ricans and Dominican population. Puerto Ricans <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> to the area since the 1940s and the 1950s, and Dominicans came in the '70s and '80s. Many Puerto Ricans flocked to the area after World War II due to the {{proximity}} to jobs at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The neighborhood continues to have 27% Hispanic or Latino population, and Broadway near Graham Avenue is known as [...] "Avenue of Puerto Rico". Havemeyer Street is lined with Hispanic-owned 'bodegas' and barber shops. However, even though the Southside has the highest concentration of Hispanics in the neighborhood, this population is dispersed throughout all of Williamsburg even as north as the Williamsburg-Greenpoint border.|$|E
