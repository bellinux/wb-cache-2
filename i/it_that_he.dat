5|$|This {{term was}} also used to imprecisely refer to the {{equipment}} used to perpetrate their crimes, such as gas chambers and Zyklon B. The true meaning of Sonderbehandlung was widely known in the SS, and in April 1943, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler was so concerned about the security of <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had it redacted in a secret report.|$|E
5|$|Curie's {{systematic}} studies {{included two}} uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite). Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was {{four times as}} active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium. She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. Pierre was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> decided to drop his work on crystals and to join her.|$|E
5|$|Macbeth did {{not survive}} the English {{invasion}} for long, for he was defeated and mortally wounded or killed by the future Malcolm III ("King Malcolm Ceann-mor", son of Duncan I) {{on the north side}} of the Mounth in 1057, after retreating with his men over the Cairnamounth Pass to take his last stand at the battle at Lumphanan. The Prophecy of Berchán has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was wounded and died at Scone, sixty miles to the south, some days later. Macbeth's stepson Lulach was installed as king soon after.|$|E

5|$|Mark Hoppus' {{involvement}} {{stems from}} when an Atticus Clothing employee played him I Am the Movie. He was so taken with <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> raved about the band in Rolling Stone, {{inviting them to}} open for his group, Blink-182 on their 2004 European tour. On the trek, he became good friends with the musicians. He told them that he had purchased an abundance of recording gear and amplifiers for the previous Blink-182 album and told the band of his interest in recording music from a production standpoint. At the final show of the tour, guitarist Joshua Cain went to Hoppus' dressing room {{and asked him to}} produce their next record. Although Hoppus had never produced anything before, he was excited {{to be a part of}} the album and accepted the offer.|$|E
5|$|The three battles to {{hold back}} the Central Powers ended in early autumn 1917, by which time there were 31 dead and 453 wounded among the volunteers; 129 {{received}} distinction. Dimitrie Lăzărel was one to have survived all three engagements, and legend has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never went into combat without the banner. Deleu had left reserve duty to join the 10th Chasseurs Battalion in the Mărășești combat, but fell severely ill and was reassigned to other offices.|$|E

5000|$|He talked quickly, in a high-pitched, slightly-nasally voice, and he didn't {{shy away}} from a little flirty talk with the ladies. He'd {{sometimes}} make comments that are likely not in the Mariner Vendors Handbook — never lewd, mind you, {{but if you were}} following the thread, not G-rated either. Rick was an individual. And <b>that's</b> why <b>he</b> was beloved. Not the speed of his peanut throws, not his banter, not his 34 years of service. <b>It's</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was unique. <b>It's</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> took something boring and made it into something joyful.

It was during this period that he had {{operations}} to repair cartilages in both knees.|$|E
25|$|Cătărău {{was later}} sighted in the United States and Mexico, {{and worked as}} a whale hunter. Another story has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> settled in Polynesia, and was even {{recognized}} as king by an indigenous tribe. In France, where he arrived with a false passport, Cătărău led the life of a delinquent, and spent time in prison. In 1920, he was jailed in Nice for stealing jewels from his American fiancée. After 1925, he was spotted in the Republic of China, a gunrunner for the National Revolutionary Army.|$|E

25|$|Berlin {{was born}} in Mir, today in Belarus in 1816 into a family of Jewish {{scholars}} renowned for its Talmudic scholarship. His father Jacob, while not a rabbi, was a Talmudic scholar descendant of a German rabbinic family; his mother was directly descended from Rabbi Meir Eisenstadt. According to some sources, Berlin initially was a weak student. However, most scholars believe this to be false. Legend has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> applied himself to his studies after overhearing his parents debating whether he should pursue a trade.|$|E
25|$|Edward Lisle {{built his}} own first bicycle {{in the early}} 1870s and had enough success racing <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> began to build {{additional}} bicycles to order. In 1876, he partnered with William Sharratt to increase production, but that partnership only lasted three years. In 1883, Edward Lisle founded the Star Cycle Company. Besides safety bicycles, models included tandems and a Pedersen. In 1889 the company purchased a factory on Stewart Street and by 1899, production reached 10,000 cycles per year, and by 1904 Star was the largest Wolverhampton based bicycle manufacturer.|$|E
25|$|One {{tradition}} has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> went on pilgrimage to Rome, but more certain is {{the knowledge of}} time spent in Brittany. He settled there on an island in the Etel river, now called L'Ile de Cado, where he built an oratory, founded a monastery and devoted himself to spreading the Gospel. There are chapels dedicated to him at Belz and Locoal-Mendon in Morbihan and at Gouesnac'h in Finistère, where he is called upon to cure the deaf. His name is also the basis of some thirty Breton place-names.|$|E

25|$|Lee's friend Dennis Wheatley, a noted author, was {{responsible}} for bringing the occult to him. The company made two films from Wheatley's novels, both starring Lee. The first, The Devil Rides Out (1967), is {{generally considered to be}} one of Hammer's crowning achievements. According to Lee, Wheatley was so pleased with <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> offered the actor the film rights to his remaining black magic novels, free of charge. However, the second film, To the Devil a Daughter (1976), was fraught with production difficulties and was disowned by its author. Although financially successful, it was Hammer's last horror film, and marked the end of Lee's long association with the studio that had a major impact on his career.|$|E
25|$|When Henry {{tried to}} divorce Queen Catherine of Aragon, Fisher became the Queen's chief supporter. As such, he {{appeared}} on the Queen's behalf in the legates' court, where he startled the audience by the directness of his language and by declaring that, like St John the Baptist, {{he was ready to}} die on behalf of the indissolubility of marriage. Henry VIII, upon hearing this, grew so enraged by <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> composed a long Latin address to the legates in answer to the bishop's speech. Fisher's copy of this still exists, with his manuscript annotations in the margin which show how little he feared the royal anger. The removal of the cause to Rome brought Fisher's personal involvement to an end, but the King never forgave him for what he had done.|$|E
25|$|The power {{struggle}} between John X and Guy of Tuscany and Marozia {{came to a}} conclusion in 928. Guy had secretly collected a body of troops, and with them made {{an attack on the}} Lateran Palace when Peter, Duke of Spoleto, was caught off his guard, and had only a few soldiers with him. Peter was cut to pieces before his brother's eyes, while John himself was thrown into a dungeon, where he remained until he died. There are two variant traditions surrounding his death; the first has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was smothered to death in the dungeon within a couple of months of his deposition. Another has it he died sometime in 929 without violence, but through a combination of the conditions of his incarceration and depression.|$|E
