5|$|After {{the appeals}} had been exhausted, Illinois Governor Richard James Oglesby {{commuted}} Fielden's and Schwab's sentences {{to life in}} prison on November 10, 1887. On the eve of his scheduled execution, Lingg committed suicide in his cell with a smuggled blasting cap which he reportedly held in his mouth like a cigar (the blast blew off half his <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> survived in agony for six hours).|$|E
5|$|Michaels and Diesel's feud resumed at the Royal Rumble when Michaels {{attacked}} Diesel {{during his}} match with Hart. Michaels then became the top {{contender for the}} WWF World Heavyweight Championship by winning the 1995 Royal Rumble match. Diesel won their match at WrestleMania after Sid, Michaels' new bodyguard, accidentally distracted the referee. Diesel offered Michaels a rematch, and Michaels told Sid that his services would not be required during the rematch. Sid attacked Michaels, and Diesel came to Michaels' defense. This attack caused Michaels to turn <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> and Diesel resumed their friendship and won the WWF Tag Team Championship later in 1995.|$|E
25|$|He {{could be}} broken but never bent, and his rude frankness accorded with his hard, sombre <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> often alienated men's sympathies though he seldom lost their respect. His lyricism is vigorous, feeling but austere, and almost entirely {{subjective}} and personal, while his pamphlets are distinguished by energy of conviction, strength of affirmation, and contempt for weaker and more ignorant opponents.|$|E

25|$|Backlund {{was trained}} for {{professional}} wrestling by renowned trainer Eddie Sharkey {{and made his}} debut for the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1973. Backlund's clean cut look and technical approach made him a natural <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> quickly got over with the fans. After leaving the AWA, Backlund traveled the United States, working for the National Wrestling Alliance in its various territories. In 1974, Backlund wrestled in Texas, for Dory Funk, Jr. and Terry Funk's Amarillo promotion. In March, he defeated Terry Funk for the NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship (the promotion's top title). Backlund held it for two months, before losing it to Karl Von Steiger in May.|$|E
25|$|As McMahon expected, WCW did address Hart and the {{aftermath}} of the screwjob on Nitro from the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis that same night. Mike Tenay and Tony Schiavone strongly criticized McMahon and Michaels for their actions. The show started with Bischoff making reference to Hart's impending arrival in WCW and his punching McMahon in the <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> then used his on-air persona as the mouthpiece for the New World Order to claim (kayfabe) that Hart was to join the nWo as soon as he could be signed to WCW. Hollywood Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, {{and the rest of the}} nWo members stood with Canadian flags and sang the Canadian national anthem.|$|E

Bart tries to get the shock {{bracelet}} remote control, but Sideshow Bob already has it and throws it out of the window, gags Bart with a piece of tape, picks him up and prepares to kill him with a knife, bent on killing him once again. However, Sideshow Bob realizes he is accustomed to Bart's <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> can not bring himself to do it. With that, Sideshow Bob tries to take his leave, but gets zapped continuously by his shock bracelet (because of birds pecking the remote after it had landed in their nest).|$|E

25|$|During combat, {{the player}} {{character}} is Agrippa, who can use various gladiatorial weapons such as swords, scimitars, maces, spears, bows, slingshots and flails. If Agrippa has severed {{the arm of}} an enemy, he can {{pick it up and}} also use it as a weapon. However, weapons can only be used for {{a certain amount of time}} before they break. During combat, a meter indicates the remaining vitality of Agrippa's weapon(s) and helmet (if he has one equipped). Agrippa can attack with his main weapon, his sub-weapon or shield, or with a two-handed weapon. The player can lock on to enemies to make Agrippa target them. Agrippa can also throw weapons at his enemies, and can fight with his fists, using strong and soft punches as well as shoulder tackles. If timed correctly, Agrippa can also steal weapons from his enemies, or knock their weapons out of their hands using a shoulder tackle. He can also attack from the ground by flinging sand into an approaching enemy's <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> can attack downed enemies by stomping on them or stabbing them. If Agrippa stands behind a groggy enemy he can perform a suplex on them.|$|E
500|$|Katie shows Maggie her tablet as {{the pair}} {{sit in the}} former's room. A visibly-drunk Carol enters and talks to Katie about the {{importance}} of having fun. Katie wants to finish her homework, but assures Carol that she would make a good mother. Downstairs, Jim persuades Angela to take up position under the table as Pat replaces the soap in the toilet. Pat joins Jim next to the table and returns a VHS; it becomes clear that Jim's apparent love for Countdown is actually a cover for his pornography habit, and Jim tries to steer the conversation away from the topic, worried that Angela will hear. Carol enters and puts on music. Pat sees Carol's sunscreen, and prepares her a drink of [...] "Adam's ale". Carol aggressively flirts with Jim, who does not reciprocate. When Pat hands Carol water, she throws it in his <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> leaves. Carol confronts Jim about promises he made to her, and how this house should be hers, not Angela's. Jim remains terrified that Angela can hear the conversation.|$|E
500|$|Wisden {{said that}} as a bowler, Peel had a [...] "fine length, easy action and splendid command of spin", which meant that he [...] "was often a match-winner". Peel {{consistently}} bowled a good length and varied the flight of the ball to deceive batsmen. He also bowled a quicker ball which, in contrast to his usual delivery, travelled {{in a straight line}} instead of turning. On a pitch affected by rain, batsmen found him very difficult to <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was very successful in these conditions. When bowling on pitches where the ball came more slowly off the surface, Peel often bowled faster; this pace made it difficult for batsmen to score runs against him even when conditions were in their favour. After he delivered the ball, the spin he imparted often made it curve in the air before it reached the batsman. According to Woodhouse, when bowling, [...] "Peel brought his arm behind his back with a peculiar flourish-like action and then 'whipped the ball down. He generally opened the bowling, including when he played for England. At the time, it was general practice to open the bowling with a fast bowler and a left-arm spinner.|$|E

[...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.'

500|$|In early 1986, an {{execution}} date (March 4) {{was set on}} the Chi Omega convictions; the Supreme Court issued a brief stay, but the execution was quickly rescheduled. In April, shortly after the new date (July 2) was announced, Bundy finally confessed to Hagmaier and Nelson what they believed was {{the full range of}} his depredations, including details of what he did to some of his victims after their deaths. He told them that he revisited Taylor Mountain, Issaquah, and other secondary crime scenes, often several times, to lie with his victims and perform sexual acts with their decomposing bodies until putrefaction forced him to stop. In some cases, he drove for several hours each way and remained the entire night. In Utah, he applied makeup to Melissa Smith's lifeless <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> repeatedly washed Laura Aime's hair. [...] "If you've got time," [...] he told Hagmaier, [...] "they can be anything you want them to be." [...] He decapitated approximately twelve of his victims with a hacksaw, and kept at least one group of severed heads—probably the four later found on Taylor Mountain (Rancourt, Parks, Ball and Healy)—in his apartment {{for a period of time}} before disposing of them.|$|E

So the guy's chest is cut open and he’s been in make-up for hours {{to make it look like}} he’s been torn open and he’s all bloody and stuff. So then they pour these worms and this goopy, syrupy stuff and this fake blood onto this guy’s chest... We had to zip him up in the body bag. It takes a few minutes to get to 'action' after he's zipped up. We unzip him and we see the worms and it’s so gross–and the look on his face. The worms are crawling up and their in his armpits and starting to crawl toward his <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> can’t move at all because he’s supposed to be dead." [...] Nicole continued that this scene had to be shot [...] "three or four times. We kept trying to get faster and faster but we were all laughing [...] It was like a Fear Factor episode with no chance of getting money... It was so gross but so much fun.
