40|$|To {{solve the}} puzzle of attitudes toward <b>debt</b> <b>buybacks,</b> the authors use a model that {{combines}} considerations of debt overhang {{with the possibility of}} asymmetrical information between debtor countries and their creditors. In this environment, a debt overhang may create disincentives for a country to undertake a worthwile investment, and debt relief may induce the country to invest and to increase its output, raising future debt repayments. The authors show that <b>debt</b> <b>buybacks</b> can credibly reveal a debtor country's willingness to invest and to repay in the future when offered relief today. In equilibrium, countries that buy back debt get debt relief and those that do not <b>buyback</b> <b>debt</b> do not get debt relief. The authors tested and failed to reject two implications of their model : 1) that banks grant debt relief to countries that have a swap program in place, and 2) that the secondary market price of country debt, conditional on a swap, is higher than the debt price, conditional on no swap.

40|$|The pricing of {{sovereign}} credit risk {{is a necessary}} component of the financial architecture of the European Monetary Union. However, unnecessarily high and volatile risk premia on government bonds are currently preventing effective financial intermediation within the euro area, thereby inhibiting its economic recovery. Several proposals have been made on how these risk premia should be brought down, namely i) permanent pooling of funding through joint bond issuance, ii) temporary liquidity assistance through multilateral funds, iii) <b>debt</b> <b>buybacks</b> using multilateral funds, and iv) debt restructuring. This paper attempts to evaluate these four proposals. It argues that joint bond issuance will not achieve a meaningful reduction of liquidity premia in the sovereign bond market; these instruments would either create perverse incentives or accelerate the sovereign debt crisis for peripheral Europe. An institution to provide temporary liquidity assistance is a necessary addition to the institutional framework of EMU – {{there needs to be}} an EMF to complement the ECB. <b>Debt</b> <b>buybacks</b> using multilateral funds can be a very useful tool for solvent countries such as Spain; they can prevent an overshooting of risk premia that could turn a sovereign liquidity crisis into a solvency crisis. A quantitative assessment shows that <b>debt</b> <b>buybacks</b> at market prices are insufficient to correct Greece’s debt overhang, however. In the case of Greece, a voluntary exchange of existing government bonds into new obligations, complemented by a buyback option at a steep discount to face value, could restore sovereign creditworthiness and allow the private sector to regain market access at acceptable interest rates. In the absence of such an orderly and controlled reduction of public debt, highly indebted euro area governments will likely opt to restructure their sovereign debt unilaterally, if they fail to regain market access after several years. This could have unwelcome consequences for financial stability in the euro area, which should be avoided through a creative and cooperative approach to the problem...|$|R

40|$|The {{arguments}} {{put forward}} by Bulow and Rogoff (1988, 1991) against sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>buybacks</b> are re-examined in a willingness-to-pay framework. This paper argues that the Bulow-Rogoff framework treats default by a debtor as an event with no dead-weight loss, and, as such, underestimates the potential gains from a buyback. The willingness-to- pay framework allows dead-weight costs of default to be introduced in a consistent and simple fashion into the buybacks calculus. Two versions of this framework are considered. First, a model in which the default costs induce an all-or-nothing default decision is analysed. In this case, an ambiguous result is derived in which the variability of the debtor’s income determines whether (small) buybacks are beneficial to the debtor, even though expected total transfers to the creditor increase, consistent with Bulow-Rogoff. In a second version, default costs are modelled so as to induce at most a partial default. This model corresponds most closely, {{in terms of the}} repayment behaviour of the sovereign debtor, to the models used by Bulow and Rogoff. It is shown that small buybacks are always beneficial to the debtor in this case. The second version is extended to include an investment opportunity. Only if the country has sufficiently scarce resources when the investment can be made, will a buyback be harmful to the interests of the debtor.

This result holds for all buyback programs large and small, {{so long as they}} involve voluntary creditor participation and are not part of a larger deal including offsetting concessions from lenders.

In a model of intertemporal consumption smoothing, buybacks at the fair price are desirable if the country experiences unusually heavy export earnings and if large reserve holdings tend to increase transfers to creditors in default states. Concerted agreements in which debt repurchases are linked to cuts in interest rates or new money requirements can make buybacks at the fair price viable, while preventing the free-rider problem among lenders.

40|$|Much of the {{discussion}} of the risks of sovereign debt crises has focused on the issue of currency risk (see Dodd and Spiegel, 2005). This has led to the recommendation that countries should borrow in their local currency. Yet in the drive to develop local markets, many countries are running up domestic debt burdens. Although domestic debt has the advantage over foreign debt that it is not subject to a currency mismatch, countries are still forced to use scarce budget resources to repay the debt, and if the debt gets overly large, a country can run the risk of a debt crisis. There are many reasons that some countries have begun to accumulate large domestic debt burdens including financing external <b>debt</b> <b>buybacks,</b> sterilizing capital inflows, or financing domestic programs.

40|$|The {{troublesome}} debts of {{many developing}} countries have spawned much literature on why countries borrow, on what debt contributes to growth, on why countries repay, and {{on how to deal}} with existing debt. The author provides an analytical primer on the following aspects of sovereign debt : 1) the basic accounting concepts associated with debt and some data associated with external borrowing; 2) debt as a component of an optimizing model of borrowing in a competitive loan market, when the borrower faces an intertemporal budget constraint; 3) debt as a component of recent models of endogenous growth; 4) problems arising from sovereign risk, including problems of liquidity, enforcement, and revenue-raising to finance repayment; 5) incentives to repay; 6) options available to a creditor whose debtor is unwilling to meet current debt-service obligations; and 7) <b>debt</b> <b>buybacks.</b> The author concludes that in the absence of any efficiency cost imposed by outstanding debt, how much a buyback benefits the borrower depends on how much buying back debt reduces what is available for repayment later. The author also concludes that if there are efficiency losses associated with debt, debt forgiveness can benefit both a debtor nation and its creditors. Contrary to claims in the literature, this outcome does not require that a reduction in the face value of debt raise its market value, and the debtor benefits even though the buyback raises the market price of the debt.

40|$|Top {{commercial}} banks {{seemed to have}} weathered the debt crisis, however {{it remains to be}} seen whether their current strength and stability will help reestablish normal credit relationships between private banks and the developing countries. Some losses by private creditors are likely to be part of any resolution of the debt crisis, and such losses are implicit in some of the many proposals for dealing with the crisis. However, through a combination of self interest and public policy the current impasse in the debt crisis should be overcome. This may be done partly through large scale debt swaps sponsored by private or public agencies. Debt swaps are already being implemented bilaterally in small steps and through a variety of instruments, including <b>debt</b> conversions and <b>buybacks.</b> Banks&Banking Reform,Financial Intermediation,Financial Crisis Management&Restructuring,Economic Theory&Research,Municipal Financial Management...|$|R

[...] In 1988, Steven and Mitchell Rales, of the Cardinal Acquisition Corporation, offered $2.5 billion for the company. [...] In response to the offer, Interco's board authorized $1.95 billion in additional <b>debt</b> to <b>buyback</b> stock. [...] Senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to restructure the company, including a plan to sell 16 of Interco's 20 companies. [...] While this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover, the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years. [...] From 1989 to 1991, Interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions {{in an attempt to}} remain solvent. [...] While the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation, the full value of these assets was never realized by Interco, as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds. [...] The combination of selling the majority of its companies, while being saddled by over $2 billion in debt, created unsustainable negative cash flow, resulting in Inteco's bankruptcy in 1991. [...] Thus in spite of being a profitable subsidiary, International Hat was liquidated in 1989 in a fire sale to Paramount Cap Company.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyIntroducción During the 1990 s {{the market}} for Latin America's debt grew in volume, types of {{instruments}} traded and number of investors and trade houses involved. Investors were drawn by high growthpotential and high yields in most Latin American countries, {{as well as by}} a general trend towards the implementation of economic and political reforms. As a result, the relative size of Latin America's market worldwide grew. This growth, however, was affected by a series of market events that underscored Latin America's vulnerability to financial shocks. Growth in trading volumes and asset values was first interrupted in 1994, in the aftermath of Mexico's peso devaluation in mid-December. Mexico's devaluation set in motion 'contagion' (the 'tequila effect');, which depressed market values throughout Latin America and other emerging markets during early 1995. Investor confidence recovered by mid- 1995, following the massive rescue package for Mexico organized by the International Monetary Fund with support from United States and other G- 7 countries. Capital flows to Latin America and other emerging markets grew considerably for the next two years. Market conditions were favorable until the onset of financial and economic difficulties in Southeast Asia in mid- 1997. Market contagion spread these difficulties to Russia by mid- 1998, which in turn led to more general, and more severe, contagion throughout the emerging markets {{in the latter half of}} 1998. The resulting loss of investor confidence eventually led to Brazil's January 1999 devaluation. An essential element of external financing in the 1990 s was increasing access to the international bond market. The importance of bond financing as a source of external funding to Latin America rose substantially, with the number and value of bonds issued surging considerably over the course of the decade. Bond financing is currently one of the fastest growing sources of external development financing, being second only to foreign direct investment. On average, bond financing became the second major source of funding in Latin America in the 1990 s. In order to assess the role of bonds as a source of external finance in Latin America in the 1990 s, it is important to understand the behavior and evolution of bond spreads and the changes in debt composition due to liability management. This paper looks first at the role of the Brady plan, which redefined Latin America's integration into the global economy during the 1990 s, as well as the role of <b>debt</b> <b>buybacks</b> and swaps. The changes in the composition of sovereign debt throughout the decade and the behavior of spreads are also analyzed, including the influence of credit ratings on Latin American bond spreads. In the 1990 s the outstanding stock and volume of sovereign tradable Latin American debt showed an unprecedented increase, as it became increasingly liquid with the development of secondary markets. As liquidity increased, Latin American debt markets became more volatile. Bond flows to Latin America experienced strong volatility throughout the decade and were strongly concentrated in middle-income countries, particularly in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Spreads responded not only to economic fundamentals, but were subject to market sentiment as well. As a result, issues of financial volatility and contagion were particularly relevant to Latin American countries...|$|R
