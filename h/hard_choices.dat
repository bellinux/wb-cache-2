25|$|While also {{available}} in Hong Kong and Taiwan, <b>Hard</b> <b>Choices</b> was effectively banned in mainland China as publishers there declined to purchase either the translation or English-language distribution rights for the book. Although Chinese publishers did not offer a specific reason for declining to buy the book, Simon & Schuster asserted that the ban was politically motivated as import agencies and publishers were fearful of retaliation by the Chinese government for printing material that was too politically sensitive, such as the chapter-length coverage of Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng and Clinton's generally critical comments about the Chinese government.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the book's publication, it was said to have already {{received}} one million pre-orders. [...] In actuality, Simon & Schuster said that it during its first week on sale, it sold over 100,000copies, a figure supported by extrapolation of the underlying Nielsen BookScan data. [...] It debuted at first on the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover nonfiction. [...] During its second and third weeks of availability, sales of <b>Hard</b> <b>Choices</b> declined markedly, but were still enough to keep it atop the Times Best Sellers list. [...] In the fourth week, sales declined again and the book surrendered the top spot on the Times Best Sellers list to Edward Klein's Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas, a lurid and lightly sourced account of purported rivalries between the two couples and within each marriage. [...] By this point, <b>Hard</b> <b>Choices</b> had sold some 177,000 physical copies.

2500|$|Beckett {{also wanted}} to explore themes about making <b>hard</b> <b>choices.</b> To {{think outside the box}} {{sometimes}} requires not only [...] "transgressive" [...] but extremely [...] "cruel" [...] behavior, he told Kirkus Reviews. The ramifications of John Redlantern's transgression, he noted, also has a wide number of unintended ramifications. The novel explores a socially and theologically conservative society's reaction to this transgression, which at first leads to a reactionary response. Only later does it lead to social upheaval in ways some characters predict (most notably Tina Spiketree's fears of patriarchy) but in ways no one can anticipate. Beckett said much of {{the latter part of the}} novel is about how positive, creative new ways of thinking can still harm people badly, and force people to make sacrifices they do not wish to make.|$|E

40|$|In {{almost every}} culture, ambitious women were once {{hindered}} by stereotypes regarding their priorities and were often compelled {{to make the}} <b>hard</b> <b>choice</b> between a serious career and their typical role of making a family.

2500|$|The book {{continued}} to accumulate sales into the year following its publication. [...] By March 2015, Nielsen BookScan had it selling 264,000 copies, and figure that rose to 280,000 copies by July 2015 and 292,200 copies by March 2016. [...] By mid-2015, Clinton had {{earned more than}} $5million in royalties from the book. [...] Compared to recent books published by the many 2016 Republican presidential candidates, her sales were well short of Ben Carson's One Nation: What We Can All Do To Save America's Future, but were well ahead of those {{of any of the}} others, with only the combined sales of a pair of books by Donald Trump coming close. [...] By late November 2015, counting both print and e-books, Time magazine said <b>Hard</b> <b>Choices</b> had sold a little over 340,000 units.|$|E
2500|$|The {{book was}} {{promoted}} partly {{in light of}} the possibility of a Clinton bid in the 2016 presidential election (in which, two years after the release of the book, she would go on to win the Democratic nomination then lose to Donald Trump in the general election). [...] Excerpts from the book were released in advance of its publication. [...] Clinton staged an extensive promotional tour for the book, which had the air of a political campaign with groups both for and against her appearing at book-signing events. [...] <b>Hard</b> <b>Choices</b> became number one on the New York Times Best Seller List, but sold considerably less than her 2003 memoir, Living History. [...] Interpreting what sales of the book meant for her possible political future became a subject for discussion among interested parties.|$|E

Her comments came as President Obama sent his national security strategy to Congress. The document formed a blueprint for foreign policy, defense and national security {{for the last two}} years of President Obama's term. It had previously been updated in 2010. In a letter outlining the strategy, President Obama said that the US would [...] "always defend our interests and uphold our commitments to allies and partners", adding, [...] "But we have to make <b>hard</b> <b>choices</b> among many competing priorities and we must always resist the overreach that comes when we make decisions based upon fear." ...|$|E
