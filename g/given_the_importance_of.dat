The PVA 38th Corps planned to attack in full force against the ROK 7th Infantry Division's center and right flank, while two divisions from the 42nd Corps started to march through the hills in order to bypass the ROK 8th Infantry Division's right flank. <b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> this assault, Han Xianchu, one of Peng's deputies, personally commanded the 38th and 42nd Corps {{for the rest of}} the battle.|$|E

5|$|<b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> {{snowmelt}} to agriculture, hydrological runoff {{models that}} include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, {{and distribution of}} the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between {{the air and the}} snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm.|$|E

25|$|These {{features}} {{tend to make}} legal writing formal.

Yet not all formality in legal writing is justified. To the extent that formality produces opacity and imprecision, it is undesirable.

In particular, when legal content must be conveyed to nonlawyers, formality should give way to clear communication.|$|E
25|$|In visual art, the plagues have {{generally}} been reserved for works in series, especially engravings. Still, relatively few depictions in art emerged compared to other religious themes until the 19th century, when the plagues became more common subjects, with John Martin and Joseph Turner producing notable canvases. This trend probably reflected a Romantic attraction to landscape and nature painting, for which the plagues were suited, a Gothic attraction to morbid stories, and a rise in Orientalism, wherein exotic Egyptian themes found currency. <b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> noble patronage throughout Western art history, the plagues may have found consistent disfavor because the stories emphasize the limits of a monarch's power, and images of lice, locusts, darkness, and boils were ill-suited for decoration in palaces and churches.|$|E

25|$|Caesar {{realized}} that his siege would fail unless he could get Vercingetorix off the high ground. He used one legion as a decoy while the rest moved onto better ground, capturing three Gallic camps in the process. He then ordered a general retreat to lure Vercingetorix off the high ground. However, the order was not heard by most of Caesar's force. Instead, spurred on by {{the ease with which}} they captured the camps, they pressed on toward the town and mounted a direct assault on it. The Aedui arrived at that moment but the Romans mistook them for enemies at the beginning and Caesar had to make order in his lines. The noise of the assault alerted Vercingetorix who arrived and saw the Roman and Aedui just beneath the walls of Gergovia. Vercingetorix then led a cavalry charge which crushed the Roman lines. After the cavalry charge, the warriors left their horses and joined the infantry who were fighting the Romans, who had suffered heavy casualties. <b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the disaster Caesar ordered a retreat. In the wake of the battle, Caesar lifted his siege and fled the Arverni lands in the direction of Aedui territory.|$|E
25|$|The Alexandrian {{contribution}} to Christian mysticism centers on Origen and Clement of Alexandria. Clement {{was an early}} Christian humanist who argued that reason {{is the most important}} aspect of human existence and that gnosis (not something we can attain by ourselves, but the gift of Christ) helps us find the spiritual realities that are hidden behind the natural world and within the scriptures. <b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> reason, Clement stresses apatheia as a reasonable ordering of our passions in order to live within God's love, which is seen as a form of truth. Origen, who had a lasting influence on Eastern Christian thought, further develops the idea that the spiritual realities can be found through allegorical readings of the scriptures (along the lines of Jewish aggadah tradition), but he focuses his attention on the Cross and on the importance of imitating Christ through the Cross, especially through spiritual combat and asceticism. Origen stresses the importance of combining intellect and virtue (theoria and praxis) in our spiritual exercises, drawing on the image of Moses and Aaron leading the Israelites through the wilderness, and he describes our union with God as the marriage of our souls with Christ the Logos, using the wedding imagery from the Song of Songs. Alexandrian mysticism developed alongside Hermeticism and Neoplatonism and therefore share some of the same ideas, images, etc. in spite of their differences.|$|E

While the modern student may tend to pay more attention to the girdle as the eminent object offered by the lady, readers in the time of Gawain would have noticed the significance of the offer of the ring as they believed that rings, and especially the embedded gems, had talismanic properties similarly done by the Gawain-poet in Pearl. This is especially true of the lady's ring as scholars believe it to be a ruby or carbuncle, indicated when the Gawain-Poet describes it as a [...] "brygt sunne" [...] (line 1819), a [...] "fiery sun."
