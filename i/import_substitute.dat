40|$|This paper uses {{regional}} panel data {{to investigate}} the mechanism of how FDI has contributed to China’s regional development through quantifying regional marketization level. It is found that FDI inflow generates a demonstration effect in identifying regional market conditions for {{investment in fixed assets}} and hence affects industrial location. In addition, its effects on regional export and regional income growth varied across east, central and west China since {{the second half of the}} 1990 s, depending on FDI-orientation in different regions. In east China, geographical advantage in export attracts FDI inflow and FDI promotes export. In addition, rise of FDI-GDP ratio increases regional share in industrial value added in east China. These effects contribute positively to regional income growth in east China although there is a direct crowding out effect between FDI and domestic investment (as input) in growth. In contrast, the negative impact of FDI inflow in central China on regional export orientation weakens its contribution to regional income growth. Furthermore, contribution of improvement of market mechanism to regional development is evidenced in attracting FDI, in promoting export and directly contributing to regional income growth.

40|$|Adoption of the {{improved}} maize package was particularly rapid {{during the period}} 1980 - 86 when an attractive guaranteed price was offered and extension activities were reinforced by a maize project that included {{the establishment of a}} seed multiplication program. Following cereal market price liberalization in 1986, maize prices fell and have been subject to considerable variability. Area has continued to expand, but farmers have greatly reduced fertilizer use, switched back to maize-late millet intercropping, and substituted early maturing varieties better suited to their own food security needs. The estimated internal rate of return (IRR) to investment in maize research and extension in southern Mali over the period 1969 - 90 is 135 %. This high rate can be attributed to low research costs (much of the technical package was borrowed from research conducted elsewhere in West Africa), and the high economic value of maize as an <b>import</b> <b>substitute.</b> Sensitivity analysis indicates that the IRR is robust with respect to adverse changes in assumptions concerning overvaluation of the exchange rate, research costs, extension costs, and area of improved maize.

40|$|How did India {{effect the}} {{transition}} from <b>import</b> <b>substituting</b> industrialization towards trade-led growth, {{in the context of}} a plural polity? It is argued that a pro-trade executive orientation at the time of a severe foreign exchange crisis can enable the executive to initiate significant policy change, if the executive takes advantage of the agreement with the IMF. Both the pro-trade orientation and the arrival of the severe foreign exchange crisis in 1991 are explained by tracing the process from India’s path of <b>import</b> <b>substituting</b> industrialization. The exogenous shock, a temporary rise in oil prices in 1990, was less significant than the ISI driven fiscal deficit, for generating the balance of payments crisis. Path reversals need not depend largely on an exogenous shock, as a path may have a built-in tendency to get reversed.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explain the pattern of {{industrial}} investment in India under British rule. While the export oriented industries, such as tea and jute relied largely on British investment, the major <b>import</b> <b>substituting</b> activity, the cotton textile industry, was dominated by Indian owned firms. While the existing literature has explained the dominant role of British investment mainly using political and social advantages arising from the imperial domination of policy and its access to economic and social networks, this paper argues that informational factors {{play an important role}} in determining this industrial divide. British entrepreneurs had good knowledge of the export market, in the mother country, that Indians did not have. On the other hand, Indian industrial entrepreneurs had extensive knowledge of the local market, coming from their background in trade. Thus the divergent flow of entrepreneurship can be explained by the comparative advantage that each type of had, Indians for the <b>import</b> <b>substituting</b> industry, and British for the export industries.

40|$|The {{combination}} of modern economic-geographical methods and methodological approaches {{is used for}} the social-economic forecasting. The two-dimensional language reguires the simultaneous description of basic characteristics of the object (system or process) and its distinct positioning on the territory and on the taxonomic scale of the spatial hierarchy. It provides the framework for methodological unity. The spatial analysis includes both the oldest comparative-geographical methods and the modern mathematical. These methods provide an adequate analysis of Russian social-economic regularities. Mathematical statistics was used to reveal the gobal synergetic effects that determine spatial development of the three main types of states, i. e. developed, developing and transitional economies. The paper shows that the fundamental feature of the Russian economy is the abolition of the low prices' system, which determined the overall Russian reality until 1992 and the deep inequilibrium of the supply prices today. This inequilibrium caused the disintegration of the Russian economic space, the local and regional market autonomy, and the flows of goods and passengers under their abrupt decline and redistribution. Under these conditions there are two main development trajectories for Russia: a) an inertia oriented towards the raw material production, with limited defense of the Russian market in the coordination with the WTO principles; b) an orientation towards innovational activities without a refuse from the support of the traditional exports and <b>import</b> <b>substitute</b> industries (taking into account their economic efficiency). The paper discusses mostly the second trajectory. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a {{brief review of}} agriculture situation in Morocco and deals with evaluating the effects of Morocco's incentive policy on performance and international competitiveness of four agricultural produce. These products are: green house tomatoes, two citrus fruits: the large orange variety Maroc- Late and the small fruit Clementine, and olive oil. Data of the respective agricultural chains of the four products were collected in two major producing areas of the products, and were used to calculate the Nominal Protection Coefficients (NPC) and the Effective Protection Coefficients (EPC) to evaluate the effects of the local incentive policy, and to calculate the Domestic Resource Cost (DRC) ratios as indicators of international competitiveness of the products. The four NPC ratios, which all were less than one, indicate that the four products are relatively taxed. In addition, the EPC's show that along with the direct taxes on these products, indirect taxes on their inputs are further penalizing these products. All the DRC ratios for the four products were also less than one, indicating a comparative advantage and an efficient allocation of domestic resources. Green house tomatoes had the smallest DRC, 0. 36. Those of the two citrus products were a little higher; 0. 41 for the Clementine and 0. 50 for Maroc- Late. Olive oil had the highest, 0. 93, DRC. The low yield per hectare is the main contributor to this relatively modest performance. However, there is a considerable potential for this product if its productivity is improved and the processing industry along with the marketing channels are modernized. Reforms therefore need to be implemented to correct the distortions introduced by the current incentive system which is biased against the export oriented products and is favorable to <b>import</b> <b>substitute</b> products. Such reforms will have to ensure better allocations of domestic resources according to the comparative advantage of the country and to deal with the challenges facing the agricultural sector within the trade agreements signed by Morocco with its trade partners.

40|$|This article {{examines}} exchange rate pass-through into prices of internationally traded {{goods in the}} case of a small emerging open market economy such as Turkey. In this study, we provide empirical evidence on complete pass-through in export prices in Turkey using aggregate data on the manufacturing sector. Our data do not however support complete pass-through in import prices in Turkey. This contradicts with the findings of the existent literature, which typically concludes that the degree of pass-through in import prices is higher than the one of export prices. This can be interpreted as a result of competition between <b>import</b> and <b>import</b> <b>substituting</b> industries where importers fall short of competing successfully with <b>import</b> <b>substituting</b> sectors. Although Turkish importers can be responsive to exchange rate changes to a certain degree in the short-run, in the long-run, they seem to lose their market power perhaps as a result of swift competition. A complete exchange rate pass-through to export prices in Turkey implies that the Turkish manufacturing export sector has the competitive strength to transmit exchange rate movements into their prices. ...|$|R
40|$|Decisions on {{the effects}} of {{safeguard}} mechanisms have been more on theoretical grounds often due to lack of precise estimation of elasticities {{that can be used to}} calibrate welfare effects. Alston et. al., (2002) demonstrate that the double logarithmic demand models can be augmented by Slutsky equation to create compensated demand equations which, when estimated result into precise compensates elasticities important for welfare analysis. This study demonstrates a similar adjustment on a dynamic double log Imperfect <b>Import</b> <b>substitutes</b> model to allow for estimation of compensated and uncompensated elasticities. Elasticities from three estimators OLS, SURE and IV indicate that imported wheat, maize and rice are normal commodities in Kenya. The uncompensated elasticities are bigger in magnitude than the compensated elasticities. Focusing on wheat, these compensated elasticities are subsequently used to estimate welfare measures of import tariffs or safeguard mechanisms through the manifested price changes. Results favour a non-tariff wheat importation regime and also favor consumer protection. The study recommends removal of the tariff rate and alternative ways of improving domestic wheat production rather than import restrictions.

40|$|In {{the less}} {{developed}} countries employment generation {{has emerged as a}} major problem. Those countries characterized by <b>import</b> <b>substituting</b> industrialization have been especially unable to expand employment opportunities, and their industrialization has been capital intensive in nature. Two different explanations for the failure of <b>import</b> <b>substituting</b> industrialization to absorb labor have been put forth. One school of thought Stresses the structural characteristics of industrialization, while an alternative explanation focuses on distortions in the factor markets. Much of this controversy implicitly revolves around the magnitude of the elasticities of Substitution — the "structural critic" school maintaining very Iow, or zero, elasticities of Substitution and the "market critic" school implying relatively high elasticities of Substitution. The CES production function is fitted to a regional cross-section of twenty-two Brazilian industries. The OLS estimates, made from 1960 industrial census data, show elasticities of Substitution ranging from. 44 to 2. 67 with over 50 percent of those estimated falling between. 8 and 1. 1. For the total manufacturing sector the elasticity of Substitution (estimated across states) was 1. 0. The relatively high estimated elasticities of Substitution provide Support for the "market critic" school. Using the production function estimates to generate factor demand functions, the importance of factor market distortions is indicated. Distortions in the Brazilian labor market are quantified and, assuming their removal, a Iower bound estimate of the resulting employment generation is made, amounting to an increase of 11. 4 percent in total manufacturing employment. Because of data limitations and the difficulties in quantification, no similar estimates were made regarding the capital market distortions. [...] ...|$|R
