25|$|In 1934, Mitsubishi Shipbuilding was {{merged with}} the Mitsubishi Aircraft Co., a company {{established}} in 1920 to manufacture aircraft engines and other parts. The unified company was known as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), and was the largest private company in Japan. MHI concentrated on manufacturing aircraft, ships, railroad cars and machinery, but in 1937 developed the PX33, a prototype sedan for military use. It was the first Japanese-built passenger car with <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> a technology the company would return to almost fifty years later in its quest for motorsport and sales success.|$|E
25|$|Daimler-Benz {{also has}} a history in four-wheel drive. In 1907 the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft had built a four-wheel-driven vehicle called Dernburg-Wagen, also {{equipped}} with four-wheel steering, that was used by German colonial civil servant, Bernhard Dernburg, in Namibia. Mercedes and BMW, in 1926, introduced a rather sophisticated four-wheel drive, the G1, the G4 and G4 following. The 1937 Mercedes-Benz G5 and BMW 325 4×4 featured <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> four-wheel steering, three locking differentials, and fully independent suspension. They were produced because of a government demand for a four-wheel-drive passenger vehicle. The modern G-series/Wolf such as the G500 and G55 AMG still feature some of the attributes, {{with the exception of}} fully independent suspension since it hinders suspension articulation. The Unimog is another Mercedes truck.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1979, for the 1980 model year, AMC {{introduced}} {{four-wheel drive}} {{versions of the}} Spirit and Concord, calling the collective line the AMC Eagle. Eagles rapidly {{became one of the}} company's best-known products and {{is considered one of the}} first [...] "crossover SUVs". Eagles used the 2-wheel drive body shells mounted on an all-new platform developed by American Motors in the late 1970s. Featuring an innovative <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system, it sold best in snow-prone areas. Sales started strongly but declined over time. While the two-wheel drive Spirit and Concord were both discontinued after 1983 as the company concentrated on its new Renault Alliance, the Eagle survived for five years longer, albeit only in station wagon form, into the 1988 model year. This meant the four-wheel drive Eagle was the lone representative of the AMC brand from 1984–1988. All the company's remaining output was branded Renault or Jeep. The last AMC Eagle was built on December 14, 1987.|$|E
50|$|Expedition was {{available}} with automatic <b>full-time</b> ControlTrac <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> with two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4406 transfer case and a center multi-disc differential. ControlTrac {{was introduced in}} 1995 and included four selectable modes: Two High, Auto, Four High (lock) and Four Low (lock). Two High mode and Auto mode with auto-lock was not available.|$|R
50|$|The heavyweight 6,155 lb (3+ ton) as tested, 2015 Expedition Platinum with 3.5 EcoBoost V-6 and {{selectable}} automatic <b>full-time</b> ControlTrac <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> was clocked from 0 to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds. The full-size SUV can clip 100 mph in 18.2 seconds, 110 mph in 24.3 seconds, and is electronically safety-limited to 113 mph. Expedition has a near perfect 50:50 front:rear balanced {{weight distribution}} and {{center of gravity}} positioned at 28.5 inches.|$|R
50|$|Selectable {{automatic}} <b>full-time</b> Control Trac <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{designed by}} BorgWarner is standard on all 4x4 Expeditions. There are four modes: Two High mode, Auto mode, Four High mode and Four Low mode. Each mode can be selected via a rotary control dial on the dash.|$|R
5000|$|Symmetric <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (on Lexus RX and Highlander) ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1983 saw the new <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system, Selec-Trac, replace Quadra-Trac; ...|$|E
50|$|The 2008 HX show car {{was smaller}} than both the H2 and H3. It {{featured}} a 3.6 L V6 engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. The HX shared with other Hummers a body-on-frame design, with front and rear independent suspensions, four-wheel-disc brakes, and <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{selectable}} automatic <b>full-time</b> ControlTrac <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system {{continues to}} be offered, but gains a trio of new off-road electronic systems {{in the form of}} Hill Ascent Assist (HAA), Hill Descent Control (HDC), and Ford Truck Apps (FTA). FTA gives off-road orientation/geometry, 4x4 system status, and traction control system status in real-time. The four-wheel electronic traction control system (brake differential locking control) was recalibrated {{to take into account the}} new EcoBoost V-6's higher torque output and earlier torque delivery.|$|R
5000|$|The {{automatic}} <b>full-time</b> ControlTrac <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system remained available, with an uprated two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4416 {{transfer case}}. The new transfer case featured an updated intelligent locking center multi-disc differential with front-to-rear [...] "torque biasing" [...] capability in Auto mode. A new dedicated microprocessor with new control software was added allowing {{the system to}} detect different terrain and surface conditions to predict traction loss before it happens. Two High mode was also reintroduced. Four-wheel electronic traction control was now available as an option, and simulated front and rear differential locks.|$|R
50|$|The 1999 {{model year}} {{received}} a facelift {{similar to that}} of the 1999 model year Ford F-150. Included in the update was a new front grille which now dropped lower in the center, grille work, as well as a new front bumper that incorporated the fog lamps into the lower valance and larger center air intake. Both the 4.6 liter and 5.4 liter V8 engines received updates including more power and torque. The Two High mode for automatic <b>full-time</b> ControlTrac <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> equipped models was dropped leaving only Auto, Four High (lock) and Four Low (lock) modes. The dashboard also received an updated radio and air conditioning controls and revised Gauge Cluster and a Digital Odometer for the first time.|$|R
50|$|Initially, the Niva had a {{carbureted}} 1.6-litre {{overhead cam}} four-cylinder petrol engine producing 54 kW (72 hp) and 126 N·m (93 lb·ft), a four-speed manual transmission, and (until today) <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b> In 1985, the transmission {{was changed to}} a five-speed; because the transfer case is a separate unit, it remains very noisy and creates excessive vibration.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{generation}} {{also saw the}} introduction of Super Select 4WD (SS4) as ActivTrak 4WD in some markets, multimode ABS, which were firsts on Japanese four-wheel drives, and electronic shock absorber. SS4 was ground-breaking {{in the sense that}} it combined the advantages of part-time and <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> with four available options: 2H (high-range rear-wheel drive), 4H (high-range <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive),</b> 4HLc (high-range four-wheel drive with locked center differential) and 4LLc (low-range four-wheel drive with locked center differential). Another advantage of this {{second generation}} system is that it gave the driver the ability to switch between two-wheel drive and <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> at speeds up to 100 km/h (62 mph), whereas the first generation Pajero had to be stationary to switch from rear-wheel drive to four-wheel drive (but not from four-wheel drive back to rear-wheel drive). In addition to the SS4, an air locking differential was included as factory option. Either 4HLc or 4LLc mode must be engaged to perform this operation. Multimode ABS, on the other hand, was equally innovative. This meant ABS would be fully functional in all modes of SS4, as braking with a locked center differential requires completely different braking parameters. The new electronic shock absorber was also factory option with three settings: S (soft), M (medium), and H (hard). This meant driver can change ride quality and handling depending on road conditions via a switch on center console.|$|E
50|$|The Infantry Carrier Vehicle {{provides}} protected transport and, during dismounted assault, {{supporting fire}} for the infantry squad. The Stryker is a <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> selectively eight-wheel drive, armoured vehicle weighing approximately 19t which carries an infantry squad with their equipment. On paved roads the vehicle can attain speeds of 62 mph without a governor and 37 mph with a governor.|$|E
5000|$|Selectable {{automatic}} <b>full-time</b> Control Trac <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{continues to}} be offered, and uses a two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4417 transfer case with intelligent locking center multi-disc differential and [...] "torque biasing" [...] capability. Four-wheel electronic traction control is standard and off-road underbody skid plate armor is optional. A new default off-road program with throttle response recalibration was added, and is automatically activated when Four Low (lock) mode is selected. Expedition can achieve an off-road crawl ratio of 41.06:1 with a low range ratio of 2.64:1 and rear axle ratio of 3.73:1.|$|R
50|$|The Massif is {{fitted with}} a 6-speed ZF 6S400 {{overdrive}} manual gearbox with high and low range ratios. No automatic was available. The Massif also has selectable <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> like its forebear the Land Rover Series (but unlike the Land Rover Defender which has permanent <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive).</b> This was intended to reduce fuel consumption, claimed as “up to 10%” by Iveco. The decision to have selectable <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{is believed to be}} because Iveco suggested permanent <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> is unnecessary for the majority of driving conditions. The Massif is usually in four-by-two, rear-wheel <b>drive</b> unless <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> is engaged.|$|R
50|$|The fifth {{generation}} 2011 Ford Explorer (U502) replaced automatic ControlTrac <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{with automatic}} Intelligent <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and Terrain Management.|$|R
5000|$|Humvees feature <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> {{independent}} suspension, steep {{approach and}} departure angles, 60-percent gradeability and 16 in of ground clearance. Most recent production models included the M1151, M1152, M1165, and M1167. As of 2015, Humvees are in {{use by the}} U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Navy. The combined fleet is about 140,000 Humvees. More than 50 friendly foreign nations also have Humvees.|$|E
50|$|The Compass also {{features}} two electronically controlled four-wheel drive systems. Freedom Drive I and Freedom Drive II, Freedom Drive I is a <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system with locking capabilities; Freedom Drive II {{is based on}} Freedom Drive I but by using the vehicle's CVT transmission {{it is capable of}} a 19:1 gear reduction simulating a low-range usually found in vehicles with dedicated transfer cases.|$|E
50|$|Active Drive I is a <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{system that}} {{requires}} no driver input. This system under normal conditions sends all available torque {{to the front}} wheels while monitoring {{the speed of the}} front and rear axles. If the system detects that the front axle is moving more quickly than the rear axle then the system will send power through the power transfer unit to the rear axle until the speeds are the same.|$|E
50|$|<b>Four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> demand {{increased}} significantly, with Versatile {{becoming one}} of the leaders in <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> development and production. By the late 1970s the Versatile lineup included tractors ranging from 220 to 330 horsepower. With the 1980s came an expanded line of <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> tractors that stretched to 470 horsepower in the Versatile 1150.|$|R
50|$|The 6HP19A is a {{variation}} of the 6HP19 for <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> applications. It was used by the Volkswagen Group for some permanent <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> models.|$|R
50|$|For {{vehicles}} that have partial <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> the term two-wheel drive {{refers to the}} mode when <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> is deactivated and torque is applied to only two wheels.|$|R
50|$|Under the skin, it {{utilised}} a 6G72 24-valve 3.0-litre DOHC V6 {{with gasoline}} direct injection, mated to an INVECS-II five-speed semi-automatic transmission. The electronically controlled, <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system was heavily {{based on that}} of the high performance Legnum VR-4 wagon, incorporating a center differential and Active Yaw Control (AYC). The same car was the donor of the four wheel multi-link suspension, rear self-levelling mechanism, and RISE (Reinforced Impact Safety Evolution) passive safety construction.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] F6A engines {{were joined}} by a new {{high-performance}} [...] K6A (HA21) for the Works RS/Z model. Front-wheel drive or <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> were offered, in three- or five-door sedans or as a three-door van. The Works model was also reclassified as a sedan, as many advantages for light commercial cars had vanished. The tailgate and rear doors are still fairly angular, but the front was more rounded than previous models.|$|E
50|$|Two {{versions}} of the car are offered in the U.S. The Lancer Evolution MR, with 6-speed Twin Clutch Sportronic Shift Transmission (TC-SST). The other version is the GSR which has a 5-speed manual transmission system. The car also has a new <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system named S-AWC (Super All Wheel Control), an advanced version of Mitsubishi's AWC system used in previous generations. The S-AWC uses torque vectoring technology to send different amounts of torque to the rear wheels.|$|E
50|$|Access to both {{sections}} of the park requires a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicle. <b>Four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles on Fraser Island need to obtain a vehicle permit. Both sections have numerous camping areas.|$|R
50|$|Audi {{released}} the original Quattro to European customers in late 1980, featuring Audi's quattro permanent <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system (hence its name), {{and the first}} to mate <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> with a turbocharged engine.|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{introduced}} {{the option of}} the F-Series in <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b> Previously a conversion outsourced to Marmon-Herrington, Ford {{was the first of}} the [...] "big three" [...] U.S. manufacturers to manufacture <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> trucks on its own.|$|R
50|$|ControlTrac {{four-wheel drive}} is {{the brand name}} of a {{selectable}} automatic <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system offered by Ford Motor Company. The four-wheel drive system was designed and developed at BorgWarner under its TorqTransfer Systems division in the mid 1980s. BorgWarner calls the system Torque-On-Demand (TOD). ControlTrac was the first automatic system to use software control and no planetary or bevel geared center differential. Instead of a planetary or bevel geared center differential, the system uses a variable intelligent locking center multi-disc differential.|$|E
5000|$|S-AWC (Super All Wheel Control) is {{the brand}} name of an {{advanced}} <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system developed by Mitsubishi Motors. The technology, specifically developed for the new 2007 Lancer Evolution, is an advanced version of Mitsubishi's AWC system. Mitsubishi first exhibited S-AWC integration control technology in the Concept-X model at the 39th Tokyo Motor Show in 2005. According to Mitsubishi, [...] "the ultimate embodiment of the company's AWC philosophy is the S-AWC system, a 4WD-based integrated vehicle dynamics control system".|$|E
5000|$|Design of {{the vehicle}} began at the White Motor Company, based in Cleveland, in 1937. It had [...]25 in face-hardened armor, <b>full-time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (with no way to {{disengage}} it), four-speed manual constant-mesh (non-synchromesh) transmission (with one reverse gear) and two-speed transfer case, leaf spring suspension, manual steering, and (unusual for the period) vacuum-assisted (power) brakes. The wheelbase was 131 in, tread 65.25 in. The wheels were 8.5 in wide, 20 in diameter, and used standard 12-ply military non-directional tires. Fuel capacity was 30 gal.|$|E
50|$|The Jensen FF is a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> grand tourer {{produced}} by British car manufacturer Jensen Motors between 1966 and 1971. It {{was the first}} non all-terrain production car equipped with <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and an anti-lock braking system.|$|R
50|$|The {{gravel road}} is {{accessible}} by all vehicles {{but it would}} be advisable to have a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (4WD) in wet conditions. The Panhandle Fire Trail is a 9.5 km <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> trail located within the park.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the convertible in 1981, a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> version of the coupé was also added. The <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system was developed by Ferguson Research who also offered it for installation into the Opel Senator/Vauxhall Royale.|$|R
