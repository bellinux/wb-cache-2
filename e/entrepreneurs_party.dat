40|$|Since {{individuals}} demanding formations of new parties face {{a collective}} action problem, I inquire why people form new parties, and why this political strategy became increasingly popular between 1973 and 2002 in Swedish municipalities.

However, ‘strong emotions’ only explain why individuals form parties in the first place, not why party formation has become a popular strategy.

40|$|The role of {{national}} parliaments in scrutinising their governments in European Union affairs {{has been at}} the forefront of debates on democratic accountability in the European Union for the past two decades. Resolutions are the legislative instruments most clearly associated with government control. This article finds that party political strategies, and especially the different constraints and incentives for mainstream/government <b>parties</b> and issue <b>entrepreneurs</b> on Europe, are the most important factors determining the activity {{of national}} parliaments in the form of resolutions on European Union affairs. Issue <b>entrepreneurs</b> are <b>parties</b> which are Eurosceptic and for which Europe is salient. Motions initiated by issue entrepreneurs are numerous but limited to criticising the government and contain little technical detail, while the resolutions of mainstream government parties mostly support the government’s position. Resolutions and motions in European Union affairs are thus used rather as instruments of ‘position taking’ than as a form of government control, but could still help to foster accountability by bringing European Union issues and government policy to the citizens’ attention...|$|R
30|$|In Wenzhou, 46.38  % of the chairmen {{of private}} {{enterprises}} are party members, 41.81  % {{of the general}} managers are party members, and 50  % of companies {{do not have a}} party group. The fact that political beliefs are high among private business owners and the proportion of nonstate party organization is also high has its expected reasons. First, national policy promotes political beliefs. The 2002 revised Party Constitution and nonstate party organization construction policy in 2003 incorporated private business owners into the development of the Communist Party of China. The proportion of private <b>entrepreneurs</b> with Communist <b>Party</b> membership reached around one-third up to 2011. Among private businesses with scales of more than 100 million yuan of assets, 53.2  % of their owners hold party membership; another 40  % are willing {{to become part of the}} Communist Party (Zhang and Lu 2013). The proportion of private enterprises that establish party organizations increases by 2 to 3  % every 2  years; to date about 30 to 40  % of private companies have established party groups. In nearly 70  % of these companies, the position of committee (party branch) secretary is held by the private business owner (Zhang and Lu 2013 : 306 – 307). Second, after Xiaoping Deng’s southern trip in 1992, the 1994 state enterprise consolidation policies promoted rapid development of China’s private economy. As private enterprises revealed their identity, a number of state-owned/collective enterprises restructured their ownership and a number of government officials and intellectuals chose to start their own business. These restructured state-owned enterprises, government officials, and intellectuals became part of private businesses with original party membership. Thus, the fact that a high proportion of private <b>entrepreneurs</b> are <b>party</b> members is in a sense the result of the restructuring of state-owned enterprises as well as government officials (Dickson 2003, 2008; Tsai 2007). As a gathering place of private businesses, Wenzhou is especially pronounced in terms of these two aspects. For example, although Wenzhou has very few state-owned enterprises, restructuring of state-owned business is not a major factor; however, since 1992, the phenomena of government officials transforming into businessmen, “nonstate party organization establishment,” and “red CEO” recruitment in Wenzhou have had demonstrative effects for the whole country.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} was more {{complex in the}} MNR where, after a bitter internal struggle, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, a pragmatic former Minister of Planning and Coordination and prominent <b>entrepreneur,</b> captured the <b>party's</b> nomination. The MNR's strategy was to develop Sánchez de Lozada's image as a veteran movimientista (movement leader) to capture populist support. At the same time, party strategists intended to attract support from outside the party by building on the candidate's entrepreneurial background. The task of converting the candidate into an old party member apparently succeeded: old-line populist politicians dominated the first slots on the party's legislative lists. The naming of former President Walter Guevara Arze as the vice presidential candidate was perceived as {{further evidence of the}} party's success in influencing the candidate.|$|R
40|$|In a two-period model {{where an}} {{investment}} project is funded with standard debt, the probability distribution of final cash flow is determined, at the interim date, by an unverifiable {{state of nature}} together with a choice by the controlling <b>party</b> (<b>entrepreneur</b> or creditor). With a control allocation contingent on a noisy default signal, renegotiation may improve efficiency in two ways: (i) reduce excessive risk-taking - due to the entrepreneur's moral hazard - through debt forgiveness; (ii) avoid the costs of financial distress associated with excessive liquidation or underinvestment by debt-holders, by letting them receive an equity stake in the firm. Such efficiency gain is an advantage of bank loans over publicly traded debt, given that the former are more easily renegotiated than the latter. The {{difference between the two}} types of debt is increasing in the degree of contractual incompleteness (noise present in the default signal) and in the portion of project value accounted for by future discretionary investment options. incomplete contracts, debt renegotiation, financial distress, intermediation,...|$|R

The Nisga'a are conscious of the tourism trade potential in the Nass Valley, and the most effective plan to ensure a commitment from the Nisga'a to the promotion of a flourishing tourism industry would include a systematically coordinated effort by the nation - beginning with the Nisga'a Lisims Government (NLG) - and the individual tourism and hospitality industry <b>entrepreneur.</b> Each <b>party</b> would ideally be dedicated to the conservation of the pristine environment {{in conjunction with a}} tourism plan.

Nisga'a Lisims Government (NLG) can assess the industry in the province, as well as the Northwestern section on the province, and determine the best fit for the Nisga'a tourism offerings into the established industry. From their daily operations, an as-yet-to-be association of Nisga'a tourism operators can determine the needs of the industry, and thus recommend appropriate legislation development and implementations that best suit the needs of potential visitors to the Nisga'a territories. Additionally, this not-yet-formed association would enable local operators to develop the resources that will provide the best experience for the visitors. The opening of the Nisga'a Museum on May 11, 2011 can be a starting point for the governments, its institutions and the individual tourism operators to create awareness for the Nisga'a Tourism Industry.

40|$|Parties {{launched}} by political entrepreneurs are usually newcomers into {{more or less}} established party systems. Their "founding fathers" act without specific external group support and the literature on new parties predicts {{that there is a}} low survival rate for entrepreneurial parties. In the case of Poland, the party system had been relatively stable from the 2001 until the 2011 parliamentary elections and subsequently some new parties entered into politics, tried to gain electoral support as well as political relevance. The most recent groupings in the Polish political system which are closest to the theoretical concept of entrepreneurial parties are the Palikot's Movement (Ruch Palikota), Kukiz' 15 and the Modern Party (Nowoczesna). The aim of the paper is to examine to what extent the leaders of these parties can be seen as political <b>entrepreneurs</b> and the <b>parties</b> as "entrepreneurial parties". Another point we discuss is in which aspects the leaders of the parties examined are similar in their role of political entrepreneurs and in which they differ. In order to answer these questions, the previous careers of the leaders, the ways they entered politics and the strategies they used to achieve their goals will also be analyzed...|$|R

2500|$|The Maoist {{vision of}} modernity never [...] "enjoyed entire hegemony" [...] within the Party, {{and was always}} contested even {{at the height of}} Mao's power. Zhou Enlai's {{launching}} of the Four Modernizations in 1965 (and again 1975) are an example of this. When Mao died, the Four Modernizations replaced class struggle as the Party's key objective. This vision eventually led to the enfranchisement of the private market economy and the establishment of new institutions, and became Deng Xiaoping's [...] "socialism with Chinese characteristics". This in turn led to the adoption of alternative visions of modernity popular in the Western world. Ideological change led to factional strife, with many leading members of the party calling for a return to the classical socialist model of development. From the outside world these changes may seem odd: a society which looks more capitalist by the day is still ruled by a Party that claims [...] "fidelity to socialism". However, there is [...] "less understanding of how this looks from within". A break with the basic tenets of Maoist thought came in the 1990s, when Jiang Zemin talked of the need to let private <b>entrepreneurs</b> join the <b>Party.</b> This decision had a stronger connection to realpolitik then to ideological conviction.
