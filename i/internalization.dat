5|$|Poliovirus infects {{human cells}} by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, CD155, (also {{known as the}} {{poliovirus}} receptor (PVR)) on the cell surface. Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the viral particle necessary for viral entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or that the virus is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that poliovirus binds to CD155 and is taken up by endocytosis. Immediately after <b>internalization</b> of the particle, the viral RNA is released.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, <b>internalization</b> of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E

25|$|A study {{dedicated}} to investigating the thin ideal <b>internalization</b> {{as a factor}} of bulimia nervosa is Thompson's and Stice's research. The aim of their {{study was to investigate}} how and to what degree does media affect the thin ideal <b>internalization.</b> Thompson and Stice used randomized experiments (more specifically programs) {{dedicated to}} teaching young women how to be more critical when it comes to media, in order to reduce thin ideal <b>internalization.</b> The results showed that by creating more awareness of the media's control of the societal ideal of attractiveness, the thin ideal <b>internalization</b> significantly dropped. In other words, less thin ideal images portrayed by the media resulted in less thin ideal <b>internalization.</b> Therefore, Thompson and Stice concluded that media affected greatly the thin ideal <b>internalization.</b> Papies showed {{that it is not the}} thin ideal itself, but rather the self-association with other persons of a certain weight that decide how someone with bulimia nervosa feels. People that associate themselves with thin models get in a positive attitude when they see thin models and people that associate with overweight get in a negative attitude when they see thin models. Moreover, it can be taught to associate with thinner people.|$|E
25|$|The first pivotal step in {{infectious}} pathogenesis is {{the attachment}} to the host tissues. The M-protein, the most extensively studied SDSE virulence factor, has been documented to facilitate both adherence to and <b>internalization</b> into host cells. Other adhesins have also been described, including the genes gfba, fnB, fbBA, fnBB, lmb and gapC; all mediating binding to fibronectin. gfba was recently shown contribute to bacterial <b>internalization</b> into endothelial cells and intracellular persistence. These properties may explain the tendency of recurrent bacteraemia observed in human SDSE-cases.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the previously cited example, actin polymerization is stimulated in the initial steps of the <b>internalization</b> of some viruses, notably HIV, by, for example, inactivating the cofilin complex.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} {{apoptosis}} to occur within OROV, viral uncoating, viral <b>internalization,</b> {{along with the}} replication of cells is necessary. Apoptosis in some viruses is activated by extracellular stimuli. However, {{studies have demonstrated that}} the OROV infection causes apoptosis to be activated through intracellular stimuli and involves the mitochondria.|$|E
25|$|On binding a ligand {{the protein}} and ligand are internalized. This <b>internalization</b> is {{independent}} of macropinocytosis and occurs by an actin dependent mechanism requiring the activation Src-family kinases, JNK and Rho-family GTPases. Unlike macropinocytosis this process is not affected by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Na+/H+ exchange.|$|E
25|$|Oocytes can be {{unusually large}} cells in species for which {{embryonic}} development takes place {{away from the}} mother's body. Their large size can be achieved either by pumping in cytosolic components from adjacent cells through cytoplasmic bridges (Drosophila) or by <b>internalization</b> of nutrient storage granules (yolk granules) by endocytosis (frogs).|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, salvinorin A shows {{atypical}} properties as an agonist of the KOR {{relative to}} other KOR agonists. For instance, it is 40-fold less potent in promoting <b>internalization</b> (that is, receptor downregulation) of the human KOR relative to the prototypical KOR agonist U-50488.The drug has been found not to produce diuresis in mice, possibly due to its short duration.|$|E
25|$|A {{person may}} {{experience}} multiple orgasms, or an involuntary orgasm, {{such as in}} the case of rape or other sexual assault. An involuntary orgasm from forced sexual contact often results in feelings of shame caused by <b>internalization</b> of victim-blaming attitudes. The incidence of those who experience unsolicited sexual contact and experience orgasm is very low, though possibly under-reported due to shame or embarrassment; such orgasms additionally happen regardless of gender.|$|E
25|$|Practitioners of Sufism {{hold that}} {{in its early stages}} of {{development}} Sufism effectively referred to nothing more than the <b>internalization</b> of Islam. According to one perspective, it is directly from the Qur'an, constantly recited, meditated, and experienced, that Sufism proceeded, in its origin and its development. Other practitioners have held that Sufism is the strict emulation of the way of Muhammad, through which the heart's connection to the Divine is strengthened.|$|E
25|$|Generation {{identity}} {{occurs when}} an individual recognises that {{they are part of}} a particular social subgroup, a cultural generation, and concern themselves with the <b>internalization</b> of external features of the world. The reminiscence bump occurs during a period of life where people form their individual and generational identity. The earlier years of the reminiscence bump coincide with the formation of generation identity, while the later years coincide with the formation of adult identity.|$|E
25|$|Her work {{makes clear}} that for medieval readers the act of reading itself had an oral phase in which the text was read aloud or sub-vocalized (silent reading was a less common variant, and {{appears to have been}} the {{exception}} rather than the rule), then meditated upon and 'digested' hence making it one's own. She asserts that both 'textual' activities (picturing and reading) have as their goal the <b>internalization</b> of knowledge and experience in memory.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam {{is often}} {{recommended}} {{due to its}} long elimination half-life and also because of its availability in low potency doses. The non-benzodiazepine Z drugs such as zolpidem, zaleplon, and zopiclone {{should not be used}} as a replacement for benzodiazepines, as they have a similar mechanism of action and can induce a similar dependence. The pharmacological mechanism of benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence is the <b>internalization</b> (removal) of receptor site in the brain and changes in gene transcription codes in the brain.|$|E
25|$|Several {{hypotheses}} {{are given}} about how tolerance develops, including opioid receptor phosphorylation (which {{would change the}} receptor conformation), functional decoupling of receptors from G-proteins (leading to receptor desensitization), μ-opioid receptor <b>internalization</b> or receptor down-regulation (reducing the number of available receptors for morphine to act on), and upregulation of the cAMP pathway (a counterregulatory mechanism to opioid effects) (For a review of these processes, see Koch and Hollt.) CCK might mediate some counter-regulatory pathways responsible for opioid tolerance. CCK-antagonist drugs, specifically proglumide, {{have been shown to}} slow the development of tolerance to morphine.|$|E

25|$|Within tissues, IGFBP-3 can bind IGF-1 and IGF-2 {{released}} by many cell types, and block {{their access to}} the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R), which is activated by both IGFs. IGFBP-3 also interacts with cell-surface proteins, affecting cell signaling from outside the cell or after <b>internalization,</b> and also enters the cell nucleus where it binds to nuclear hormone receptors and other ligands. High levels of IGFBP-3 within tumors are associated with increased cancer severity (or worse outcome) for some cancers, but decreased severity or better outcome for others. No cases of IGFBP3 gene deletion in humans have been reported, but mice lacking the gene show near-normal growth.|$|E
25|$|Sufi spiritual {{traditions are}} central to the Bengali Muslim way of life. The most common Sufi ritual is the Dhikr, the {{practice}} of repeating the names of God after prayers. Sufi teachings regard the Prophet Muhammad as the primary perfect man who exemplifies the morality of God. Sufism is regarded as the individual <b>internalization</b> and intensification of the Islamic faith and practice. The Sufis played a vital role in developing Bengali Muslim society during the medieval period. Historic Sufi missionaries are regarded as saints, including Shah Jalal, Khan Jahan Ali, Shah Farhan, Shah Amanat, and Khwaja Enayetpuri. Their mausoleums are focal points for charity, religious congregations, and festivities.|$|E

25|$|When {{dialogue}} journals {{are used}} with adult students in second language settings, {{and also in}} teacher preparation, personal and family concerns tend to dominate the topics introduced by both instructor and students, such as the trauma of migration for new immigrants. Anderson, Nelson, Richardson, Webb, & Young found some positive outcomes of dialogue journal use for middle school students at risk for academic failure, social isolation, and dropping out of school. A unique use of dialogue journals with adolescents in an HIV/STI prevention program found that the individualized written interactions helped assess participants’ understanding and <b>internalization</b> of information {{in a way that}} addressed unsafe behavior, built trust, and engaged those who were less likely to participate in class discussions.|$|E
25|$|The profuse binding of ricin {{to surface}} {{membranes}} allows <b>internalization</b> with {{all types of}} membrane invaginations. The holotoxin can be taken up by clathrin-coated pits, {{as well as by}} clathrin-independent pathways including caveolae and macropinocytosis. Intracellular vesicles shuttle ricin to endosomes that are delivered to the Golgi apparatus. The active acidification of endosomes is thought to have little effect on the functional properties of ricin. Because ricin is stable over a wide pH range, degradation in endosomes or lysosomes offers little or no protection against ricin. Ricin molecules are thought to follow retrograde transport via early endosomes, the trans-Golgi network, and the Golgi to enter the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} indicates that disruption of the blood–brain barrier in Alzheimer's disease patients allows blood plasma containing amyloid beta (Aβ) to enter the brain where the Aβ adheres preferentially {{to the surface of}} astrocytes. These findings have led to the hypotheses that (1) breakdown of the blood–brain barrier allows access of neuron-binding autoantibodies and soluble exogenous Aβ42 to brain neurons and (2) binding of these autoantibodies to neurons triggers and/or facilitates the <b>internalization</b> and accumulation of cell surface-bound Aβ42 in vulnerable neurons through their natural tendency to clear surface-bound autoantibodies via endocytosis. Eventually the astrocyte is overwhelmed, dies, ruptures, and disintegrates, leaving behind the insoluble Aβ42 plaque. Thus, in some patients, Alzheimer's disease may be caused (or more likely, aggravated) by a breakdown in the blood–brain barrier.|$|E
25|$|Iron export {{occurs in}} a variety of cell types, {{including}} neurons, erythrocytes, macrophages and enterocytes. The latter two are especially important since systemic iron levels depend upon them. There is only one known iron exporter, ferroportin. It transports ferrous iron out of the cell, generally aided by ceruloplasmin and/or hephaestin (mostly in enterocytes), which oxidize iron to its ferric state so it can bind ferritin in the extracellular medium. Hepcidin causes the <b>internalization</b> of ferroportin, decreasing iron export. Besides, hepcidin seems to downregulate both TFR1 and DMT1 through an unknown mechanism. Another player assisting ferroportin in effecting cellular iron export is GAPDH. A specific post translationally modified isoform of GAPDH is recruited to the surface of iron loaded cells where it recruits apo-transferrin in close proximity to ferroportin so as to rapidly chelate the iron extruded.|$|E
25|$|While {{the general}} {{bisexual}} {{population as a}} whole faces biphobia, this oppression is also aggravated by other factors such as race. In his examination of the bisexual male perspective, entitled, Managing Heterosexism and Biphobia: A Revealing Black Bisexual Male Perspective, Grady L. Garner delves into the oppression that he faces as both a black and bisexual male. He explains that the <b>internalization</b> of negative sociocultural messages, reactions, and attitudes can be incredibly distressing as bisexual black males attempted to translate or transform these negative experiences into positive bisexual identity sustaining ones. The experience of bisexual black males is different from that of bisexual white males. As the demands and tribulations of black bisexual males appear to be comparatively more distressing than those that black and white, homo- and heterosexual individual's encounter, this acknowledgement is important and vital to the understanding of biphobia from an intersectional perspective.|$|E
25|$|Signal {{transduction}} by a GPCR {{begins with}} an inactive G protein coupled to the receptor; the G protein exists as a heterotrimer consisting of Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits. Once the GPCR recognizes a ligand, the conformation of the receptor changes to activate the G protein, causing Gα to bind a molecule of GTP and dissociate from the other two G-protein subunits. The dissociation exposes sites on the subunits that can interact with other molecules. The activated G protein subunits detach from the receptor and initiate signaling from many downstream effector proteins such as phospholipases and ion channels, the latter permitting the release of second messenger molecules. The total strength of signal amplification by a GPCR {{is determined by the}} lifetimes of the ligand-receptor complex and receptor-effector protein complex and the deactivation time of the activated receptor and effectors through intrinsic enzymatic activity; e.g. via protein kinase phosphorylation or b-arrestin-dependent <b>internalization.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{specific}} research {{topic of}} interest is how microbes such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa invade the eye and cause infection. Although the pathogenesis of microbial keratitis is not well understood, many different factors have been investigated. One group of researchers showed that corneal hypoxia exacerbated Pseudomonas binding to the corneal epithelium, <b>internalization</b> of the microbes, and induction of the inflammatory response. One way to alleviate hypoxia {{is to increase the}} amount of oxygen transmitted to the cornea. Although silicone-hydrogel lenses almost eliminate hypoxia in patients due to their very high levels of oxygen transmissibility, they also seem to provide a more efficient platform for bacterial contamination and corneal infiltration than other conventional hydrogel soft CLs. A recent study showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermis adhere much more strongly to unworn silicone hydrogel CLs than conventional hydrogel lenses and that adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 20 times stronger than that of Staphylococcus epidermidis. This might partly explain why Pseudomonas infections are the most predominant. However, another study conducted with worn and unworn silicone and conventional hydrogel CLs showed that worn silicone CLs were less prone to Staphylococcus epidermidis colonization than conventional hydrogel lenses.|$|E
25|$|Patriarchal {{values are}} deeply {{embedded}} in the society of Pakistan, and its different manifestations are observed in {{different aspects of the}} society. As mentioned above, gender division of labour enforces women to primarily specialize in unpaid care work as mothers and wives at home, whereas men perform paid work, and come out as breadwinners. This has led to a low level of resource investment in girls' education not only by their families but also by the state. This low investment in women's human capital, compounded by negative social biases and cultural practices, restrictions on women's mobility and the <b>internalization</b> of patriarchy by women themselves, becomes the basis for gender discrimination and disparities in most spheres of life. Some of the ramifications are that women are unable to develop job-market skills, hence, they have limited opportunities available to them in the wage-labour market. Moreover, social and cultural restrictions limit women's chances to compete for resources in a world outside the four walls of their homes. It translates into social and economic dependency of women on men. The nature and degree of women's oppression and subordination vary across classes, regions and the rural and urban divide in Pakistan. It has been observed that male dominant structures are relatively more marked in the rural and tribal setting where local customs and indigenous laws establish stronger male authority and power over women.|$|E
500|$|Acute {{amphetamine}} {{administration in}} humans increases endogenous opioid release in several brain {{structures in the}} reward system. Extracellular levels of glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, {{have been shown to}} increase in the striatum following exposure to amphetamine. This increase in extracellular glutamate presumably occurs via the amphetamine-induced <b>internalization</b> of EAAT3, a glutamate reuptake transporter, in dopamine neurons. Amphetamine also induces the selective release of histamine from mast cells and efflux from histaminergic neurons through [...] Acute amphetamine administration can also increase adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosteroid levels in blood plasma by stimulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.|$|E
500|$|TGF-beta is a {{regulator}} {{of tissue}} remodeling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in development, and promotes metastasis in cancer. [...] A {{number of studies}} have identified NEDD9 as a downstream effector in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, essential for promoting EMT. In MCF-7 cells, NEDD9 negatively regulates expression of the epithelial protein E-cadherin, preventing association of E-cadherin with cell membrane and activating SRC-kinase. Activated SRC provides <b>internalization</b> and lysosomal degradation of E-cadherin. Consistent with these findings is a study demonstrating downregulation of epithelial markers (E-cadherin, occludin, β-catenin) and concurrent upregulation of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin) in response to NEDD9 overexpression in MCF-10 cells.|$|E
500|$|British philosopher John Locke {{argued that}} moral rules cannot be {{established}} from conscience because {{the differences in}} people's consciences would lead to contradictions. Locke {{also noted that the}} conscience is influenced by [...] "education, company, and customs of the country", a criticism mounted by J. L. Mackie, who argued that the conscience should be seen as an [...] "introjection" [...] of other people into an agent's mind. Michael Martin challenges the argument from conscience with a naturalistic account of conscience, arguing that naturalism provides an adequate explanation for the conscience without the need for God's existence. He uses the example of the <b>internalization</b> by humans of social pressures, which leads to the fear of going against these norms. Even if a supernatural cause is required, he argues, it could be something other than God; this would mean that the phenomenon of the conscience is no more supportive of monotheism than polytheism.|$|E
500|$|In certain brain regions, {{amphetamine}} {{increases the}} concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft. Amphetamine can enter the presynaptic neuron either through [...] or by diffusing across the neuronal membrane directly. As a consequence of DAT uptake, amphetamine produces competitive reuptake inhibition at the transporter. Upon entering the presynaptic neuron, amphetamine activates [...] which, through protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling, causes DAT phosphorylation. Phosphorylation by either protein kinase can result in DAT <b>internalization</b> ( [...] reuptake inhibition), but [...] phosphorylation alone induces the reversal of dopamine transport through DAT (i.e., dopamine [...] ). Amphetamine is also known to increase intracellular calcium, an effect which is associated with DAT phosphorylation through an unidentified Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK)-dependent pathway, in turn producing dopamine efflux. Through direct activation of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels, [...] reduces the firing rate of dopamine neurons, preventing a hyper-dopaminergic state.|$|E
500|$|In {{the absence}} of amphetamine, [...] will {{normally}} move monoamines (e.g., dopamine, histamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, etc.) from the intracellular fluid of a monoamine neuron into its synaptic vesicles, which store neurotransmitters for later release (via exocytosis) into the synaptic cleft. When amphetamine enters a neuron and interacts with VMAT2, the transporter reverses its direction of transport, thereby releasing stored monoamines inside synaptic vesicles back into the neuron's intracellular fluid. Meanwhile, when amphetamine activates , the receptor causes the neuron's cell membrane-bound monoamine transporters (i.e., the dopamine transporter, norepinephrine transporter, or serotonin transporter) to either stop transporting monoamines altogether (via transporter <b>internalization)</b> or transport monoamines out of the neuron; in other words, the reversed membrane transporter will push dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin out of the neuron's intracellular fluid and into the synaptic cleft. [...] In summary, by interacting with both VMAT2 and TAAR1, amphetamine releases neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles (the effect from VMAT2) into the intracellular fluid where they subsequently exit the neuron through the membrane-bound, reversed monoamine transporters (the effect from TAAR1).|$|E

2500|$|Although no {{approved}} therapeutics {{are currently}} based on ricin, {{it does have}} the potential {{to be used in the}} treatment of tumors, as a [...] "magic bullet" [...] to destroy targeted cells. Because ricin is a protein, it can be linked to a monoclonal antibody to target cancerous cells recognized by the antibody. The major problem with ricin is that its native <b>internalization</b> sequences are distributed throughout the protein. If any of these native <b>internalization</b> sequences are present in a therapeutic agent, the drug will be internalized by, and kill, untargeted non-tumorous cells as well as targeted cancerous cells.|$|E
2500|$|While {{transcription}} factors control which cells express DAT, functional {{regulation of}} this protein is largely accomplished by kinases. MAPK, CAMKII, PKA, and PKC can modulate {{the rate at}} which the transporter moves dopamine or cause the <b>internalization</b> of DAT. Co-localized TAAR1 is an important regulator of the dopamine transporter that, when activated, phosphorylates DAT through protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. Phosphorylation by either protein kinase can result in DAT <b>internalization</b> ( [...] reuptake inhibition), but [...] phosphorylation alone induces reverse transporter function (dopamine [...] ). Dopamine autoreceptors also regulate DAT by directly opposing the effect of TAAR1 activation. The human dopamine transporter, hDAT, has a high affinity zinc binding site that, upon binding Zn2+, facilitates amphetamine induced efflux and inhibits reuptake of hDAT substrates.|$|E
