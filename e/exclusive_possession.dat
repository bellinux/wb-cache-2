5|$|Most Iridomyrmex {{species are}} {{aggressive}} ants that will attack anything which attacks or disturbs their nests or trails they forage on. This is noticeable with particular member {{species of the}} I. purpureus species group, where they will pour out of their nest and attack and kill all intruders. Even smaller species show similar behaviours to these ants and will also swarm out of their nests to bite and spray iridomyrmecin, a defensive chemical found in the genus. Because of their large numbers, aggression, and activeness, Iridomyrmex ants are ecologically dominant in Australia, and several species are known to obtain <b>exclusive</b> <b>possession</b> to food sources and prevent other insects from using them. These ants will also affect foraging behaviours of other ant nests living nearby due to how active they are and their large numbers.|$|E

The King was keen to curry favour with the Pope, to maintain the papal grants of <b>exclusive</b> <b>possession</b> to the new lands that his naval forces had been exploring in the Far East since Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route to India around Africa in 1498. The previous year, the Pope had been very pleased with Manuel's gift of a white elephant, also from India, which the Pope had named Hanno. Together with other precious gifts of silver plate and spices, the rhinoceros, with its new collar of green velvet decorated with flowers, embarked in December 1515 for the voyage from the Tagus to Rome. The vessel passed near Marseille in early 1516. King Francis I of France was returning from Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume in Provence, and requested a viewing of the beast. The Portuguese vessel stopped briefly at an island off Marseilles, where the rhinoceros disembarked to be beheld by the King on 24 January.|$|E

25|$|It is the {{reasoned}} {{conclusion of}} this study... that the sense of guilt created by the Vietnam war {{in the minds of}} many Americans is not warranted and that the charges of officially, condoned illegal and grossly immoral conduct are without substance. Indeed, detailed examination of battlefield practices reveals that the loss civilian life in Vietnam was less great than in World War II and Korea and that concern with minimizing the ravages of the war was strong. To measure and compare the devastation and loss of human life caused by different war will be objectionable to those who repudiate all resort to military force as an instrument of foreign policy and may be construed as callousness. Yet as long as wars do take place at all it remains a moral duty to seek to reduce the agony caused by war, and the fulfillment of this obligation should not be disdained. I hope that this book may help demonstrate that moral convictions are not the <b>exclusive</b> <b>possession</b> of persons in conscience opposed to war, and that those who in certain circumstances accept the necessity and ethical justification of armed conflict also do care about human suffering.|$|E

40|$|This is {{an interpretive}} {{study of the}} life of the Prophet Muhammad as it is artistically {{depicted}} in the repertoire (especially the narrative ballads) of fifty-one contemporary Egyptian maddahin (singers of eulogies in honour of the Prophet Muhammad, sing. maddah). The elements of this repertoire, as diverse as narrative ballads, classical odes, Qur'an chanting, and the melodies of the secular songs of well-known Egyptian singers, do not exist as discrete units but rather as a lively tawlifa (blend) [...] to use a common term in Colloquial Egyptian Arabic (CEA). This study is about blends where discrete units lose their borderlines and leak into one another, about phenomena which are "betwixt and between" the perceived scholarly categories which confidently delineate boundaries between elite and popular Islam, the historical and the legendary Muhammad, the sacred and the profane, orality and writing, standard and colloquial Arabic. In order to understand the process which marks the making of the people's Muhammad, the study deals with the sources and the contents of the repertoire of the Egyptian maddahin. The performance of these singers as well as their interaction with the audience are also considered. The "legendary" material in this repertoire is attested as historical by many authoritative and well-recognized "orthodox" authors of the past. Classical Arabic, classical poetic forms, philosophical notions, long believed to be the <b>exclusive</b> <b>possessions</b> of the learned, are freely utilized in the ballads and popular songs under study. The people's Muhammad appears as both a commanding figure, empowered by the supernatural, and a touchingly vulnerable human being; God's ascetic messenger and a man who savours life's lawful pleasures; an eloquent speaker who utters Qur'an-like terse Arabic and a lovingly familiar figure who also uses local patois. Bipolarity, beloved of many scholars, is seriously challenged by the art of the Egyptian maddahin. A renewed effort has to be made to discover more valid categories which will take into account the intermediary combinations (Mischbildungen) characteristic of that art...|$|R

2500|$|A {{more modern}} {{function}} {{has been that}} land which is disused or neglected by an owner may be converted into another's property if continual use is made. Squatting in England has been a way for land to be efficiently utilised, particularly in periods of economic decline. Before the Land Registration Act 2002, if a person had possessed land for 12 years, then at common law, the previous owner's right of action to eject the [...] "adverse possessor" [...] would expire. The common legal justification was that under the Limitation Act 1623, just like a cause of action in contract or tort had to be used within a time limit, so did an action to recover land. This promoted the finality of litigation and the certainty of claims. Time would start running when someone took <b>exclusive</b> <b>possession</b> of land, or part of it, and intended to possess it adversely {{to the interests of}} the current owner. Provided the common law requirements of [...] "possession" [...] that was [...] "adverse" [...] were fulfilled, after 12 years, the owner would cease to be able to assert a claim.

40|$|If crap design can be {{inclusive}}, {{what does}} that mean for what we mean by inclusive design? Starting from this question, raised at Include 2009, the paper tries to reveal the basic questions underneath. Reduced to their general form, these questions are relevant to every activity that has a normative dimension: who is to decide the standards? Should the norms be decided by the best knower or by the people, however ignorant they might be? This leads to two other fundamental questions: what is there to know? And who is the best knower? Together these basic questions make clear that the definitions of inclusive design are underdetermined: just to mention needs of the widest possible audience with the widest range of abilities does not decide the issue about the (missing) link between inclusion and good design. In analysing how this link can be confronted, the paper provides strong arguments for design as a deliberative enterprise involving both designers and the people they design for. It points out that inclusivity and normative objectivity (two prima facie opposed ideals) can be reconciled, by defining the norm of good design in terms of a deliberative cooperation. Key here is that the competence about what is good design is not an <b>exclusive</b> and inquestionable <b>possession</b> of anyone, but arises by deliberative cooperation of designers and people about the issues at stake. Thus, design quality is viewed as a matter of cooperative integraton rather than a matter of convergence of different perspectives: a design is excellent, not when it is appreciated by both the designer and the consumer, but when it is produced by exploiting the information and competences at disposal of the designer and the people s/he designs for in qualified circumstances. status: publishe...|$|R

When we took {{on the role of}} joint co-ordinators of the bicultural project at Christchurch College of Education {{at the end of last}} year, one of the tasks we faced was the development of programmes within the College that would provide staff and students with the basic knowledge they need about the Treaty and its relevance to teaching and prepare them to apply this knowledge to their own practice. This paper describes the processes we are engaged in to develop Treaty education programmes and the programme shape that is evolving. It also describes some of the conceptual incongruities that we are finding associated with Treaty education, and it places these against a wider framework of theorisations of learning, of decolonisation, of participatory and reflective practice, and of kaupapa Maori. Teaching how to teach in a Treaty-based society, and the focus of this paper In New Zealand, the responsibility to meet the needs of Maori students is anchored in the Treaty of Waitangi. The Treaty guarantees Maori the right to the same rights and benefits of citizenship as Pakeha 1, and it guarantees Maori the right to retain control of their properties or taonga 2. The relevance of these Treaty promises is multiple. Maori academic success is one issue. The Treaty implies that Maori have the right to expect that the state education system will address the learning needs of Maori students and enable them to achieve success outcomes to the same extent as it addresses the needs of Pakeha students. Another issue is the right of Maori to a process of learning and teaching that acknowledges their cultural values and aspirations.
