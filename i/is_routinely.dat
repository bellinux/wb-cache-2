5|$|The C center {{produces}} a characteristic {{infrared absorption spectrum}} with a sharp peak at 1344 cm−1 and a broader feature at 1130 cm−1.

Another proposed way, using the UV absorption at ~260 nm, has later been discarded as unreliable.|$|E

At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the need for this is rare.|$|E
5|$|John Hancock (Will Smith) is an {{alcoholic}} amnesiac with superhuman powers reminiscent {{to those of}} superheroes. Though he uses his powers to stop criminals in his current residence of Los Angeles, his activity inadvertently causes {{millions of dollars in}} property damage due to his constant intoxication. As a result, he <b>is</b> <b>routinely</b> jeered at crime scenes. Hancock also ignores court subpoenas to address the damage he has caused.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the A centers, B centers do not induce color, and no UV or visible {{absorption}} can {{be attributed}} to the B centers. Early assignment of the N9 absorption system to the B center have been disproven later. The B center has a characteristic IR absorption spectrum (see the infrared absorption picture above) with a sharp peak at 1332cm−1 and a broader feature at 1280cm−1. The latter <b>is</b> <b>routinely</b> used to estimate the nitrogen concentration in the B form.|$|E

5|$|The {{blackbuck}} has {{associations with}} the Indian culture. The antelope {{might have been}} a source of food in the Indus Valley civilisation (33001700 BCE); bone remains have been discovered in sites such as Dholavira and Mehrgarh. The blackbuck <b>is</b> <b>routinely</b> depicted in miniature paintings of the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries) depicting royal hunts often using cheetahs. Villagers in India and Nepal generally do not harm the blackbuck. Tribes such as the Bishnois revere and care for most animals including the blackbuck. The blackbuck has been declared as the state animal of Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|The use of pure oxygen for {{accelerated}} decompression {{is limited}} by oxygen toxicity. In open circuit scuba the upper limit for oxygen partial pressure is generally accepted as 1.6 bar, equivalent {{to a depth of}} 6msw (metres of sea water), but in-water and surface decompression at higher partial pressures <b>is</b> <b>routinely</b> used in surface supplied diving operation, both by the military and civilian contractors, as the consequences of CNS oxygen toxicity are considerably reduced when the diver has a secure breathing gas supply.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Elizabeth Hummel is {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{and one of}} the male leads in the Fox musical comedy-drama series Glee. Series creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan initially conceived of him as a fashionable gay countertenor who <b>is</b> <b>routinely</b> bullied at school. Kurt is portrayed by actor Chris Colfer, and has appeared as a character on the show since its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Glee follows the trials of the New Directions glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of Lima, Ohio, of which Kurt is a member. His storylines in the first season focus on his struggle with his sexual identity as he discloses his homosexuality to his father and friends, and deals with his romantic feelings for Finn Hudson, the heterosexual co-captain of the glee club.|$|E

5|$|Scientific {{instrument}} packages {{were installed}} on the lunar surface during all the Apollo landings. Long-lived instrument stations, including heat flow probes, seismometers, and magnetometers, were installed at the Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 landing sites. Direct transmission of data to Earth concluded in late 1977 due to budgetary considerations, but as the stations' lunar laser ranging corner-cube retroreflector arrays are passive instruments, they are still being used. Ranging to the stations <b>is</b> <b>routinely</b> performed from Earth-based stations with an accuracy of a few centimetres, and data from this experiment {{are being used to}} place constraints {{on the size of the}} lunar core.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy <b>is</b> <b>routinely</b> performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids can {{be obtained}} by chemical reduction of either their oxides or their sulfides. Simpler or more complex extraction methods may be employed depending on the starting form and economic factors. Boron <b>is</b> <b>routinely</b> obtained by reducing the trioxide with magnesium: B2O3 + 3 Mg → 2 B + 3MgO; after secondary processing the resulting brown powder has a purity of up to 97%. Boron of higher purity (> 99%) is prepared by heating volatile boron compounds, such as BCl3 or BBr3, either in a hydrogen atmosphere (2 BX3 + 3 H2 → 2 B + 6 HX) or to the point of thermal decomposition. Silicon and germanium are obtained from their oxides by heating the oxide with carbon or hydrogen: SiO2 + C → Si + CO2; GeO2 + 2 H2 → Ge + 2 H2O. Arsenic is isolated from its pyrite (FeAsS) or arsenical pyrite (FeAs2) by heating; alternatively, it {{can be obtained}} from its oxide by reduction with carbon: 2 As2O3 + 3 C → 2 As + 3 CO2. Antimony is derived from its sulfide by reduction with iron: Sb2S3 → 2 Sb + 3 FeS. Tellurium is prepared from its oxide by dissolving it in aqueous NaOH, yielding tellurite, then by electrolytic reduction: TeO2 + 2 NaOH → Na2TeO3 + H2O; Na2TeO3 + H2O → Te + 2 NaOH + O2. Another option is reduction of the oxide by roasting with carbon: TeO2 + C → Te + CO2.|$|E
