5000|$|Alset Global GmbH is an Austrian {{technology}} and engineering company based in Graz that is specialised in hydrogen-based clean mobility solutions. Alset Global developed a Hybrid <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>system</b> of which the technology is patented. According to Alset Global, this technology is unique as it offers to run an internal combustion engine on either pure petrol, pure hydrogen {{or a combination of}} both. [...] This technology offers a new sustainable and clean alternative to the automotive industry (OEMs, vehicle fleets as well as ships and planes). This technology has been developed to create an alternative technology to meet with new emission target levels.

50|$|The unique {{character}} of the <b>Hydrogen</b> Hybrid <b>system</b> is the flexibility of using both petrol and hydrogen fuel depending on the driving conditions.

Hence, this characteristic of the <b>Hydrogen</b> Hybrid <b>system</b> differentiates Alset Global from the others. Eight years of research and development have led to a very efficient way to burn hydrogen and use the fuel's full potential. Nevertheless, the details of this technology are not revealed to public. Alset Global holds various patents for the future implications of this system and therefore the information is concealed.|$|R

50|$|The Hybrid <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>system</b> runs {{parallel}} to a conventional petrol injection system. Alset Global designed this architecture {{that it can}} be installed in any vehicle with minimum modification to the existing system. The shift between the petrol and the hydrogen is achieved by the software developed by Alset Global. This software controls the ECU of the vehicle and shifts between the petrol and hydrogen fuels. The software ensures that the vehicle's benefits from the hydrogen are at its maximum level without risking the journey to run out of hydrogen or petrol fuels. The main reasoning behind this system is to make drivers comfortable with the range of hydrogen and ensure them that petrol fuel can be supplied to the system at any time. Until the infrastructure for hydrogen filling stations is totally established, Alset Global's fuel switch system will increase the confidence and serenity of drivers who wish to make long road trips.|$|E

40|$|In renewably powered remote <b>hydrogen</b> {{generation}} <b>systems,</b> on-site water {{production is}} essential {{so as to}} service electrolysis in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>systems</b> which may not have recourse to shipments of de-ionised water. Whilst the inclusion of small Reverse Osmosis (RO) units may function as a (useful) dump load, it also directly impacts the power management of remote <b>hydrogen</b> generation <b>systems</b> affecting operational characteristics. This research investigates {{the impact on the}} <b>hydrogen</b> generation <b>system</b> when simulations utilise different methods to account for solar power needed to drive the system as well as varying scales of (short-term) battery capacity. The simulations, in MATLAB/Simulink, utilise two specific methods of irradiance prediction (ASHRAE clear sky model and Neural Networks) and are benchmarked against measured irradiance data for Geraldton (Western Australia). This imposes different levels of accuracy and intermittency. Laboratory testing and device-level models help simulate the operational characteristics of a <b>hydrogen</b> generation <b>system</b> including on-site water production. Operational characteristics studied include: total energy available for PEM electrolysis, ontime of the electrolyser in steady-state, the number of start/stop cycles for the electrolyser and its duty factor (litres of hydrogen generated over the total number of start/stops). Results show that increasing systems 2 ̆ 7 battery capacity only affects the operational characteristics of a PEM electrolyser up to a threshold capacity (Ah). Increasing battery capacity generally allows for more renewable energy penetration. Additionally, the <b>hydrogen</b> generation <b>system</b> behaviour is (generally) more accurately predicted, across all battery capacities, when Neural Networks are used to predict the availability of solar irradiance. The ability to predict accurate levels of solar irradiance becomes more important in winter when irradiance is at its lowest. The results also highlight the need to use highly resolved (temporal) simulations which are able to better capture device-level operational characteristics...|$|R
