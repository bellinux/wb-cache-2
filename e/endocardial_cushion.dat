50|$|The ostium primum atrial septal defect (also {{known as}} an <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushion</b> defect) is a defect in the atrial septum {{at the level of}} the tricuspid and mitral valves.

5000|$|During heart {{development}} of a human embryo, the cavity of the primitive atrium becomes subdivided into right and left chambers by a septum, the septum primum, which grows downward into the cavity.

40|$|During {{embryonic}} development, cardiac valves arise {{at specific}} {{regions in the}} cardiac endothelium that swell up due to enhanced extracellular matrix production (so-called <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions).</b> An important extracellular matrix component that is produced by the endocardial cells is the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan. A deficiency in hyaluronan synthesis results in a failure to form <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions</b> {{and a loss of}} their cellularization by a process called endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation. Expression of the major hyaluronan synthase Has 2 is under the influence of both positive and negative regulators. MicroRNA-dependent degradation of Has 2 is required to control extracellular hyaluronan levels and thereby the size of the <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions.</b> In this article, we review the current literature on hyaluronan synthesis during cardiac valve formation and propose that a balanced activity of both positive and negative regulators is required to maintain the critical homeostasis of hyaluronan levels in the extracellular matrix and thereby the size of the <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions.</b> The activating and inhibitory interactions between microRNA- 23, Has 2, and hyaluronan are reminiscent of a reaction-diffusion system. Using a mathematical modeling approach we show that the system can produce a confined expression of hyaluronan, but only if the inhibitory signal is transferred to adjacent cells in exosomes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNormal {{development}} of the cardiac atrioventricular (AV) <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions</b> is essential for proper ventricular septation and morphogenesis of the mature mitral and tricuspid valves. In this study, we demonstrate spatially restricted expression of both Wnt- 9 a (formerly Wnt- 14) and the secreted Wnt antagonist Frzb in AV <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions</b> of the developing chicken heart. Wnt- 9 a expression is detected only in AV canal endocardial cells, while Frzb expression is detected in both endocardial and transformed mesenchymal cells of the developing AV cardiac cushions. We present evidence that Wnt- 9 a promotes cell proliferation in the AV canal and overexpression of Wnt- 9 a in ovo results in enlarged <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions</b> and AV inlet obstruction. Wnt- 9 a stimulates β-catenin-responsive transcription in AV canal cells, duplicates the embryonic axis upon ventral injections in Xenopus embryos and appears to regulate cell proliferation by activating a Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Additional functional studies reveal that Frzb inhibits Wnt- 9 a-mediated cell proliferation in cardiac cushions. Together, these data argue that Wnt- 9 a and Frzb regulate mesenchymal cell proliferation leading to proper AV canal cushion outgrowth and remodeling in the developing avian heart...|$|R

40|$|Advances in the {{surgical}} treatment of atrial septal defect {{have made the}} recognition of the less common varieties of practical importance. There is general agreement on the definition of ostium secundum defects but some confusion about the nomenclature of persistent ostium primum and the common atrio-ventricular (A-V) canal. When the dorsal and ventral A-V <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions</b> fail to fuse and to develop normally in faetal life, the extent of this failure is reflected in the severity of the resulting defect. At one extreme lies the persistent common A-V canal furnished with anterior and posterior valve cusps each common to the two ventricles, the single orifice being continuous above with a persistent ostium primum and below with a high ventricular septal defect. The opposite extreme is simply a persistent ostium primum with, as a rule, a bifid anterior cusp of the mitral valve. Between these two extremes all gradations can occur. Embryology. During the sixth week of foetal life the dorsal and ventral <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions</b> come together by their own growth and fuse to form a common mass, so dividing the A-V canal into separate right and left canals (Patten, 1949).

50|$|The {{primitive}} atrium {{is divided}} in two by joining of several structures.

To the right of the septum primum and also coming down from {{the roof of the}} primitive atrium, descends a semilunar-shaped partition called the septum secundum. The free edges of the septum secundum produce an orifice called foramen ovale, which closes after birth when the septum primum and secundum fuse to each other completing the formation of the atrial septum.|$|R

50|$|Heart defects {{commonly}} {{seen with}} Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome {{are associated with}} the <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushion</b> and are {{the most important factor in}} determining a diagnosis. The mitral valve and tricuspid valve of the heart can be malformed, the atrioventricular canal can be complete instead of developing into the interatrial septum and interventricular septum, and conotruncal heart defects, which include tetralogy of Fallot, double outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great vessels, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenosis have also been associated with 3C syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Failure of the septum primum to fuse {{with the}} <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushion</b> {{can lead to}} an ostium primum atrial septal defect.

Notch has a direct role to play in regulating endocardial cadherin proteins. The resulting loss of endocardial cohesion contributes to EMT. Thus cells with a higher Notch activation are more disposed to EMT. The simulations indicate that Notch-mediated lateral induction could provide a simple mechanism for preferential growth towards the centers of the <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The heart {{originates}} from splanchnic mesoderm and to {{a lesser}} extent from neural crest cells. The HNK- 1 monoclonal antibody is a marker for early migrating neural crest cells, but reacts also with structures which are not derived from the neural crest. We investigated whether heart structures are HNK- 1 positive before neural crest cells colonize these target tissues. To that end, we determined the HNK- 1 antigen expression in the developing avian heart on immunohistochemical sections and on Western blots. The HNK- 1 immunoreactivity in the developing chick heart is compared with data from literature cm the localization of neural crest cells in chick/quail chimeras. Structures with neural crest contribution, including parts of the early outflow tract and the related <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions,</b> the primordia of the semilunar valve leaflets and the aorticopulmonary septum were HNK- 1 positive. Furthermore, other structures were HNK- 1 positive, such as the atrioventricular cushions, the wall of the sinus venosus at stage HH 15 through 21, parts of the endocardium at E 3, parts of the myocardium at E 6, and the extracellular matrix in the myocardial base of the semilunar valves at E 14. HNK- 1 expression was particularly observed in morphologically dynamic regions such as the developing valves, the outflow tract cushion, the developing conduction system and the autonomie nervous system of the heart. We observed that atrioventricular <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions</b> are HNK- 1 positive. We conclude that: a HNK- 1 immunoreactivity does not always coincide with the presence of neural crest cells or their derivatives; (2) the outflow tract <b>cushions</b> and atrioventricular <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions</b> are HNK- 1 positive before neural crest cells are expected (stage HH 19) to enter the <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushions</b> of the outflow tract; (3) the observed spatio-temporal HNK- 1 patterns observed in the developing heart correspond with various HNK- 1 antigens.

50|$|In Congenital Heart Disease, {{heterozygous}} {{mutations in}} Pitx2 {{have been involved}} in the development of Tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, transposition of great arteries, and <b>endocardial</b> <b>cushion</b> defect (ECD). The mutations of the Pitx2 gene are created through alternative splicing. The isoform of Pitx2 important for cardiogenesis is Pitx2c. The lack of expression of this particular isoform correlates with these congenital defects. Pitx2 mutations significantly reduce transcriptional activity of Pitx2 and synergistic activation between Pitx2 and NKX2(also important for development of the heart). The large phenotypic spectrum due to the mutation of Pitx2 may be attributed to a variety of factors including: different genetic backgrounds, epigenetic modifiers and delayed/complete penetrance. It is important to note that the mutation of Pitx2 is not defined as the cause of these congenital heart defects, but currently perceived as a risk factor for their development.|$|E
