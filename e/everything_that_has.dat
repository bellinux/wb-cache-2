5|$|Continuing to the Order's {{underground}} facility, Alex {{is captured}} by Judge Holloway, who reveals that <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened {{is due to}} a broken pact. One hundred and fifty years ago, the four founding families broke away from Silent Hill's Order to move to Shepherd's Glen.|$|E
5|$|The Universe can {{be defined}} as {{everything}} that exists, <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> existed, and everything that will exist. According to our current understanding, the Universe consists of spacetime, forms of energy (including electromagnetic radiation and matter), and the physical laws that relate them. The Universe encompasses all of life, all of history, and some philosophers and scientists suggest that it even encompasses ideas such as mathematics and logic.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of Dexter, after hearing a voice that he thinks is God telling him to murder people, Ned Flanders becomes a serial killing vigilante, {{targeting}} characters who are Homer's enemies. When Flanders discovers that Homer {{is the one who}} has been duping him into committing murder (by way of a Bible-shaped receiver), Homer argues that God does not exist and starts burning Ned's bible, only to be stopped and strangled to death by God Himself. Marge begs God to reverse <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened, but God tells her that Satan is the one who is running the world. When Flanders thinks that this scenario cannot get any worse, it is revealed that Satan is sleeping with Ned's deceased wife, Maude.|$|E

5|$|Dean Peterson {{is forced}} to expel the nerds, and a remorseful Homer {{immediately}} invites them {{to move in with}} his family. However, their presence quickly disrupts the normal family routine, and Marge orders Homer to evict them, leading him {{to try to get the}} three re-admitted to the school. Homer's plan involves an attempt to run down Dean Peterson with his car, but have the nerds push Peterson out of the way at the last moment, with the hope that Peterson would readmit the nerds out of gratitude for saving his life. But the plan backfires, and Homer winds up running down the dean, seriously injuring him. At the hospital, Homer admits he was fully responsible for the pranks, and asks that Benjamin, Doug, and Gary be reinstated. The dean agrees to reinstate them and does not punish Homer, agreeing to forget <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened. The nerds thank Homer for his assistance and move back into their old dormitory room.|$|E
5|$|Magi sacrifices {{herself to}} give the fairies a chance, and she tells Crysta to {{remember}} everything she's learned. Zak manages to stop the machine, depriving Hexxus {{the source of his}} power, but he manifests himself within the oil in the machine and begins to ignite the forest ablaze. Crysta seemingly sacrifices herself by allowing herself to be devoured by Hexxus and all seems lost, until he begins to sprout limbs and leaves like a tree. Pips {{and the rest of the}} fairies rally to the powers they have been given, which causes the seed that Crysta fed him to start growing wildly. Hexxus is imprisoned by the newly grown tree at the very border of FernGully which bursts into bloom. Crysta appears after the fight, having survived her ordeal and successfully succeeded Magi as a magical fairy. She gives Zak a seed, begging him to remember <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> transpired and she sadly restores him to his human size. Remembering the seed in his hand, Zak promises to remember his adventure, and buries the seed in the soil before telling Tony and Ralph that things need to change as they leave the forest behind. The seed sprouts new growth for FernGully, as Crysta follows Pips with Batty behind her.|$|E
25|$|Kiyoaki goes {{directly}} to Honda {{and gives a}} full account of <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened. His friend is amazed, but supportive; not long afterwards, {{a visit to the}} district court solidifies his decision not to involve himself in the drama of other people's lives.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Everything</b> <b>that</b> I <b>have</b> worked for, <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> I <b>have</b> hoped for, <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> I <b>have</b> {{believed}} in during my public life has crashed into ruins. There {{is only one}} thing left for me to do: that is devote what strength and power I have to forwarding {{the victory of the}} cause for which we have sacrificed so much.|$|R

25|$|Another {{criticism}} of postcolonial literature {{is that by}} focusing much on the distinct culture of the colonized, it seems to ignore the vast human rights violation {{that many of the}} cultural practices contain in them. Culture cannot be unquestionable as there are universal human rights, which should be respected, and to term <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> emerged in the West, such as the ideals of liberty, as a negative colonial legacy, is a far-fetched proposition.|$|E
25|$|Irenaeus' {{emphasis}} on the unity of God is reflected in his corresponding {{emphasis on}} the unity of salvation history. Irenaeus repeatedly insists that God began the world and has been overseeing it ever since this creative act; <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened {{is part of his}} plan for humanity. The essence of this plan is a process of maturation: Irenaeus believes that humanity was created immature, and God intended his creatures {{to take a long time}} to grow into or assume the divine likeness.|$|E
25|$|Amy visits Kim {{and tells}} her <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened; Kim tells her that it's time to change. Amy clears {{out all the}} alcohol from her apartment. She takes her Aaron story to Vanity Fair, where it ends up getting published, and sends it to Aaron. He attends a game and after, Aaron is called back to the court, where the Knicks City Dancers perform with Amy front and center. She tells him {{she wants to make}} their {{relationship}} work. They confess their love for each other and kiss.|$|E

25|$|An autobiographical {{memory is}} a {{personal}} representation of general or specific events and personal facts. Autobiographical memory also refers to memory of a person's history. An individual does not remember exactly <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened in one's past. Memory is constructive, where previous experience affects how we remember events and what we end up recalling from memory. Autobiographical memory is constructive and reconstructed as an evolving process of history. A person's autobiographical memory is fairly reliable; although, the reliability of autobiographical memories is questionable because of memory distortions.|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{may have}} {{encountered}} {{the idea of}} the Eternal Recurrence in the works of Heinrich Heine, who speculated that one day a person would be born with the same thought-processes as himself, and that the same applied to every other individual. Nietzsche expanded on this thought to form his theory, which he put forth in The Gay Science and developed in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Schopenhauer directly influenced this theory. Schopenhauer postulated that a person who unconditionally affirms life would do so even if <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened were to happen again repeatedly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> {{happened}} since has therefore been planned by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity. The {{world has been}} intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as only in this way can they mature as moral agents. Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed Jonah: {{it was only in}} the depths of the whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will. Similarly, death and suffering appear as evils, but without them we could never come to know God.|$|E

25|$|The Ājīvika {{school is}} known for its Niyati ("Fate") {{doctrine}} of absolute determinism, the premise that there is no free will, that <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened, is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles. Ājīvikas considered the karma doctrine as a fallacy. Ajivika metaphysics included a theory of atoms similar to the Vaisheshika school, where everything was composed of atoms, qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces. Ājīvikas were atheists and rejected the authority of the Vedas, but they believed that in every living being is an ātman – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.|$|E
25|$|Waking up at home, Havens struggles {{through a}} day fitting a bridesmaid's dress for her sister's wedding, and is {{shocked to learn}} her sister would like to sell their father's 1966 Pontiac GTO tri-power, which Havens had planned on {{finishing}} as a wedding present. Havens is then {{picked up by a}} group of intelligence agents, led by Fitzgerald. Miller arrives and, through a long gunfight on the highway, kills several agents and reclaims Havens. She flees at the first opportunity and contacts Rodney (Marc Blucas), a firefighter and former boyfriend. Believing Havens is merely stressed and is playing out a fantasy, Rodney takes her out and she tells him <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened to her, though he still does not understand. Miller then arrives and pretends to take Havens hostage while holding everyone else at gunpoint, fleeing with her.|$|E
25|$|The Celtic {{collection}} includes {{works in}} all six Celtic languages. A representative collection of Scottish Gaelic books has been assembled, primarily through purchase of earlier publications, {{guided by the}} standard bibliographies, and, for books published after 1911, by legal deposit. Irish literature, which is far more extensive, has been collected through a similar combination of purchase and deposit. However, many collections purchased by or donated to the Library have contained rare Irish books. The Library of Dr E. C. Quiggin, which was received in 1921, contained a large Irish collection and many early Breton books. Further Breton books have been purchased or were acquired in the libraries of Sir Edward Anwyl, Thomas Powel, Dr Thomas Gwynn Jones, Dr Paul Diverres and Llywarch Reynolds. The holdings of Cornish and Manx printed books include practically <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been published in those languages, with a few facsimiles.|$|E
50|$|Warriors are {{responsible}} for <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> they <b>have</b> done and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> they <b>have</b> said, {{and all of the}} consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they {{are responsible}} for, they remain fiercely true.|$|R

2500|$|Habib {{told his}} family <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> {{happened}} {{after he left}} Sydney in July 2001. Just in case something bad happens to him, he said, [...] "I {{want them to know}} fully everything".|$|R
25|$|All the storylines collide when Brad's house catches fire. While {{the fire}} trucks {{get stuck in}} a traffic jam, Tommy comes on his bicycle {{to put out the}} fire, which {{incidentally}} trapped Dawn inside. As he saves her life, the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Brad despairs at the destruction of his house, the symbol of his material success. Albert attains a sort of enlightenment when he synthesizes the two opposing outlooks of the Jaffes and Vauban to realize the cosmic truth of everything. Brad, meanwhile, is fired from Huckabees, leaving him rudderless. Albert reveals to Brad that he burned Brad's jet skis, and the fire spread to the house. Albert understands that he and Brad are no different, that everything really is inextricably connected, but that these connections necessarily arise from the often senselessly painful reality of human existence. Having realized this, he refers Brad to Caterine, hoping she will help him as she did Albert and Tommy. Albert and Tommy talk later about <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened. As the two talk, Caterine and the Jaffes watch them, concluding that they can close both of their cases.|$|E
500|$|In his 1999 {{review of}} Fight Club, which was {{generally}} negative, film critic Roger Ebert commented, [...] "A lot of recent films seem unsatisfied {{unless they can}} add final scenes that redefine the reality of <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> gone before; call it the Keyser Söze syndrome." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the events}} of [...] "Dead is Dead", Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) is brought to a hospital, having been shot by Ben (Michael Emerson). While waiting, his wife Penny (Sonya Walger), is visited by Eloise, who apologizes for {{involving}} Desmond in <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened. Penny later visits Desmond, {{who is expected to}} make a full recovery. Charles, who is also Daniel's father, speaks with Eloise outside the hospital, but does not visit his daughter.|$|E
