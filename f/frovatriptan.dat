50|$|Preventive {{migraine}} medications {{are considered}} effective if they reduce the frequency or {{severity of the}} migraine attacks by at least 50%.

50|$|Sumatriptan was {{the pioneer}} drug in this class. The second generation's triptans such as zolmitriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, {{eletriptan}} and <b>frovatriptan</b> soon became available.Different triptans {{are available in}} different formulations and in different strengths (see table 2). They have been formulated as subcutaneous injections, oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal spray and as rectal suppositories. Delivery system of the triptans may {{play an important role}} in the onset of action. The selection of anti-migraine drug for patients depends on their symptoms. The first selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist, sumatriptan, was first synthesized as a subcutaneous injection, then as an oral tablets and more recently as a nasal spray, it is also available in some countries as suppositories. The subcutaneous injection is the fastest way to stop a rapidly progressing migraine attacks. The sumatriptan nasal spray provides faster onset of action than the tablets but it produces a similar headache response at 2 hours. Some patients prefer the nasal spray as it works more rapidly than the tablets and does not have as many adverse effects as the subcutaneous injection. Nasal spray is although not suitable for all patients, because some patients experience bad taste and lack of consistency of response. Zolmitriptan was developed with the strategy to create a more lipophilic compound, with faster absorption and better ability to cross the blood brain barrier than sumatriptan. It is available as tablets, orally disintegrating tablets and as nasal spray in some countries. Rizatriptan is available as tablets and orally disintegrating tablets but naratriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan and <b>frovatriptan</b> are only available in tablets, for now.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Migraine is {{the most}} common painful {{neurological}} disorder, affecting 13 % of the general population. Triptans represent a powerful pharmacological tool in acute migraine treatment, however, a significant portion of treated patients cannot have access to this class due to possible adverse affects. Today, a total of seven triptan molecules are available, representing a commonly prescribed migraine treatment. Although there is a need of extensive use of triptans, only 25 % of migraine patients are using triptans. Areas covered: This review includes triptans and evidence for the use of <b>frovatriptan.</b> A systematic approach is used to discuss the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic aspects of <b>frovatriptan,</b> considering the emerging data on the clinical efficacy of <b>frovatriptan</b> in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches. The data were obtained by searching the following key words in MEDLINE: pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, triptans, <b>frovatriptan,</b> migraine, menstrual migraine, relatively to the period 1988 - 2011. Expert opinion: <b>Frovatriptan</b> has been developed in order to improve safety and efficacy of triptans. It shows a favorable tolerability and efficacy profile, limited to 24 / 48 -h headache recurrence, when compared with other triptans. Preclinical data suggest that the pharmacokinetic profile of <b>frovatriptan</b> may differ from other available triptans. In fact, among triptans, <b>frovatriptan</b> showed the highest potency at the 5 -HT 1 B receptor (8. 2) and the longer half-life (26 h). These parameters determine the clinical properties of frovatriptan; in particular the lowest rate of headache recurrence in comparison with other triptans...|$|E

Current guidelines recommend triptans as first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe migraine attacks. <b>Frovatriptan</b> is a second-generation triptan with a longer terminal elimination half-life in blood than other triptans (~ 26 hours). Three double-blind, randomized crossover preference studies have been recently conducted, assessing efficacy and safety of <b>frovatriptan</b> versus rizatriptan, zolmitriptan, and almotriptan, respectively. <b>Frovatriptan</b> showed favorable tolerability and sustained effect, with a significantly lower rate of relapse over 48 hours versus the other triptans. These findings were confirmed {{in a series of}} analyses of patient subsets from the three studies, including patients with menstrually related and oral contraceptive-induced migraine, hypertension, obesity, weekend migraine, as well as patients with migraine with aura. In all patient subsets analyzed, lower headache recurrence rates were observed versus the comparator triptans, indicating a more sustained pain-relieving effect on migraine symptoms. A further randomized, double-blind study demonstrated that <b>frovatriptan</b> given in combination with the fast-acting cyclooxygenase inhibitor dexketoprofen provided improved migraine pain-free activity at 2 hours, and gave more sustained pain-free activity at 24 hours, versus <b>frovatriptan</b> alone. These benefits were observed both when the combination was administered early ( 1 hour after onset). Different pharmacokinetic, but synergistic, properties between <b>frovatriptan</b> and dexketoprofen may make the combination of these agents particularly effective in migraine treatment, with rapid onset of action and sustained effect over 48 hours. These benefits, together with potential cost-effectiveness advantages versus other triptans could drive selection of the most appropriate treatment for acute migraine attacks.

Although previous studies have independently compared the efficacy of these agents, contemporaneous data examining both pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and efficacy in parallel have not previously been available. Materials and methods: In this single-center double-blind study, 18 subjects (ten female) were treated for a single migraine attack with <b>frovatriptan</b> 2. 5 mg or rizatriptan 10 mg. Plasma concentrations were measured predose and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after drug administration. The primary end point {{of this study was}} to evaluate the association between PK parameters and efficacy measures and recurrence rate. Secondary end points were pain-free and pain-relief episodes at 2 and 4 hours, recurrent episodes within 48 hours, and cumulative hazard of recurrence within 72 hours. Results: At baseline, approximately 17 % of patients had mild migraine, while 83 % had moderate–severe migraine. Although the time to maximum concentration was similar for both drugs (2. 7 versus 2. 3 hours), the terminal half-life for <b>frovatriptan</b> was longer than rizatriptan (29. 3 versus 3. 2 hours, P< 0. 0001). The proportion of patients who were pain-free at 4 hours without rescue medication was higher in the frovatriptan-treated group, (38. 9 versus 5. 6 %, P= 0. 045). The cumulative hazard of recurrence over 72 h was reduced by <b>frovatriptan</b> compared to rizatriptan-treated patients (log-rank test, P= 0. 04). Pain-free and pain-relief episodes for the study period were positively correlated with the concentration:maximum concentration (Cmax) ratio for <b>frovatriptan</b> (r= 0. 52, P= 0. 028), but not rizatriptan. Recurrence rate was negatively correlated with the concentration:Cmax ratio for both <b>frovatriptan</b> (r=− 0. 96, P= 0. 0024) and rizatriptan (r=− 0. 98, P= 0. 0004). Fewer adverse events were observed for <b>frovatriptan</b> compared to rizatriptan (one versus eight, P= 0. 021).

Randomized controlled trials comparing <b>frovatriptan</b> with placebo or a triptan comparator for the acute or prophylactic treatment of MM were selected for review. MM affects up to 60 % of women with migraine. Compared with attacks at other times of the cycle, menstrual attacks are longer, more severe, less responsive to treatment, more likely to relapse, and more disabling than attacks at other times of the cycle. No drugs are licensed for acute treatment of MM; triptans are recommended for treatment of moderate to severe attacks for menstrual and nonmenstrual attacks. Perimenstrual prophylaxis is indicated for patients with predictable MM that does not respond to symptomatic treatment alone. Treatment is unlicensed, but options include triptans, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and hormone manipulation. <b>Frovatriptan</b> is distinctive from other triptans due to its long elimination half-life of 26 hours, which confers a longer duration of action. Post hoc analyses from randomized trials of MM show similar pain relief and pain-free rates for <b>frovatriptan</b> compared with other triptans (2 hours pain-free: relative risk [RR] 1. 27, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 91 – 1. 76) but significantly lower relapse rates (24 hours sustained pain-free: RR 0. 34, 95 % CI 0. 18 – 0. 62). Data from randomized controlled trials show a significant reduction in risk of MM in women using <b>frovatriptan</b> 2. 5 mg once daily (RR 1. 56, 95 % CI 1. 31 – 1. 86) or twice daily (RR 1. 98, 95 % CI 1. 68 – 2. 34) for perimenstrual prophylaxis compared with placebo.

Analysis was carried out in a subset of 18 subjects with migraine with aura (HIS criteria) out of the 107 enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. According to the study design, each patient had to treat three episodes of migraine in no more than 3  months with one drug, before switching to the other treatment. The rate of pain-free episodes at 2  h was significantly (p <  0. 05) larger under <b>frovatriptan</b> (45. 8  %) than under zolmitriptan (16. 7  %). Pain free at 4  h, pain relief at 2 and 4  h and recurrent episodes were similar between the two treatments, while sustained pain-free episode was significantly (p <  0. 05) more frequent during <b>frovatriptan</b> treatment (33. 3 vs. 8. 3  % zolmitriptan). Our study suggests that <b>frovatriptan</b> is superior to zolmitriptan in the immediate treatment of patients with migraine with aura, and it is capable of maintaining its acute analgesic effect over 48  h...|$|E
40|$|Roger K Cady, Kathleen Farmer Headache Care Center, Springfield, MO, USA Abstract: For {{the last}} quarter of a century, triptans have been {{available}} for acute treatment of migraine but with little guidance on which of the different triptan products to use for which patient or which attack of migraine. In this article, we propose a structured approach to analysis of individual migraine attacks and patient characteristics as a means of defining and optimizing acute intervention. Assessment of patient and attack profiles includes the “ 5 -Ps”: pattern, phenotype, patient, pharmacology, and precipitants. Attending to these five components of information can assist in developing an individualized behavioral, pharmacological, and nonpharmacological comprehensive treatment plan for most migraine patients. This clinical approach is then focused on <b>frovatriptan</b> because of its unique molecular signature and potential novel clinical applications. <b>Frovatriptan</b> like all triptans is indicated for acute treatment of migraine but its role has been explored in management of several unique migraine phenotypes. <b>Frovatriptan</b> has the longest half-life of any triptan and consequently is often promoted for acute treatment of migraine of longer duration. It has also been studied as a short-term preventive treatment in women with menstrual-related migraine. Given that 60 % of female migraineurs suffer from menstrual-related migraine, this population is the obvious group for continued study. Small studies have also explored frovatriptan’s use in treating migraine predicted by premonitory symptoms as a preventive for the headache phase of migraine. By identifying patient and attack profiles, clinicians may effectively determine the viability of <b>frovatriptan</b> as an effective pharmacological intervention for migraine.

40|$|Abstract: Triptans are {{recommended}} for the acute treatment of {{moderate to severe}} migraine or failure to respond to other acute migraine treatments. Seven triptans are available providing {{a wide range of}} choices. These triptans are more similar than dissimilar but patients do note differences in effectiveness and in tolerance. Also migraine situations may differ from attack to attack, providing the opportunity to exploit the uniqueness of a particular triptan. <b>Frovatriptan</b> has a uniquely long-half life, five times that of other triptans. This provides the opportunity to use <b>frovatriptan</b> in mini-prophylaxis such as in menstrual-related migraine and other situations, as well as use in long-lasting or recurrent migraine...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: The "Migraine Intervention Score" (MIS) {{is a new}} self-administered {{scale that}} can be used to {{quantify}} the severity of specific migraine symptoms. The objective of the present study was to determine if MIS could be used to improve the efficacy of <b>frovatriptan</b> 2. 5 mg in the early treatment of migraine attacks for clinical practice. Methods: In this prospective, observational study patients suffering from migraines with or without aura were enrolled and permitted to choose the time of self-medication with <b>frovatriptan</b> 2. 5 mg. At the time of intake of medication, patients evaluated the severity of individual migraine symptoms using MIS. The scores for each symptom were then totalled to provide an overall level of symptom severity. A total of 1620 patients completed the treatment of 3 migraine attacks with <b>frovatriptan.</b> 1518 patients could be analyzed with respect to the documented efficacy parameters of the third attack. Patients initiating treatment at low symptom severity levels were compared to those initiating treatment at high symptom severity levels. Results: Time to the achievement of the primary endpoint (headache response) was significantly lower in patients who initiated treatment at low versus high symptom severity levels (42. 06 ± 32. 33 vs. 49. 25 ± 34. 92 min; p= 0. 0023). Likewise, patients who initiated treatment at low symptom severity levels achieved complete headache relief more rapidly (79. 37 ± 65. 33 vs. 96. 05 ± 100. 85 min; p= 0. 0109) and required escape medication less frequently (3. 88 % vs. 13. 73 %; p< 0. 0001). Conclusions: The initiation of attack treatment with <b>frovatriptan</b> at low severity of migraine symptoms is more effective than starting therapy at higher symptom levels. Together with the low recurrence headache rate, the decreased necessity for escape medication and the low number of tablets needed, these data demonstrate that operationalized intervention with <b>frovatriptan</b> 2. 5 mg is a valuable method for improving the treatment of migraine attacks...|$|E
40|$|<b>Frovatriptan</b> versus other {{treatments}} for acute migraine There are now three crossover, double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of similar design comparing <b>frovatriptan</b> 2. 5 mg with zolmitriptan 2. 5 mg [1], rizatriptan 10 mg [2] and almotriptan 12. 5 mg [3]. Each RCT {{found no significant}} differences between the treatments with regard to patients ’ expressed preferences and, as secondary outcome measures, the conventional end-points of pain-freedom and headache relief [4]. A meta-analysis of the three trials, all without placebo comparison, found them to be the sufficient evidence of equal efficacy of <b>frovatriptan</b> and these other triptans [5]. Is this useful knowledge? There appears to be a consensus supporting head-to-head comparisons between triptans as the evidential basis for selecting best treatment. Clinical experience, which is not easily converted into formal evidence, nonetheless demonstrates that differences between triptans at group level are generally less influential than the differences in individual responses to them. So, in practice, those for whom triptans are indicated will still need to make their own comparative assessments. The prior question is: for whom are triptans indicated? Accordingly, one important comparative RCT is missing. ...|$|E
40|$|In two {{cross-over}} {{randomized controlled}} trials (RCTs) {{published in the}} Journal of Headache and Pain, <b>frovatriptan</b> 2. 5 mg had a similar efficacy to that of rizatriptan 10 mg [1] and almotriptan 12. 5 mg [2]. In both RCTs preference, the primary efficacy measure was quite comparable as were pain free and headache relief after 2 h, and sustained pain free for 2 – 48 h [1, 2]. In contrast, in a systematic review of triptans [3 n] the mean therapeutic gain (active minus placebo) for headache relief at 2 h was 19 % (95 % CI 16 – 22 %) for <b>frovatriptan</b> 2. 5 mg, whereas it was 33 % (95 % CI 31 – 35 %) for sumatriptan 100 mg, 34 % (95 % CI 30 – 37 %) for zolmitriptan 2. 5 mg, 36 % (95 % CI 32 – 39 %) for rizatriptan 10 mg, and 27 % (95 % CI 20 – 33 %) for almotriptan 12. 5 mg. The superiority of sumatriptan 100 mg versus <b>frovatriptan</b> 2. 5 mg was confirmed in a not fully published large (n = 1196) RCT in which the headache relief rates were 47 and 37 %, respectively [4, 5]. The recurrences rates for <b>frovatriptan</b> (25 %) and sumatriptan (31 %) were similar. Migraine patients in these RCTs [3, 4, 6] waited until the headache was moderate or severe whereas patients in the cross-over RCT were instructed to treat the migraine attack {{as early as possible}} [1, 2].

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>frovatriptan</b> and {{sumatriptan}} on internal carotid and coronary vascular haemodynamics were investigated and compared in conscious dogs. <b>Frovatriptan</b> and sumatriptan (0. 1 – 100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) induced a transient increase in external coronary artery diameter (eCOD) {{of up to}} 2. 9 ± 1. 2 and 1. 8 ± 0. 6 %, respectively (both P< 0. 05). This {{was followed by a}} prolonged and dose-dependent decrease in eCOD of up to − 5. 2 ± 1. 2 and − 5. 3 ± 0. 9 % (both P< 0. 05), with ED 50 values of 86 ± 21 and 489 ± 113 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1, respectively. In contrast, only a decrease in the external diameter of the internal carotid artery was observed (− 6. 0 ± 0. 6 and − 6. 2 ± 1. 4 %, both P< 0. 05, and ED 50 values of 86 ± 41 and 493 ± 162 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1, respectively). <b>Frovatriptan</b> was thus 5. 7 fold more potent than sumatriptan at the level of both large coronary and internal carotid arteries. After endothelium removal by balloon angioplasty in coronary arteries, the initial dilatation induced by the triptans was abolished and delayed constriction enhanced. The selective antagonist for the 5 -HT 1 B receptors SB 224289 dose-dependently blocked the effects of sumatriptan on large coronary and internal carotid arteries whereas the selective antagonist for the 5 -HT 1 D receptors BRL 15572 did not affect any of these effects. In conclusion, <b>frovatriptan</b> and sumatriptan initially dilate and subsequently constrict large coronary arteries in the conscious dog, whereas they directly constrict the internal carotid artery. The vascular endothelium modulates the effects of these triptans on large coronary arteries. Finally, 5 -HT 1 B but not 5 -HT 1 D receptors are primarily involved in canine coronary and internal carotid vasomotor responses to sumatriptan...|$|E
