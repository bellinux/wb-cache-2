25|$|The {{presence}} of these specialized cannabinoid {{receptors in the brain}} led researchers to the discovery of endocannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl <b>glyceride</b> (2-AG). THC targets receptors in a manner far less selective than endocannabinoid molecules released during retrograde signaling, as the drug has a relatively low cannabinoid receptor efficacy and affinity. In populations of low cannabinoid receptor density, THC may act to antagonize endogenous agonists that possess greater receptor efficacy. THC is a lipophilic molecule and may bind non-specifically to a variety of entities in the brain and body, such as adipose tissue (fat).|$|E

Gastric lipase is {{synthesized}} and secreted from gastric chief cells in the stomach and is stable at pH 1,5-8,but has maximum activity at pH 3-6.Fat digestion begins when gastric lipase hydrolyses dietary triglycerides, by cleaving only one long-, medium- or short-acyl chain from the <b>glyceride</b> backbone and release free fatty acids and diacylglycerols. The enzyme hydrolyses esters at position sn-3, the acyl chain at the bottom, more rapidly than esters at sn-1 position, the acyl chain {{on the top of}} the <b>glyceride</b> backbone. However the gastric lipase activity against phospholipids and cholesterol esters is poor.|$|E

In this paper, the {{relative}} change rates of content of conjugated fatty acid <b>glycerides,</b> content of tans-fatty acid <b>glycerides,</b> unsaturation and linear long-chain fatty acid <b>glycerides</b> were explored after being at high temperature {{for several hours}} by using FTIR-ATR. The results hints: 1. Starting from 160 ℃, the contents of conjugated fatty acids <b>glycerides</b> and trans-fatty acid glycerids in the vegetable oils increase but unsaturation and content of linear long-chain fatty acid <b>glycerides</b> decreases with heating temperature and heating time increasing; 2. When heating temperature reaches 200 ℃ or more, the heating time up to four hours or longer, the four indicators(conjugated fatty glycerids ， trans-fatty acid glycerids, unsaturation and linear long-chain fatty acid <b>glycerides)</b> of five kinds of vegetable oils have substantial changes; 3. The content of linoleic acid in the vegetable oil has some contributions to the change amplitude of contents of conjugated fatty acid <b>glycerides,</b> {{and the content of}} oleic acid in the vegetable oil has some contributions to the change amplitude of content of trans-fatty acid <b>glycerides.</b> Because refined “waste oil ” experiences a longer history at temperature higher than 200 ℃ compared to the vegetable oil, four index value and its variation can be used as specific indicators for it...|$|R
50|$|Partial <b>glycerides</b> are esters of {{glycerol}} with fatty acids, {{where not}} all thehydroxyl groups are esterified. Since {{some of their}} hydroxyl groups are free their molecules are polar. Partial <b>glycerides</b> may be monoglycerides (two hydroxyl groups free) or diglycerides (one hydroxyl group free).Short chain partial <b>glycerides</b> are more strongly polar than long chain partial <b>glycerides,</b> and have excellent solvent properties for many hard-to-solubilize drugs, making them valuable as excipients in improving the formulation of certain pharmaceuticals.The most common forms of acylglycerol are triglycerides, having high caloric value and usually yielding twice as much energy per gram as carbohydrate.|$|R

50|$|Lipases in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{play a critical}} role in fat digestion. More than 95% of fat in food consists of triglycerides, which are categorized based on the length of fatty acids connected to <b>glyceride</b> backbone.

50|$|Alkyd {{coatings}} {{are produced}} in two processes; fatty acid {{process and the}} alcoholysis or mono-glyceride process. Higher quality, higher performance alkyds are produced in the fatty acid process where {{the composition of the}} resulting resin can be more precisely controlled. In this process an acid anhydride, a polyol, and an unsaturated fatty acid are combined and cooked together until the product has achieved a predetermined level of viscosity. Penta alkyds are made this way. More economical alkyd resins are produced from the alcoholysis or <b>glyceride</b> process where end product quality control is not as paramount. In this process raw vegetable oil, high in unsaturated component, is combined with additional polyol and heated to cause transesterification of the triglycerides into a mixture of mono- and diglyceride oils. To this resulting mixture acid anhydride is added to build the molecular weight of the resin into roughly the same product as in the fatty acid process. However, the alcoholysis process, also known as the <b>glyceride</b> process, produces a more randomly oriented structure. To remove the water produced as a by-product and to increase the reaction rate, surplus phthalic anhydride was added. Water was thus removed with the unreacted acid by heating the bulk to a temperature needed to do this. It meant that the reaction was not as controllable as would be desired. A new process was introduced, in which Xylene was added to produce an azeotrope with the water. This gave greater control at a lower temperature, this also produced resins at a lower viscosity, useful in making high solids paints; this process was known as the AZO process. In both cases the resulting product is a polyester resin to which pendant drying oil groups are attached. At the conclusion of both processes the resin is purified, diluted in solvent and sold to paint and varnish makers.|$|E
40|$|The {{infrared}} spectra of tripalmitoyl <b>glyceride</b> confirm the tuning fork configuration previously attributed to trilauroyl <b>glyceride</b> (Small, D. M. 1986. Handbook of Lipid Research. Vol. 4). The acyl chains in solid tripalmitoyl glycerol, either within each molecule or between neighboring molecules, are oriented parallel {{to each other}} with the sn- 3 acyl chains extended toward the opposite direction of the sn- 1 and sn- 2 chains. The presence of cholesterol increases the orientational disorder of the tripalmitoyl <b>glyceride</b> molecules in terms of increased reorientational fluctuations and twisting/torsion motions of the acyl chains. In the solid mixture, cholesterol is embedded in the tripalmitoyl <b>glyceride</b> lattice which results in a reorientation of the acyl chains within each molecule from a parallel packing to a nonparallel packing. No evidence was found for hydrogen bond formation between the OH group of cholesterol and any of the three C = O groups of tripalmitoyl <b>glyceride.</b> Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
