40|$|The {{medicinal}} {{properties of}} the leaves and fruit of Olea Europaea (olive tree) have been known since antiquity. Numerous contemporary studies have linked the Mediterranean diet with increased health.

Increasingly, there has been an interest in the biological properties of polyphenols, which are minor constituents of olive oil. For example, <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> {{has been shown to be}} a potent antioxidant and has anti-atherogenic and anti-cancer properties. The overall aim of this study was to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of action of <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> using genome-wide mRNA-Seq. Initial experiments were aimed at assessing cytotoxicity, apoptosis and cell cycle effects of <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> in various cell lines. The findings indicated a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability in human erythroleukemic K 562 and human keratinocytes. When comparing the viability in parental CEM-CCRF and R 100 cells (which overexpress the P-glycoprotein pump), it was determined that the R 100 cells were more resistant to effects of <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> suggesting efflux by the multi-drug resistance pump. By comparing the uptake of Hoechst 33342 in the two cell lines that had been pretreated with <b>hydroxytyrosol,</b> it was determined that the polyphenol may have P-glycoprotein-modulating activity. Further, initial studies indicated modest radioprotective effects of relatively low doses of <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> in human keratinocytes. Analysis of mRNA sequencing data identified that treatment of keratinocytes with 20  μM <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> results in the upregulation of numerous antioxidant proteins and enzymes, including heme oxygenase- 1 (15. 46 -fold upregulation), glutaredoxin (1. 65) and glutathione peroxidase (1. 53).

The administered dose of phenolic compounds was estimated from methanolic extracts of virgin olive oil after subjecting them to different hydrolytic treatments. Plasma and urine samples were collected from 0 to 12 h before and after 25 mL of virgin olive oil intake, a dose close to that used as daily intake in Mediterranean countries. Samples were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography–mass spectrometry before and after being subjected to acidic and enzymatic hydrolytic treatments. Results: Calibration curves were linear (r> 0. 99). Analytical recoveries were 42 – 60 %. Limits of quantification were < 1. 5 mg/L. Plasma <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> and 3 -O-methyl-hydroxytyrosol increased as a response to virgin olive oil administration, reaching maximum concentrations at 32 and 53 min, respectively (P < 0. 001 for quadratic trend). The estimated <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> elimination halflife was 2. 43 h. Free forms of these phenolic compounds were not detected in plasma samples. Conclusions: The proposed analytical method permits quantification of <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> and 3 -O-methyl-hydroxytyrosol in plasma after real-life doses of virgin olive oil. From our results, � 98 % of <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> appears to be present in plasma and urine in conjugate...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hydroxytyrosol</b> and hydroxytyrosyl acetate are two {{well-known}} {{phenolic compounds}} with antioxidant properties that {{are present in}} virgin olive oil. Since the in vivo biological activity of polyphenols is dependent on their intestinal absorption and metabolism, the absorption of <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> and hydroxytyrosyl acetate {{and the extent to}} which they are conjugated and metabolised during transfer across intestinal Caco- 2 /TC 7 cell monolayers, was investigated. LC-DAD and LC-MS were used for the quantification and identification of metabolites. Further evidence was obtained by observing metabolite susceptibility to β-glucuronidase treatment and by comparison of products of in vitro conjugation reactions of authentic phenolics with those produced by the CaCo- 2 cells. Homovanillyl alcohol was the only conjugate detected as a result of <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> metabolism, and accounted for 20 % of the total metabolites detected in the basolateral compartment after 2 h of incubation. Hydroxytyrosyl acetate was largely converted into free <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> (38. 4 %) and subsequently metabolised into homovanillyl alcohol (6. 7 %). In addition, hydroxytyrosyl acetate glucuronide (17. 4 %) together with non-metabolised hydroxytyrosyl acetate (37. 5 %) were also detected. Both hydroxytyrosyl acetate and <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> were transferred across human Caco- 2 /TC 7 cell monolayers, but the acetylated compound exhibited an apparent permeability (PappAP→BL/Papp BL→AP) 2. 1 -fold higher than free <b>hydroxytyrosol.</b> For both compounds, all conjugates were preferentially transported to the basolateral side. These results show that the acetylation of <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> significantly increases its transport across the small intestinal epithelial cell barrier, and supports further research into hydroxytyrosyl acetate as a <b>hydroxytyrosol</b> prodrug offering enhanced bioavailability. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
