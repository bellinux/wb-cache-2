25|$|Once {{the lander}} was 355 m above the ground, airbags were {{inflated}} {{in less than}} a second using three catalytically cooled solid rocket motors that served as gas generators. The airbags were made of 4 inter-connected multi-layer vectran bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander. They were designed and tested to accommodate <b>grazing</b> <b>angle</b> impacts as high as 28m/s. However, as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15m/s vertical impacts, three solid retrorockets were mounted above the lander in the backshell. These were fired at 98m above the ground. The lander's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0m/s between 15 and 25m above the ground. After 2.3 seconds, while the rockets were still firing, the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5m above the ground and fell to the ground. The rockets flew up and away with the backshell and parachute (they have since been sighted by orbital images). The lander impacted at 14m/s and limited the impact to only 18G of deceleration. The first bounce was 15.7m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces (accelerometer data recording did not continue through all of the bounces).|$|E
2500|$|In the {{important}} special case of reflection {{at normal incidence}} (not involving anisotropic materials) there is no particular s or p polarization. Both the x and y polarization components are reflected identically, and therefore the polarization of the reflected wave is identical {{to that of the}} incident wave. However, in the case of circular (or elliptical) polarization, the handedness of the polarization state is thereby reversed, since by convention this is specified relative to the direction of propagation. The circular rotation of the electric field around the x-y axes called [...] "right-handed" [...] for a wave in the +z direction is [...] "left-handed" [...] for a wave in the -z direction. But in the general case of reflection at a nonzero angle of incidence, no such generalization can be made. For instance, right-circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at a <b>grazing</b> <b>angle,</b> will still be right-handed (but elliptically) polarized. Linear polarized light reflected from a metal at non-normal incidence will generally become elliptically polarized. These cases are handled using Jones vectors acted upon by the different Fresnel coefficients for the s and p polarization components.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop an {{extension}} of the small slope approximation (SSA) for scattering from randomly rough Dirichlet surfaces, which includes some multiple scattering. This extension is designated by SSA+. We focus on scattering at very low <b>grazing</b> <b>angles</b> where multiple scattering of both the incident and scattered fields is of importance. Numerical results for the SSA+ bistatic scattering cross-section for very low forward <b>grazing</b> <b>angles</b> are presented using the Gaussian roughness spectrum and for both very low forward and very low backward <b>grazing</b> <b>angles</b> using the Pierson-Moskowitz and modified power law spectra. The results are restricted to an angle of incidence of 80 °. It is shown that when the lowest-order SSA gives reasonably accurate results, the SSA+ increases the accuracy up to at least the final 0. 2 ° of grazing in the forward direction. In the backward direction, the SSA+ gives good results for the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum, but the results are less dramatic. Post-printBroschat, S. L., and Y.

5000|$|Practically, in many {{experiments}} with quantum reflection from Si, the grazing incidence angle is used (figure A). The set-up is mounted {{in a vacuum}} chamber to provide a several-meter path free of atoms; a good vacuum (at the level of 10−7 Torr or [...] ) is required. The magneto-optical trap (MOT) is used to collect cold atoms, usually excited He or Ne, approaching the point-like source of atoms. The excitation of atoms is not essential for the quantum reflection but it allows the efficient trapping and cooling using optical frequencies. In addition, the excitation of atoms allows the registration at the micro-channel plate (MCP) detector (bottom of the figure). Movable edges are used to stop atoms which do not go toward the sample (for example a Si plate), providing the collimated atomic beam. The He-Ne laser was used to control {{the orientation of the}} sample and measure the <b>grazing</b> <b>angle</b> [...] At the MCP, there was observed relatively intensive strip of atoms which come straightly (without reflection) from the MOT, by-passing the sample, strong shadow of the sample (the thickness of this shadow could be used for rough control of the <b>grazing</b> <b>angle),</b> and the relatively weak strip produced by the reflected atoms. The ratio [...] of density of atoms registered {{at the center of this}} strip to the density of atoms at the directly illuminated region was considered as efficiency of quantum reflection, i.e., reflectivity.
