40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for ray tracing <b>displacement</b> <b>maps</b> that requires no additional storage over the base model. <b>Displacement</b> <b>maps</b> are rarely used in ray tracing {{due to the}} cost associated with storing and intersecting the displaced geometry. This is unfortunate because <b>displacement</b> <b>maps</b> allow the addition of large amounts of geometric complexity into models. Our method works for models composed of triangles with normals at the vertices. In addition, we discuss a special purpose displacement that creates a smooth surface that interpolates the triangle vertices and normals of a mesh.

50|$|ZBrush is {{used for}} {{creating}} high-resolution models (able to reach 40+ million polygons) for use in movies, games, and animations, by companies ranging from ILM to Electronic Arts. ZBrush uses dynamic levels of resolution to allow sculptors to make global or local changes to their models. ZBrush is most known {{for being able to}} sculpt medium to high frequency details that were traditionally painted in bump maps. The resulting mesh details can then be exported as normal maps to be used on a low poly version of that same model. They can also be exported as a <b>displacement</b> <b>map,</b> although in that case the lower poly version generally requires more resolution. Or, once completed, the 3D model can be projected to the background, becoming a 2.5D image (upon which further effects can be applied). Work can then begin on another 3D model which can be used in the same scene. This feature lets users work with complicated scenes without heavy processor overhead.|$|E

This distance map gives us all the information necessary to quickly intersect a ray with the surface.

The results show that the StaMPS technique successfully extracted sufficient number of Persistent Scatterers (PS) to derive a one dimensional (1 D) time series <b>displacement</b> <b>map</b> which shows the deformation rates up to 59 mm/year in the satellite Line of Sight (LOS) direction and 50. 8 mm/year in the direction opposite to the satellite LOS.

A local adaptation then deforms the geometry of the generic model to fit all of its vertices to the scan surface. The high-resolution geometry of the scan surface is represented as a <b>displacement</b> <b>map</b> which is generated using an offsetenvelope mapping.
