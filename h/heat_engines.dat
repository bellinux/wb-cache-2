5|$|The thermal {{efficiency}} of geothermal electric plants is low, around 10–23%, because geothermal fluids do {{not reach the}} high temperatures of steam from boilers. The laws of thermodynamics limits the efficiency of <b>heat</b> <b>engines</b> in extracting useful energy. Exhaust heat is wasted, unless {{it can be used}} directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. System efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel, but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles. Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its capacity factor can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated. The global average was 73% in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Although {{it may be}} hard {{today to}} {{understand}} the allure of the caloric theory, at the time it seemed to have some clear advantages.

25|$|He concludes {{further that}} {{the choice of the}} working fluid, its density or the volume {{occupied}} by it cannot change this maximum efficiency.

25|$|The initial {{application}} of thermodynamics to mechanical <b>heat</b> <b>engines</b> was extended {{early on to}} the study of chemical compounds and chemical reactions. Chemical thermodynamics studies the nature of the role of entropy in the process of chemical reactions and has provided the bulk of expansion and knowledge of the field. Other formulations of thermodynamics emerged in the following decades. Statistical thermodynamics, or statistical mechanics, concerned itself with statistical predictions of the collective motion of particles from their microscopic behavior. In 1909, Constantin Carathéodory presented a purely mathematical approach to the field in his axiomatic formulation of thermodynamics, a description often referred to as geometrical thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Most rocket {{engines are}} {{internal}} combustion <b>heat</b> <b>engines</b> (although non combusting forms exist). Rocket engines generally produce a high temperature reaction mass, as a hot gas. This {{is achieved by}} combusting a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel with an oxidiser within a combustion chamber. The extremely hot gas is then allowed to escape through a high-expansion ratio nozzle. This bell-shaped nozzle is what gives a rocket engine its characteristic shape. The effect of the nozzle is to dramatically accelerate the mass, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speed reaching as high as 10 times {{the speed of sound}} at sea level are common.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{refrigeration}} include the {{air cycle machine}} used in aircraft; the vortex tube used for spot cooling, when compressed air is available; and thermoacoustic refrigeration using sound waves in a pressurized gas to drive heat transfer and heat exchange; steam jet cooling popular in the early 1930s for air conditioning large buildings; thermoelastic cooling using a smart metal alloy stretching and relaxing. Many Stirling cycle <b>heat</b> <b>engines</b> can be run backwards {{to act as a}} refrigerator, and therefore these engines have a niche use in cryogenics. In addition there are other types of cryocoolers such as Gifford-McMahon coolers, Joule-Thomson coolers, pulse-tube refrigerators and, for temperatures between 2 mK and 500 mK, dilution refrigerators.|$|E

25|$|Much {{later in}} the history of man, the steam engine came about as the crucial Promethean recipe of the second kind, feeding on coal.

This technology propelled the Industrial Revolution in Britain {{in the second half of}} the 18th century, whereby man's economy has been thrust into a long, never-to-return overshoot-and-collapse trajectory with regard to the Earth's mineral stock. Georgescu lists the internal combustion engine and the nuclear fission reactor as other, later examples of Promethean recipes of the second kind, namely <b>heat</b> <b>engines</b> feeding on a mineral fuel (oil and uranium (plus thorium), respectively).|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} thermodynamics, {{a commonly}} considered {{model is the}} heat engine. It consists of four bodies: the working body, the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A cyclic process leaves the working body in an unchanged state, and is envisaged as being repeated indefinitely often. Work transfers between the working body and the work reservoir are envisaged as reversible, and thus only one work reservoir is needed. But two thermal reservoirs are needed, because transfer of energy as heat is irreversible. A single cycle sees energy taken by the working body from the hot reservoir {{and sent to the}} two other reservoirs, the work reservoir and the cold reservoir. The hot reservoir always and only supplies energy and the cold reservoir always and only receives energy. The second law of thermodynamics requires that no cycle can occur in which no energy is received by the cold reservoir. <b>Heat</b> <b>engines</b> achieve higher efficiency when the difference between initial and final temperature is greater.|$|E

Thomas Thomson (1773–1852) was the first Professor of Chemistry at Glasgow and in 1831 founded the Shuttle Street laboratories, perhaps the first of their kind in the world. His students founded practical chemistry at Aberdeen soon after. William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy at Glasgow aged only 22. His work included the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics.
