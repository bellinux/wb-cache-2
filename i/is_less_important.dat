5|$|All cacti {{have some}} adaptations to promote {{efficient}} water use. Most cacti—opuntias and cactoids—specialize in surviving in hot and dry environments (i.e. they are xerophytes), {{but the first}} ancestors of modern cacti were already adapted to periods of intermittent drought. A small number of cactus species in the tribes Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae have become adapted to life as climbers or epiphytes, often in tropical forests, where water conservation <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like other {{volcanic}} {{zones in}} the Garibaldi Belt, volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field are not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. This {{is partly because}} the field {{is located in a}} remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the last few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>important</b> than dealing with other natural processes, including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects, particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi Belt is located in a highly populated area. Because of these concerns, significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge {{on the state of the}} Garibaldi volcanoes. This improvement is continuous and will support the understanding to monitor volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field for future volcanism.|$|E

25|$|A major {{question}} is whether human psychological faculties are mostly innate or whether they are mostly a result of learning, and hence subject to cultural and social processes such as language. The innate view holds that humans share {{the same set of}} basic faculties, and that variability due to cultural differences <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>important</b> and that the human mind is a mostly biological construction, so that all humans sharing the same neurological configuration can be expected to have similar cognitive patterns.|$|E

25|$|Selection of a pigment for a {{particular}} application is determined by cost, and by the physical properties and attributes of the pigment itself. For example, a pigment {{that is used to}} color glass must have very high heat stability in order to survive the manufacturing process; but, suspended in the glass vehicle, its resistance to alkali or acidic materials is not an issue. In artistic paint, heat stability <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>important,</b> while lightfastness and toxicity are greater concerns.|$|E

Lewis depicts the Calormene culture as one in which a primary guiding principle is that the weak must {{make way for the}} strong: For in Tashbaan there is only one traffic regulation, which is that everyone who <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>important</b> has {{to get out of the}} way for everyone who is more important; unless you want a cut from a whip or a punch from the butt end of a spear.|$|E
25|$|A {{toolmaker}} may {{put a lot}} {{of effort}} into finding the highest quality raw material or the most suitable tool stone. In this way more effort is invested in obtaining a good foundation, but time is saved on shaping the stone, that is the effort is focussed on the start of the operational chain. Equally the artisan may concentrate the most effort in the manufacture so that the quality or suitability of the raw material <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>important.</b> This will minimize the initial effort but will result in a greater effort {{at the end of the}} operational chain.|$|E

25|$|Angra {{occupies}} the south coast of Terceira. It is {{the headquarters of}} a military command and the seat of a Roman Catholic bishopric. Its principal buildings are the Sé Cathedral of Angra do Heroísmo, a military college, an arsenal, and an observatory. The harbor, now of little commercial or strategic importance (but formerly a major commercial and military port), is sheltered on the west and southwest by the promontory of Monte Brasil, but, today, it <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>important</b> than the neighboring ports of Ponta Delgada {{on the island of}} São Miguel and Horta on the island of Faial.|$|E
25|$|For medical purposes, {{the exact}} number of {{helminth}} eggs <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>important</b> and therefore most diagnoses are made simply by identifying the appearance of the worm or eggs in feces. Due to the large quantity of eggs laid, physicians can diagnose using only one or two fecal smears. The Kato technique (also called the Kato-Katz technique) is a laboratory method for preparing human stool samples prior to searching for parasite eggs. Eggs per gram is a laboratory test that determines the number of eggs per gram of feces in patients suspected of having a parasitological infection, such as schistosomiasis.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{carried out}} {{in recent years have}} shown human fasciolosis to be an {{important}} public health problem. Human fasciolosis has been reported from countries in Europe, America, Asia, Africa and Oceania. The incidence of human cases has been increasing in 51 countries of the five continents. A global analysis shows that the expected correlation between animal and human fasciolosis only appears at a basic level. High prevalences in humans are not necessarily found in areas where fasciolosis is a great veterinary problem. For instance, in South America, hyperendemics and mesoendemics are found in Bolivia and Peru where the veterinary problem <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>important,</b> while in countries such as Uruguay, Argentina and Chile, human fasciolosis is only sporadic or hypoendemic.|$|E

For example, Division Street (1200 N) <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>important</b> than either Chicago Avenue (800 N) or North Avenue (1600 N), but is still a major thoroughfare. However, {{this is not always}} the case; for example, on the city's Far North Side, Peterson Avenue (6000 N) is a more heavily trafficked street than Bryn Mawr Avenue (5600 N), which sits exactly at the 7-mile marker. U.S. Route 14 is routed along Peterson between Clark Street at 1600 W and Cicero Avenue at 4800 W, whereas Bryn Mawr is discontinuous, split into two segments {{in this part of the}} city by Rosehill Cemetery between Damen and Western Avenues.|$|E
25|$|The Sidewinder is {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} the drawbacks of the stacked design. It does this by reorienting the coils so that while electrically cancelling they are on opposite poles of a magnet. Thus, unlike stacked coils, output is hotter since the net effect is to add rather than subtract the signal between the coils; thus, the impedance can be lower, avoiding overwinding to obtain sufficient output. There is less signal cancellation. Sonically these sit somewhere between a true P-90 and a stacked pickup. They don't chime but they aren't nasal or lifeless either. They are ideal candidates for overdriven sounds where loss of sparkle <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>important</b> than avoiding hum amplification. These type of pickups have the same appearance of P-90s.|$|E
25|$|The gross {{anatomy of}} a muscle is the most {{important}} indicator of its role in the body. One particularly important aspect of gross anatomy of muscles is pennation or lack thereof. In most muscles, all the fibers are oriented in the same direction, running in a line from the origin to the insertion. In pennate muscles, the individual fibers are oriented at an angle relative to the line of action, attaching to the origin and insertion tendons at each end. Because the contracting fibers are pulling at an angle to the overall action of the muscle, the change in length is smaller, but this same orientation allows for more fibers (thus more force) in a muscle of a given size. Pennate muscles are usually found where their length change <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>important</b> than maximum force, such as the rectus femoris.|$|E
