5|$|The United States also observes tribal {{sovereignty}} of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they {{have a great deal of}} autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are monogamous {{and will}} remain with the one partner until death. Female jackals have only one {{breeding}} cycle each year. Breeding occurs from October to March in Israel and from February to March in India, Turkmenistan, Bulgaria, and Transcaucasia, with the mating period lasting up to 26–28 days. Females undergoing their first estrus are often pursued by several males that may quarrel among themselves. Mating results in a copulatory tie that lasts for several minutes, as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> all other canids. Gestation lasts 63 days, and {{the timing of the}} births coincides with the annual abundance of food.|$|E

5|$|It {{lived in}} what is now {{southern}} Germany in the Late Jurassic period around 150million years ago, when Europe was an archipelago in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the equator than it is now. Similar in shape to a European magpie, with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a raven, Archaeopteryx could grow to about 0.5metres (1.6ft) in length. Despite its small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, Archaeopteryx has more in common with other small Mesozoic dinosaurs than <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> modern birds. In particular, it shares the following features with the deinonychosaurs (dromaeosaurs and troodontids): jaws with sharp teeth, three fingers with claws, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes ("killing claw"), feathers (which suggest homeothermy), and various skeletal features. These features make Archaeopteryx a clear candidate for a transitional fossil between dinosaurs and birds, making it important in the study both of dinosaurs and of the origin of birds.|$|E
5|$|The bookwheel, in {{its most}} {{commonly}} seen form, was invented by Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli in 1588, presented {{as one of the}} 195 designs in Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli (The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli). To ensure that the books remained at a constant angle, Ramelli incorporated an epicyclic gearing arrangement, a complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks. Ramelli's design is unnecessarily elaborate, as he likely understood that gravity could have worked just as effectively (as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> a Ferris wheel, invented centuries later), but the gearing system allowed him to display his mathematical prowess. While other people would go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.|$|E

25|$|Unlike P. falciparum, P. vivax can {{populate}} the bloodstream with sexual-stage parasitesthe form {{picked up by}} mosquitoes {{on their way to}} the next victimeven before a patient shows symptoms. Consequently, prompt treatment of symptomatic patients doesn't necessarily help stop an outbreak, as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> falciparum malaria, in which fevers occur as sexual stages develop. Even when symptoms appear, because they are usually not immediately fatal, the parasite continues to multiply.|$|E

25|$|Oxygen (O2) must {{be present}} in every {{breathing}} gas. This is because {{it is essential to}} the human body's metabolic process, which sustains life. The human body cannot store oxygen for later use as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> food. If the body is deprived of oxygen {{for more than a few}} minutes, unconsciousness and death result. The tissues and organs within the body (notably the heart and brain) are damaged if deprived of oxygen for much longer than four minutes.|$|E
25|$|People {{with normal}} {{circadian}} systems can generally fall asleep quickly at night if they slept too little the night before. Falling asleep earlier will in turn automatically help {{to advance their}} circadian clocks due to decreased light exposure in the evening. In contrast, people with DSPD have difficulty falling asleep before their usual sleep time, {{even if they are}} sleep-deprived. Sleep deprivation does not reset the circadian clock of DSPD patients, as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> normal people.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the American Kennel Club (AKC) is {{the primary}} {{registry}} for purebred dogs, and first recognized the Australian Shepherd in 1991 {{as a member of}} the Herding group. However, many Aussie breeders felt the AKC put too much emphasis on breed conformity and not enough on performance, so the ASCA declined to join the AKC. Those breeders who felt that AKC membership had its advantages split off from ASCA to form their own Australian Shepherd club, the United States Australian Shepherd Association, created their own breed standard, and joined the AKC in 1993. The decision about affiliation with the AKC remains controversial, as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> many performance breeds.|$|E

While PepsiCo owns its own manufacturing and distribution facilities {{in certain parts of}} these regions, more of this production is conducted via alternate means such as licensing (which <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> Aquafina), contract manufacturing, joint ventures, and affiliate operations.

25|$|In {{suspension}} bridges, large main cables (normally two) hang {{between the}} towers and are anchored {{at each end}} to the ground. This {{can be difficult to}} implement when ground conditions are poor. The main cables, which are free to move on bearings in the towers, bear the load of the bridge deck. Before the deck is installed, the cables are under tension from their own weight. Along the main cables smaller cables or rods connect to the bridge deck, which is lifted in sections. As this is done, the tension in the cables increases, as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> the live load of traffic crossing the bridge. The tension on the main cables is transferred to the ground at the anchorages and by downwards tug on the towers.|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{theoretical}} check on federal power, {{the distinction between}} the federal military reserves and the National Guard permits state governors to use their personnel to assist in disaster relief and to preserve law and order in times of crisis. The latter is permitted because the National Guard are not subject to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act unless they are under federal jurisdiction. The restrictions, however, do apply to the four of the other five reserve components just as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> their active duty military counterparts. The United States Coast Guard and Coast Guard Reserve are not subject to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act because they are the only Armed Force of the United States that {{is not part of the}} United States Department of Defense.|$|E

The letter referred to research stating that the Settlement Division has ties to right-wing NGOs, which, in turn, are connected to The Jewish Home Party (Bayit Yehudi), Slomiansky’s party. Shaffir also argued against funding for the Jewish Identity Administration which she considered a ploy to promote a right wing political agenda.|$|E
