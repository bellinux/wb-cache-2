It is only in the middle classes, Stephen, that people get into a state of dumb helpless horror when they find that there are wicked people in the world.

60|$|Miss Wayne, she decided, was {{at least}} very like the woman Appleby had pictured to her; but she was {{difficult}} to understand, for Violet seldom displayed her feelings, and her cold serenity baffled the observer. Tony Palliser, of whom she had contrived to see a good deal, was an easier and less interesting study. Nettie was naively witty, and could assume American mannerisms with excellent effect when she chose while Tony was fond of being amused, and Violet Wayne apparently devoid of any small jealousy. Thus he {{spent a good deal}} of time hanging about Miss Harding, and would have been painfully astonished had he discovered what she thought of him. Languid good nature and the faculty of idling time away very gracefully did not appeal to her, for even pleasure is pursued with grim strenuousness in her country. He was, she fancied, just such a man as the one Appleby had sacrificed himself for; but she surmised that there were a good many men of that kind in England, and Appleby had told his story in a fashion that made the identification of the scene and the persons concerned in it difficult. Nettie felt also that should conviction be forced upon her she would still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> her course would be.|$|E

50|$|Eventually, Hillary wears Eddie {{down and}} she gets funding (mainly from friends, associates, and colleagues) for his first fights, all of which go awry, either through Hillary's lack of {{knowledge}} about boxing or Eddie's out-of-shape condition (and general fear of being hit). All the while, Hillary and Eddie continue sparring on their own, thanks to their different personalities.

50|$|Agile {{manufacturing}} {{is seen as}} {{the next}} step after lean manufacturing in the evolution of production methodology. The key difference between the two is like between a thin and an athletic person, agile being the latter. One can be neither, one or both. In manufacturing theory, being both {{is often referred to as}} leagile.According to Martin Christopher, when companies <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> to be, they have to look at the customer order cycle (COC) (the time the customers are willing to wait) and the leadtime for getting supplies. If the supplier has a short lead time, lean production is possible. If the COC is short, agile production is beneficial.|$|E
50|$|Young {{people who}} were born in Canada or brought as {{children}} share {{a particular set of}} issues and concerns with their parents and the wider Pakistani-Canadian community. Their perspective regarding adaptation and integration is generally not informed by significant direct experience of the culture and values of the homeland, and, as a result, parents and grandparents take on a mediating role. They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> aspects of their traditional lifestyle and values must be left behind and what can be transferred to and re-established in their new home. Most significantly, they generally assume the responsibility for making these choices for their children as well. The family - even in its truncated form in the diaspora - is both the base for substantial cultural transfer and the source of intergenerational conflict.|$|E

5000|$|Adoption and child-visitation protections {{were also}} in question. While North Carolina only allows {{adoption}} by one unmarried adult, there are cases where children are adopted by two unmarried adults (including same-sex couples) in other states and are now living in North Carolina. Since those relationships {{would not have been}} recognized under Amendment One, there were potentially serious consequences. In Potential Legal Impacts of the Proposed Same Sex Marriage Amendment, the authors concluded that in child-custody disputes [...] "judges may interpret one as an expression of public policy against all non-marital relationships. This interpretation may have caused judges to view such relationships as having a per se negative impact on a child, and fashion custody orders accordingly. They also said that in custody disputes between a parent and non-parent, the courts could decide that one parent's relationship is impermissible since it would validate a domestic legal union other than heterosexual marriage. As with the other protections in question it seemed that the courts would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> the actual interpretation and implementation will be in this area.|$|E
