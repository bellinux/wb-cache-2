5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} scan inspection, the pantograph elevates the 3D scanner at the <b>fuselage.</b> A pan-tilt unit moves the scan device to acquire the hull. By comparing the data acquired to the three-dimensional model of the aircraft, algorithms are able to diagnose any faults in the <b>fuselage</b> structure and provide information on their shape, size and depth.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the three}} {{prototype}}s began in late 1945 and the first prototype began manufacturer's testing on 30 December. The ground testing revealed that the engine exhaust caused a low-pressure area under the rear <b>fuselage</b> which caused the fighter to tilt tail-down during engine tests. The rigidly mounted heatshield caused {{the underside of the}} rear <b>fuselage</b> to deform because the steel and the duralumin skin of the <b>fuselage</b> had different expansion ratios when heated. The rear <b>fuselage</b> and the heatshield were both redesigned to eliminate these problems. On 23 March the prototype was trucked to the Flight Research Institute (LII)'s airfield at Ramenskoye to begin preparations for flight testing.|$|E

40|$|An {{aircraft}} configuration {{consisting of a}} pair of <b>fuselages</b> parallel to each other and connected by a main wing and a horizontal stabilizer which pivot on the <b>fuselages</b> is described. The pivotal attachment allows the wing to be yawed relative to the <b>fuselages</b> for high speed flight {{while at the same time}} spreading the weight and volume distribution of the aircraft along the direction of flight. The main wing is curved upward at the tips to compensate for any roll tendencies caused by its yawed position...|$|R

5|$|Portions of the Apache are {{produced}} by various aerospace firms. AgustaWestland has produced number of components for the Apache, both for the international market and for the British Army's AgustaWestland Apache. Since 2004, Korea Aerospace Industries has been the sole manufacturer of the Apache's <b>fuselage.</b> <b>Fuselage</b> production had previously been performed by Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical; the transfer of <b>fuselage</b> production led to a prolonged legal dispute between Teledyne Ryan and Boeing.|$|E

5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), {{part of the}} Department of Transportation, {{were the}} primary {{investigators}} into the crash of Flight 2511. The wreckage of the DC-6 {{was taken to a}} hangar at nearby Wilmington Airport, where the <b>fuselage</b> was reassembled on a wood-and-chicken-wire frame. Investigators recovered approximately 90% of the <b>fuselage,</b> which was then assembled on the frame in the Wilmington hangar.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} of the Hunter {{consists of}} six interchangeable major sections: the forward <b>fuselage</b> (housing {{the cockpit and}} armament pack), center <b>fuselage</b> (including the integral wing roots and air duct intakes), rear <b>fuselage,</b> tail unit assembly, and two individually produced wings. Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing of the type could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack. Establishing initial full-rate production for the type was difficult; manufacturing the Hunter required the development of 3,250 tool designs and the procurement of 40,000 fixtures, jigs, and tools.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{construction}} {{techniques in}} aerodynamic surface construction allow long runs of Natural Laminar Flow (NLF) along airfoils and <b>fuselages</b> provided that their shape has been properly designed. A numerical optimization iterative procedure for drag reduction by shape modification of mono- and multi-component airfoils and three-dimensional <b>fuselages,</b> has been developed. To this aim we propose a geometric parameterization {{of a general}} 3 D body. Reduction of drag through an extension of laminar flow runs, for airfoils and 3 D glider <b>fuselages,</b> is shown. A modular numerical code developed to perform shape optimization for drag reduction {{has proven to be}} efficient and reliable...|$|R

5|$|The forward <b>fuselage</b> did go {{on display}} on 28 June 1995. On 2 July 1995, three {{people were arrested}} for {{throwing}} ash and human blood on the aircraft's <b>fuselage,</b> following an earlier incident in which a protester had thrown red paint over the gallery's carpeting. The exhibition closed on 18 May 1998, and the <b>fuselage</b> was returned to the Garber Facility for final restoration.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the forward}} and rear {{bulkhead}} was the bomb bay, which was constructed with a double-frame to strengthen it for carrying the bomb load. The {{space between the}} bomb bay and rear bulkhead was used up by Funkgerät radio equipment and contained the dorsal and flexible casemate ventral gunner positions. The rear bulkhead contained a hatch which allowed access {{into the rest of}} the <b>fuselage</b> which was held together by a series of stringers. The wing was a two spar design. The <b>fuselage</b> was formed of stringers to which the <b>fuselage</b> skin was riveted. Internally the frames were fixed only to the stringers, which made for simpler construction at the cost of some rigidity.|$|E
