40|$|Advanced 1 -D {{models for}} Secondary Settling Tanks (SSTs) {{explicitly}} account for several phenomena {{that influence the}} settling process (such as <b>hindered</b> settling and compression settling). For each of these phenomena a valid mathematical expression needs to be selected and its parameters calibrated to obtain a model {{that can be used}} for operation and control. This is, however, a challenging task as these phenomena may occur simultaneously. Therefore, the presented work evaluates several available expressions for <b>hindered</b> settling based on long-term batch settling data. Specific attention is paid to the behaviour of these <b>hindered</b> settling functions in the compression region in order to evaluate how the modelling of sludge compression is influenced by the choice of a certain <b>hindered</b> settling function. The analysis shows that the exponential <b>hindered</b> settling forms, which are most commonly used in traditional SST models, not only account for <b>hindered</b> settling but partly lump other phenomena (compression) as well. This makes them unsuitable for advanced 1 -D models that explicitly include each phenomenon in a modular way. A power-law function is shown to be more appropriate to describe the <b>hindered</b> settling velocity in advanced 1 -D SST models...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the ability}} to perform {{activities}} of daily living (ADL) is frequently used to identify the impact on daily living caused by health problems such as diseases, impaired eyesight or hearing, it is still not well known what makes people feel <b>hindered</b> in daily living with more or less inability to perform ADL. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate feeling <b>hindered</b> by health problems in daily living among people (n = 958, 60 - 96 years) in relation to ADL capacity, health problems as well as social and financial resources, sense of coherence and life satisfaction. The data are taken from a baseline survey in one of the four included centres (Blekinge) of the longitudinal multicentre cohort study, The Swedish National Study on Aging and Care. The result showed that people felt <b>hindered</b> by their health problems despite no impairment in ADL capacity. Feeling greatly <b>hindered</b> by health problems was associated with factors linked to mobility but also to fatigue, no help when needed, and avoiding being outdoors due to fear of falling. Factors associated with feeling greatly <b>hindered</b> differed depending on whether people were impaired in ADL capacity or not. In people with excellent ADL capacity feeling <b>hindered</b> was associated with picking up things from the floor and rising from a chair and fatigue, whereas avoiding being outdoors, no help when needed and rising from a chair were found to be associated with feeling <b>hindered</b> by health problems among people with impaired ADL capacity. Combining people's ADL capacity with questions about feeling <b>hindered</b> may provide knowledge of determinant factors of feeling <b>hindered</b> in relation to ADL capacity, impaired or not, to identify people in need of rehabilitation or other interventions...|$|R
