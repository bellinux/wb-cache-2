40|$|The {{magnetic}} interference of vehicle imposes {{a strong influence}} on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometer.</b> Based on the mechanism of the vehicle {{magnetic interference}}, we firstly use the difference algorithm of the magnetic gradient tensor to fuse the magnetic interference of each vector magnetometer and establish a mathematical model of vehicle magnetic interference for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometer.</b> Next, we propose a compensation method for the vehicle magnetic interference and a recognition method for the estimation of compensation coefficients based on this mathematical model.

40|$|Recently, a novel Direct String <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Gradiometer</b> (DSMG) {{has been}} developed, where a {{vibrating}} wire, {{driven by an}} AC current, {{is used as a}} single sensitive element. It is designed to directly measure the local off-diagonal components of the magnetic gradient tensor, Bxz, Byz and Bxy, provided the distance to an object creating magnetic anomalies is much larger than the length of the string. This requirement is well satisfied in space, if the sensor is deployed from a satellite platform orbiting near the planet under surveillance. Current instruments operating at 1 kPa pressure achieve sensitivity of 1. 8 × 10 ^- 10 T/m in the band 0. 0001 Hz to 0. 1 Hz. In this paper we show that proposed modifications to the current gradiometer design, specifically aimed at the deployment in space, could have a magnetic gradient sensitivity better than 10 ^- 13 T/m/√(Hz) in the frequency range of interest for specific missions both for fundamental research and for such applications as geophysical exploration on Mars and other solar system planets. Also, by combining a few single-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometer</b> modules, it is possible to deploy a full tensor <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometer.</b> Comment: 17 single column pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report a {{detailed}} {{investigation of a}} number of different materials commonly used in precision instrumentation in the view of using them as critical components in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometer.</b> The materials requirement inside a <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometer</b> is stringent because the presence of magnetic susceptible material will introduce intrinsic errors into the device. Many commercial grade non-magnetic materials still have unacceptably high levels of volume magnetic susceptibility between 0. 001 and 0. 0001. It is shown here that machining with steel tools can further increase the susceptibility by up to an order of magnitude. The ability of an acid wash to remove this contamination is also reported. Washing in acid is shown to reduce the variation of volume susceptibility in several commercial grade plastics which already have low values of susceptibility. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

It is, however, worth noting that, {{the size of the}} Martian magnetosphere is determined by a pressure balance between the upstream parameters and the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>magnetic</b> field which both are in the presented simulations smaller than they were several Gyr ago.|$|R

For astatization, we use two integrated orthogonal sensors and a second-order polynomial correction; after astatization the gradiometer error is suppressed more than 1000 ×. The gradiometer has been successfully used in a real-world metal-detection task which was allowed by the low gradiometer astatization error of ±  50 nT/m and its noise of 1 nT/(m√Hz) @ 1 Hz...|$|R
50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>gradiometers</b> are {{pairs of}} magnetometers with their sensors separated, usually horizontally, by a fixed distance. The {{readings}} are subtracted {{to measure the}} difference between the sensed magnetic fields, which gives the field gradients caused by magnetic anomalies. This is one way of compensating both for the variability in time of the Earth's magnetic field and for other sources of electromagnetic interference, thus allowing for more sensitive detection of anomalies. Because nearly equal values are being subtracted, the noise performance requirements for the magnetometers is more extreme.|$|R

30|$|These {{observations}} prompt one {{to ask how}} {{the global}} <b>intrinsic</b> <b>magnetic</b> field at Mars may have affected the interaction between Martian upper atmosphere and the Solar wind.

Moreover, the role the planetary global <b>intrinsic</b> <b>magnetic</b> field plays in the planetsolar wind interactions is of a more general interest, because it is also linked to the escape of oxygen ions from Earth (see, e.g. Moore and Khazanov, 2010), as well as from Earth-like planets in our and other Solar Systems.|$|R

Within the standard model of particle physics, neutrinos will have an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>magnetic</b> moment proportional to their mass. We examine the possibility of detecting the magnetic moment using a conducting loop. According to Faraday's Law of Induction, a magnetic dipole passing through a conducting loop induces an electromotive force, or EMF, in the loop. We compute this EMF for neutrinos in several cases, based on a fully covariant formulation of the problem.

It is shown that the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>magnetic</b> moment of the Cooper pairs can be extracted from low-temperature behaviours of these measurable quantities of the current-carrying rings made of the cuprate superconductors.

30|$|The present “magnetized Mars” study where Mars {{is assumed}} to has a small <b>intrinsic</b> <b>magnetic</b> has been {{inspired}} by two important observations. First, planetary oxygen ions are currently measured in detail by the ASPERA- 3 instrument on ESA’s Mars Express (MEX) mission. The measurements have provided global maps of the spatial distribution of the non-thermally escaping planetary O+ and O 2 + ions and their energization when the solar wind accelerates planetary ions above the escape velocity (see, e.g. Barabash et al., 2007). Secondly, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) detected strong (> 1000 nT) localized magnetized regions at Mars (Acuña et al., 1998, 2001; Connerney et al., 2004) suggesting {{that in the past}} Mars may have had a strong global <b>intrinsic</b> <b>magnetic</b> dynamo which has thereafter decayed.|$|R
