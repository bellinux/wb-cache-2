After problems deploying the craft's solar array {{and with the}} automated docking systems on both Kvant-2 and Mir, the new module was docked manually on 6 December. Kvant-2 added {{a second set of}} gyrodines to Mir, and brought the new life support systems <b>for</b> <b>recycling</b> water and generating oxygen, reducing dependence on ground resupply. The module featured a large airlock with a one-metre hatch. A special backpack unit (known as Ikar), an equivalent of the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, was located inside Kvant-2's airlock.|$|E

5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash <b>for</b> <b>recycling.</b> The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E
5|$|NextWorth {{purchases}} used {{electronics and}} resells about 80-85 percent of them, while the remainder {{are sent to}} a network of partners <b>for</b> <b>recycling.</b> Many used iPhones are resold in countries where new ones are more expensive. Sellers can fill out an online form to describe the used products they want to sell, then get a quote through the website. After receiving the quote, sellers have thirty days to ship the product using a pre-paid shipping label provided by NextWorth. The company wipes the device's memory and inspects the item before sending the seller reimbursement in 3-15 days depending on the payment method. If NextWorth appraises a product at a lower condition than the seller expected, they can get an explanation from NextWorth, challenge the quote, or reject it and get the product back.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, a {{significant}} part of the world's production of cobalt blue (a dye made with cobalt compounds and alumina) and smalt (cobalt glass powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting) was carried out at the Norwegian Blaafarveværket. The first mines for the production of smalt in the 16th century were located in Norway, Sweden, Saxony and Hungary. With the discovery of cobalt ore in New Caledonia in 1864, the mining of cobalt in Europe declined. With the discovery of ore deposits in Ontario, Canada in 1904 and the discovery of even larger deposits in the Katanga Province in the Congo in 1914, the mining operations shifted again. When the Shaba conflict started in 1978, the copper mines of Katanga Province nearly stopped production. The impact on the world cobalt economy from this conflict was smaller than expected: cobalt is a rare metal, the pigment is highly toxic, and the industry had already established effective ways <b>for</b> <b>recycling</b> cobalt materials. In some cases, industry was able to change to cobalt-free alternatives.|$|E

40|$|As {{communities}} across the United States contemplate the increasing cost of municipal recycling programs, this work suggests curbside recycling programs become a public service for which residents pay a monthly fee. Using a convenience survey of residents of Tipton, Iowa this research evaluates residents’ recycling behaviors and attitudes and provides estimates of maximum willingness to pay per month <b>for</b> curbside <b>recycling</b> service. Two methods {{were used to determine}} willingness to pay <b>for</b> curbside <b>recycling,</b> a single-bound dichotomous choice referendum and an open-ended stated preference question, which provided three estimates of maximum willingness to pay per month <b>for</b> curbside <b>recycling</b> service. This work adds to the literature by evaluating recycling through a lens of ta public service and establishes a current estimate of WTP <b>for</b> curbside <b>recycling</b> in a rural Iowa community directly affected by the increased cost of recycling...|$|R

5|$|R.C. Pro-Am II was {{developed}} by Rare and published by Tradewest. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in December1992. Nintendo Power praised the game's controls and upgrade options, which made the game strategic. The magazine criticized the difficulty as unfair, with aircraft hazards that gave players no reaction time in which to dodge attacks. Nintendo Magazine System praised the game overall and its multiplayer in particular, but felt that better games were available. In 1993, GamePro said that the game was better than its predecessor, but noted that the graphics and sound could have been better. Jeuxvideo.com appreciated how the sequel's cars had better traction, but thought the game was technically unrefined considering its few advances in four years' time. For example, they criticized Rare <b>for</b> <b>recycling</b> the original game's audio. In 1994, Game Players had high praise for the game's multiplayer, screeching sound effects, vehicle handling, and replay value. They criticized its lack of in-game music and current weapon indicators, and struggled to anticipate turns in the track in the game's angled perspective.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{identifies}} twelve {{elements of}} ship recycling and highlights their respective roles and duties in a proposed ship recycling system. The source and items of knowledgebase <b>for</b> ship <b>recycling</b> {{have been brought}} out. A new philosophy focusing clean and safe ship <b>recycling</b> namely design <b>for</b> ship <b>recycling</b> has been introduced based on principles such as ecofriendliness, engineering efficiency, energy conservation and ergonomics. The role of naval architects in ship recycling industry has been described based on the above factors. The paper brings out the role of naval architects in ship recycling {{the way it has}} been practiced worldwide and proposed by regulatory bodies. The authors have brought out the new concept of design <b>for</b> ship <b>recycling</b> and various aspects of it. The role of naval architects in the practice of this new design philosophy which is ready to be embraced by the maritime industry has been reiterated. Key Words: Ship recycling, naval architect knowledgebase, design <b>for</b> ship <b>recycling...</b>|$|R
