5000|$|The {{recently}} introduced Omega 3D/Panavision 3D system also uses this technology, though {{with a wider}} spectrum and more [...] "teeth" [...] to the [...] "comb" [...] (5 for each eye in the Omega/Panavision system). The use of more spectral bands per eye eliminates the need to color process the image, required by the <b>Dolby</b> <b>system.</b> Evenly dividing the visible spectrum between the eyes gives the viewer a more relaxed [...] "feel" [...] as the light energy and color balance is nearly 50-50. Like the <b>Dolby</b> <b>system,</b> the Omega system {{can be used with}} white or silver screens. But it can be used with either film or digital projectors, unlike the Dolby filters that are only used on a digital system with a color correcting processor provided by Dolby. The Omega/Panavision system also claims that their glasses are cheaper to manufacture than those used by Dolby. In June 2012 the Omega 3D/Panavision 3D system was discontinued by DPVO Theatrical, who marketed it on behalf of Panavision, citing [...] "challenging global economic and 3D market conditions".Although DPVO dissolved its business operations, Omega Optical continues promoting and selling 3D systems to non-theatrical markets. Omega Optical’s 3D system contains projection filters and 3D glasses. In addition to the passive stereoscopic 3D system, Omega Optical has produced enhanced anaglyph 3D glasses. The Omega’s red/cyan anaglyph glasses use complex metal oxide thin film coatings and high quality annealed glass optics.|$|E
50|$|Bang & Olufsen invented and {{patented}} {{the so-called}} Dolby HX PRO (Headroom eXtension) principle for combining bias control with the <b>Dolby</b> <b>system</b> for better high-frequency response in cassette recorders. Tandberg invented the cross-field recording system for tape recorders where a separate {{head with the}} bias was used. Adding bias to the recorded signal in the one head had tended to limit the system's high-frequency response, due to interaction between bias and signal. The cross-field system produced less interference from the bias signal. This allowed extended high-frequency performance compared to mixing the two signals in the recording head, but mechanical tolerances for cross-field are tight. The system required frequent readjustment and was largely abandoned. Japanese manufacturer Akai, however, persisted with cross-field bias and successfully marketed portable and mains-operated machines featuring the cross-field system.|$|E
5000|$|Distortion is the {{alteration}} {{of the original}} shape (or other characteristic) of something. In communications and electronics it means the {{alteration of}} the waveform of an information-bearing signal, such as an audio signal representing sound or a video signal representing images, in an electronic device or communication channel. Distortion is usually unwanted, and so engineers strive to eliminate or minimize it. In some situations, however, distortion may be desirable. For example, in FM broadcasting and noise reduction systems like the <b>Dolby</b> <b>system,</b> an audio signal is deliberately distorted in ways that emphasize aspects of the signal that are subject to electrical noise, then is symmetrically [...] "undistorted" [...] after passing through a noisy communication channel, reducing the noise in the signal. Distortion is also used as a musical effect, particularly with electric guitars.|$|E

5000|$|While {{implemented}} {{in dozens of}} European and Japanese consumer device models and acoustically much superior to the Dolby B and C systems, the High Com family of systems never gained a similar market penetration. This was caused by several factors, including the existing pre-dominance of the <b>Dolby</b> <b>system,</b> with Dolby Laboratories introducing the [...] "good enough" [...] Dolby C update (with up to 15 dB A-weighted improvement) around 1980 as well, and also {{by the fact that}} High&thinsp;Com required higher quality tape decks and tapes to work with in order to give satisfactory results.High&thinsp;Com II even required calibration of the playback level using a 400 Hz calibration tone for optimum results, and with prices in the several hundred dollars for the external Nakamichi compander box it was much too expensive to be used by many people outside the small group of audiophiles using high-end tape recorders or open-reel decks.When AEG-Telefunken struggled financially in 1981/1982 and the Hannover development site was partially disbanded and refocused on digital technologies in 1983, this also put the High&thinsp;Com development to an end. The latest tape decks to come with High&thinsp;Com were produced around 1986.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 70s {{there was also}} the German Telefunken-made HighCom NR system, a {{broadband}} compander, which was technically very advanced and reached a signal-to-noise ratio in the range of a CD (approximately 100 dB). That was a gain in dynamics of roughly 25 dB that outperformed the well-known Dolby B by far. HighCom was included in more sophisticated cassette recorders, mostly alongside the various <b>Dolby</b> <b>systems.</b> Even though this applied to the consumer market, there was no tape hiss at all that an ear could realize. Another advantage was that recorded tapes could be exchanged amongst HighCom recorders without any loss of quality in sound. The [...] "pumping effect" [...] mostly reported from critical sound material (e.g. drums or any percussive instrument) with advanced dbx NR which was also a serious competitor did not show in properly calibrated HighCom recordings. HighCom was utilized in professional recording studios and (German) radio stations in its professional versions HighCom II and HighCom III. It was licensed by Nakamichi around 1980 but did not penetrate the market, possibly due to the less aggressive marketing strategies typical for German companies at that time compared to the widely known <b>Dolby</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electronic noise {{reduction}} techniques were also developed {{to increase the}} signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range of analog sound recordings. Dolby {{noise reduction}} includes a suite of standards (designated A, B, C, S and SR) for both professional and consumer recording. The <b>Dolby</b> <b>systems</b> use frequency dependent compression/expansion (companding) during the recording/playback, respectively. DBX is another noise reduction system that uses a more aggressive companding technique to improve both dynamic range and noise level. However, DBX recordings do not sound acceptable when played on non-DBX equipment.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1970s, {{advances}} in solid-state electronics made {{the design and}} marketing of more sophisticated analog circuitry economically feasible. This led {{to a number of}} attempts to reduce tape hiss through the use of various forms of volume compression and expansion, the most notable and commercially successful being several <b>systems</b> developed by <b>Dolby</b> Laboratories. These <b>systems</b> divided the frequency spectrum into several bands and applied volume compression/expansion independently to each band (Engineers now often use the term [...] "compansion" [...] to refer to this process). The <b>Dolby</b> <b>systems</b> were very successful at increasing the effective dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio of analog audio recording; to all intents and purposes, audible tape hiss could be eliminated. The original Dolby A was only used in professional recording. Successors found use in both professional and consumer formats; Dolby B became almost universal for prerecorded music on cassette. Subsequent forms, including Dolby C, (and the short-lived Dolby S) were developed for home use.|$|R

50|$|While {{there are}} dozens of {{different}} kinds of noise reduction, the first widely used audio noise reduction technique was developed by Ray Dolby in 1966. Intended for professional use, Dolby Type A was an encode/decode system in which the amplitude of frequencies in four bands was increased during recording (encoding), then decreased proportionately during playback (decoding). The <b>Dolby</b> B <b>system</b> (developed in conjunction with Henry Kloss) was a single band system designed for consumer products. In particular, when recording quiet parts of an audio signal, the frequencies above 1 kHz would be boosted. This had the effect of increasing the signal to noise ratio on tape up to 10 dB depending on the initial signal volume. When it was played back, the decoder reversed the process, in effect reducing the noise level by up to 10 dB. The <b>Dolby</b> B <b>system,</b> while not as effective as Dolby A, had the advantage of remaining listenable on playback systems without a decoder.|$|R

50|$|A <b>Dolby</b> noise-{{reduction}} <b>system,</b> or <b>Dolby</b> NR, {{is one of}} {{a series}} of noise reduction <b>systems</b> developed by <b>Dolby</b> Laboratories for use in analog magnetic tape recording. The first was Dolby A, a professional broadband noise reduction for recording studios in 1965, but the best-known is Dolby B (introduced 1968), a sliding band system for the consumer market, which helped make high fidelity practical on cassette tapes which used a relatively noisy tape size and speed. It is common on high fidelity stereo tape players and recorders to the present day. Of the noise reduction <b>systems,</b> <b>Dolby</b> A and Dolby SR were developed for professional use. Dolby B, C, and S were designed for the consumer market. Aside from Dolby HX, all the Dolby variants work by companding, or compressing the dynamic range of the sound during recording and expanding it during playback.|$|R
