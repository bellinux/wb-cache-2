2500|$|In {{a bid to}} {{put down}} the Missouri guerrilla raiders {{operating}} in Kansas, General Thomas Ewing, Jr. issued in April 1863 [...] "General Order No. 10," [...] which ordered the arrest of anyone giving aid or comfort to Confederate guerrillas. This meant chiefly women or girls who were relatives of the guerrillas. Ewing confined those arrested in a series of makeshift prisons in Kansas City. The women were sequentially housed in two buildings which were considered either too small or too unsanitary, before being moved to an empty property at 1425 Grand. This structure was part of the <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> Robert S. Thomas, George Caleb Bingham's father-in-law. In 1861 Bingham and his family were living in the structure, but in early 1862 after being appointed treasurer of the state of Missouri, he and his family relocated to Jefferson City.

2500|$|Edmund Rice was {{particularly}} successful {{in his own}} real estate transactions. [...] After selling his [...] of land and homestead near the Sudbury meetinghouse on 1 September 1642 to John Moore, Rice established his residence on 13 September 1642 on his 20 acres of land abutting [...] Henry Dunster's farm near the Old Connecticut Path in southeastern Sudbury. Within a year, Philemon Whale and Thomas Axtell, former town mates and kin from Berkhamstead, England established their homesteads on adjacent lots nearby. [...] In October 1643 Rice sold Philemon Whale [...] of land and a house near the Old Connecticut Path in southern Sudbury and also that same month he sold [...] of adjacent land to Thomas Axtell. [...] But only three years later on 6 May 1646, Rice, along with his son Edward Rice and Philemon Whale, administered the <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> Thomas Axtell and he purchased back the land from the estate shortly thereafter. On 8 April 1657, Rice purchased the [...] "Jennison Farm" [...] in the southeastern part of Sudbury. And by 1659, Rice had acquired about [...] of land in southeastern Sudbury (present day Wayland and Cochituate), including nine acres of land and the homestead purchased back from Philemon Whale (see image of the homestead), and the probated estate of Henry Dunster that included the former Glover family lands. The General Court made grants of land to Rice {{in what is now}} Framingham, [...] in 1652 and [...] in 1659. These lands in Framingham were passed on to Rice's son Henry in 1659, and became to be known as Rice's End.|$|E

[...] Sumner Chilton Powell wrote in his 1964 Pulitzer Prize-winning , [...] "Not only did Rice become the largest {{individual}} landholder in Sudbury, but he represented his new town in the Massachusetts legislature for five years and devoted at least eleven of his last fifteen years to serving as selectman and judge of small causes." [...] He was appointed on 4 September 1639 by the General Court to lay out the roads and lots of Sudbury, and he was granted [...] of land near the original Sudbury meetinghouse [...] On 3 April 1640, Rice was granted [...] in southeastern Sudbury near the Old Connecticut Path. [...] He served as a selectman in Sudbury in 1639 and 1640, and subsequently for several years between 1644 and 1656. [...] He was designated a freeman on 13 May 1640, and was first elected as a deputy (representative) of the Great and General Court in October 1640. [...] He was later appointed by the General Court on 2 June 1641 as a Judge of Small Causes for Sudbury, serving until 1648 in the appointed position. [...] Then from 1648 until 1654 he was elected and reelected locally in Sudbury as one of the municipal judges. [...] He was reelected for another year term as a deputy of the General Court in 1643. In 1644 Rice and two other Sudbury residents (Peter Noyes and Thomas Mayhew) were appointed to survey the farm properties of the <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> Joseph Glover near the southeastern boundary of Sudbury to be transferred to Harvard College President Henry Dunster who had married Glover's widow Elizabeth and assumed responsibility for the Glover children. [...] On 18 June 1645, Rice and his colleagues reported to the General Court on their survey. [...] In 1648, Rice was ordained as a Deacon in the [...] Puritan Church at Sudbury. [...] He was appointed by the General Court on 22 May 1651 {{as a member of a}} commission to settle a boundary dispute between Watertown and Sudbury, and he was reelected as a deputy of the General Court in each of the three years from 1652 through 1654. [...] Again in May 1656, Rice and Peter Noyes were called upon by the General Court for their expertise to survey [...] of land purchased by John Stone of Sudbury from the Indians, which was supplemented by a grant of the General Court to Stone of an additional [...] in what is now Framingham. Stone erected a gristmill on his property of Stone's End in 1656 that would later become the village of Saxonville. [...] And again in 1662 at the behest of the General Court, Rice and John Howe of Marlborough were called upon to survey [...] of land in the area now known as Framingham that they deemed to be worth £10 to be awarded by the General Court to Thomas Danforth as compensation for his services to the Colony and Harvard College.|$|E

60|$|When Glossin {{returned}} home he found, among other letters and papers sent to him, one of considerable importance. It {{was signed by}} Mr. Protocol, an attorney in Edinburgh, and, addressing him as the agent for Godfrey Bertram, Esq., late of Ellangowan, and his representatives, acquainted him with {{the sudden death of}} Mrs. Margaret Bertram of Singleside, requesting him to inform his clients thereof, in case they should judge it proper to have any person present for their interest at opening the repositories of the deceased. Mr. Glossin perceived at once that the letter-writer was unacquainted with the breach which had taken place between him and his late patron. The <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> lady should by rights, as he well knew, descend to Lucy Bertram; but it was a thousand to one that the caprice of the old lady might have altered its destination. After running over contingencies and probabilities in his fertile mind, to ascertain what sort of personal advantage might accrue to him from this incident, he could not perceive any mode of availing himself of it, except in so far as it might go to assist his plan of recovering, or rather creating, a character, the want of which he had already experienced, and was likely to feel yet more deeply. 'I must place myself,' he thought, 'on strong ground, that, if anything goes wrong with Dirk Hatteraick's project, I may have prepossessions in my favour at least.' Besides, to do Glossin justice, bad as he was, he might feel some desire to compensate to Miss Bertram in a small degree, and in a case in which his own interest did not interfere with hers, the infinite mischief which he had occasioned to her family. He therefore resolved early the next morning to ride over to Woodbourne.|$|E

For basic explanation <b>of</b> its topic <b>the</b> thesis is prefaced by chapters about the patronage in general and <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> Němčice and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local parish. Basic spheres <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patronage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Schwarzenberg family over parishes in their manors (on <b>the</b> example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parish <b>of</b> Němčice) are presented after that. This thesis studies <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> patronage primarily {{with respect to the}} administration.

5000|$|On <b>the</b> {{south side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east wall, {{there is an}} {{agricultural}} scene. Nakht is shown overseeing men who are ploughing, sowing and harvesting the fields. <b>The</b> scenes <b>of</b> agriculture may show <b>the</b> continuation <b>of</b> Nakht’s life in <b>the</b> Field <b>of</b> Reeds. However, as suggested by Noblecourt, these scenes may metaphorically show an eternal life through <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> farming, through <b>the</b> seasons. [...] If Noblecourt’s view is accurate, then the scenes are {{different from that of}} Old Kingdom mastabas, where any agricultural scenes were designed primarily as a means <b>of</b> magically ensuring <b>the</b> continuity <b>of</b> farming on <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased,</b> thereby allowing sustenance for their ka. On <b>the</b> north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> west wall, Nakht is shown in a further frequently depicted scene: the fishing and fowling scene. This type of scene is also commonly found in New Kingdom, and although they were not uncommon in Old Kingdom mastabas, within the latter their primary purpose was to provide magical sustenance for the dead. In <b>the</b> tomb <b>of</b> Nakht, he is shown spearing fish and fowl, together with his family. Davies (1917:66) suggests that [...] "sustenance…was not always coaxed from the soil by severe labor sic", indicating that this scene was used to show a form of receiving food after death in a different way, for entertainment for <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> and for an artistic change of genre. However, there is a different interpretation that they were, like banquet scenes, depicted to show an image of potency and creativity after death as some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equipment is similar and [...] "the women present…wear outfits similar to that worn for a banquet".|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LL. M.

It appears that a divorced spouse is in certain circumstances {{in a better position}} than the surviving spouse - a position that appears to be unsatisfactory. The Act brought about an improvement for the surviving spouse who has been disinherited or for whom there has not been sufficiently catered for where there is in fact a need for maintenance. <b>The</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act is based on the need for maintenance by the surviving spouse. It is clear from the Act that the executor has the power to enter into agreements with the surviving spouse, heirs and legatees in terms of which assets may be transferred contrary to <b>the</b> will <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased.</b> His assets may be transferred to a trust or the assets may be burdened by certain restrictive rights imposed on them in which case the beneficiary and heir's rights to deal with them are limited. <b>The</b> claim <b>of</b> a surviving spouse ranks concurrent with <b>the</b> claim <b>of</b> minor children for maintenance but does not compete with a claim by creditors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate.</b> Estate planners must at all times keep <b>the</b> will <b>of</b> <b>the</b> testator in mind.
