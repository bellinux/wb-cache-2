5000|$|A {{plate and}} frame filter press {{is the most}} {{fundamental}} design, and many now refer it as a [...] "membrane filter plate". This type of filter press consists of many plates and frames assembled alternately with the supports of a pair of rails. The presence of a centrifuge pump ensures the remaining suspended solids do not settle in the system, and its main function is to deliver the suspension into each of the separating chambers in the {{plate and frame filter}}. For each of the individual separating chambers, there is one hollow <b>filter</b> <b>frame</b> separated from two filter plates by filter cloths. The introduced slurry flows through a port in each individual frame, and the filter cakes are accumulated in each hollow frame. As the filter cake becomes thicker, the filter resistance increases as well. So when the separating chamber is full, the filtration process is stopped as the optimum pressure difference is reached. The filtrate that passes through filter cloth is collected through collection pipes and stored in the filter tank. Filter cake (suspended solid) accumulation occurs at the hollow plate frame, then being separated at the filter plates by pulling the plate and frame filter press apart. The cakes then fall off from those plates and are discharged to the final collection point.|$|E

When {{tracking}} {{a moving}} human target,the traditional particle filter algorithm based on color characteristic can't get accurate results {{in situations like}} complicated background or frequent brightness change.

40|$|Recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have re-ignited {{debates on}} how to prevent and manage {{psychological}} injury among returning troops. These debates point to the psychological cost of war as a grand challenge whose scale and complexity stretch far beyond the already large and growing number of veterans affected. We use a unique ethnography of a military medical team's {{tour of duty in}} Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, to explore the role of institutional context as a contributing factor to psychological injury from war. We find that exposure to war and its consequences invokes sustained experiences of senselessness, futility, and surreality that are partially rooted in cultural expectations, professional role identity, and organizational protocol, and can threaten people's existential grounding in this institutional context. We argue that what makes work at war traumatic for some and not others is likely affected by the specific context through which people <b>filter,</b> <b>frame,</b> and cope with, their experience. A contextual understanding of psychological injury at war that is based in organizational research can thus form an important part of better addressing this grand challenge...|$|E

Indeed, it is frequently suggested {{that one of the}} most exciting possibilities for publishing in the era of the internet is the ability to create and disseminate radical new forms of work that it simply was impossible to create in the time of print.

Current commentators, with a utopian naivety, often overlook the fact that existing infrastructures and business models are inadequate for the publication of work that does not attempt just to replicate paper-based structures in a digital world.

First, we will adopt stereo vision-basedfeature identification to solve the SLAM problem. The suggested algorithm will use only astereo vision without any other traditional odometry information for executing the SLAMalgorithm. The stereo-vision camera (robot) motion estimation and incremental map building(from new landmarks) will be computed within a standard extended Kalman <b>filter</b> <b>frame</b> work. Researches about feature matching and disparity estimation will also be conducted fordeveloping an efficient feature identification method. Next, we will propose a fuzzy local pathplanning method based on fuzzy decision-making theory. The local path planning strategywill be designed for an omni-directional robot for choosing its way to avoid obstacles whenexecuting the SLAM algorithm. To be real-time implementable, we will write a C++ programwith graphical user interface (GUI) [33]. In which, we will use some library such as OpenGLfor graphical object [32], OpenCV for image processing, and some subroutines fromSceneLib [12].

A relative stabilization of filtration velocity, venting efficiency and wine lightening were experimentally confirmed during contacts with oscillation waves of ultrasonic transmitter on the ceramic filter. Which significantly reduced the cost of various preservatives to increase periods storage. To study the processes of wine processing by the proposed method it was made an experimental installation on the basis of pilot machine MRp- 1 / 2 for bottling of quiet liquids and an ultrasonic device "Volna– M" UZTA- 1 / 22 -OM with a firmly, waveguide which transmits sound, fixed <b>filter</b> <b>frame</b> on the ultrasound emitter. To stabilize the performance of ultrasonic units with ceramic membrane elements without quality deterioration of wines it was empirically determined rational parameters of power of ultrasound input and pressure in the system. The given derived dependencies and graphs allow to define the time of relatively stable operating filter regime. It was revealed a significant cost reduction on filtration, as it allows escape from the contamination of the product by various preservatives, and increasing of storage duration in a sealed container during aseptic filling without a thermal sterilization. Ultrasonic emitter contact by superposition wave vibrations on the ceramic filter increases not only the efficiency of gas removal, but also improves the organoleptic characteristics, stabilizes the filters, improves their productivity. Gas removal creates unfavorable conditions for development of the yeast, which in turn increases the shelf life of semisweet wine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: GSC 3203 - 0780 is {{identified}} as an eclipsing binary for the first time. Nine timings of primary and secondary minima were obtained. The well-defined and sharp begin and end of minima imply that GSC 3203 - 0780 is an EA-type binary with a period P= 0. d 824846. During the observation of DE Lac, a high-amplitude δ Scuti star, GSC 3203 - 0780 was {{within the field of}} view, which was found to be variable. Follow-up observations in 2008 and 2009 provides first indication on the type of light curve morphology. The star is lo-cated at α 2000 = 22 h 11 m 33. s 4, δ 2000 =+ 40 ◦ 41 ′ 51. ′′ 3 and is also identified as USNO-B 1. 0 1306 - 0470210 and N 2 X 8000197 (GSC 2. 3). In GSC 2. 3 the magnitude of the V photographic band is listed as V= 13. m 90. First photometric observations of the eclipsing binary GSC 3203 - 0780 were carried out over three nights in 2008 and 2009 with a SBIG ST 10 XME CCD camera and IR cut-off filter attached at a 60 mm (2. 4 inch) f/ 11. 7 refractor. The effective field of view of the CCD photometric system is about 73 ′x 49 ′and the size of each pixel is 2. 0 ′′x 2. 0 ′′.
