5|$|Barnes was rested as Bradman’s men {{defeated}} Warwickshire by nine wickets. He {{returned as}} the tourists faced and drew with Lancashire {{for the second}} time on tour. Barnes top-scored in the first innings with 67, putting on an opening stand of 123 with Morris as Australia made 321. He continued his productivity with 90 in the second innings, adding 161 for the second-wicket with Bradman. The home side managed to hang on for a draw, seven wickets <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> second innings. Barnes was then rested for the non-first-class match against Durham, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. Australia made 282 and had the hosts at 5/73 in reply when rain washed out the match after the first day.|$|E
5|$|Despite these raids, the war's outcome {{had become}} apparent. Defections of ZNDH {{personnel}} and aircraft to the Allies and Partisans intensified, including two Bf 109s to Italy on 16 April and a further two Messerschmitts to the Partisans in Mostar on 20 April. The last fighter delivery {{took place on}} 23 April 1945. It was also on this day that the final Croatian kills were scored when an ex-HZL 16-kill ace and his wingman claimed two RAF P-51 Mustangs shot <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> Bf 109Gs, {{one of which was}} confirmed. The last attack mission was flown on 6 May, when two antiquated Rogožarski R-100 fighter trainers bombed the railway bridge over the Kupa in an effort to stop the Partisan advance on Karlovac, south of Zagreb. One of the Yugoslav-built parasol wing aircraft was hit by ground fire and the pilot crash-landed near his target. He was captured and shot on the spot.|$|E
5|$|Woodfull {{started his}} final English {{campaign}} slowly. In his first eight innings, he scored only 161 runs at 20.12 with one half-century. Other players sensed that Woodfull had become less cheerful following the bodyline series and {{he offered to}} drop himself following his run of poor form, but fellow selectors Bradman and Alan Kippax disagreed. In the traditional Test rehearsal against the MCC, Australia reduced the hosts to be eight <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> second innings, still in arrears when the match ended in a draw. In his final innings before the Tests, Woodfull struck form with 172 not out against Lancashire.|$|E

5|$|However, South Vietnamese {{officers}} were often reluctant to absorb heavy casualties. On several occasions, Cao's forces {{were in an}} excellent position to trap and wipe out whole battalions of Viet Cong, but he would fail to close the trap on one pretext or another and allow the enemy to escape. This behavior initially mystified Vann, who was attempting to build Cao into an aggressive commander. Unknown to Vann, Diem would reprimand or demote any officer who lost too many men, no matter how successful the operation. Diem {{was more interested in}} using the military to protect his regime than to take on the Viet Cong. His solution was to fill the ARVN with Catholic political cronies and friends like Cao, Lê Quang Tung, and Tôn Thất Đính, who had little military ability, but were very likely to help stop a coup attempt. After a skirmish on a highway that resulted in a small number of South Vietnamese casualties along with several trucks destroyed, Cao was called to Saigon and reprimanded by Diem. Upon his return, Vann and his group of advisers were forced to end the joint planning sessions that had been so successful earlier, and action essentially wound <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> region. Cao used the excellent military intelligence network they had developed to find areas devoid of the Viet Cong, and planned operations only in those areas. In many other cases, operations were executed on paper only, in order to report an increasing tempo of operations that did not actually exist.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon kings {{built up}} a set of written laws, issued either as {{statutes}} or codes, but these laws were never written <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> entirety and were always supplemented by an extensive oral tradition of customary law. In {{the early part of}} the period local assemblies called moots were gathered to apply the laws to particular cases; in the 10th century these were replaced by hundred courts, serving local areas, and shire moots dealing with larger regions of the kingdom. Many churchmen and thegns were also given permission by the king to hold their own local courts. The legal system depended on a system of oaths, in which the value of different individuals swearing on behalf of the plaintiff or defendant varied according to their social status - the word of a companion of the king, for example, was worth twelve times that of a churl. If fines were imposed, their size similarly varied accord to the oath-value of the individual. The Anglo-Saxon authorities struggled to deal with the bloodfeuds between families that emerged following violent killings, attempting to use a system of weregild, a payment of blood money, as a way of providing an alternative to long-running vendettas.|$|E

25|$|By mid-2011, the Indian cricket {{team was}} enjoying {{unprecedented}} success, winning the 2011 Cricket World Cup held at home, while also being the No. 1 Test team, {{which they had}} achieved in 2009. They proved to be undefeatable at home as always, but also enjoyed success away, especially beyond the subcontinent such as in South Africa in late 2010, where {{for the first time}} ever, the Indian cricket team did not lose a Test series there. The team, led by wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni, was widely praised by media and former cricketers, and Dhoni's captaincy was also considered by some experts {{to be one of the}} reasons for India's success. However, this success was turned upside <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> tour to England in 2011. It was widely expected that India would win the Test and ODI series there, by light of their recent success. However, their weaknesses in their bowling and batting were completely exposed by the Englishmen and they lost all the 4 Tests, losing their No. 1 Test status to England. Despite the debacle in England, it was widely expected that India would retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after the series in Australia, as the team's previous 2 tours Down Under were ok with achieving 2 test victories and that the Australian cricket team was now quite weak. Also the nucleus of the Indian side selected for the tour had a number of players who had a good record in Australia. India had most recently won a five-match ODI home series against England 5–0 in October and a three-Test home series against the West Indies 2–0 in November, further improving expectations.|$|E
25|$|Even {{a return}} to RFK Stadium {{was not enough to}} cure {{whatever}} had been ailing United over the last 2 or 3 months of league play. United fell behind 2–0 against Columbus, but an attempt at a late rally came up short. A penalty kick by Rolfe put United on the scoreboard. Later, Saborio appeared to have tied the score in the 84th minute, off a through pass by Pontius, but the Costa Rican was controversially ruled offside. The result vaulted the Crew {{to the top of the}} standings in the Eastern Conference, while United slipped to 4th place. With dreams of MLS hardware slipping away, D.C. United still had top position in CONCACAF Champions League group play, which the team locked <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> final group match of 2015, a 3–3 draw in Jamaica, against Montego Bay United. The Jamaican side jumped out to an early lead when a quick restart caught out a really makeshift D.C. defense, that included Aguilar making his first start as a fullback, and Jalen Robinson making his first start as a center back. That goal was Montego Bay's first ever tally in CCL play. The home side extended the lead 3 minutes later and took what appeared to be a commanding 3-0 lead early in the second half on a penalty kick, after a phantom foul call against midfielder Jared Jeffrey. D.C. however rallied, with goals by Arrieta and Opare, and earned a draw and a point, when Michael Farfan collected a loose ball deep into stoppage time and aimed his shot into the top corner of the goal. The draw was the first CCL group match that D.C. United didn't win over the last two entries into CONCACAF play, but it did extend their CCL group play unbeaten streak to 8 games and left the team with 10 points, waiting to learn their seeding and knockout round opponent when Champions League play resumes in 2016.|$|E

When Will goes to the country on his vacation he leaves the latchkey of his apartment with his chum, telling him to make himself at home.

May and Belle, two pretty girls who are in business, decide to try their hand at housekeeping. They rent Will's apartment and settle <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> new quarters. John decides to take advantage of his friend's invitation and make use of his rooms. He lets himself in with the latchkey, and is amazed to find the two girls sound asleep. Believing him to be a burglar the girls threaten him with annihilation. John thinks the joke too good to spoil, so does not try to square himself, but pleads for mercy. May secures his promise that he will never 'burgle' again, and allows him to escape. Unknown to John, May has been engaged by his partner as a typist, and when she enters the office the following morning and finds John opening the safe, she decides that once again her burglar has been caught red-handed. She calls for help, and is greatly chagrined when her supposed burglar is introduced as her employer. Amid explanations, the 'burglar' and the lady shake hands and become good friends." ...|$|E
