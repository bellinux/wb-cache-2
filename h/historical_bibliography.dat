40|$|Perhaps {{more than}} any other form of scholarship, <b>historical</b> <b>bibliographies</b> {{regularly}} force their compilers to confront, and correct, their own errors of omission and commission. Taking the discovery of two small mistakes in Bibliography of Early American Law as its point of departure, this article pays tribute to BEAL as an exemplar of a scholarly genre that is at once inescapably accountable, limitlessly collaborative, and profoundly democratic. ¶ 1 In December 1998, shortly after the publication of the Bibliography of Early American Law (also known, for short, by its acronym, BEAL, or, alternately, by its author’s last name, Cohen), 1 I was preparing to visit my parents in New Haven for the holidays and, at the last minute, went to an antiquarian bookshop in Worcester, Massachusetts, to look for a present for my father. I found and purchased two nineteenth-century formbooks, examples of a popular genre of self-help manual designed to provide both lawyers and laypeople with the correct boilerplate for a variety of legal forms—deeds, wills, licenses, and so forth. The earlier volume was the first edition of Practical Forms, compiled by Judge Asa Aikens and published i...|$|R

Following the pattern of Father Jacques Lelong's Bibliothèque historique de la France (1719), Warmholtz prepared a large bibliography of prints and manuscripts concerning Sweden printed as Bibliotheca historica sueo-gothica; eller förtekning uppå så väl trykte, som handskrifne böcker, tractater och skrifter, hvilka handla om svenska historien, eller därutinnan kunna gifva ljus; med critiska och historiska anmärkningar of Swedish history, a listing of manuscripts, printed books, treatises and writings on Swedish history (15 volumes, 1782-1817, reprinted Copenhagen 1966-68), including 9,744 works of importance. Warmholtz's numbering of the books and prints is still in use in Swedish scholarly studies and on the antiquarian market, as {{there is still no}} Swedish national bibliography for the period 1700-1830.
