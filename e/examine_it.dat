5|$|It {{is one of}} {{very few}} {{manuscript}}s of Wulfilas Gothic Bible. The manuscript is fragmentary. The four leaves of the codex were used as raw material {{for the production of}} another manuscript – Codex Guelferbytanus 64 Weissenburgensis. It is a palimpsest, and its text was reconstructed several times. Franz Anton Knittel was the first to <b>examine</b> <b>it</b> and decipher its text.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} the proof, let's <b>examine</b> <b>it</b> {{for the specific}} case when X is countably infinite. Without loss of generality, we may take X = ℕ = {1, 2, 3,...}, the set of natural numbers.|$|E
25|$|A {{criminal}} investigation was begun by an investigating magistrate in Salamá, Baja Verapaz, and, on 8 June 1994, the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Team (EAFG) began examining the clandestine graves in the community. Two months later, the forensic anthropologists had exhumed {{a total of}} 84 corpses from 21 graves. An additional grave site was identified during the field work and, once the legal formalities had been met, the EAFG was able to <b>examine</b> <b>it,</b> and exhume four sets of human remains, in August 1996.|$|E

25|$|In the {{recording}} system, {{each time a}} land title transaction takes place, the parties record the transfer instrument with a local government recorder located in the jurisdiction (usually the county) where the land lies. The government indexes the instrument by {{the names of the}} grantor (transferor) and the grantee (transferee) and photographs it so any member of the public can find and <b>examine</b> <b>it.</b> If such a transaction goes unrecorded for any reason or length of time, an unscrupulous grantor could sell the property to another grantee. In many states, the grantee whose transaction is recorded first becomes the legal owner, and any other would-be buyers are left without recourse..|$|E
25|$|In 1900, President Julio A. Roca {{ordered a}} new edition that {{eliminated}} the articles revoked by the Civil Marriage Law and introduced the new dispositions without altering the numbering of the non-modified articles. At {{the end of the}} task, the project was sent to the national government, who in turn passed it to the Faculty of Law of the University of Buenos Aires to <b>examine</b> <b>it.</b> The Faculty designated a commission, who after the investigation determined that the project introduced reforms in the law doctrine. After asking for a competence extension, the Commission proposed this modifications in 1903, although the project was never dealt with by the Congress.|$|E
25|$|Before any of {{us could}} rise to <b>examine</b> <b>it,</b> four more lights {{appeared}} almost simultaneously, about the same shape, and varying only in size. Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more like a little image carved out of black shining wood, than anything else I can liken them to. Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence. As {{for me and my}} companions, we were so awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, that we could not move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about in a sort of wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E

25|$|Under the unicameral {{procedure}} (which is {{used every}} time the Constitution {{does not require a}} special procedure), bills can be adopted by a vote of the Chamber of Deputies. At that point, the approved bill is sent to the Senate, which has 10 days to decide whether to <b>examine</b> <b>it</b> to propose changes, or let it be enacted without modification. If one-third of the senators ask to review the bill, the Senate has 30 days to formulate amendments and send the bill back to the Chamber of Deputies. Then the deputies will take the final decision on the Senate's proposals and on the bill as a whole. No further approval of the Senate is needed, but a qualified majority might be required to overcome the Senate's veto for laws adopted under the supremacy clause.|$|E
25|$|The {{documentary}} featured {{one notable}} {{change from the}} UFO Files story – Tim Oates, grandson of Brawley Oates and the now-owner of the property with the sealed well where the UFO wreckage was purportedly buried, allowed the investigators to unseal the well, in order to <b>examine</b> <b>it</b> for possible debris. Water {{was taken from the}} well which tested normal except for large amounts of aluminum present; the well had no significant contents. It was stated in the episode that any large pieces of metal had been removed from the well by a past owner of the property. Further, the remains of a windmill base were found near the well site, which refuted Ms. Pegues' statements (from the 1979 Time magazine article) that Judge Proctor never had a windmill on his property.|$|E
25|$|In January 1958, the Aleppo Codex was smuggled out of Syria {{and sent}} to Jerusalem {{to be placed in}} the care of the chief rabbi of the Aleppo Jews. But by the {{influence}} of then President of Israel, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, it was secretly taken by the government. In the late 1980s, the codex was placed in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum. This finally gave scholars the chance to <b>examine</b> <b>it</b> and consider the claims that it is indeed the manuscript referred to by Maimonides. The work of Moshe Goshen-Gottstein on the few surviving pages of the Torah seems to have confirmed these claims beyond reasonable doubt. Goshen-Gottstein suggested (in the introduction to his facsimile reprint of the codex) that not only was it the oldest known masoretic Bible in a single volume, {{it was the first time}} ever that a complete Tanakh had been produced by one or two people as a unified entity in a consistent style.|$|E

500|$|After Crash Bandicoot defeats Doctor Neo Cortex and rescues {{his girlfriend}} Tawna, Cortex falls from his lair down towards the Earth, his maniacal bid for world {{domination}} thwarted. After his crash, Cortex awakens {{in a dark}} cavern filled with glowing crystals. Convinced that they hold tremendous power, Cortex takes one and returns to his laboratory to <b>examine</b> <b>it.</b> He discovers that the planets will soon align, creating a catastrophic solar flux that threatens to destroy Earth itself. Learning that the crystals are {{the only means of}} containing this force, Cortex enlists the aid of his old colleague Doctor N. Gin and they design a new, upgraded, crystal-powered [...] "Cortex Vortex" [...] to capture the stellar energy. Realizing they need 25 more crystals to power the device, Cortex devises a plot to manipulate Crash into retrieving the crystals for him.|$|E
500|$|While Joe {{engages the}} robots with his {{modified}} Curtiss P-40 pursuit fighter, Perkins {{photographs from the}} street {{with little regard for}} her personal safety. He eventually manages to disable one robot; the rest leave thereafter. News reports show similar attacks around the globe. The disabled robot is taken back to the Legion's air base so that technology expert Dex can <b>examine</b> <b>it.</b> Polly follows and [...] reluctantly convinces Joe to let her in on the investigation. Her information takes them to the ransacked laboratory of a dying Dr. Jennings, while an assassin escapes. Just before he dies, Jennings gives Polly the two vials and states that they are crucial to Totenkopf's plans. Polly hides the vials and withholds the information from Joe. They return to the Legion's base just before it comes under attack from squadrons of ornithopter drones. Dex tacks the origin of the signal on a part of a map before his capture.|$|E
500|$|That summer, Prokofiev {{completed}} the Divertimento, Op. 43 (which {{he had started}} in 1925) and revised his Sinfonietta, Op. 5/48, a work started in his days at the Conservatory. In October that year, he had a car crash while driving his family back to Paris from their holiday: as the car turned over, Prokofiev pulled some muscles on his left hand. Prokofiev was therefore unable to perform in Moscow during his tour shortly after the accident, but {{he was able to}} enjoy watching performances of his music from the audience. Prokofiev also attended the Bolshoi Theatre's [...] "audition" [...] of his ballet Le pas d'acier, and was interrogated by members of the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM) about the work: he was asked whether the factory portrayed [...] "a capitalist factory, where the worker is a slave, or a Soviet factory, where the worker is the master? If it is a Soviet factory, when and where did Prokofiev <b>examine</b> <b>it,</b> since from 1918 to the present he has been living abroad and came {{here for the first time}} in 1927 for two weeks ?" [...] Prokofiev replied, [...] "That concerns politics, not music, and therefore I won't answer." [...] The RAPM condemned the ballet as a [...] "flat and vulgar anti-Soviet anecdote, a counter-revolutionary composition bordering on Fascism". The Bolshoi had no option but to reject the ballet.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the easiest}} ways of [...] "making sense" [...] of the delayed-choice paradox is to <b>examine</b> <b>it</b> using Bohmian mechanics. The {{surprising}} implications of the original delayed-choice experiment led Wheeler {{to the conclusion that}} [...] "no phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon", which is a very radical position. Wheeler famously said that the [...] "past has no existence except as recorded in the present", and that the Universe does not [...] "exist, out there independent of all acts of observation".|$|E

Even today such procedures have not been widely adopted, although, since clerical costs are increasing at a faster rate than are factory costs, such control has much greater significance at the present time than it had in the early 1920s." ...|$|E
