5|$|Mercury {{was used}} inside wobbler lures. <b>Its</b> <b>heavy,</b> liquid form made it useful since the lures made an {{attractive}} irregular movement when the mercury moved inside the plug.

High winds downed numerous power lines, leaving many without power {{for up to}} two weeks after the storm.

Overall, Hurricane David was responsible for minor damage and two casualties from <b>its</b> <b>heavy</b> surf.|$|E

Power outages spurred by Odile's intense winds and rain cut electricity to 92%of the population of Baja California Sur. Severe flooding also occurred, causing rivers to swell and the mass evacuation {{of people out of}} hazardous low-lying areas. The remnants of Odile brought rains and unseasonably powerful thunderstorms to the southwestern United States. In total, Odile led to the deaths of 18people throughout its nine-day existence.|$|E
