5|$|In any event, the {{molluscs}} and scavengers did not consume everything organic. Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in the debris field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood {{that seems to have}} resisted the borers. The First Class reception area off the ships Grand Staircase is still remarkably intact and furniture is still visible among the debris on the floor. Although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress is still on the bed, with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains. According to Charles Pellegrino, who dived on Titanic in 2001, a <b>finger</b> <b>bone</b> encircled by the partial remains of a wedding ring was found concreted to the bottom of a soup tureen that was retrieved from the debris field. It was returned to the sea bed on the next dive.|$|E
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (<b>finger</b> <b>bone)</b> on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens. Females average slightly larger than males.|$|E

25|$|The mtDNA {{from the}} <b>finger</b> <b>bone</b> {{differs from that}} of modern humans by 385 bases (nucleotides) in the mtDNA strand out of {{approximately}} 16,500, whereas the difference between modern humans and Neanderthals is around 202 bases. In contrast, the difference between chimpanzees and modern humans is approximately 1,462 mtDNA base pairs. This suggested a divergence time around one million years ago. The mtDNA from a tooth bore a high similarity to that of the <b>finger</b> <b>bone,</b> indicating that they belonged to the same population. From a second tooth, an mtDNA sequence was recovered that showed an unexpectedly large number of genetic differences compared to that found in the other tooth and the finger, suggesting a high degree of mtDNA diversity. These two individuals from the same cave showed more diversity than seen among sampled Neanderthals from all of Eurasia, and were as different as modern-day humans from different continents.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} of the precise {{anatomical}} features of the Denisovans, since the only physical remains discovered thus far are the <b>finger</b> <b>bone,</b> two teeth from which genetic material has been gathered and a toe bone. The single <b>finger</b> <b>bone</b> is unusually broad and robust, well outside the variation seen in modern people. Surprisingly, it belonged to a female individual, indicating that the Denisovans were extremely robust, perhaps similar in build to the Neanderthals. The tooth that has been characterized shares no derived morphological features with Neanderthal or modern humans. An initial morphological characterization of the toe bone led to the suggestion {{that it may have}} belonged to a Neanderthal-Denisovan hybrid individual, although a critic suggested that the morphology was inconclusive. This toe bone's DNA was analyzed by Pääbo. After looking at the full genome, Pääbo and others confirmed that humans produced hybrids with Denisovans.|$|E
25|$|The {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) of the <b>finger</b> <b>bone</b> {{showed it}} to be genetically distinct from Neanderthals and modern humans. The nuclear genome from this specimen suggested that Denisovans shared a common origin with Neanderthals, that they ranged from Siberia to Southeast Asia, and that they lived among and interbred with the ancestors of some modern humans, with about 3% to 5% of the DNA of Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians deriving from Denisovans.|$|E

25|$|In mammals, {{the growth}} rate of nails is related to the length of the {{terminal}} phalanges (outermost <b>finger</b> <b>bones).</b> Thus, in humans, the nail of the index finger grows faster than that of the little finger; and fingernails grow up to four times faster than toenails.|$|R
25|$|Upon his arrest, Chikatilo gave a {{statement}} {{claiming that the}} police were mistaken, and complained that he had also been arrested in 1984 for the same series of murders. A strip-search of the suspect revealed a further piece of evidence: one of Chikatilo's fingers had a flesh wound. Medical examiners concluded the wound was from a human bite. Chikatilo's penultimate victim, Viktor Tishchenko, was a physically strong youth. At the crime scene, the police had found numerous signs of a ferocious physical struggle between the victim and his murderer. Although a <b>finger</b> <b>bone</b> was later found to be broken, and his fingernail had been bitten off, Chikatilo had never sought medical treatment for his injuries.|$|E
25|$|Later in 2010, {{a second}} {{paper from the}} Svante Pääbo group {{reported}} the prior discovery, in 2000, of a third upper molar from a young adult, dating from {{about the same time}} (the finger was from level 11 in the cave sequence, the tooth from level 11.1). The tooth differed in several aspects from those of Neanderthals, while having archaic characteristics similar to the teeth of Homo erectus. They performed mitochondrial DNA analysis on the tooth and found it to have a sequence different from but {{similar to that of the}} <b>finger</b> <b>bone,</b> indicating a divergence time about 7,500 years before, and suggesting that it belonged to a different individual from the same population.|$|E
25|$|The scapulocoracoid, a bone {{that makes}} up the {{pectoral}} girdle, is large and broad. While abelisaurids have arms that are extremely reduced in size, Masiakasaurus and other noasaurids had longer forelimbs. The humerus is slender and {{the bones of the}} hand are relatively short. The related genus Noasaurus has a raptorial ungual which was originally interpreted as a sickle-like claw on the foot, but has more recently been considered a claw of the hand. The penultimate phalanx, a <b>finger</b> <b>bone</b> that immediately precedes the raptorial ungual in Noasaurus, is also known in Masiakasaurus and has a similar appearance. The enlarged ungual, however, is unknown in Masiakasaurus. The hand bore three large fingers with stout - but not particularly sharp - claws, and a highly reduced fourth finger.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} of 12 has {{been attributed to}} the number of lunar cycles in a year, and also to the fact that humans have 12 finger bones (phalanges) on one hand (three on each of four fingers). It is possible to count to 12 with the thumb acting as a pointer, touching each <b>finger</b> <b>bone</b> in turn. A traditional finger counting system still in use in many regions of Asia works in this way, and could help to explain the occurrence of numeral systems based on 12 and 60 besides those based on 10, 20 and 5. In this system, the one (usually right) hand counts repeatedly to 12, displaying the number of iterations on the other (usually left), until five dozens, i. e. the 60, are full.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} second 2010 paper, the authors {{reported}} the isolation and sequencing of nuclear DNA from the Denisova <b>finger</b> <b>bone.</b> This specimen showed an unusual degree of DNA preservation and {{low level of}} contamination. They were able to achieve near-complete genomic sequencing, allowing a detailed comparison with Neanderthal and modern humans. From this analysis, they concluded, {{in spite of the}} apparent divergence of their mitochondrial sequence, that the Denisova population shared a common branch with Neanderthals from the lineage leading to modern African humans. The estimated average time of divergence between Denisovan and Neanderthal sequences is 640,000 years ago, and the time between both of these and the sequences of modern Africans is 804,000 years ago. They suggest that the divergence of the Denisova mtDNA results either from the persistence of a lineage purged from the other branches of humanity through genetic drift or else an introgression from an older hominin lineage.|$|E
25|$|The {{owner of}} the {{property}} in 1614 did not alter or further publicize the tomb. He must have resealed it, hid the entrance and kept its location a secret, for whatever reasons, as it disappeared from public knowledge and was lost again, despite publication of the inscription. In 1780 the then owners of the vineyard, the brothers Sassi, who apparently {{had no idea it}} was there, broke into the tomb again during remodelling of their wine cellar. They opened it to the leading scholars of the day. Someone, perhaps them, fragmented the slabs covering the loculi, with the obvious intent of accessing the contents, being careful to preserve the inscriptions. If the act is to be attributed to the Sassi, and if the motive of treasure-hunting is to be imputed to them, they found no treasure. What they did find they turned over to the Vatican under Pope Pius VI, including the gold signet ring taken off the <b>finger</b> <b>bone</b> of Barbatus.

5000|$|Derived bird {{traits in}} the {{skeleton}} of Sinornis are typically flight or perching adaptations. At a time when very few intermediary forms were known, the fossil seemed to provide an early glimpse of flight evolution, showing the intermediate evolutionary step between the [...] "primitive" [...] wings of Archaeopteryx to specialized wings of modern birds. As in modern birds, Sinornis had a modified wrist bone, with a groove that lets the wrist bend sharply back, tightly tucking the wings during flight or rest. Sinornis was capable of flight similar to modern birds based on breastbone and shoulder structures that provided both room and support for bulky aerobic flight muscles. It also had reduced claws and small hands with a stable second finger that anchored important flight feathers. Unlike the fused <b>finger</b> <b>bones</b> of modern birds, Sinornis had separate <b>finger</b> <b>bones</b> that were well adapted for flight, while {{the reduction of the}} tail moved the centre of gravity forwards.
