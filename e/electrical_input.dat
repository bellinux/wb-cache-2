25|$|Generally {{the plug}} is the movable {{connector}} attached to an electrically operated device's mains cable, and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure {{and connected to}} an energised electrical circuit. The plug has protruding pins or, in US terminology, blades (referred to as male) that fit into matching slots or holes (called female) in the sockets. A plug is defined in IEC 60050 as an accessory having pins designed to engage with the contacts of a socket-outlet, also incorporating means for the electrical connection and mechanical retention of flexible cables or cords; a plug does not contain components which modify the electrical output from the <b>electrical</b> <b>input</b> (except where a switch and/or fuse is provided {{as a means of}} disconnecting the output from input). There is an erroneous tendency to refer to power conversion devices with incorporated plug pins as plugs, but IEC 60050 refers to these as 'direct plug-in equipment', defined as equipment in which the mains plug forms {{an integral part of the}} equipment enclosure so that the equipment is supported by the mains socket-outlet. In this article, the term 'plug' is used in the sense defined by IEC 60050. Sockets are designed to prevent exposure of bare energised contacts. Sockets may also have protruding exposed contacts, but these are used exclusively for grounding (earthing).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{meat and}} eating {{quality of the}} M. longissimus et lumborum (LL) from 80 adult sheep {{carcasses}} was examined. Half of the carcasses were subjected to {{the full range of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>inputs</b> that are routinely used at the abattoir: immobilisation, spinal discharge and high voltage stimulation (HVS), whereas {{the other half of the}} carcasses were subjected to all <b>electrical</b> <b>inputs</b> except HVS. HVS significantly decreased the first pH values and increased the average predicted temperature at pH 6. 0. When the shear force of samples aged for 1 daywas examined (n = 77), there was a significant effect of stimulation, such that non-stimulated meat was tougher. For a reduced sample (n = 40), the most influential effect on shear force was aging, with no significant effect of stimulation or interaction between stimulation and aging. This was such that aging reduced the percentage of samples with a shear force above 50 N from 75 % after 1 day to 17. 5 % after 7 days of aging for the 40 LLs. When the LLs were aged for 7 days, there was no effect of stimulation on eating quality traits including tenderness, flavour, juiciness or overall liking. Based on the data for the LLs aged for 7 days, a relationship between overall liking and the overall ranking score was derived. Predicted overall liking scores at each rating score were derived, from which it was determined that to achieve a rating score of 3 (good every day), the overall liking score had to be 57.
