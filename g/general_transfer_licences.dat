Under the current system, items of <b>general</b> <b>transfer</b> payment include balanced transfer payment, transfer payment to ethnic minority areas, transfer payments to rural areas for taxes reform, and transfer payment for salary adjustment (Ministry of Finance 2012). <b>General</b> <b>transfer</b> payments are not specifically designated for any usage; local governments accepting <b>general</b> <b>transfer</b> payments may follow the relevant regulations and use the money according their practical needs.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates human {{aversive}} Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) and possible influences of outcome devaluation and instrumental overtraining on this effect. PIT measures {{the extent to}} which a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) can increase instrumental responses independently paired with the same (outcome-specific transfer) or a different (<b>general</b> <b>transfer)</b> reinforcer. Two measures of PIT were obtained: the percentage of instrumental responses and the vigor of such responses. Thirty-eight volunteers performed a standard PIT task sequence. Results showed a double dissociation between outcome-specific and general transfer: the first selectively expressed in the amount of responses, the second in the vigor measure solely. Furthermore, outcome-specific transfer was enhanced by overtraining, but not affected by devaluation. <b>General</b> <b>transfer,</b> on the other hand, was affected by neither overtraining, nor devaluation. A positive correlation between <b>general</b> <b>transfer</b> and sensitivity to punishments was found. Findings are discussed in terms of hypothetically different underlying neurobehavioral mechanisms and their relations to habits and goal-directed behavior. Work was completed at the Behavioral and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, University of Cambridge (UK), supported by a joint award from the MRC and Wellcome Trust (G 00001354) and a Trust Senior Investigator Award (104631 /Z/ 14 /Z) awarded to TWR and a fellowship from the University of Bologna to SG...|$|R

40|$|Among China’s current central-local fiscal grants system, <b>general</b> fiscal <b>transfers</b> is {{the only}} type of grants applied for fiscal {{equalization}} purpose. Its scale and effects have been the major determinants for evaluating equalization effectiveness of the overall central-provincial fiscal adjustment system. After analysing the development trend in the scale of China’s <b>general</b> fiscal <b>transfers</b> and measuring {{the effectiveness of the}} overall central-provincial fiscal transfers by newly-designed indicators, this paper finds out that the relative small scale of <b>general</b> fiscal <b>transfers</b> is the main factor to explain current undesirable equalization effects of the overall central-provincial fiscal transfers. In order to effectively address regional fiscal disparities, it is recommended then that China’s current fiscal transfer system should be improved with an attempt to further increase the relative scale of <b>general</b> fiscal <b>transfers...</b>|$|R
