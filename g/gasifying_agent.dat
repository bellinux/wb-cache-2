40|$|AbstractThis study {{provides}} the optimum equivalence ratio of biomass gasification process based on thermodynamic equilibrium model. There are two cases of chemical equilibrium in a gasification process. The first being with excess carbon {{present in the}} gasification process while the second one possess excess <b>gasifying</b> <b>agent</b> with all the carbon completely gasified. The simulation results clearly show that under the certain conditions, there must exist a case between these two cases where the carbon is completely gasified without any excess <b>gasifying</b> <b>agent</b> or carbon.

Moreover, {{the results show that}} at higher <b>gasifying</b> <b>agent</b> temperatures the trend of CO increases more sharply than that at lower <b>gasifying</b> <b>agent</b> temperatures and vice versa for CO 2. The optimum equivalence ratio becomes less fuel rich with increase in gasification temperatures. At atmospheric pressures the optimum equivalence ratio was found to be 3. 0 for gasification temperatures in the range of 600 - 900 K, while it was 2. 0 for gasification temperatures of 1000 - 1500 K and 1. 5 for gasification temperatures of 1600 - 2500 K...|$|E

Comparison was conducted in terms of gasification duration, evolution of reaction rate with time and/or conversion, and effect of partial pressure on reaction rate. Reactor temperature was maintained at 900 Â Â°C. Partial pressure of <b>gasifying</b> <b>agents</b> varied from 1. 5 bars to 0. 6 bars in intervals of 0. 3 bars. Steam and CO 2 flow rates were chosen so that both <b>gasifying</b> <b>agents</b> had equal amount of oxygen content. CO 2 gasification lasted for about 60 Â min while steam gasification lasted for about 22 Â min. The average reaction rate for steam gasification was almost twice that of CO 2. Both reaction rate curves showed a peak value at certain degree of conversion. For steam gasification, the reaction rate peak {{was found to be}} at a degree of conversion of about 0. 3. However, for CO 2 gasification the reaction rate peak was found to be at a conversion degree of about 0. 1. Reaction rates have been fitted using the random pore model (RPM).

40|$|From the {{viewpoints}} {{of securing}} a stable {{supply of energy}} and protecting our global environment in the future, the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power generation of various gasifying methods has been introduced in the world. Gasified fuels are chiefly characterized by the <b>gasifying</b> <b>agents</b> and the synthetic gas cleanup methods and {{can be divided into}} four types. The calorific value of the gasified fuel varies according to the <b>gasifying</b> <b>agents</b> and feedstocks of various resources, and ammonia originating from nitrogenous compounds in the feedstocks depends on the synthetic gas clean-up methods. In particular, air-blown gasified fuels provide low calorific fuel of 4 MJ/m 3 and it is necessary to stabilize combustion. In contrast, the flame temperature of oxygen-blown gasified fuel of medium calorie between approximately 9 – 13 MJ/m 3 is much higher, so control of thermal-NOx emissions is necessary. Moreover, to improve the thermal efficiency of IGCC, hot/dry type synthetic gas clean-up is needed. However, ammonia in the fuel is not removed and is supplied into the gas turbine where fuel-NOx is formed in the combustor. For these reasons, suitable combustion technology for each gasified fuel is important. This paper outlines combustion technologies and combustor designs of the high temperature gas turbine for various IGCCs. Additionally, this paper confirms that further decreases in fuel-NOx emissions can be achieved by removing ammonia from gasified fuels through the application of selective, non-catalytic denitration. From these basic considerations, the performance of specifically designed combustors for each IGCC proved the proposed methods to be sufficiently effective. The combustors were able to achieve strong results, decreasing thermal-NOx emissions to 10 ppm (corrected at 16 % oxygen) or less, and fuel-NOx emissions by 60 % or more, under conditions where ammonia concentration per fuel heating value in unit volume was 2. 4 × 102 ppm/(MJ/m 3) or higher. Consequently, principle techniques for combustor design for each IGCC were established by the present analytical and experimental research. Also, this paper contains some findings of the author’s previously published own works and engages in wide-ranging discussion into the future development of gasification technologies...|$|R

40|$|Gasification is heating-up {{of solid}} or liquid {{carbonaceous}} material with some <b>gasifying</b> <b>agent</b> to produce gaseous fuel. Conventional gasification normally operates {{at higher pressure}} than atmospheric pressure and requires heat up during startup compared to microwave gasification. In this study, both microwave gasification and microwave plasma test rigs were designed to produce syngas from char. A quartz reactor of 600 mm length and 20 mm internal diameter with swirling gas inlet was designed as the gasification reactor. CO 2 {{was used as a}} <b>gasifying</b> <b>agent</b> for syngas production. Oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) char and oil palm shell (OPS) char were used as the carbonaceous materials. The flow rate of CO 2 varied from 1 to 4 1 pm. The microwave output power was supplied continuously at 800 W for 5 mm. The syngas was analysed using gas chromatograph (GC) Agilent 6890 fitted with packed column, Thermal Conductivity Detector (lCD), and capillary column for measuring volumetric concentration of CH 4, CO 2, CO, and H 2. From the study, it was found that EFB char is better than OPS char as gasification fuel due to high porosity and surface area that will increase the char reactivity towards CO 2. For plasma gasification, the temperature increment promoted by the addition of microwave absorber using activated carbon (AC) increased the CO composition. The optimum condition for microwave char gasification of EFB was 3 1 pm with 25 wt...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the gasification of woody biomass pellets and torrefied wood pellets at different temperatures using air or CO 2 as the gasifying agents. The woody biomass pellets were pyrolyzed and gasified {{in a controlled}} reactor facility that allowed for the determination of sample weight loss {{as a function of}} time from which the kinetics parameters were evaluated. The experimental facility provided full optical access that allowed for in-situ monitoring of the fate of the biomass pellets and the release of gas phase under prescribed high temperature condition. Pellet sample of known weight was placed in a wire mesh cage and then introduced instantly into the high temperature zone of the reactor at known temperature and surrounding gas composition as <b>gasifying</b> <b>agent.</b> The weight loss as function of time was examined for different gasification temperatures ranging from 600 - 950 oC using air or CO 2 as the <b>gasifying</b> <b>agent.</b> Significant differences in the weight loss were observed to reveal the fundamental pyro-gasification behavior between the wood and torrefied wood pellets. The results show enhanced gasification with air at low to moderate temperatures while at high temperatures the oxygen evolved from CO 2 provided a role in oxidation. The calculated activated energy was lower for woody pellets than torrefied wood pellets and it was lower with air than CO 2. These kinetic parameters help in modeling to design biomass gasifiers and combustors for increased conversion efficiency and performance using biomass or municipal solid waste pellets. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{renewable}} {{evolution in}} the energy industry and the depletion of natural resources are putting pressure on the waste industry to shift towards flexible treatment technologies with efficient materials and/or energy recovery. In this context, a thermochemical conversion method of recent interest is plasma gasification, which is capable of producing syngas {{from a wide variety}} of waste streams. The produced syngas can be valorized for both energetic (heat and/or electricity) and chemical (ammonia, hydrogen or liquid hydrocarbons) end-purposes. This paper evaluates the performance of experiments on a single-stage plasma gasification system for the treatment of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from excavated waste. A comparative analysis of the syngas characteristics and process yields was done for seven cases with different types of <b>gasifying</b> <b>agents</b> (CO 2 + O 2, H 2 O, CO 2 + H 2 O and O 2 + H 2 O). The syngas compositions were compared to the thermodynamic equilibrium compositions and the performance of the single-stage plasma gasification of RDF was compared to that of similar experiments with biomass and to the performance of a two-stage plasma gasification process with RDF. The temperature range of the experiment was from 1400 to 1600 K and for all cases, a medium calorific value syngas was produced with lower heating values up to 10. 9 MJ/Nm 3, low levels of tar, high levels of CO and H 2 and which composition was in good agreement to the equilibrium composition. The carbon conversion efficiency ranged from 80 % to 100 % and maximum cold gas efficiency and mechanical gasification efficiency of respectively 56 % and 95 %, were registered. Overall, the treatment of RDF proved to be less performant than that of biomass in the same system. Compared to a two-stage plasma gasification system, the produced syngas from the single-stage reactor showed more favourable characteristics, while the recovery of the solid residue as a vitrified slag is an advantage of the two-stage set-up. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Glycerol, a {{carbohydrate}} substrate, {{is produced}} in large quantities by the burgeoning biodiesel industry. The opportunity to produce synthesis gas (H 2 /CO mixture) from this bioprocessing residue by steam reforming is a potential advantage in the future integration of biorefineries with current petrochemical plants since syngas maybe converted to clean fuels via the Fischer-Tropsch process. In this work, alumina supported catalysts comprising of bimetallic Co-Ni, alkaline earth oxide (MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO) doped Co-Ni and lanthanide oxide (CeO 2, Pr 2 O 3, Sm 2 O 3) doped Co-Ni, were synthesized by wetness co-impregnation technique and assessed in a fixed-bed reactor over steam-to-glycerol ratio of 3. 0 <STGR&# 8804; 12. 0 and temperatures of 773 to 823 K. Kinetic examination of glycerol steam reforming over Co-Ni catalyst gave an activation energy of 63. 3 kJ mol- 1. Mechanistic models were evaluated {{on the basis of}} statistical adequacy and thermodynamic consistency. These criteria revealed that the reaction was best characterized by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) bimolecular model with associative adsorption of glycerol and steam on two different catalytic sites. Carbon deposition during the reaction appeared to be responsible for the loss in surface area and pore volume of the used catalysts. At least two types of carbonaceous species were evidenced on the catalyst &# 8722; a more reactive atomic carbon species deposited on the metal-support interface while a less reactive carbon of the polymeric nature, was located on the alumina support. Interestingly, the acidity of doped Co-Ni catalysts decreased with Pauling electronegativity of the dopants. In addition, the metal surface area of all doped catalysts (0. 8 to 1. 1 m 2 gcat- 1) was considerably higher than the undoped catalyst (0. 7 m 2 gcat- 1) while lanthanide oxide doped-catalysts also increased the degree of reducibility of Co-Ni catalyst. This study also disclosed that although carbon deposition is inevitable, lanthanide oxide-doped catalysts decreased the carbon laydown (8 &# 8722; 20 %). The carbon-resilient property of these catalysts was further substantiated through longevity tests. In the final phase of the work, H 2 and CO 2 were individually added as carbon <b>gasifying</b> <b>agents</b> during the reforming. In particular, CO 2 could be tuned at selected partial pressure and temperature to produce a syngas with more suitable H 2 :CO ratio for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac surgery {{through an}} open chest wound is a major {{operation}} both in size and duration. The wound exposure to ambient air implies considerable risks. 1) Air may enter the heart and great vessels and embolize to the brain or cardiac muscle where it may cause dysfunction or permanent damage. 2) The wound is exposed to airborne bacterial contamination, which may lead to postoperative wound infection. 3) The wound is subjected to desiccation, which may lead to serious adhesions and possible impairment of cardiac function. Intraoperative wound ventilation with carbon dioxide (CO 2) might help to protect the patient against these risks. CO 2 is more soluble than air and thus less harmful to the human body. CO 2 is also heavier than air, which facilitates {{the establishment of a}} CO 2 atmosphere in the chest wound cavity. The present study investigated how the physical properties of CO 2 could be used to prevent or reduce complications in cardiac surgery. The study shows that conventional insufflation devices such as an open-ended tube, a tube with a gauze sponge at the end, or a multi-perforated catheter cannot efficiently supply CO 2 to the wound. The flow velocities, at which these devices supply gas, are too high and the resulting turbulence mixes and dilutes the delivered CO 2 with ambient air. The net effect is a low degree of air displacement. Even more important, it also results in a much higher rate of direct airborne contamination and desiccation of the wound than what is the case without any CO 2 insufflation at all. A new insufflation device, a gas-diffuser, was developed. The thesis shows that with this device a CO 2 atmosphere of more than 99 % can be created in the cardiothoracic wound. At a continuous flow of 10 L/min, wound ventilation should thus significantly decrease the risk of air embolism. Furthermore, this type of wound ventilation may reduce the risk of postoperative wound infection in three different ways. In the first place, the laminar outflow of CO 2 from the wound opening withholds airborne contaminants from reaching the wound. Secondly, the bacteriostatic effect of CO 2 may decrease the growth rate of bacteria in the wound. Thirdly, the addition of a few vol. % of a <b>gasified</b> antiseptic <b>agent</b> to the CO 2 may decrease the number of bacteria in the wound or inhibit their growth even more. Finally, wound ventilation with humidified CO 2 should significantly reduce desiccation of sensitive wound tissue. The present thesis indicates that intraoperative wound ventilation may provide a simple and effective method {{to reduce the risk of}} several life-threatening complications in cardiac surgery as well as in other types of surgery. Future clinical studies will eventually reveal its clinical significance...|$|R
