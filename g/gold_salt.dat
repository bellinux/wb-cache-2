25|$|Rock {{art in the}} Sahara {{suggests}} that northern Mali has been inhabited since 10,000 BC, when the Sahara was fertile and rich in wildlife. By 300 BC, large organised settlements had developed, most notable near Djenné, one of West Africa's oldest cities. By the 6th century AD, the lucrative trans-Saharan trade in <b>gold,</b> <b>salt</b> and slaves had begun, facilitating the rise of West Africa's great empires.|$|E
25|$|Mali {{was once}} part of three famed West African empires which {{controlled}} trans-Saharan trade in <b>gold,</b> <b>salt,</b> slaves, and other precious commodities. These Sahelian kingdoms had neither rigid geopolitical boundaries nor rigid ethnic identities. The earliest of these empires was the Ghana Empire, which was dominated by the Soninke, a Mande-speaking people. The empire expanded throughout West Africa from the 8th century until 1078, when it was conquered by the Almoravids.|$|E

2500|$|Unique to the {{development}} of Dutch is the collapse of older ol/ul/al + dental into ol + dental, followed by vocalisation of pre-consonantal /l/ and after a short vowel, creating the diphthong [...] e.g., Dutch goud, zout and bout corresponds with Low German Gold, Solt, Bolt; German Gold, Salz, Balt and English <b>gold,</b> <b>salt,</b> bold. This is the most common diphthong along with [...] All three are commonly the only ones considered unique phonemes in Dutch. The tendency for native English speakers is to pronounce Dutch names with [...] (written as ij or ei) as , (like the English vowel y) which does not normally lead to confusion among native listeners, since in a number of dialects (e.g. in Amsterdam) the same pronunciation is heard.|$|E

40|$|The {{anti-inflammatory}} agent {{sodium aurothiomalate}} appears to act upon mononuclear phagocytes, inhibiting their lysosomal enzyme activity. Evidence is presented that <b>gold</b> <b>salts</b> {{can increase the}} number of lung tumour nodules that develop following intravenous injection of tumour cells and pretreatment can enhance the take of a subcutaneous tumour inoculum. In contrast, they do not affect the later growth of tumour. <b>Gold</b> <b>salts</b> can also suppress the action of systemically administered C. parvum in inhibiting the growth of subcutaneous tumours. These results are taken as supporting the evidence in favour of a fast acting nonspecific anti-tumour mechanism, probably macrophage mediated, that can be inhibited by <b>gold</b> <b>salts</b> and enhanced by C. parvum.

50|$|An economical, {{environmentally}} {{benign and}} fast synthesis methodology for gold nanoparticles using block copolymer {{has been developed}} by Sakai et al. In this synthesis methodology, block copolymer plays the dual role of a reducing agent {{as well as a}} stabilizing agent. The formation of gold nanoparticles comprises three main steps: reduction of <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> ion by block copolymers in the solution and formation of gold clusters, adsorption of block copolymers on gold clusters and further reduction of <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> ions on the surfaces of these gold clusters for the growth of gold particles in steps, and finally its stabilization by block copolymers. But this method usually has a limited-yield (nanoparticle concentration), which does not increase with the increase in the <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> concentration. Recently, Ray et al. demonstrated that the presence of an additional reductant (trisodium citrate) in 1:1 mole ratio with <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> enhances the yield by manyfold at ambient conditions and room temperature.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} an unprecedented green {{process for the}} production of gold nanoparticles by simple treatment of <b>gold</b> <b>salts</b> with soybean extracts. Reduction capabilities of antioxidant phytochemicals present in soybean and their ability to reduce <b>gold</b> <b>salts</b> chemically to nanoparticles with subsequent coating of proteins {{and a host of other}} phytochemicals present in soybean on the freshly generated gold nanoparticles are discussed. The new genre of green nanoparticles exhibit remarkable in vitro stability in various buffers including saline, histidine, HSA, and cysteine solutions. MTT assays reveal that the green gold nanoparticles are nontoxic and thus provide excellent opportunities for their applications in nanomedicine for molecular imaging and therapy. The overall strategy described herein for the generation of gold nanoparticles meets all 12 principles of green chemistry, as no "man-made" chemicals, other than the <b>gold</b> <b>salts,</b> are used in the green nanotechnological process...|$|R

40|$|<b>Gold</b> <b>salts</b> {{have been}} used in the {{treatment}} of rheumatoid arthritis for nearly 40 years. Their effectiveness, while not consistent, has been well established (Freyberg, 1966) and their use continues. Recently, conflicting results concerning the effective-ness of <b>gold</b> <b>salts</b> on adjuvant arthritis in rats have been reported (Newbould, 1963; Jessop and Currey, 1968). Adjuvant arthritis, a crippling deformity resulting from diffuse connective tissue involvement, is considered by some authorities to be the best available experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis because of its strong clinical and pathological siinilarities to the human disease (Pearson, 1963), and because it can be effectively treated with most antiarthritic drugs it is widely used to evaluate potential therapeutic agents. By employing highly inbred (Lewis) rats as our experimental animals and utilizing a volume-displacement apparatus to measure the arthritic lesions objectively, we have obtained an arthritic model that is highly sensitive in detecting anti-arthritic activity. In light of conflicting reports in the literature, we have re-evaluated the effectiveness of <b>gold</b> <b>salts</b> in adjuvant arthritis in rats under our test conditions.
