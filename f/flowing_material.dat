25|$|In {{the case}} of a flowing system of only one {{chemical}} constituent, in the Lagrangian representation, there is no distinction between bulk flow and diffusion of matter. Moreover, the flow of matter is zero into or out of the cell that moves with the local center of mass. In effect, in this description, one is dealing with a system effectively closed to the transfer of matter. But still one can validly talk of a distinction between bulk flow and diffusive flow of internal energy, the latter driven by a temperature gradient within the <b>flowing</b> <b>material,</b> and being defined with respect to the local center of mass of the bulk flow. In this case of a virtually closed system, because of the zero matter transfer, as noted above, one can safely distinguish between transfer of energy as work, and transfer of internal energy as heat.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{influences}} of the Pompeii and Herculaneum excavations, several other factors came together to popularize neoclassical dress. Starting in the early 1790s, Emma Hamilton began her performances of attitudes, something that was considered by contemporaries as entirely new. These attitudes were based loosely on the ancient practice of pantomime, though Emma’s performances lacked masks and musical accompaniment. Her performances created a fusion between art and nature; art came alive and her body became a type of art. As an aid to her performances of tragic mythological and historical figures, Emma wore the clothing á la grecque that would become popular in mainstream France in the coming years. A simple light colored chemise made from thin, <b>flowing</b> <b>material</b> was worn and gathered with a narrow ribbon under the breasts. Simple cashmere shawls were used as headdresses or to give more fullness to the drapery of the chemise. They also helped to prevent broken lines in the performance so that the outstretched arms were always connected with the body, escalating the effect of fluid movement, and oftentimes, a cape or a cloak was worn to emphasize {{the lines of the}} body in certain poses. This highlighted the continuity of surface of line and form {{in the body of the}} performer to emphasize the unity, simplicity, and continuously flowing movement from one part of the body to the next. The hair was worn in a natural, loose, and flowing fashion. All of these properties blended together to allow an extensive play of light and shadow to reveal and accent certain parts of the body during the performance, while covering others. Emma was highly capable in her attitudes, and the influence of her dress spread from Naples to Paris as wealthy Parisians took the Grand Tour.|$|E

Such a mathematical model is called a constitutive equation. Recently he has worked on theories of active matter, particularly dense suspensions of self-propelled particles which can include motile bacteria. He is increasingly interested in fundamental field theories of active systems in which time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry, and more generally CPT symmetry) is absent. Such theories are characterised by nonzero steady-state Entropy production. Another recent interest is the flow of shear-thickening suspensions, such as dense solutions of corn-starch or custard powder in water; this work was presented in a recent public lecture.|$|E

5000|$|The {{analysis}} {{can be done}} on samples which the operator brings to the analyser or the analyser can {{be connected to the}} source of the samples and the sampling be done automatically. The source of samples for automatic sampling is commonly some kind of process such as a chemical process. Analysers which are connected to a process, and conduct automatic sampling, can be called online (or on-line) analysers or sometimes inline (or in-line) analysers. For inline analysis, a sensor can be placed in a process vessel or stream of <b>flowing</b> <b>material</b> to conduct the analysis. Another method of online analysis is allowing a sample stream to flow from the process equipment into an analyser, sometimes conditioning the sample stream in between such as reducing pressure or changing the sample temperature. Such sampling is typically for fluids (either liquids or gases). If the sample stream is not substantially modified by the analyser, it can be returned to the process. Otherwise, the sample stream is not returned; for example, if any reagents have been added for the analysis.|$|E
5000|$|Sallé was {{the first}} notable female {{choreographer}} and {{the first woman to}} choreograph a ballet in which she also danced. As a choreographer she integrated music, costumes, and dance styles of her ballets with their themes, thereby anticipating the reforms made by choreographer Jean-Georges Noverre in the late 18th century. [...] She argued that costumes should reflect and represent the character, a novel idea at the time. This engendered a sense of [...] "realism" [...] that had been largely ignored up to this point in the evolution of ballet and also allowed for greater physical freedom among the female dancers, especially, allowing them more opportunities without the restrictions of unwieldy and elaborate clothing on stage. She changed the costume from heavy long dress to muslin <b>flowing</b> <b>material</b> which caused shock and delight. She often performed without a skirt or bodice(sans-panniers), rebelling against the traditional costume and accepted gender norms of a very regimented era. [...] She also worked in collaboration with composers such as George Handel and Christoph Gluck, commissioning compositions from them for her choreography, which helped to garner more respect for ballet as its own distinct art form.|$|E

[...] In the chorus, she is sitting at the piano [...] "wearing another styled black top, with a cut out around the chest." [...] In one scene, [...] "the starlet's {{plunging}} neckline in a lilac sheer flowing gown, which skims her breasts, gets covered by drawn on wings," [...] Sarkari claimed, while also explaining that [...] "the mirror image symmetry effect in the clip gives it a seventies vibe as the <b>flowing</b> <b>material</b> swims across the screen, while Delta also rocks another seventies look as she beats on the drums." [...] In other scenes, the singer is seeing [...] "sweeping her hair back in a ponytail" [...] and [...] "wearing a gold diamond print sheer chiffon over the top of a shimmering white leotard, cinched in at the waist with a thick gold belt."

5000|$|It's clear, {{given these}} prerequisites, that contact {{pressure}} and developed temperature is {{highly dependent on}} the lumps geometry.Flow of material exhibits an increase in energy density, because initial phase transformation and displacement of material demand acceleration of material and high pressure.Low pressure is not compatible with plastic flow, only after deceleration may the <b>flowing</b> <b>material</b> be exposed to low pressure and quickly cooled. In other words, you can't deform a solid material using direct contact without applying a high pressure and somewhere along the process must acceleration and deceleration take place, i.e., high pressure must be applied {{on all sides of}} the deformed material. <b>Flowing</b> <b>material</b> will immediately exhibit energy loss and reduced ability to flow due to phase transformation, if ejected from high pressure into low pressure. This ability withholds the high pressure and energy density in the contact zone and decreases the amount of energy or friction force needed for further advancement when the sliding continues and partly explain the difference between the static and sliding coefficient of friction (μ) if the main fracture mechanisms are equal to the previous.Thus stronger cohesion means that the molecules are not interacting and are somewhere deposited therefore a re-engineering is made where the molecules like cholesterol could be dissolved through adhesion. Thus the friccohesity mutually resolves the issues of deposition or dispersion both by estimating their mutual activities. For example if the molecules weaken their cohesion and cause adhesion or dispersion then both the cohesive and frictional forces become operational which are defined by the friccohesity. However, the tentropy of the individual molecules undergo changes as the interacting sites of the molecules gear up to accept the challenge of the new chemical environment. Thus the tentropy which is an entropy of individual molecules caused due to intramolecular chemical changes is of great significance. It also signifies the concept of the Intramolecular multiple force theory (IMMFT).Adhesive wear is a common fault factor in industrial applications such as sheet metal forming (SMF) and commonly encountered in conjunction with lubricant failures and are often referred to as welding wear or galling due to the exhibited surface characteristics, phase transition and plastic flow followed by cooling.The type of mechanism and the amplitude of surface attraction, varies between different materials but are amplified by an increase in the density of [...] "surface energy". Most solids will adhere on contact to some extent. However, oxidation films, lubricants and contaminants naturally occurring generally suppress adhesion. and spontaneous exothermic chemical reactions between surfaces generally produce a substance with low energy status in the absorbed species.Tentropy is a most significant in case of working molecules which are brought in contact of nanoemulsion. The catalysts, drugs, photosensitive, heat sensitive molecules which initiate intramolecular activities by developing varieties of arrays of electronic spin, vibrational motions, stretching motions, within infinitesimal changes. These activities cause several orders of activities and array of each becomes environment for another activity. Thus the system as well as environment are created within the single molecule. Therefore the tentropy becomes most popular in case of supramolecules, dendrimers where each tier has its own chemical environment with definite chemical activity. Complexes, capped nanoparticles are another prominent areas which need tentropy as the best solution for understanding their activities. The molecules keep interacting with other molecules based on compatibility and geometrical activities to align to substantially effective distance noted noted as equilibrium distance. These interacting activities could be enhanced by chemical additives like surfactants, binding charge inducers, catalyst for desired linkage. The fractionated charges through electronegativity causing positive and negative poles induce Coulombic forces. The functional groups the pole flickering activity like peptide bond in protein. These lead to increase cohesive forces or distribution activities.The weakening of cohesive forces and strengthening of distributed against medium restriction are defined by friccohesity.|$|E
