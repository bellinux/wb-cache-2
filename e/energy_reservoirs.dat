50|$|Sociologist Georg Simmel {{contributed to}} the {{description}} of sensory overload in the early 1900s. Writer of The Metropolis and Mental Life, Simmel writes about an urban scenario of constantly appearing stimuli that trigger the brain’s senses. He writes about a barrier that must protect the individual from this constant stimulation {{in order to keep}} one sane. In short, Simmel concludes with stating that the urban life, full of its stimulations at different scenarios, provides excitement to our nervous system. The downside is that too much exposure of this sensory overload depletes the body’s <b>energy</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Lacking the appropriate energy to react at new situations can form the bland mentality of an individual. A person’s mentality can be detrimental {{with a high degree of}} exposure of sensory overload.

40|$|International audienceEuropean {{barn owl}} chicks (Tyto alba) show a body mass {{overshoot}} prior to fledging {{that has been}} predicted {{to serve as an}} <b>energy</b> <b>reservoir</b> during periods of stochastic food availability. However, the composition of the mass overshoot has heretofore not been directly examined in nestlings of this or any other species displaying a body mass overshoot during growth (e. g., raptors and seabirds). To experimentally determine whether the overshoot in body mass in juvenile European barn owls (Tyto alba) may act as an <b>energy</b> <b>reservoir,</b> we compared the body composition of owl chicks raised on an ad libitum diet to those fed a restricted diet designed to eliminate the overshoot. Chicks raised on the two diets were also compared for differences in maturation of diverse functions (e. g., locomotion) and tissues (e. g., skeletal development). Contrary to expectations, our results on body composition in juvenile barn owls indicate that the mass overshoot prior to fledging is primarily comprised of an increased water compartment. Thus, we suggest that the mass overshoot in owls (and possibly in other species) does not serve as an <b>energy</b> <b>reservoir</b> but, rather, may function as an insurance against dehydration when hot in-nest conditions force chicks to rely on evaporative cooling: temperatures in barn owl nests can reach up to 43 degrees C.

40|$|International audienceThe {{advance of}} {{minimally}} invasive surgery has been empowered by new medical/surgical robotic systems towards achieving less invasiveness, smaller or even no scars. Wireless communication possesses great potential to be utilized in miniaturized surgical robotic system. However time delay is inevitably introduced in the control loop which causes stability issues for robotic-assisted surgeries. Wave variable based teleoperation structure provides stable force reflecting teleoperation performance but with both position and force tracking performance compromised due to conservative passivity condition. Recently, we proposed a new wave variable compensated structure to improve position and force tracking performance together with <b>energy</b> <b>reservoir</b> based regulators for stability purpose. In this paper, different <b>energy</b> <b>reservoir</b> based regulators are proposed with consideration of passivity of master and slave system to avoid uncertain compensated wave variables.

In the present study, effects of different artificial and natural diets {{as well as}} starvation was studied on energy contents of {{the third and fourth}} nymphal instars of P. maculiventris. Total available energy calculated as the sum of the energy contents of lipids, carbohydrates, glycogen, and proteins did not significantly differ in the third and fourth nymphal instars fed on natural and artificial diets. Among the <b>energy</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> only total lipid storage of the starved nymphal instars was significantly different from that in the bugs fed on the natural diet.

40|$|White {{adipose tissue}} (WAT) is {{important}} as an <b>energy</b> <b>reservoir</b> in mammals, but the precise {{mechanism by which}} energy storage in WAT is controlled remains unclear. It {{is well known that}} representative anabolic hormone insulin efficiently stores triglyceride in adipocytes. We showed that insulin inhibited β-agonist-induced lipolysis at least in part by inhibiting phosphorylation of perilipin and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Furthermore, insulin inhibited β-agonist-induced increase of PGC- 1 α expression, which is important for mitochondrial biogenesis and energy expenditure. These results suggest the possibility that insulin efficiently stores triglyceride in adipocytes by decreasing lipolysis and repressing energy expenditure. Obesity characterized by the storage of excess triglyceride in adipose tissue is a complex and chronic disorder that has become a global epidemic (1). Especially, visceral obesity, with fat accumulation in abdomen among viscera, is often associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension and with an increased risk of accelerated atherosclerosis, which is called the metabolic syndrome (10).

40|$|Voyager IRIS {{measurements}} on Jupiter show substantial {{vertical and horizontal}} structure which I apply to {{an assessment of the}} associated global scale dynamics. The retrieved temperature profiles indicate a variation of static stability between 4 x 10 (' 8) cm(' 2) s('- 2) and 2 x 10 (' 9) cm(' 2) s('- 2) from upper tropospheric ((TURN) 365 mb) to stratospheric ((TURN) 20 mb) levels. Meridional cross sections of the thermal deviations from both the zonal and global (area-weighted) means show a coherent organization on the scale of the belt-zone spacing. The computed zonal thermal wind shear between 100 and 300 mb is strongly correlated with the imaging measurements of the zonal flow and in the sense required to significantly reduce the strength of the observed jet streams over some 2 - 6 scale heights above the cloud deck. I compute the available potential <b>energy</b> <b>reservoirs</b> for the upper troposphere and show that these also vary with latitude in proportion to the kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>reservoirs</b> inferred from imaging measurements. Both the available potential energy and the eddy kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are, however, more than a decade smaller than the estimated zonal mean kinetic energy. I review the observational evidence and constraints for possible planetary wave propagation in Jupiter's upper atmosphere from Voyager IRIS, radio occultation, and imaging measurements. I then apply the dispersion relations for planetary waves on an equatorial beta plane to a diagnostic assessment of the observed vertical and longitudinal scales. Although no single wave mode can be unequivocally identified, the lower order equatorial Rossby modes with an equivalent depth of h(,) <(,) 2 km are most easily related to all the observations of features with a zonal planetary wavenumber n (LESSTHEQ) 20.
