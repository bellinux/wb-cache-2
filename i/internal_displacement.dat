The international protections in place for the internally displaced, primarily the 1998 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Guiding Principles on <b>Internal</b> <b>Displacement,</b> do not apply to earthquake survivors who have crossed an international border. There is nothing protecting the externally displaced, which creates significant protection gaps for those most vulnerable to trafficking—girls and young women—who are treated as migration offenders rather than forced migrants in need of protection.

40|$|The Wenchuan {{earthquake}} in Sichuan Province of China has caused tremendous {{loss of life}} and property. The severe earthquake along with the heavy rainfall has induced landslide and debris flows so that the slope stability is a significant concern in this earthquake region. A newly developed inclinometer based on the Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensing technique has been installed in a slope in Sichuan Province for long-term monitoring of <b>internal</b> <b>displacements.</b> A series of FBG sensing bars are installed at different depths of two different boreholes in the slope; meanwhile, all optical fibers of the sensing bars are connected and extended to a monitoring station around 1000 m away from the slope site through a main armored cable of optical fibers. Monitoring works are {{carried out in the}} monitoring station from 20 June to 25 September 2010. Thus, <b>internal</b> <b>displacements</b> of the slope are analyzed together with the rainfall data which are also collected by a rainfall gauge. The results demonstrate that rainfall infiltration has a strong influence on the <b>internal</b> <b>displacements,</b> while the influence reduces dramatically when the depth exceeds 5. 2 m. Through a numerical model for the effect analysis of rainfall intensity and duration, the slope stability decreases significantly when the rainfall intensity higher (or equal) than 0. 5 mm/h and rainfall duration longer than 100 h.

Elasticity reconstruction involves definition of a region of interest having uniform Young's modulus along its boundary and subsequent solution of the discretized elasticity equilibrium equations. Data acquisition and reconstruction were performed on a urethane rubber phantom of known elastic properties and an ex vivo canine kidney phantom using < 2 % differential deformation. Regional elastic properties are well represented on Young's modulus images. The long-term objective of this work is to provide a means for remote palpation and elasticity quantitation in deep tissues otherwise inaccessible to manual palpation...|$|R

According to Armenian sources, {{on the night of}} 1 April and early morning of 2 April, the Azerbaijani side launched large-scale attacks along the contact line between Karabakh and Azerbaijan. On 2 April, a 12-year-old Armenian boy was killed as a result of missile artillery attack from a BM-21 Grad near the border with Martuni. Two other children were wounded as well. According to Azerbaijani sources, on 2 April, Azerbaijani positions and inhabited places near the front line came under fire from Armenian military, armed with mortars and high caliber grenade launchers, that killed and wounded several civilians. According to the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense, during a rapid counter-offensive, the Armenian side's front defense line was broken in multiple places and several strategic heights and inhabited places were retaken (including the strategically important hill of Lalatapa). An AFP journalist confirmed that the Lalatapa heights were also under Azerbaijani control. The Azerbaijani side claimed that they had captured some areas, including heights near the village of Talysh, as well as the village of Seysulan.

Renting of land for a maximum of twenty years is allowed and this is expected to ensure that land goes to the most productive user. Land distribution and administration is considered an area where corruption is institutionalized, and facilitation payments as well as bribes are often demanded when dealing with land-related issues. As there is no land ownership, infrastructural projects are most often simply done without asking the land users, which then end up being displaced and without home or land. A lot of anger and distrust sometimes results in public protests.

40|$|Oceanic {{internal}} tides are internal waves with tidal periodicities. They are ubiquitous {{throughout the}} ocean, although generally more pronounced near large bathymetric {{features such as}} mid-ocean ridges and continental slopes. The <b>internal</b> vertical <b>displacements</b> associated with these waves can be extraordinarily large. Near some shelf breaks where the surface tides are strong, <b>internal</b> <b>displacements</b> (e. g., of an isothermal surface) can exceed 200 meters. Displacements of 10 meters in the open ocean are not uncommon. The associated current velocities are usually comparable to or larger than the currents of the surface tide. On continental shelves internal tides can occasionally generate packets of internal solitons, which are detectable in remote sensing imagery. Other common nonlinear features are generation of higher harmonics (e. g., 6 -hr waves) and wave breaking. Internal tides {{are known to be}} an important energy source for mixing of shelf waters.

2500|$|Since {{the start}} of Plan Colombia, the main {{strategy}} for reducing cocaine production has been the aerial spraying of coca plantations with herbicides such as glyphosate. Since 2000 more than 1,600,000 hectares of coca crops have been sprayed and more than 413,000 have been manually eradicated. Aerial spraying of illicit crops is both very expensive and ineffective - for each hectare sprayed with glyphosate, coca crops are reduced by about 0.02 to 0.065 hectares, so 32 hectares of coca need to be sprayed to eradicate just one hectare (an effectiveness rate of just 4.2%). The marginal cost of removing one kilogram of cocaine from the market through spraying is roughly $240,000. Aerial spraying has {{a negative impact on}} the environment (deforestation, water pollution, harm to ecosystems), health (skin problems, respiratory illnesses, miscarriages) and causes <b>internal</b> <b>displacement.</b> After 2006, Colombian anti-drug policies shifted towards interdiction strategies (cocaine seizures, lab destruction, dismantling cartels) which have been far more effective than eradication strategies. These policies caused a major supply shock (increasing the street price of cocaine in the US), greatly reduced the net cocaine supply and led to major changes in the drug trafficking operations (shifting towards Central America and Mexico). Juan Manuel Santos, who had been responsible for the post-2006 drug strategy as defence minister, continued these policies as president. The Colombian government now addresses drug consumption from a public health angle and advocates for alternative development strategies in vulnerable regions affected by coca cultivation, while adopting a [...] "rational and efficient" [...] strategy against criminal activities tied to drug trafficking. As part of this new policy, in October 2015 the government ordered the suspension of aerial aspersion with glyphosate.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} {{rigorous}} method for removing rigid-body motions from a given molecular dynamics trajectory of a flexible macromolecule. The method becomes exact in {{the limit of}} an infinitesimally small sampling step for the input trajectory. In a recent paper [G. Kneller, J. Chem. Phys. 128, 194101 (2008) ], one of us showed that virtual <b>internal</b> atomic <b>displacements</b> for small time increments can be derived from Gauss' principle of least constraint, which leads to a rotational superposition problem for the atomic coordinates in two consecutive time frames of the input trajectory. Here, we demonstrate that the accumulation of these displacements in a molecular-fixed frame, which evolves in time according to the virtual rigid-body motions, leads to the desired trajectory for internal motions. The atomic coordinates in the input and output trajectory are related by a roto-translation, which guarantees that the internal energy of the molecule is left invariant. We present a convenient implementation of our method, in which the accumulation of the <b>internal</b> <b>displacements</b> is performed implicitly. Two numerical examples illustrate the difference to the classical approach for removing macromolecular rigid-body motions, which consists of aligning its configurations in the input trajectory with a fixed reference structure...|$|R
