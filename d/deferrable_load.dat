Background: Islands often {{depend on the}} import of fossil fuels for power generation. Due to the combined effect of high oil prices and transportation costs, energy supply systems based on renewable energies are already able to compete successfully with fossil fuel systems {{for a number of}} these islands. Depending on local and regional conditions, not only energy supply is a challenge, but also the finding of a reliable supply of water. A promising alternative to freshwater shipments is seawater desalination. Desalination processes can act as a flexible load whenever excess electricity generated by renewable sources is present. Methods: Numerical simulations of combined energy and water supply systems for the Caribbean island Petite Martinique, Grenada, are accomplished. Considering renewable energy sources like wind and solar radiation, energy storage technologies, and desalination processes, various scenarios are introduced and simulated, and the results are compared. Results: An extension of the current energy supply system with renewable energy technologies reduces power generation costs by approximately 40 %. The excess energy generated by renewables can supply a significant share of a desalination plant’s energy demand. The levelized costs of electricity and water show that the integration of desalination as a <b>deferrable</b> <b>load</b> is beneficial to the considered micro grid. Conclusions: The implementation of renewable energy generation and desalination as <b>deferrable</b> <b>load</b> is recommendable in Petite Martinique.

40|$|Real-time demand {{response}} {{is an essential}} tool for handling the uncertainties associated with the increasing penetration of renewable generation.

The electricity consumption of these smaller loads, which we call deferrable loads, can be shifted over time, and can thus be used (in aggregate) to compensate for the random fluctuations in renewable generation. In this paper, we propose a real-time distributed <b>deferrable</b> <b>load</b> control algorithm to reduce the variance of aggregate load (load minus renewable generation) by shifting the power consumption of deferrable loads to periods with high renewable generation.

We formulate a constrained nonlinear programming problem and incorporate the theory of majorization to develop algorithms that can compute smoothness optimal schedules for the <b>deferrable</b> <b>load</b> dominant system. An effective heuristic algorithm is also presented by extending the majorization-based algorithm for the general scenario with both priority loads and deferrable loads. After obtaining the smooth power schedule, a distributed user benefit maximization load control scheme is used to allocate the scheduled power to individual users, while maximizing their levels of satisfaction. The analysis and simulation results demon-strate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms on smooth electric power scheduling, peak power minimization, and reducing power generation cost.

40|$|Motivated by {{environmental}} and energy security concerns, many states and countries have enacted legislation calling for increased renewable adoption in the electricity sector. Unlike conventional fossil fuel-based electricity sources, renewable {{resources such as}} wind and solar power are characterized by intermittent, uncertain, and non-dispatchable output. Successfully addressing this variability in renewable generation {{is a prerequisite for}} deep renewable penetration. The prevailing paradigm in most power systems, exemplified by programs such as the Participant Intermittent Renewable Program (PIRP) in California, is one where the system operator accepts all renewable generation and absorbs the attendant variability through operating reserves. This approach works today at modest renewable generation levels but will result in untenable increases in reserve requirements tomorrow when renewables serve a sizeable fraction of total electric load. Hence, meeting ambitious renewable penetration targets will require the implementation of a number of variability mitigation strategies across the entire spectrum of power system operations. In this dissertation, we identify and explore areas in which control and optimization techniques can help provide some of these solutions. One such mitigation strategy is the coordinated aggregation of deferrable loads and storage, in which load is tailored to match variable supply. We investigate methods of exploiting these demand-side capabilities by developing and evaluating algorithms for the real-time scheduling of these flexible resources. We note that the benefits of coordinated aggregation can be achieved at modest levels of both <b>deferrable</b> <b>load</b> participation and flexibility. We also provide an analytical framework for understanding how these resources influence the costs of meeting load requirements incurred in wholesale electricity markets. Specifically, we explore the interplay between <b>deferrable</b> <b>load</b> scheduling and cost-minimizing procurements of bulk power and reserve capacity made in the day-ahead forward market. Another solution we consider, specific to wind power, involves curtailing generator output in certain situations. We explore how a wind power producer - subject to financial penalties for imbalances from contracted amounts - might leverage power curtailment capability to mitigate financial risk arising from price and production uncertainty. In particular, we analytically quantify the economic benefit derived from curtailment as an explicit function of expected prices, and compute empirical estimates of this curtailment benefit using price data from the various power system operators...|$|E

To the best of our knowledge, there are few researches concentrated on microgrid configuration considering demand response. In [20, 21], island microgrid sizing optimization considering demand response is studied, but the demand response resource is the fixed seawater desalination load without considering different demand response participation degrees. The demand response participation degree (DRPD) [15, 18] is closely related to the interests of the demand response, but many of the current researches ignored the impact of the DRPD.

Rather than utility scale storage, smart grid technology (not restricted, but mainly involving bidirectional communication between the supply and demand side and dynamic pricing) enables flexible consumption to be a virtual storage alternative for moderation of the production of variable renewable energy sources on the micro grid level. A study, motivated with energy loss allocation, electric demand and the legal framework that is characteristic for the average Serbian household, was performed using the HOMER software tool.

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} deployment of photovoltaic (PV) units and energy storage systems (ESSs) in households. When the energy generated by PV units {{is greater than the}} aggregate load of households and the capacity of ESS, there will be a reverse energy flow from households to the substation. When the reverse energy flow exceeds a certain threshold, it will cause a voltage rise problem, which is a challenge for PV units to be effectively integrated with the distribution network. In this paper, we propose an energy consumption scheduling algorithm, which shifts the <b>deferrable</b> <b>load</b> (e. g., washing machines, dryers) from peak hours (e. g., 7 pm- 10 pm) to high solar radiation hours (e. g., 10 am- 2 pm) in order to jointly shave the peak load and reduce the reverse energy flow. We formulate the energy consumption scheduling problem as a stochastic optimization problem to capture the uncertainty of the amount of PV output power. The objective of our algorithm is to minimize the electricity bill for the household users which have PV units and ESS installed. We use inclining block rate (IBR) pricing and time of use (TOU) pricing to encourage users to shift their load.
