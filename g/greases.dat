5|$|The {{third most}} common use of lithium is in <b>greases.</b> Lithium {{hydroxide}} {{is a strong}} base and, when heated with a fat, produces a soap made of lithium stearate. Lithium soap {{has the ability to}} thicken oils, and it is used to manufacture all-purpose, high-temperature lubricating <b>greases.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{and use of}} lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium <b>greases</b> for aircraft engines and similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use {{was supported by the}} fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small demand for lithium soaps and lubricating <b>greases</b> was supported by several small mining operations, mostly in the US.|$|E
50|$|Waste from passive <b>grease</b> {{traps and}} gravity interceptors is called brown <b>grease.</b> Brown <b>grease</b> is rotted food solids in {{combination}} with fats, oils, and <b>grease</b> (FOG). Brown <b>grease</b> is pumped from the traps and interceptors by <b>grease</b> pumping trucks. Unlike the collected yellow <b>grease,</b> the majority of brown <b>grease</b> goes to landfill sites. New facilities (2012) and new technology are beginning to allow brown <b>grease</b> to be recycled.|$|R
5000|$|A third system type, GRDs (<b>grease</b> {{recovery}} devices), {{removes the}} <b>grease</b> automatically when trapped. The recovered <b>grease</b> or [...] "yellow grease" [...] is recycled with the waste vegetable {{oil from the}} kitchen's deep-fryers. Restaurants must not pay for <b>grease</b> trap pumping as do restaurants with conventional <b>grease</b> traps or <b>grease</b> interceptors.|$|R

5|$|GOI still {{produces}} {{and sells}} {{a wide range}} of branded oil based products including lubricants and <b>greases</b> of all kinds. These include products for a variety of applications ranging from metal working oils to refrigeration oils. Car engine oils include the Gulf Formula, Gulf MAX, and Gulf TEC ranges. Heavy duty diesel engine lubricants include the Gulf Supreme and Gulf Superfleet ranges.|$|E
5|$|Selected {{heavy metals}} {{are used as}} {{catalysts}} in fuel processing (rhenium, for example), synthetic rubber and fibre production (bismuth), emission control devices (palladium), and in self-cleaning ovens (where cerium(IV) oxide in the walls of such ovens helps oxidise carbon-based cooking residues). In soap chemistry, heavy metals form insoluble soaps {{that are used in}} lubricating <b>greases,</b> paint dryers, and fungicides (apart from lithium, the alkali metals and the ammonium ion form soluble soaps).|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum {{disulfide}} (MoS2) {{is used as}} a {{solid lubricant}} and a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) antiwear agent. It forms strong films on metallic surfaces and is a common additive to HPHT <b>greases</b> — {{in the event of a}} catastrophic grease failure, a thin layer of molybdenum prevents contact of the lubricated parts. It also has semiconducting properties with distinct advantages over traditional silicon or graphene in electronics applications. MoS2 is also used as a catalyst in hydrocracking of petroleum fractions containing nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen.|$|E
40|$|<b>Grease</b> is {{extensively}} used {{to lubricate}} various machine {{elements such as}} rollingbearings, seals, and gears. Understanding the flow dynamics of <b>grease</b> is relevant forthe prediction of the <b>grease</b> distribution for optimum lubrication and the migration ofwear- and contaminant particles. In this study <b>grease</b> flow is visualized using themethod of micro Particle Image Velocimetry; the experimental setup comprises aconcentric cylinder with rotating shaft to simulate the <b>grease</b> flow in a DoubleRestriction Seal (DRS) geometry with two different <b>grease</b> pocket heights. It is shownthat <b>grease</b> may be partially yielded in the large <b>grease</b> pocket geometry and fullyyielded in the small <b>grease</b> pocket geometry. For the small <b>grease</b> pocket geometry, itis shown that three distinct <b>grease</b> flow layers are present: a high shear rate regionclose to the stationary wall, a bulk flow layer, and a high shear rate boundary regionnear the rotating shaft. The <b>grease</b> shear thinning behaviour and its wall slip effectshave been detected and discussed. Godkänd; 2013; 20130408 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{document}} the potential for using waste <b>grease</b> as a feedstock, to locate the <b>grease,</b> and to document how much <b>grease</b> is available in South Carolina. This report looked at two major forms of waste grease: yellow <b>grease</b> and brown <b>grease.</b> The South Carolina Energy Office conducted two surveys of the waste <b>grease</b> collectors operating within the state. According to the survey results, 218, 100 gallons of brown <b>grease</b> are collected annually in the state.

GOI trades mainly in lubricants, oils, and <b>greases.</b> GOI is also involved in franchising the Gulf brand to operators in the petroleum and automotive sectors; Gulf-branded filling stations can be found in several countries including the UK, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Slovak & Czech Republics, the Netherlands, Jordan, Finland and Turkey. GOI has direct and indirect interests in a number of businesses that use the Gulf brand under license.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the price rose rapidly {{as a result}} of {{increasing}} demand for bismuth as a metallurgical additive to aluminium, iron and steel. This was followed by a decline owing to increased world production, stabilized consumption, and the recessions of 1980 and 1981–82. In 1984, the price began to climb as consumption increased worldwide, especially in the United States and Japan. In the early 1990s, research began on the evaluation of bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in ceramic glazes, fishing sinkers, food-processing equipment, free-machining brasses for plumbing applications, lubricating <b>greases,</b> and shot for waterfowl hunting. Growth in these areas remained slow during the middle 1990s, in spite of the backing of lead replacement by the US Government, but intensified around 2005. This resulted in a rapid and continuing increase in price.|$|E
25|$|Soaps are key {{components}} of most lubricating <b>greases,</b> which are usually emulsions of calcium soap or lithium soap and mineral oil. Many other metallic soaps are also useful, including those of aluminium, sodium, and mixtures of them. Such soaps are also used as thickeners to increase the viscosity of oils. In ancient times, lubricating <b>greases</b> {{were made by the}} addition of lime to olive oil.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fat, oil and <b>grease</b> are {{the three}} {{elements}} usually found in the municipal sewage systems as the results of improper disposal from the sink. These elements come from domestic and commercial kitchens. The absent or inefficient of a plumbing device known as <b>grease</b> trap has caused the trapped of fat, oil and <b>grease</b> in the sewage systems. There {{are two types of}} <b>grease</b> trap, namely Passive <b>Grease</b> Trap and Active <b>Grease</b> Trap. These <b>grease</b> types are collected and they can be recycled and used to produce an energy source, for example biodiesel. In Malaysia, the usages of passive <b>grease</b> traps are exercised. There are two parameters that govern the construction of the <b>grease</b> trap, namely retention time and flow rate. The ratio of sizing including the empirical formulations regarding the flow rate and the retention time will be discussed thoroughly in this paper. Furthermore, the {{understanding of the nature of}} the fat, oil and <b>grease</b> and the construction guideline for <b>grease</b> trap will be covered in this paper...|$|R

50|$|For <b>greased</b> bearings, the low {{pressures}} of lubrication before the <b>grease</b> fitting could often {{result in a}} failure of the <b>grease</b> to travel all the way down into all the voids of the bearing. The <b>grease</b> fitting improved this penetration, yielding more effective lubrication.|$|R
40|$|Water {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{contaminants}} in <b>grease</b> lubrication. There are numerous applications where bearings are susceptible to water ingresses such as in the steel, food, and pulp and paper industries. A <b>grease</b> can absorb water to different degrees depending upon the type of <b>grease.</b> The ability of a <b>grease</b> to either absorb or reject water can influence the service life of rolling bearings. Two parameters that determine the performance of a <b>grease</b> at very low temperature are the yield stress and startup torque. Water was found to influence the yield stress and startup torque depending on the operating temperature, <b>grease</b> type, and percentage water in the <b>grease...</b>|$|R

25|$|The type of {{alkali metal}} used determines {{the kind of}} soap product. Sodium soaps, {{prepared}} from sodium hydroxide, are firm, whereas potassium soaps, derived from potassium hydroxide, are softer or often liquid. Historically, potassium hydroxide was extracted {{from the ashes of}} bracken or other plants. Lithium soaps also tend to be hard—these are used exclusively in <b>greases.</b>|$|E
25|$|Silicones {{are often}} used in {{waterproofing}} treatments, molding compounds, mold-release agents, mechanical seals, high temperature <b>greases</b> and waxes, and caulking compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants, contact lenses, explosives and pyrotechnics. Silly Putty was originally made by adding boric acid to silicone oil. Other silicon compounds function as high-technology abrasives and new high-strength ceramics based upon silicon carbide. Silicon is a component of some superalloys.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to study the production of high temperature <b>grease</b> from waste lubricant sludge and silicone oil. The effects of different ratios of waste lubricant sludge to fumed silica and mixing time on <b>grease</b> characteristics were investigated. The ratios of waste lubricant sludge and fumed silica used were 100 : 0, 90 : 10, 80 : 20, 70 : 30, 60 : 40, 50 : 50 and 40 : 60. In terms of mixing time, it was varied at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hours. Throughout the experiment, the <b>grease</b> was prepared by using the heating and mixing technique. The <b>grease</b> produced was analysed according to the ASTM and NLGI standard via penetration test, dropping point test, copper corrosion test, FTIR and AAS. Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) analysis was carried out to study on the functional groups present in the <b>grease.</b> Atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis was also carried out to determine the concentration of a specific metal element in the <b>grease.</b> The {{results showed that the}} <b>grease</b> produced with a minimum ratio of fumed silica to sludge (10 : 90) was able to produce high temperature <b>grease</b> with a dropping point of 272. 5.

25|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is used in}} {{the home}} as a type of drain opener to unblock clogged drains, usually {{in the form of a}} dry crystal or as a thick liquid gel. The alkali dissolves <b>greases</b> to produce water soluble products. It also hydrolyzes the proteins such as those found in hair which may block water pipes. These reactions are sped by the heat generated when sodium hydroxide and the other chemical components of the cleaner dissolve in water. Such alkaline drain cleaners and their acidic versions are highly corrosive and should be handled with great caution.|$|E
