50|$|The Jeffersonian was an all-coach {{passenger}} train {{operated by the}} Pennsylvania Railroad between New York City, Washington, D.C., and St. Louis. Inaugurated in 1941, the services equaled that of the Trail Blazer, and it was equipped with modernized coaches, twin diners, and observation cars. In 1948, it was re-equipped with new lightweight cars and given a unique <b>car,</b> a <b>recreation</b> <b>car,</b> complete with a movie theater, game tables, and a playpen for kids. In 1956, the Jeffersonian was discontinued, and its cars went to other trains. Its coaches went to the Indianapolis Limited and Spirit of St. Louis (breaking that train's all-Pullman status). In addition, the General started carrying through cars to Washington, D.C. Its <b>recreation</b> <b>car</b> went to the Penn Texas.|$|R

40|$|Perception {{of safety}} is an {{important}} factor affecting the leisure behavior of Latinos residing in urban neighborhoods. Yet research on how fear of crime and fear of gangs in particular affect leisure of ethnic and racial minorities is underdeveloped. The ob-jectives of this study are to examine how <b>gangs</b> operate in <b>recreation</b> spaces in Latino neighborhoods, how gangs affect the use of outdoor recreation environments and how Latinos respond to these issues. The study is based on focus groups conducted with Latino residents in Chicago. Findings indicate gang members are almost constantly present in parks, which serve as spaces for drug use and distribution. Moreover, gangs operate {{in other areas of the}} neighborhood making it unsafe to access parks. Partic-ipants employ strategies to address the gang problem including avoidance, protective and collective behaviors.

It aired with the previous episode, [...] "William Henry Harrison" [...] , on the same day. The story picks up right where [...] "William Henry Harrison" [...] left off: the Parks & <b>Recreation</b> <b>gang</b> finds Leslie and Ron's rivalry cumbersome and locks them in a room together to hash things out. Because most of the episode only covers {{a short period of}} time, time cards appear during various points during Leslie and Ron's entrapment.|$|R
5000|$|The {{freedoms and}} <b>recreation</b> that <b>cars</b> {{provided}} {{led to the}} invention of car racing. Onlookers enjoyed this new form of racing and often made car purchases based on car models and brands in the race. This was one way that automotive companies were able to advertise for their new cars. In 1922, a contestant named Noel Bullock participated in the Pikes Peak, Colorado championship race with his Model T, named [...] "Old Liz." [...] "Old Liz" [...] was compared to a tin can due to its lack of paint and hood, which gave the car its nickname, [...] "Tin Liz." [...] Tin Liz's sturdiness and speed led to its winning of the race against all other expensive cars of the time. From that point on, [...] "Tin Lizzie" [...] became the name for all Model T cars, as its win was reported in newspapers throughout the country. This further popularized Ford cars, {{as well as the}} sport of auto racing. Auto racing eventually {{led to the development of}} NASCAR.|$|R
2500|$|On the {{northern}} slopes, {{close to the}} forest <b>recreation</b> area <b>car</b> park, is {{the remains of a}} wedge tomb. It was excavated in 1953 by H. E. Kilbride-Jones, aided by Rúaidhrí de Valera and Seán Ó Nualláin, of the Royal Irish Academy. The tomb consists of two chambers which were originally covered by a cairn of stones. Some of this material can be seen scattered around the tomb area. However, many of the stones were used as material for the stone walls built nearby. The main chamber is [...] long and [...] wide and is formed by a triple-walled gallery. This triple-walling is an unusual feature; most wedge tombs are double-walled. It faces towards the summit of Montpelier Hill where there once stood a passage tomb. At some point during the Bronze Age, parts of the chamber were dismantled and used for the construction of three stone-lined cists which were inserted into the cairn material. One cist has had its capstone moved aside so that its chamber is visible. Two middle Bronze Age food vessels and a late Bronze Age cinerary urn were found in the cists during the excavation.|$|R
50|$|Smog Watch, {{also known}} as the Anti-Idling Sign, is a {{voluntary}} government protocol to prevent the Seattle, Washington, region from exceeding the federal health standards in relation to ozone. It aims at protection of public health during summers, where ozone levels are often found to be the highest. At certain times during the summer, agency meteorologists will issue a smog watch for 48 hours when there are elevated smog levels. During this 48-hour period, citizens of the Seattle district are encouraged to lower smog levels by taking steps to decrease pollution, including by: driving less, refueling when it is cool, refraining from using lawn mowers, partaking in pollution-free <b>recreation,</b> turning off <b>car</b> engines while idling, and volunteering for environmental sustainability programs.|$|R

40|$|Transit-oriented {{development}} (TOD), as {{a sustainable}} supporting strategy, emphasizes {{the improvement of}} public transportation coverage and quality, land use density and diversity around public transportation stations and priority of walking and cycling at station areas. Traffic, environmental and economic problems arising from high growth of private cars, inappropriate distribution of land use, and car-orientation of the metropolitan area, necessitate adoption of TOD. In recent years, extensive research into urban development and transportation has focused on this strategy. This research in which metro stations are considered {{as a base for}} development, aims to model metro users' travel behavior and decision-making procedures. In this regard, the research question is: what are the parameters or factors affecting the frequency of travel by metro in a half-mile radius from stations. The radius was determined based on TOD definitions and five-minute walking time to metro stations. A questionnaire was designed in three sections that include travel features by metro, attitudes toward metro, and economic and social characteristics of respondents. Ten stations were selected based on their geographic dispersion in Tehran and a sample of 450 respondents was determined. The questionnaires were surveyed face to face in (half-mile) vicinity of metro stations. Based on a refined sample on 400 questionnaires ordered discrete choice models were considered. Results of descriptive statistics show that 38. 5 percent of the sample used metro more than 4 times per week. Trip purpose for 45. 7 percent of metro users is work. Access mode to the metro stations for nearly half of the users (47. 6 percent) is bus. The results of ordered logit models show a number of significant variables including: habit of using the metro, waiting time in stations, trip purpose (working, shopping and <b>recreation),</b> personal <b>car</b> access mode to the metro station, walking access mode to the metro station and being a housewife...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{specialised}} camping programmes, {{based largely}} on the premise of therapeutic recreation, have emerged {{as a form of}} intervention for children with chronic illnesses, and their siblings. Although these programmes are proliferating, little systematic evaluation of their outcomes has been undertaken, particularly within a European context. The aim of this research was to investigate the symptom and psychosocial outcomes of The Barretstown <b>Gang</b> Camp therapeutic <b>recreation</b> programme in Ireland, a programme aimed at European children with chronic illnesses and their siblings, in the short and longer term. Measures assessing children's physical, psychological and social functioning, specifically their self-reported physical symptoms, affect, self-esteem and quality of life, were translated into 12 European languages and administered at 3 time periods: 2 weeks before each child participated in the programme (Time 1), 2 weeks after participation (Time 2) and at 6 months following participation (Time 3). Benefits were noted in their experience of physical symptoms, affect pertaining to physiological hyperarousal and quality of life in the short and longer term. Positive changes were also noted in relation to self-esteem as it pertains to global self-worth and physical attractiveness though these were, for the most part, in the longer term only and were preceded by adverse effects in the short term. While some of these positive changes were global, there were group differences based mostly on children's age, and patient/sibling status {{and to a lesser extent}} on their nationality. However, no benefits were evident in many aspects of children's functioning, either at a global or a group level, in the short and longer term. These findings clarify previous research and suggest that camping programmes have an important role to play as a complementary intervention in facilitating adjustment to chronic illness.
