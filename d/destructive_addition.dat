40|$|AbstractWireless {{communication}} {{is currently the}} most dynamic field with the invention of new technologies. Presently {{one of the main}} challenges in the wireless communication field is to combat fading. At the receiver, the signal may be lost completely due to <b>destructive</b> <b>addition</b> of multi paths signal components. Generally effect of fading is analyzed with channel compensation using different diversity combining schemes such as selection diversity, equal gain combining and maximal ratio combining techniques. Selection diversity is one of the preferred schemes due to its simplest implementation process. However, often channel estimation may not be perfect because of changing nature and other factors like correlation between the signals etc. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} observe the effect of imperfect channel estimation on the performance of the receiver. Analysis has been done for channel estimation along with selection diversity combining. Also, receiver may not be synchronized always with transmitter giving some phase errors. Such error is also incorporated along with selection diversity for performance evaluation of the system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the scattering properties of woven fibrous materials {{in order to}} model the interactions between the scattered radiation from individual fibers. A normally incident plane electromagnetic wave is considered and different representative geometries are analyzed theoretically. Experimental results are presented for specific woven thermal insulation fabrics. Previous studies in the literature have mostly ignored the effect of constructive or <b>destructive</b> <b>addition</b> of scattered waves from individual fibers {{with the exception of}} the case of parallel fibers. Whereas the light-scattering characteristics of a single long fiber depend only on the size parameter and on the material optical constants, the additional mechanism of interference between the scattered waves from fibers of parallel or perpendicular orientation introduces an additional dependence on fiber locations. In this study, analytical models are developed for obtaining the radiative scattering characteristics of woven fibrous media taking into account the mechanism of interference. Experimental measurements of forward- and backward-scattered light from a woven silica cloth over a broad range of wavelengths in the infrared are obtained and compared with the predicted results for a system of two orthogonal families of infinite parallel fibers...|$|E
30|$|The major {{challenges}} in future wireless communications systems are increased spectral efficiency and improved link reliability. The wireless channel constitutes a hostile propagation medium, which suffers from fading (caused by <b>destructive</b> <b>addition</b> of multipath components) and interference from other users. Diversity provides the receiver with several (ideally independent) {{replicas of the}} transmitted signal and is therefore a powerful means to combat fading and interference and thereby improve link reliability. Common forms of diversity are space-time diversity [1] and space-frequency diversity [2]. In recent years the use of spatial (or antenna) diversity has become very popular, which is mostly {{due to the fact}} that it can be provided without loss in spectral efficiency. Receive diversity, that is, the use of multiple antennas on the receiver side of a wireless link, is a well-studied subject [3]. Driven by mobile wireless applications, where it is difficult to deploy multiple antennas in the handset, the use of multiple antennas on the transmitter side combined with signal processing and coding has become known under the name of space-time coding [4] and is currently an active area of research. The use of multiple antennas at both ends of a wireless link (multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology) has been demonstrated to have the potential of achieving extraordinary data rates [5]. The corresponding technology is known as spatial multiplexing [6] or BLAST [7] and yields an impressive increase in spectral efficiency. Most of the previous work in the area of MIMO wireless has been restricted to narrow-band systems. Besides spatial diversity broadband MIMO channels, however, offer to higher capacity and frequency diversity due to delay spread. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) significantly reduces receiver complexity in wireless broadband systems. The use of MIMO technology in combination with OFDM, that is, MIMO-OFDM [6], therefore seems to be an attractive solution for future broadband wireless systems [8, 9]. However, intercarrier interference (ICI) due to Doppler shifts, phase offset, local oscillator frequency shifts, and multi-path fading severely degrades the performance of OFDM systems [10]. Most of the channel estimation methods assume a linear time-invariant model for the channel, which is not valid for the next-generation, fast-moving environments [11]. Recently a time-frequency varying MIMO-OFDM channel estimation approach is presented where discrete prolate spheroidal sequences are used to obtain a robust time-varying channel estimator that does not require any channel statistics [12]. A time-varying model of the channel can be obtained by employing time-frequency representation methods. Here we present a time-varying MIMO-OFDM channel estimation based on the discrete evolutionary representation of the channel output. The Discrete Evolutionary Transform (DET) [13] provides a time-frequency representation of the received signal by means of which the spreading function of the multi-path, fading, and frequency selective channel can be modeled and estimated.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new tomographic imaging method using multiple wavelengths in digital holographic microscopy. It {{is based on}} the addition of several reconstructed wavefronts measured at different wavelengths. The resulting diffraction tomographic visibility is then enhanced and the position of the interfaces is determined with ultrahigh precision. Digital holographic microscopy is a method enabling the recording of complex wavefronts and its numerical reconstruction. In our case, it {{is based on the}} recording, in off-axis geometry, of the interference between a reference wave and an object wave reflected by a microscopic specimen and magnified by a microscope objective. A couple charged device (CCD) camera records consecutively the resulting holograms at several wavelengths equally separated in the frequency domain. An adapted reconstruction algorithm has been developed to perform an achromatic reconstruction of the different wavefronts. Tomography is then performed by adding the reconstructed wavefronts. Each wavefront phase is individually adjusted to be equal in a given plane of interest. The result of this operation is a constructive addition of complex waves in the selected plane and <b>destructive</b> <b>addition</b> in the others. The amplitude image is attenuated according to a function, called filter function. For perfectly constructive phases no attenuation is present. Varying the plane of interest enables the scan of the object in depth. The obtained diffraction tomographic resolution is better than the one obtained in OCT, with an equivalent spectral width, in low-coherence or short-pulse lasers in optical coherence tomography. Nevertheless, no axial scanning is needed and the shape of the spectrum can be post acquisition tailored. A method is then proposed to enhance the visibility and to precisely determine the position of the interfaces. An axial scan allows the extraction of depth profiles. The maxima detection and a least square fit algorithm are used to perform this enhancement. Moreover, weights are introduced in the addition of the wavefronts, in order to tailor the filter function. Different weights distributions are discussed in terms of separation limit and precision on the interface position. It is shown that position resolution increases for higher separation limit. Finally, the tomographic method has been simplified for cases of a total reflective surface to perform topography. This allows measurements on specimen of several microns high without phase ambiguities. The results are directly measured in optical pathlengths. Experimental measurements have been performed on a specifically designed and homemade target, as well as on a multilayer specimen. Twenty wavelengths in the range of 480 - 700 nm have been used, resulting in tomographic sections of 725 nm. It is shown that the experimental results perfectly correspond the simulations. Enhanced tomographic results show a separation limit of 725 nm with a position resolution under 130 nm. Measures performed using the Kaiser weight distribution allow a position resolution of a few nanometers, for an increasing separation limit to 3 µm...|$|E

In fact, {{the exchange of}} energy and water with the atmosphere, the mechanisms of flood generation {{as well as the}} infiltration of water and contaminant into the subsurface are primarily controlled by the presence of water in the pores of shallow soils. At the same time, the estimation of moisture content in the shallow subsurface is a difficult task. Direct measurements of water content require the recovery of soil samples for laboratory analyses: sampling is invasive and often <b>destructive.</b> In <b>addition,</b> these data are generally insufficient to yield a good spatial coverage for basin-scale investigations. In-situ assessment of soil-moisture contents, possibly at the scale of interest for distributed catchment-scale models, is therefore necessary. The goal {{of this paper is to}} assess the information contained in surface-to-surface GPR surveys for moisture content estimation under dynamic conditions. GPR data are compared against and integrated with TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) data. TDR and surface-to-surface GPR data act at different spatial scales and two different frequency ranges. TDR, in particular, is widely used to estimate soil water content, e. g. converting bulk dielectric constant into volumetric water content values. GPR used in surface-to-surface configuration has been used increasingly to quickly image soil moisture content over large areas. Direct GPR wave velocity is measured in the ground. However, in the presence of shallow and thin low-velocity soil layers, such as the one generated by an infiltrating water front, dispersive, guided GPR waves are generated and the direct ground wave is not identifiable as a simple arrival.

It has prepared by reinforcing BBJS fibers with epoxy resin and hardener in matrix by using hand layup technique. The reinforcing material may be in the form of fibers, particles or flakes. Reinforcement usually adds rigidity and greatly impedes fracture promulgation. Skinny fibers can have high potency, and provided they are mechanically well attached to the matrix they can greatly improve the composite's overall properties. Fibres are used to carry the load and matrix is used to bind and transmit the load to fibers. The natural fibers were prepared from the raw material by retting and combing process.

Stimulation of cells with PMA increased mRNA expression {{as well as the}} secretion of IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, and IL- 8, and induced the de novo expression of IL- 8 receptors. Xenotransplantation into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice by intravenous or subcutaneous inoculation led to development of disseminated tumors with infiltrative and <b>destructive</b> growth. In <b>addition</b> lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, and infiltration of spleen were observed. Morphological and immunological analysis of tumor cells revealed the same features as HD-MyZ cells. This cell line might be an important tool for understanding the pathogenesis and biology of HD. In addition the SCID mice model might prove helpful in developing new therapeutic strategies...|$|R
40|$|Maternally {{deposited}} carotenoids are {{a prominent}} component of egg yolk and are vital {{for the development}} and growth of the embryo. In most studies of avian yolk carotenoids, eggs are destructively sampled and this may limit both the number of clutches studied and the research questions addressed. We describe an empirical field trial for a nondestructive biopsy method to extract small samples (0. 05 ml) of egg yolk for highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of yolk carotenoid concentrations. We sampled 180 clutches (N = 44 biopsies) of two species of introduced thrushes (genus Turdus) from agricultural habitats in central North Island, New Zealand. Once the protocol was established, all biopsied eggs from clutches that were not depredated or deserted before candling {{were found to be}} developing normally after 3 – 5 d of incubation (N = 28) and all hatched. Biopsy samples (> 0. 02 g) produced concentrations of yolk carotenoids (and variances) that were statistically indistinguishable from whole yolk <b>destructive</b> samples. In <b>addition,</b> our samples (> 0. 02 g) confirmed previously reported differences in yolk carotenoid concentrations between the two thrush species and revealed a significant decline in yolk carotenoid concentration with laying order. Further examination of how variability in yolk carotenoid concentration and identity influences offspring sex, success, and survival or, later in life, reproductive success and ability to efficiently incorporate dietary carotenoids into both integument and immune tissues will require larger sample sizes. Studies to date have been restricted by the number of destructive samples that investigators are willing (or permitted) to obtain from wild species. Thus, we hope that our nondestructive method of sampling yolk will promote further examination of the links between carotenoid uptake from the environment and maternal investment in the avian yolk.

40|$|An {{improved}} technique, {{and electronic}} circuitry {{to implement the}} technique, {{have been developed for}} a military-standard electromagnetic-compatibility (EMC) test in which one analyzes susceptibility to low-frequency ripple conducted into the equipment under test via a DC power line. In the traditional technique for performing the particular test, the ripple is coupled onto the DC power line via a transformer. Depending upon some design details of the equipment under test, the inductance of the transformer can contribute a degree of instability that results in an oscillation of amplitude large enough to destroy the equipment. It is usually possible to suppress the oscillation by connecting a damping resistor to the primary terminals of the ripple-injection transformer. However, it is important to emphasize the usually in the preceding sentence: sometimes, the resistive damping becomes insufficient to suppress <b>destructive</b> oscillation. In <b>addition,</b> undesirably, the resistor contributes to power dissipation and power demand, and thereby also necessitates the use of a larger ripple voltage amplifier. Yet another disadvantage of the transformer-coupling technique is that the transformer introduces low-frequency distortion of the injected ripple voltage. The improved technique makes it possible to inject ripple with very low distortion at low frequency, without inducing oscillation. In this technique, a transformer is not used: Instead, power is fed to the equipment under test via series power field-effect transistors (FETs) controlled by a summing operational amplifier. One of the inputs to the amplifier controls the DC component of the power-line voltage; the other input, generated by an external oscillator, controls the ripple component. The circuitry for implementing this technique includes panel displays, an internal power supply for the operational amplifier and panel displays, and amplitude controls for the DC and ripple powerline voltage components...|$|R
40|$|This {{portion of}} the Short Course {{is divided into two}} {{segments}} to separately address the two major proton-related effects confronting satellite designers: ionization effects and displacement damage effects. While both of these topics are deeply rooted in "traditional" descriptions of space radiation effects, there are several factors at play to cause renewed concern for satellite systems being designed today. For example, emphasis on Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technologies in both commercial and government systems increases both Total Ionizing Dose (TID) and Single Event Effect (SEE) concerns. Scaling trends exacerbate the problems, especially with regard to SEEs where protons can dominate soft error rates and even cause <b>destructive</b> failure. In <b>addition,</b> proton-induced displacement damage at fluences encountered in natural space environments can cause degradation in modern bipolar circuitry as well as in many emerging electronic and opto-electronic technologies. A crude, but nevertheless telling, indication of the level of concern for proton effects follows from surveying the themes treated in papers presented at this conference. The table lists themes found in the IEEE Transaction on Nuclear Science (TNS) December issue from the past year and compares them with the December issue's content a decade earlier. Ten years ago there were nine papers, or about 10 % of the total, dealing with the four indicated topics. At that time, single event effects from protons were the primary concern, and these were thought to be possible only when a nuclear reaction initiated energetic recoil atoms. This is shown in the table as the 'traditional" SEE subject. A decade later, submissions addressing this topic had doubled, while papers devoted to displacement damage studies had increased from one to nine! More importantly, displacement damage effects in the natural space environments have become a concern for degradation in modern devices (other than solar cells), and this was not so ten years earlier...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{theoretical}} and experimental examination of two-photon direct frequency comb spectroscopy (DFCS) using atomic two-level systems. This method {{is a very}} promising tool to extend optical spectroscopy into the short wavelength region where only few cw laser sources exist. The high peak intensities of pulsed lasers facilitate efficient nonlinear conversion into frequency regions which are so far unexplored, for example by high harmonic generation (HHG). DFCS is based on theoretical work in the 1970 s which showed that a pulse train of a mode-locked laser drives a two-photon transition as efficient as a cw laser of same average power. Thereby the effective line width {{is determined by the}} narrow width of a single comb mode rather than by the spectral width of a single pulse. In this way a frequency comb combines the spectral purity of a cw laser with the high peak intensity of a pulsed laser. To demonstrate the capability of a nonlinearly converted frequency comb for DFCS, the absolute frequency of a two-photon transition in $^{ 24 }$Mg at 431 ~nm was measured in a first experiment. The accuracies of the values could be improved by more than two orders of magnitude with respect to previously reported values. Furthermore two crucial effects which affect the transition rates were analyzed quantitatively for the first time: the impact of a linear chirp and non-centered spectral envelope on the spectroscopy. In general the pulses of a nonlinear converted frequency comb are not bandwidth limited leading to a partially <b>destructive</b> pairwise <b>addition</b> of modes. To describe the impact of a linear chirp a theoretical model was developed and verified experimentally using two-photon spectroscopy on cesium. Moreover, theory and experiment have shown a Gaussian decrease in the transition rate with increasing detuning of the laser spectrum. %Another important aspect is the centering of the laser spectrum with respect to the atomic transition. Theory and experiment show here a Gaussian decrease in the transition rate with increasing detuning. Finally the progress of $ 1 S - 3 S$ spectroscopy in hydrogen is presented. This transition is a promising candidate for a test of bound state quantum electrodynamics. Using cw lasers the required wavelength of 205 ~nm is hard to generate, making this transition to an eligible system for DFCS. Beside the experimental achievements also the lessons learned from Cs and Mg spectroscopy and their consequences for the H spectroscopy are discussed. In the scope of this work a frequency quadrupled laser system was extended and improved, providing ps frequency combs of high average power and good beam profile at 820 ~nm, 410 ~nm and 205 ~nm. An overall output power of max. 100 ~mW is now available at 205 ~nm, the up to date highest power generated by SHG. Moreover for H spectroscopy a new spectrometer was designed and built...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} role of values in the problem-solving and decision-making activities of leaders using an established and validated theory on the content and structure of personal values. Undergraduate student participants completed a managerial assessment center that required them to solve managerial problems, complete an in-basket exercise, and respond to several questionnaires. Participants 2 ̆ 7 past leadership activities were assessed along with their willingness to engage in destructive leader behavior {{and their ability to}} generate original, high quality solutions to leadership problems. Destructiveness was defined as striving for personal gains over collective organizational interests and/or focusing on short-term gains over long-term organizational goals. Results revealed that achievement values and power values were positively related to leader emergence whereas hedonism goals were negatively related to leader emergence. Participants 2 ̆ 7 value systems were also found to predict their willingness to engage in <b>destructive</b> behavior. In <b>addition,</b> having an authority figure support destructiveness moderated the effect of values such that {{with the support of the}} company president, participants with self-enhancement values were more destructive than were those with self-transcendence values. These groups did not differ when the authority support was not present. Results also showed that participants 2 ̆ 7 defined an ambiguous leadership problem in a manner that reflected their personal values, which mediated the relationship between values and solution destructiveness. Although personal values influenced problem definitions and the destructiveness of problem solutions, they did not directly affect the quality, originality, or creativity of the problem solutions. However, participants who engaged in problem construction generated solutions that were more original, higher in quality, and more creative than did participants who did not engage in problem construction. Overall, results of this study provided empirical support for the popular assertion that personal values play an important role in organizational leadership. Implications of the results for today 2 ̆ 7 s organizational are discussed along with suggestions for future empirical research that will help to delineate further the complex influence personal values have on organizational behavior. ...|$|R
