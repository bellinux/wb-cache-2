A close study of these banknotes reveals an interesting array of subsets which were printed by two banknote printing companies (Bradbury Wilkinson and Thomas de La Rue). The notes were also designed at different time periods as {{there are very few}} identical and consistent design features appearing on all the denominations. Varying banknote numbering systems, different types of security threads, variations in the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> of the Mauritian Coat of Arms, different ultraviolet light latent printing, inconsistent variations in the size incrementation between the denominations and multiple different typesets {{are just a few of}} the differences. This issue lasted up to 1998.|$|E

Inside, instead of the stone vaulted ceiling of a Norman cathedral, there are hammer beams supporting a ceiling of pitched wood and a stone pointed arch acts as a simple proscenium to the central pulpit. Above this diffused light enters through a rose window of stained glass. This is flanked by further lights on the lower level, while twin organ pipes emphasise the symmetry of the pulpit.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the Dutch {{aircraft}} manufacturer, Fokker, realising that the {{increasing use of}} jet-powered fighters meant that existing piston-engined advanced trainers had insufficient performance, started design of a jet-engined advanced trainer, the S.14 Machtrainer. According to Harker the idea for a Dutch jet trainer originated after Rolls-Royce approached Fokker with drawings for a Derwent-powered jet trainer. Rolls-Royce feared losing the large market for jet trainers to the Goblin-powered Vampire and, after an unsuccessful attempt to interest Miles Aircraft in producing a Derwent-powered competitor, approached Fokker. The S.14 was a low-winged monoplane of all-metal construction. In order to aid use in its role as a trainer, the crew of two sat side by side on Martin-Baker ejection seats, with room in the spacious cockpit for a third crew member, although this capability was never used. This gave a fairly wide fuselage. It had a retractable tricycle undercarriage, and was powered by a single Rolls-Royce Derwent engine mounted in the centre fuselage, fed from air inlets in the aircraft's nose. Three airbrakes were fitted to the rear fuselage. The wing <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>size</b> allowed for the aircraft to land at much lower speeds than most jet aircraft at the time.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, these uniforms became outdated. The Fechheimer Bros. of Cincinnati {{created some}} uniforms for OSU. These uniforms {{were the same}} navy blue as the {{previous}} uniforms, except the buttons were changed to silver. At this time the chin straps and Eagle Ohio were also changed to silver. The plumes took on the modern red and gray appearance and were constructed of tough turkey feathers. The spats were changed from cloth to vinyl during this time as well. The shoulder patches changed <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>size.</b> The uniforms changed very little from the 1970s until 1988, except for things like hat manufacturer, a short period in which a large metal diamond Ohio replaced the Eagle Ohio, {{and the use of}} aluminum hat bands instead of the silver adjustable type. After the directorship of Charles Spohn, the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma recognition bars were no longer authorized for wear on the OSUMB uniform. During the expansion years in the 1970s, many uniforms dating back to the 1940s had to be dug out of storage and updated with the current patch designs of the band. To a careful and up-close observer, one would notice significant differences in the cut and style of the uniforms being worn. Even hats were not standardized. The only common thread among the uniforms was the color, which even began to fade on older uniforms. It was common practice for band members to use black marker to fix frayed parts of the uniform which exposed white cotton lining. These uniforms also had to be used by the Military band, and were falling apart. Pieces were sourced as needed from manufacturers such as Ostwald, Bayly, Frechheimer, and DeMoulin Brothers. The Fechheimer Corporation began producing a police uniform in the 1980s that matched the design of the Marching Band uniforms. These eventually became the standard replacement uniform coat until 1989, when Dr. Woods commissioned a new uniform style.|$|E

The <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizing</b> of the Salesiana Polytechnic University campus Girón Emergency Electrical System born from the need to provide a continuous electrical service, satisfying the electrical energy needs in the different working areas of the administrative personal and of teachers. In this sense, the research work has been structured in such a way to define in general terms the different steps for the realization of the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizing</b> of the emergency electrical system, this is, from the emergency generator group to the farthest load. This research project consists of five chapters: the first chapter allows to know how is the Salesiana Polytechnic University campus Girón electrically and how is the equipment to be used for the load census. The second chapter refers to the determination of the load and of installed demand. The third chapter orders the conceptual elements and theoretical bases suitable for the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizing</b> of the emergency electrical system. The fourth chapter is the core of the research, because, in this chapter, all calculations are performed for the correct sizing of the emergency generator group with their respective automatic transfer boards, protections and drivers. In the referential budget are contained the economic technical analysis and the corresponding implementation feasibility, because in this chapter was realized the total project investment analysis, {{in order to make a}} viable project in the short and medium term. The fifth chapter discusses the test protocols of emergency generator groups to be installed. Thus, this work allows to give the necessary guidelines and guidance needed for the implementation of the emergency generator groups. The whole process of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizing</b> is based on the right application of technical and economic criteria, to ensure a XXII lifetime of equipment, thus providing a continuous work in the administrative and teaching work hours and satisfying the expectations of all the people who make the Salesiana Polytechnic University campus Girón...|$|R

At first, the role of hypersonic transportation systems within the current market is sketched.

During the description of the case study, the nominal mission trajectory is examined in detail, pointing out the major mission phases and the subsystems' modes of operation. The proposed design methodology starts with the identification of the major requirements that will lead the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>sizing</b> activities. Then, a special attention is devoted to the identification of the major functionalities of the Cabin Escape System and to the selection of the proper subsystems able to guarantee them. Indeed, considering the high level of complexity of such a system, during the design process, specific attention should be paid to the impact of onboard systems integration on the overall transportation system architecture and layout. At this purpose, a proper utilization of CAD model can ease the integration process allowing fast verification of mass and volume budgets. Furthermore, the possibility of exploiting this system during the different phases of the mission has been evaluated and, eventually, a preliminary impact risk analysis is reporte...|$|R
