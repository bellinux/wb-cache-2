25|$|On September 17, 2012, a {{man from}} the Republic of Kiribati was rescued after being at sea for 105 days. The man said that a shark swam around the boat and took it off in a direction. He {{followed}} it and as he followed it with his eyes <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> there was the stern of a purse seiner with a bunch of crewmen with binoculars looking at him.|$|E
25|$|Not long afterward, {{during the}} heat of the day, Abraham had been sitting at the {{entrance}} of his tent by the terebinths of Mamre. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> saw three men in the presence of God. Then he ran and bowed to the ground to welcome them. Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, to which they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah's tent to order cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them, waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate.|$|E

Both times as he crossed home plate, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> pointed to the sky. [...] "That was for him", Youkilis said. [...] "There are some crazy things that have happened in my life. You ... feel like there's somebody out there somewhere pushing balls out for you, and doing great things." ...|$|E

500|$|Schulz {{was one of}} {{the larger}} {{football}} players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter. [...] Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. [...] He recalled: [...] "We were playing Oberlin in 1904. [...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] I hit him as hard as I could. [...] Imagine my surprise when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> said, 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the rest of the afternoon. [...] Every time I looked at the little fellow, I had to break out laughing".|$|E
500|$|In September 1833, after {{traveling}} to the French village of Besançon to find cheap paper for a publishing enterprise, Balzac crossed into Switzerland and registered at the Hôtel du Faucon under the name Marquis d'Entragues. He sent word to Hańska that he would visit the garden of the Maison Andrié, {{where she and her}} family were staying. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> saw her face at the window, then– as he described it later– he [...] "lost all bodily sensation". They met later that day (September 25) at a spot overlooking Lake Neuchâtel; according to legend, he noticed a woman reading one of his books. He was overwhelmed with her beauty, and she wrote soon afterwards to her brother, describing Balzac as [...] "cheerful and lovable just like you".|$|E
2500|$|NFL {{executive}} Bill Granholm {{recalled that}} it was Hirsch's ability to make the overhead or over-the-shoulder catch that set him apart: [...] "He would run down the field with his chin {{high in the air}} -- with his head all the way back. Under a long pass, he didn't look left or right as they do today -- <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> back at the ball as it came to him [...] over his head[...] [...] [...] e put his head between the ball and the defensive back. That's how he caught so many bombs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clouds {{of black}} smoke were {{observed}} by several people on agricultural properties {{to the west of}} Winton. [...] One was a station hand working on the tower of a windmill. [...] He was aware of the noise of an aircraft in the distance. [...] The noise suddenly stopped so <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> saw a cloud {{of black smoke}} in the sky. [...] Two burning objects were falling from the smoke towards the ground. [...] When one of the falling objects struck the ground he saw a bright flash followed by a rising column of black smoke. A number of people in Winton observed the cloud of black smoke in the air {{to the west of the}} town, followed by two columns of dense black smoke rising from ground level.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), as Abraham {{was sitting in}} the {{entrance}} of his tent by the terebinths of Mamre {{in the heat of the}} day, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> saw God in the form of three men. [...] He ran, bowed to the ground, and welcomed them. Abraham offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, and they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah's tent to order cakes made from choice flour, ran to select a choice calf for a servant-boy to prepare, set curds and milk and the calf before them, and waited on them under the tree as they ate. One of the visitors told Abraham that he would return the next year, and Sarah would have a son, but Sarah laughed to herself at the prospect, with Abraham so old. God then questioned Abraham why Sarah had laughed at bearing a child at her age, noting that nothing was too wondrous for God. The first reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} round of the main Wimbledon draw, in the biggest win of his career Levine upset world # 24 (and former world # 1, and two-time Grand Slam champion) Marat Safin of Russia 6–2, 3–6, 7–6(7–4), 6–4. [...] Levine was ranked 133rd going into the tournament. [...] The Guardian {{described}} Levine as [...] "a feisty little terrier who kept harrying away at his towering opponent", and The New York Times noted that [...] "If you stand them side by side" [...] Levine and Safin [...] "look a little like David and Goliath. [...] Levine ... is seven inches (178 mm) [...] shorter and 45 pounds lighter than Safin, but when it counted ... the American was faster and stronger." [...] When Levine clinched the win <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> pointed into the sky in acknowledgement of his grandmother Lillian Kimmel, who had died three years prior. Safin said that he had known before the match that Levine was a [...] "talented lefty, tough player, fast ... gonna go for it. [...] He's a tough one." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), the servant brought out silver, gold, and {{garments}} for Rebekah and presents for {{her brother and}} her mother. Then the servant and his party ate, drank, and spent the night. The next morning, the servant asked leave to return to Abraham, but Laban and her mother asked that Rebekah remain a period of time. The servant persisted, so they called Rebekah to ask for her reply, and she agreed to go. So they blessed Rebekah — wishing that her children be thousands of myriads and seize the gates of their foes — and they sent off Rebekah and her nurse with the servant. Isaac had {{just come back from}} the vicinity of Beer-lahai-roi to his home in the Negeb and was out walking in the field toward evening when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> saw camels approaching. Raising her eyes, Rebekah saw Isaac, alighted from the camel, and asked the servant who the man was. The servant said that Isaac was his master, so she covered herself with her veil. The servant told Isaac everything that had happened, and Isaac brought her into Sarah's tent and took her as his wife. Isaac loved Rebekah, and found comfort after his mother's death. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and the long first open portion ( [...] , petuchah) end here with the end of chapter ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E
