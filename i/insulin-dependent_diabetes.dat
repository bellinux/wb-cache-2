5000|$|Insulin-dependent (type I)diabetes {{mellitus}} [...] (IDDM) is {{a genetic}} heterogenouse autoimmune disorder, which is triggered by genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The prevalence of <b>insulin-dependent</b> (type I) <b>diabetes</b> mellitus (IDDM) among {{children and young}} adult from Europe is approximately 0.4%. <b>Insulin-dependent</b> (type I) <b>diabetes</b> mellitus (IDDM) is characterized by acute onset and insulin deficiency. Patients with <b>insulin-dependent</b> (type I) <b>diabetes</b> mellitus (IDDM) are found with gradual loss of the pancreatic islet beta cells and therefore not able to produce insulin. As a result, they usually need exogenous insulin to maintain their life.|$|R
40|$|Background: Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a chronic}} disease {{and one of}} the main causes of mortality in developing countries. The main objective of treating all chronic diseases, of course, is to improve well-being and attain a satisfactory quality of life (QOL). The major goal of this study is comparison of attitude toward QOL in <b>insulin-dependent</b> subjects with <b>diabetes</b> mellitus and healthy subjects. Methods: In this study, <b>insulin-dependent</b> subjects with <b>diabetes</b> mellitus and healthy subjects were gathered via convenience sampling. The subjects were asked to complete the Hanestad & Albrektsen Attitude to Quality of Life Questionnaire. The questionnaire evaluates five quality of life dimensions-physical, social, mental-emotional, behavioral-activity, and economic-using a scoring system similar to the Likert scale. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare scores between the two groups. Results: The mean total score on attitude toward QOL in the healthy control group was 53. 8, and it in the <b>insulin-dependent</b> subjects with <b>diabetes</b> mellitus group was 35. 9. The mean total score of attitude toward QOL in the physical dimension, mentalemotional and feelings of well-being dimension, and behavioral-activity dimension were significantly higher in the healthy population than they were in diabetes mellitus groups. Such a difference was not seen in the social and economic dimensions. Conclusion: Since the attitudes of <b>insulin-dependent</b> subjects with <b>diabetes</b> mellitus toward QOL are used as an index of individual and societal health levels, it appears that this group may benefit from education and professional counseling to improve their QOLs...|$|R

25|$|Early {{breastfeeding}} {{is associated}} with fewer nighttime feeding problems. Early skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby improves breastfeeding outcomes and increases cardio-respiratory stability. Reviews from 2007 found numerous benefits. Breastfeeding aids general health, growth and development in the infant. Infants who are not breastfed are at mildly increased risk of developing acute and chronic diseases, including lower respiratory infection, ear infections, bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, botulism, urinary tract infection and necrotizing enterocolitis. Breastfeeding may protect against sudden infant death syndrome, <b>insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, lymphoma, allergic diseases, digestive diseases, obesity, develop diabetes, or childhood leukemia later in life. and may enhance cognitive development.|$|E
25|$|Pancreatectomy (removal of {{a portion}} or {{nearly all of}} the pancreas) is usually a {{treatment}} of last resort when the simpler medical measures fail to provide prolonged normal blood sugar levels.

These cases can be cured by removing much less of the pancreas, resulting in excellent outcomes with no long-term problems.|$|E
25|$|Mehra, whose {{research}} has covered {{various aspects of}} histocompatibility and immunogenetics, started {{his work on the}} subjects during his post-doctoral days in Europe, and at John Hansen's laboratory in Seattle, where he used DNA-based technologies of HLA analysis to study the immunogenetic aspects of rheumatoid arthritis. Later, in India, he studied HLA-linked genes and identified that a subtype of HLA-DR2 carried on a unique class II haplotype made humans susceptible to diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis. He also differentiated the Indian rheumatoid arthritis and <b>insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus patients from the Western Caucasian patients by demonstrating that the former showed a pattern of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ association and these studies helped in characterizing the Indian population with regard to its genomic diversity. His group demonstrated that HLA genes with specific pockets in the peptide binding region controlled the severity of mycobacterial diseases, which was a first-time discovery. Together with Ajay Kumar Baranwal of AIIMS Delhi and Brian D. Tait of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, he carried out a research project, Antibody Repertoire and graft outcome following solid organ transplantation, which assisted in the prediction of graft rejection and had significance in organ and bone marrow transplantation. He also guided a team of scientists in a project based on polymorphic immunomodulatory genes for developing molecular medicine to combat infectious, autoimmune and rheumatological diseases. His {{research has}} been documented by way of several articles; ResearchGate an online repository of scientific articles has listed 287 of them. Besides, he has published a book, The HLA Complex in Biology and Medicine: A Resource Book, and has contributed chapters to books published by other researchers, including Textbook of Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Allied and Molecular Medicine.

2500|$|Alloxan is a toxic glucose analogue, which {{selectively}} destroys insulin-producing {{cells in}} the pancreas (that is beta cells) when administered to rodents and many other animal species. This causes an <b>insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus (called [...] "alloxan diabetes") in these animals, with characteristics similar to type 1 diabetes in humans. Alloxan is selectively toxic to insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells because it preferentially accumulates in beta cells through uptake via the GLUT2 glucose transporter. Alloxan, {{in the presence of}} intracellular thiols, generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a cyclic reaction with its reduction product, dialuric acid. The beta cell toxic action of alloxan is initiated by free radicals formed in this redox reaction. Studies suggests that alloxan does not cause diabetes in humans.

Failure to detect significant amounts of human C-peptide by radioimmunoassay during periods of hypoglycemia or in response to stimulation with glucagon, leucine, or tolbutamide indicated that the insulin was not endogenous.

2500|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a disease}} in which the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas either stop producing insulin or can no longer produce it in enough quantity for the body's needs. The condition is commonly divided into two types, depending {{on the origin of}} the condition: Type 1 diabetes, sometimes called [...] "juvenile diabetes", is caused by destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas. The condition is also referred to as <b>insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes,</b> meaning exogenous insulin injections must replace the insulin the pancreas is no longer capable of producing for the body's needs. Dogs can have insulin-dependent, or Type 1, diabetes; research finds no Type 2 diabetes in dogs. Because of this, there is no possibility the permanently damaged pancreatic beta cells could re-activate to engender a remission as may be possible with some feline diabetes cases, where the primary type of diabetes is Type 2. There is another less common form of diabetes, diabetes insipidus, which is a condition of insufficient antidiuretic hormone or resistance to it.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{diagnosis}} and interventive treatment can mean reduced incidence of complications such as cataracts and neuropathy. Since dogs are insulin dependent, oral drugs are not effective for them. They {{must be placed}} on insulin replacement therapy. Approved oral diabetes drugs can be helpful to sufferers of Type 2 diabetes because they work {{in one of three}} ways: by inducing the pancreas to produce more insulin, by allowing the body to more effectively use the insulin it produces, or by slowing the glucose absorption rate from the GI tract. Unapproved so-called [...] "natural" [...] remedies make similar claims for their products. All of this is based on the premise of having an endocrine pancreas with beta cells capable of producing insulin. Those with Type 1, or <b>insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes,</b> have beta cells which are permanently damaged, thus unable to produce insulin. This is the reason nothing other than insulin replacement therapy can be considered real and effective treatment. Canine diabetes means insulin dependency; insulin therapy must be continued for life.|$|E
