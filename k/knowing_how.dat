5|$|HIV {{infections are}} usually {{treated with a}} {{combination}} of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce. The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> viruses reproduce.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} and renaissance tradition, Troilus {{is one of}} those who argue most for war against the Greeks in Priam's council. In several texts, for example the Laud Troy Book, he says that those who {{disagree}} with him are better suited to be priests. Guido, and writers who follow him, have Hector, <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> headstrong his brother can be, counsel Troilus not to be reckless before the first battle.|$|E

5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
5|$|In August 1970, Les Solomon, {{his wife}} and {{daughter}} were on vacation in the southwest and arranged to visit Mims, Roberts and their families. At that time, Dan Meyer and Don Lancaster were among the most prolific authors in Popular Electronics. Meyer had built a million dollar a year business that sold kits of parts to build the project that he and Lancaster wrote about. Mims and Roberts wanted to do the same and quizzed Solomon on the kit business. Solomon gave them some statistics but said there was no way of <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> many kits an article would sell, maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand.|$|E
5|$|N'Diaye {{was born}} in Dakar, Senegal to Seynabou and Mbad N'Diaye. He has an older brother, named Adam. He grew up playing soccer and did not seriously begin playing {{basketball}} at a young age. In 2010, Amadou Koundoul, who was the assistant coach for the UC Irvine Anteaters men's basketball team at the time, saw N'Diaye participate in a pick-up game in a gymnasium at Dakar. He asked him {{to travel to the}} United States, and N'Diaye accepted the offer. He arrived in the US without <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> to speak English. In the new country, he initially had trouble with speaking English and often needed things to be translated to French.|$|E

5|$|The {{spelling}} system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered, {{with elements}} of French, Latin, and Greek spelling {{on top of}} the native Germanic system. Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace. Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> a word is pronounced. There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.|$|E

She also competed in National Physique Committee fitness contests, taught gymnastics and kickboxing, and worked as a personal trainer.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers fondly {{recalled}} serendipitous in-game encounters as {{they learned}} the game environment's unwritten rules. Not <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> foreign figures would react, Rock, Paper, Shotgun reviewer treated new encounters as puzzles. This experimentation led to moments of fearful scrambling across {{a room to}} avoid a new, encroaching enemy type, and discovering that other enemies that are harmless if left alone. Rain World was abundant with opportunities for a player to demonstrate ingenuity and improvisation, according to GameSpot reviewer, whose highlights included making a mouse into a dark room's lantern, using weapons as climbable objects, and luring enemies into battle to distract from the Slugcat's presence. Those critics considered these mysterious, perceptive interactions {{to be among the}} game's best features, though far outweighed by Rain World punishing game mechanics.|$|E

5|$|Spider-Man 3 premiered on April 16, 2007 in Tokyo, and was {{released}} in the United States in both conventional and IMAX theaters on May 4, 2007. The film grossed $890.9 million worldwide, making it the most successful film of the trilogy financially and the second film in the franchise that {{was released}} on IMAX. However, it received mixed reviews; while the effects and action scenes were praised, aspects of the plot (such as Harry's butler <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> his father really died and not telling him), {{and the use of}} three villains (especially the treatment of Venom) were criticized. A fourth film, titled Spider-Man 4, was set to be released on May 6, 2011, but was canceled in favor of the 2012 reboot The Amazing Spider-Man.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} written {{for most of its}} 155-issue run by comic book writer, artist, and editor Larry Hama, and was notable for its realistic, character-based {{storytelling}} style, unusual for a toy comic at the time. Hama wrote the series spontaneously, never <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> a story would end until it was finished, but worked closely with the artists, giving them sketches of the characters and major scenes. While most stories involved the G.I. Joe Team battling against the forces of Cobra Command, an evil terrorist organization, many also focused on the relationships and background stories of the characters. Hama created most characters in collaboration with Hasbro, and used a system of file cards {{to keep track of the}} personalities and fictional histories of his characters, which later became a major selling point for the action figure line.|$|E
5|$|In {{additional}} to {{the technical}} limitations, Robinett had struggled with Atari's management over the game. Around {{the time of}} Adventures development, Atari, now owned by Warner Communications, had hired Ray Kassar as general manager of their Consumer Division, and he was later promoted to president and CEO of Atari in December 1978. Kassar interacted with the programmers rarely and generally treated their contributions with indifference. Robinett was initially discouraged from working on Adventure by his supervisor, George Simcock, who said the ambitious game could not be done based on <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> much memory Colossal Cave Adventure used. When Robinett developed a working prototype within a month, the management at Atari were impressed, encouraging him to continue the game despite his supervisor's initial response. The management later tried to convince Robinett {{to make it a}} tie-in work for the upcoming Superman movie, which was owned by Warner Communication. Robinett remained committed to his initial idea. Instead, Atari had developer John Dunn offered to take Robinett's prototype source code to make the 1979 Superman game.|$|E

5|$|In , Boruto joins an {{examination}} {{to improve his}} ninja rank from low status Genin to middle status Chunin with his teammates. Before the exams happened, he was training to surpass his father. For it, he becomes a student of Naruto's best friend and rival Sasuke Uchiha who first challenges him to perform the Rasengan; not <b>knowing</b> <b>how,</b> he received help from his teacher Konohamaru {{to know how to}} perform it. Upon learning and mastering a small Rasengan, Boruto starts training with Sasuke after his acceptance to it. Later in the film, Boruto is told by Sasuke that he has potential of surpassing his father. In the exams, he cheats by using a device that uses ninjutsu due to his lack of training in traditional abilities. After being caught and disqualified, Naruto gets captured by Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki from protecting the leaf village. Upon being scolded by Sasuke, Boruto realizes his underhandedness and joins the rescue team to save the abducted Naruto, while finally gaining his father's compliance. With the help of Naruto and Sasuke, Boruto defeats the enemy Momoshiki with his Rasengan. Although he resented the Hokage position, Boruto becomes resolute to become strong to protect his village's leader and entrust Sarada to be a future Hokage instead of himself. Boruto also reprises his role in the novel adaptation of the movie, as well as part of an omake from the manga Sasuke Uchiha's Sharingan Legend where he trains with the title character.|$|E
