6000|$|Mr. Noel Vanstone {{has stepped}} into his father's shoes under the {{following}} circumstances: Mr. Michael Vanstone {{appears to have}} died, curiously enough, as Mr. Andrew Vanstone died--intestate. With this difference, however, in the two cases, that the younger brother left an <b>informal</b> <b>will,</b> and the elder brother left no will at all. The hardest men have their weaknesses; and Mr. Michael Vanstone's weakness {{seems to have been}} an insurmountable horror of contemplating the event of his own death. His son, his housekeeper, and his lawyer, had all three tried over and over again to get him to make a will; and had never shaken his obstinate resolution to put off performing the only business duty he was ever known to neglect. Two doctors attended him in his last illness; warned him that he was too old a man to hope to get over it; and warned him in vain. He announced his own positive determination not to die. His last words in this world (as I succeeded in discovering from the nurse who assisted Mrs. Lecount) were: [...] "I'm getting better every minute; send for the fly directly and take me out for a drive." [...] The same night Death proved to be the more obstinate of the two; and left his son (and only child) to take the property in due course of law. Nobody doubts that the result would have been the same if a will had been made. The father and son had every confidence in each other, and were known to have always lived together on the most friendly terms.|$|E

The English codicil has little in common with this but the name. It is not an <b>informal</b> <b>will,</b> but an addition to a will, read as a part of it, and needing the same formalities of execution.|$|E

50|$|It {{is certain}} {{from the text}} of Gaius that the {{earliest}} forms of will were those made in the comitia calata and those made in procinctu, or {{on the eve of}} battle. The former were published before the comitia, as representative of the patrician genies, and were originally a legislative act. These wills were the peculiar privilege of patricians. At a later time the form of plebeian will developed (irs/amentum per aes ci libram), and the law of testamentary succession was further modified by the influence of tile practor, especially in the direction of recognition of fideicommissa similar in some respects to testamentary trusts. Codicilli, or <b>informal</b> <b>wills,</b> also came into use and were sufficient for almost every purpose except for appointing an heir.|$|R

To illustrate {{the importance of a}} strong culture, or on the contrary, the consequences of a weak, undefined one, we have made an overview of the organizational context. Culture is important to an organization, because it influences the employees, customers, management, virtually the entire public of a company. A company with a strong culture, whether it is formal or <b>informal,</b> <b>will</b> create a positive image, and the effects will manifest on the company, both in internal and external results.

This paper aims to analyze the effect that the organizational culture has on company's development. We tied this analysis of the status of culture in Vodafone Romania, to see to what extent are concepts applicable in Romanian society and the impact their, on company's development. We wish to show that the role of organizational culture is crucial to the evolution of a modern company, because the company’s image reflects cultural strategies. Moreover, we have emphasized the importance of the change and evolution cultural, required for the company’s adjustment to the current financial, economic, social realities and its prosperity...|$|E
30|$|A {{branch in}} the {{literature}} that pursues a related line of inquiry to {{the focus of this}} paper investigates the relationship between trade liberalization, financial liberalization, and informality. This branch of literature mostly focuses on the manufacturing sector, ascribing less importance to the implications on the services sector. In line with the hypothesis of this paper, the liberalization literature also suggests that after trade liberalization, multinational firms and chains penetrate domestic markets through foreign direct investments and produce a positive impact on the total share of formal employment in a country, both in the services sector and the manufacturing industry. Scholars, however, have been less successful at examining the mechanisms and interaction between liberalization and informality. In a model developed by Goldberg and Pavcnik (2003), formal employment is subject to labor market regulations and is costly. Trade liberalization results in more competition, while greater competition drives the demand for cheaper informal inputs, meaning the relationship between informal employment and trade liberalization is unambiguously positive. In their model, the degree of reallocation from the formal to the informal sector depends on the degree of flexibility in the labor market. Aleman-Castilla (2006) argues that the least productive firms, most of which are <b>informal,</b> <b>will</b> be forced to exit the market and that trade liberalization will reduce informality. Fugazza and Fiess (2010) employ various macro and micro data sets and argue that the macro data sets support the conventional view that trade liberalization is associated with an increase in informality, while the micro data set does not support this hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{insights}} into recent developments in the way the law of succession allows people to use new technologies to document their testamentary intentions in an informal way. Design/methodology/approach – This article considers one area in which the law has arguably kept good pace with advances in society’s expectations and technological change – the law of succession. This article examines the legislative reforms in Queensland and other jurisdictions permitting the recognition of <b>informal</b> <b>wills</b> and the decided cases in the area. In particular, the article examines the decision in a Queensland Supreme Court case in which the court recognised the validity of a will made on an iPhone.

40|$|Base of the {{presentation}} to the 22 nd International Input-Output Conference, held in Lisbon - Portugal, on 14 - 18 / 4 / 2014 An identical version of this paper, but for “studying the Socio-Economics of Ageing”, {{can be found in}} the MPRA (Munich Personal RePEc Archive) Paper No. 53858, February 2014. Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs) and Socio-Demographic Matrices (SDMs) are presented as tools that offer specific features for studying the activity of countries in several different areas, as well as for supporting policy decision processes. Based on methodological principles derived mainly from the works of Richard Stone, emphasis is placed on the desirability of working in a matrix format, which includes not only people (SDM), but also, at the same time, activities, products, factors of production and institutions (SAM). Approaches based on SAMs and SDMs will be presented as a way of capturing the relevant network of linkages and the corresponding multiplier effects, which can then be used for the subsequent modelling of the activity of the countries to be studied. As an example of socio-economic studies that can be undertaken using approaches based on both SAMs and SDMs, the study of the activity of household unincorporated enterprises, also described as <b>informal,</b> <b>will</b> be illustrated with an application to Portugal. In that application, three scenarios will be briefly presented, involving, on the one hand, two changes in incomes and, on the other hand, a change in expenditures. The macroeconomic effects of those changes will be summarised in the form of changes in the macroeconomic aggregates: Gross Domestic Product, Gross National Income and Disposable Income.

40|$|Background Many {{people who}} develop {{dementia}} {{are placed in}} long-term care facilities, as they often require high-level care that {{can no longer be}} provided by family and friends. As yet no cure for dementia exists and management of dementia-associated behaviours can be complex. Mental recall is one type of behaviour therapy whereby a representation of past experience is elicited. To date {{there has not been a}} systematic review conducted that focuses specifically on recall techniques for managing behaviours associated with dementia. Aim To determine the effects of using recall strategies in managing behaviours associated with dementia. Types of studies Any quantitative and qualitative study designs were considered. Types of participants People aged over 60 years who had a clinical diagnosis of dementia and displayed behaviours associated with dementia. Types of intervention Any behaviour therapy modality that used recall was considered for this review. For the purpose of this review memory or mental recall related to the ability to recall previously encountered items from memory. Types of outcome measures The outcome of interest was a positive change in the behaviour associated with dementia. Search strategy Using a collection of keywords and MeSH terms, a selection of electronic bibliographic databases were searched for both published and unpublished studies between the years 1990 and 2009. A three-step search strategy was utilised: firstly an initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was undertaken, followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe the article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms was then performed across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles were searched for additional studies. Critical appraisal Papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review. Data extraction and synthesis Data was extracted from papers included in the review using the appropriate standardised data extraction tool. Due to the heterogeneity of papers statistical pooling was not appropriate and the findings are summarised in narrative form. Results Only three papers met inclusion criteria; one quasi-experimental and two case series. Methodological quality was weak and caution is required when interpreting results. The quasi-experimental study focussed on teaching and supporting spousal caregivers of people with dementia to use a cueing system to modify the frequency of repetitive verbalisations. Results suggested that for those caregivers who followed the intervention as advised by the therapist, reductions in verbalisations were demonstrated compared to pre-intervention. There was however, a wide variation in the severity of the problem, with results showing a variable amount of change in vocalisations following the intervention. The results of the case series suggest that incorporating a behavioural approach that includes a cueing system with or without fading cues may be successful for some residents with dementia but not all. Implications for practice Due to the strength of the results no conclusive recommendations can be made regarding the utilisation of cueing systems to change problem behaviours associated with dementia. There is weak evidence to suggest that recall approaches can be of benefit to some people with dementia who exhibit behaviours such as demanding and repetitive verbalisations and aggression. Issues regarding expertise in developing and delivering such interventions, as well as training and support of caregivers, both formal and <b>informal,</b> <b>will</b> need to be considered. Implications for research Primary research utilising rigorous research methods that evaluate the effects of cueing systems to modify behaviours associated with dementia is imperative in order to recommend or refute such a behavioural approach. Other issues such as factors likely to affect a person's response to recall strategies and the optimal training methods for staff and informal caregivers of people with dementia, including strategies for encouragement and support should be considered.

30|$|In an ideally dichotomized {{situation}} in which both the certifiability of hiring requirements and the stages of a hiring process are clearly divided, a two-by-two theoretical distribution of job-person matching methods can be constructed. Four types of job-person matching scenarios are generated accordingly: certifiable qualifications are desired at both recruitment and selection stages (type I), certifiable qualifications are required in recruitment with non-certifiable qualifications required in selection (type II), non-certifiable qualifications are preferred in recruitment with certifiable qualifications referred in selection (type III), and non-certifiable qualifications are desired at both the recruitment and selection stages (type IV). Correspondingly, Fig. 1 presents the typology of individual job search behaviors in the abovementioned four types of job-person matching scenarios. The formal job search channel will mainly be observed in both recruitment and selection stages in type I. The formal job search channel will dominate the recruitment stage with {{the dominance of the}} informal channel in the selection stage in type II. The <b>informal</b> channel <b>will</b> be mainly used in recruitment with the formal channel mainly seen in selection in type III, and finally, the <b>informal</b> channel <b>will</b> be the major method in both the recruitment and selection stages in type IV.|$|R
