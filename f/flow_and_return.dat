First, we find that the well-documented positive feedback trading is a tranquil-period phenomenon such that it is more difficult in general for emerging-market funds to attract new investment in financial panic. Second, the predictive power of flow on return is driven by a combination of price pressure and information effects in tranquil period, while the information effect dominates in financial panic. Third, the underlying co-movements or contagion of flow across the emerging-market funds influence the association between <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> <b>return.</b> Overall, the findings highlight the importance of accounting for state-dependent dynamics as well as cross-regional co-movements in the analysis of <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> <b>return.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{institutional}} investor trades in stocks grouped by {{style and the}} relationship of these trades with equity market returns. It aggregates transactions drawn from a large universe of approximately $ 6 trillion of institutional funds. To analyze style behavior, we assign equities to deciles in each of five style dimensions: size, value/growth, cyclical/defensive, sector, and country. We find, first, strong evidence that investors organize and trade stocks across style-driven lines. This appears true for groupings both strongly and weakly related to fundamentals (e. g., industry or country groupings versus size or value/growth deciles). Second, the positive linkage between <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> emerges at daily frequencies, yet becomes even more important at lower frequencies. We show that quarterly decile <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> are even more strongly positively correlated than are daily <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> <b>returns.</b> However, as the horizon increases beyond a year, we find that the flow/return correlation declines. Third, style <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> are important components of individual stock expected returns. We find that nearby style inflows <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> positively forecast future returns while distant style inflows <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> forecast negatively. Fourth, we find strong correlations between style <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> temporary components of return. This suggests that behavioral theories {{may play a role in}} explaining the popularity and price impact of flow-related trading. ...|$|R

While in many long-run risks models time-varying volatility influences only risk premium but not expected cash flows, in our model {{a common set of}} risk factors drive both expected cash flow and risk premium dynamics. This feature helps the model to overcome two main criticisms against long-run risk models following Bansal and Yaron (2004) : the over-predictability of cash flows by asset {{prices and the}} tight relation between time-varying risk premia and growth volatility.
