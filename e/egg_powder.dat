In this study, immune effects of the specific <b>egg</b> yolk <b>powders</b> (IgY) against both V. harveyi and V. parahaemolyticus on white shrimp were evaluated. The <b>egg</b> yolk <b>powders</b> against V. harveyi and V. parahaemolyticus for passive immunization of white shrimp were prepared, while a tube agglutination assay and an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used for detection of IgY titer.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{development}} of a method to determine semicarbazide (SEM) in fresh whole egg and in whole egg and <b>egg</b> white <b>powders</b> as those used in the food industry, by using LC-MS/MS is described. The method is based on a recently validated one for the determination of SEM in baby food. SEM is extracted from egg with 0. 2 mol. L- 1 hydrochloric acid and derivatised with 2 nitrobenzaldehyde. The extract is neutralised and purified by passing through a solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. The 2 -nitrobenzaldehyde derivative is eluted with ethyl acetate. The eluate is evaporated to dryness and the residue re-dissolved in methanol: water mobile phase. SEM is determined by reversed phase LC-MS/MS. The “in-house” validation of this method has been performed taking into account the “Harmonized guidelines for single-laboratory validation of methods of analysis” (IUPAC Technical report) and the Commission Decision (2002 / 657 /EC). The performance characteristics of the method were established by in-house validation procedures employing assays with standard solutions, sample blanks and spiked samples. Linearity, matrix effect, trueness, precision, selectivity, limits of detection and of quantification were determined. The fitness for purpose of this method was assessed based on its performance characteristics. LOD’s of 0. 15 µg•kg- 1 and 0. 4 µg•kg- 1 for whole fresh egg and industrial <b>egg</b> <b>powders,</b> respectively, were obtained. The LOQ for fresh whole egg was 0. 2 µg•kg- 1 and for industrial <b>egg</b> <b>powders</b> 0. 8 µg•kg- 1.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Oral food {{challenges}} for diagnosis {{and management of}} egg allergy using fresh egg are common; however, to limit the risk of foodborne infection, many allergy units use pasteurized raw egg. Pasteurization and drying processes {{have the potential to}} affect the structure of egg proteins in <b>egg</b> <b>powder</b> and thus the allergenicity when compared to fresh egg. Our aim was to compare the binding of serum IgE from egg-allergic children to in vitro digested and undigested pasteurized whole raw <b>egg</b> <b>powder</b> with unpasteurized fresh whole raw egg. METHODS: Egg proteins from in vitro digested or undigested pasteurized whole raw <b>egg</b> <b>powder,</b> fresh whole egg, egg white and egg yolk were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and incubated overnight with pooled sera from egg-allergic children. RESULTS: In both the raw egg samples and the pasteurized whole <b>egg</b> <b>powder,</b> protein bands corresponding to known molecular weights of the major egg allergens were present. Pasteurized whole raw <b>egg</b> <b>powder</b> was bound by serum IgE in a similar manner to unpasteurized whole raw egg and was unaffected by in vitro digestion. Serum IgE also bound egg yolk, indicating sensitization to both egg yolk and egg white proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The main egg allergens are present in pasteurized whole raw <b>egg</b> <b>powder,</b> and serum IgE of egg-allergic children binds to them in a similar pattern to those in fresh whole raw egg. Pasteurized whole raw <b>egg</b> <b>powder</b> is a suitable substitute for raw egg in clinical practice for oral food challenges.
