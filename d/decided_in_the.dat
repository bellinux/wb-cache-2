5|$|The 1990 {{season and}} Super Bowl win {{marked the end}} of an era for the Giants. Parcells had grown restless as coach of the Giants and yearned for {{complete}} control of the team. Knowing that he would not get that opportunity with George Young as GM, Parcells <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring of 1991 to leave the Giants for a career in broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Despite those players' {{performance}}s, {{the game}} was <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> running game {{and the performance of}} the two teams' offensive and defensive lines. Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh was praised for adjusting his team's strategy at halftime, allowing it to succeed in the second half. Stanford's rushing offense accounted for 247 yards, while its defensive line limited Virginia Tech to just 67 yards rushing. The Stanford defense also sacked Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor eight times, denying him time to pass the ball accurately.|$|E

5|$|Dow {{spent the}} early 1840s {{attending}} to his tanning business, but also {{found time to}} encourage individual drinkers to take up abstinence. In 1842, he and his allies succeeded in getting the city government in Portland to require licenses for liquor dealers and to prosecute unlicensed sellers; {{a referendum on the}} question was <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prohibitionists' favor later that year. The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely. Dow kept up his speaking efforts around the state, despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} custom of Europe {{in the late}} {{classical}} and early Middle Ages, he was popularly recognised after his death as a saint, along with several hundred other Welsh men and women. But the date and circumstances of {{the foundation of the}} church, and of Padarn's life were long forgotten when it was <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> twelfth century that he should be commemorated in a Vita or Latin Life, following the example of the Life of St David written at Llanbadarn about 1090. That in turn had followed a European tradition of writing such lives. They are not biographies as we understand them today. Instead they were hagiographies, designed to elevate the saint’s status as a holy person of miraculous achievements.|$|E
5|$|Harrison ran in all {{the free}} states except Massachusetts, and the slave states of Delaware, Maryland, and Kentucky. Hugh L. White ran in the {{remaining}} slave states except for South Carolina. Daniel Webster ran in Massachusetts, and Willie P. Mangum in South Carolina. The plan narrowly failed, as Van Buren won the election with 170 electoral votes. A swing of just over 4,000 votes in Pennsylvania would have given that state's 30 electoral votes to Harrison, and the election would have been <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives.|$|E

5|$|In 1823, Wickliffe {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives and served five {{consecutive}} terms. Again he succeeded his cousin and friend, Ben Hardin. Though a Whig, he disagreed with many of the positions of the party's founder, Henry Clay. When no candidate received a majority of the electoral votes in the 1824 presidential election, the constitution mandated that the election be <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House. Wickliffe bucked Clay's advice to vote for him and instead voted for Andrew Jackson, who was the choice of the Kentucky legislature.|$|E
5|$|In March 1914, the Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence was {{announced}} in Gjirokastër and it was confirmed in the Protocol of Corfu. The Republic, however, was short-lived, as Albania collapsed {{at the beginning of}} World War I. The Greek military returned in October–November 1914, and again captured Gjirokastër, along with Saranda and Korçë. In April 1916, the territory referred to by Greeks as Northern Epirus, including Gjirokastër, was annexed to Greece. The Paris Peace Conference, 1919 restored the pre-war status quo, essentially upholding the border line <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1913 Protocol of Florence, and the city was again returned to Albanian control.|$|E

5|$|The Stanley Cup final between Montreal and Toronto went five games, but is {{remarkable}} as each game required overtime to be <b>decided.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> third game, with the series tied at one game a piece, Kennedy both saved {{the game for}} the Leafs and won it. First, he prevented a goal by clearing a puck that was heading into the Toronto net, then, just fifty seconds later {{at the other end}} of the rink, he intercepted a clear-out pass from Montreal's Calum MacKay and scored to win the game. The fourth game was won by Toronto to lead the series 3–1.|$|E
5|$|The men's singles {{rules have}} {{undergone}} several changes {{since the first}} edition. This event has always been contested in a knockout format, and all matches have been best-of-five sets except in 1970, 1973, and 1974, when the first round was best-of-three sets, and in 1982, when {{the third and fourth}} round were best-of-three sets. Since 1905, all sets have been <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> advantage format. The lingering death best-of-twelve points tie-break was introduced in 1971 and has been used for the first four sets since then, except from 1980 to 1982, when the tie-break was also played in fifth sets.|$|E

5|$|Two earlier {{business}} decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial savings {{of time and}} money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand a Cold War attack, and thus {{did not have to be}} broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich v The Queen, is an {{important}} legal case, stemming from an incident that took place on 17 December 1986, that was <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> High Court of Australia on 13 November 1992. It concerned {{the nature of the}} right to a fair trial, and under what circumstances indigent defendants (defendants who cannot afford legal representation) should be provided with legal aid by the state. The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented. It is {{an important}} case in Australian criminal law, and also in Australian constitutional law, since it is one of many cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Devils {{finished}} {{first in the}} Atlantic Division with 108 points.

In the Stanley Cup Finals, the Devils and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had a back-and-forth battle, as both teams won all of their home games. The Devils brought the Stanley Cup to New Jersey for a third time, defeating the Mighty Ducks in the seventh game of the Finals in New Jersey. After the series, Daneyko, a long-time fan favorite, announced his retirement.

5|$|In the 1982–83 season, Akram Salman was {{appointed}} as the team's new manager. Al-Talaba started {{the season with}} confidence having won the league {{in the last two}} seasons, but finished in second place, only one point behind the league leaders, Salahaddin. Salahaddin were undefeated in the league while Al-Talaba had a single loss, by 2–0 loss to Al-Sinaa {{in the second round of}} matches. The championship was <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last match of the season when Al-Talaba met Salahaddin with only one point between them, so Salahaddin needed a win or a draw to secure the title. Al-Talaba scored first and dominated the match until, in the last thirty minutes, Salahaddin managed to equalise. The score remained 1–1, which won Salahaddin the championship for the first time in their history. Hussein Saeed was the top goalscorer with 17 goals, eight goals ahead of another Al-Talaba player, Rahim Hameed.|$|E
5|$|Most World Fantasy Award nominees and {{winners are}} decided by {{attendees}} and judges {{of the annual}} World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees of the current and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which {{has the power to}} break ties. Unlike the other World Fantasy Award categories, the Convention Award has no nominees and is not <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> usual way; instead, the winner is selected by the convention organizers themselves and announced along with the nominees in the other categories. The final results are presented at the World Fantasy Convention at the end of October. Through 2015, winners were presented with a statuette of H.P.Lovecraft, but at the 2015 ceremony it was announced that the statuette would not be given out in future years. No announcement was made about a replacement award at that time.|$|E
5|$|The 1973 Yankees {{held the}} AL East lead {{entering}} August, but faded and ended the year fourth. The 1973 season was the team's last in Yankee Stadium before {{the building was}} renovated. The Yankees had become concerned about the drop in attendance and the poor conditions of the stadium's surroundings. For a time, New Jersey sought to attract sports teams to the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and New York City acted to prevent the Yankees from moving. The city paid $24million to buy Yankee Stadium and the adjacent land, and in 1972 agreed to renovations. Work on the stadium finished in 1976, and the Yankees were required {{to play at the}} Mets' home field, Shea Stadium, in 1974 and 1975. During the first of those seasons, the team nearly won the AL East, finishing behind the Orioles in a race that was <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final games. The Yankees were helped by an early-season trade that brought first baseman Chris Chambliss to the team, and improved to 89 wins from 1973's 80 victories.|$|E
