5|$|The binary ferrous and ferric halides are well-known, {{with the}} {{exception}} of ferric iodide. The ferrous halides typically arise from treating <b>iron</b> <b>metal</b> with the corresponding hydrohalic acid to give the corresponding hydrated salts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>metal</b> {{has been}} used since ancient times, {{although}} copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000times harder than pure iron. Crude <b>iron</b> <b>metal</b> is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel. Steels and iron alloys formed with other metals (alloy steels) {{are by far the}} most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.|$|E

25|$|The {{coordination}} {{sphere of}} the <b>iron</b> <b>metal</b> {{can be described}} as octahedral. The chloride and hydride ligands are trans, giving a D4h ideal rotation axis that passes through the Fe, Cl, and H atoms. This axis is perpendicular to the equatorial plane defined by the four phosphorus atoms, through which the Fe metal lies slightly above. This suggests that the four phosphorus nuclei are equivalent. The bond distances between the <b>iron</b> <b>metal</b> atom and the coordinating ligands are given by the following.|$|E

25|$|In {{industrial}} practice, {{the iron}} catalyst is obtained from finely ground iron powder, {{which is usually}} obtained by reduction of high purity magnetite (Fe3O4). The pulverized <b>iron</b> <b>metal</b> is burnt (oxidized) to give magnetite of a defined particle size. The magnetite particles are then partially reduced, removing some of the oxygen in the process. The resulting catalyst particles consist of a core of magnetite, encased in a shell of wüstite (FeO), {{which in turn is}} surrounded by an outer shell of <b>iron</b> <b>metal.</b> The catalyst maintains most of its bulk volume during the reduction, resulting in a highly porous high surface area material, which enhances its effectiveness as a catalyst. Other minor components of the catalyst include calcium and aluminium oxides, which support the iron catalyst and help it maintain its surface area. These oxides of Ca, Al, K, and Si are unreactive to reduction by the hydrogen.|$|E
