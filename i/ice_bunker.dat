25|$|The first {{refrigerated}} cars in Japan entered {{service in}} 1908 for fish transport. Many of these cars were equipped with <b>ice</b> <b>bunkers,</b> however the bunkers {{were not used}} generally. Fish were packed in wooden or foam polystyrene boxes with crushed ice.|$|R
25|$|Refrigerator cars {{suffered}} heavy {{damage in}} World War II. After the war, the occupation forces confiscated many cars {{for their own}} use, utilizing the <b>ice</b> <b>bunkers</b> as originally intended. Supplies were landed primarily at Yokohama, and reefer trains ran from the port to U.S. bases around Japan.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20th century, {{mechanical}} refrigeration began to replace ice-based systems. Soon after, mechanical refrigeration units replaced the [...] "armies" [...] of personnel required to re-ice the cars. The plug door was introduced experimentally by P.F.E. (Pacific Fruit Express) in April 1947, when one of their R-40-10 series cars, #42626, was equipped with one. P.F.E.'s R-40-26 series reefers, designed in 1949 and built in 1951, were the first production series cars to be so equipped. In addition, the Santa Fe Railroad first used plug doors on their SFRD RR-47 series cars, which were also built in 1951. This type of door provided a larger six foot opening to facilitate car loading and unloading. These tight-fitting doors were better insulated and could maintain an even temperature inside the car. By the mid-1970s, the few remaining <b>ice</b> <b>bunker</b> cars were relegated to [...] "top-ice" [...] service, where crushed ice was applied atop the commodity.|$|E

NADX #10000 was a 22 ft-long, all-steel car that resembled the forty-and-eights used in Europe during World War I. The prototype weighed 13.5 ST and was outfitted with a 1500 lb <b>ice</b> <b>bunker</b> at each end.

25|$|Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch number 13000 {{was built}} of {{stainless}} steel by the Consolidated Steel Corporation of Wilmington, California with convertible <b>ice</b> <b>bunkers,</b> side ventilation ducts, and axle-driven circulation fans. It was thought that stainless steel would better resist the corrosive deterioration resulting from salting the ice. The one-of-a-kind unit entered service as #13000, but was subsequently redesignated as #1300, and later given #4150 in 1955. The car spent most of its life in express service. Cost was cited as the reason no additional units were ordered. The car was dismantled at Clovis, New Mexico in February 1964.|$|R
5000|$|When the Ferdinand Magellan was rebuilt {{for service}} as United States Railcar No. 1, the {{original}} six bedrooms {{in the car}} were reduced to four, and {{the dining room and}} observation lounge were enlarged. Two of the bedrooms were a suite for the President and the First Lady, with a fully equipped bathroom, including a bathtub, connecting the two bedrooms. The dining room could also be used as a conference room. It has a solid mahogany table that measures 38" [...] x 72" [...] (96.3 cm x 183 cm) and seats eight. The front end of the car held quarters for two stewards, a pantry, a galley, mechanical equipment, storage and <b>ice</b> <b>bunkers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Plant {{technology}} {{began to}} be turned {{to the problem of}} directly chilling rooms and containers, to replace the need to carry ice at all. Pressure began to grow for a replacement for <b>ice</b> <b>bunkers</b> on the trans-Atlantic routes during the 1870s. Tellier produced a chilled storeroom for the steamship Le Frigorifique, using it to ship beef from Argentina to France, while the Glasgow-based firm of Bells helped to sponsor a new, compressed-air chiller for ships using the Gorrie approach, called the Bell-Coleman design. These technologies soon became used on the trade to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The same approach {{began to be}} taken in other industries. Carl von Linde found ways of applying mechanical refrigeration to the brewing industry, removing its reliance on natural ice; cold warehouses and meat packers began to rely on chilling plants.|$|R

50|$|Burlington Refrigerator Express (BREX) was a {{railroad}} refrigerator car leasing {{company that was}} formed on May 1, 1926 as {{a joint venture between}} the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q) and the Fruit Growers Express Company. The move helped the FGE expand its business into the Pacific Northwest, and added almost 2,700 <b>ice</b> <b>bunker</b> units to the existing car pool already under lease by the Burlington to the FGE and Western Fruit Express (WFE).|$|E
25|$|The United States Office of Defense Transportation {{implemented}} mandatory pooling {{of class}} RS produce refrigerator cars from 1941 through 1948. World War II experience found the cars spending 60 {{percent of their}} time traveling loaded, 30 percent traveling empty, and 10 percent idle; and indicated the average 14 loads each car carried per year included 5 requiring <b>bunker</b> <b>icing,</b> 1 requiring heating, and 8 using ventilation or top icing.|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} herein described {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} performance characteristics of the oscillating vane-type fan. The fan was the invention of Mr. Van Dorn and Mr. Cornwell, primarily for use in circulating air in railroad refrigerator cars. In the present system of railroad refrigeration for the transportation of perishable foodstuffs, the refrigerator car is a heat insulated car, with bunkers at each end for the cakes of ice. When the car is loaded and the doors shut, cooling is obtained only due to the natural circulation of air in the car, caused by the difference in temperature between the <b>ice</b> in the <b>bunker</b> and the fruit. This circulation has not been found sufficient, in {{that there is a}} large temperature difference between the top and bottom fruit (see Appendix B) and the top half is too warm, often spoiling during transportation. Also, because of this, the car cannot be filled to its volumetric capacity. Therefore the requirements which led to the invention of this type of fan were as follows: 1. To provide a sufficient volume of air, against the resistance developed in passing through the fruit, to obtain the cooling characteristics required. 2. To provide a fan which would not require major changes in the structural design of the car, or lessen the amount of fruit which could be carried. 3. To provide a fan, simple in construction and installation, and in its drive mechanism from the car axle. The oscillating vane-type fan met conditions 2 and 3 in that it could be situated in the four and one half inch space between the floor racks and the floor of the car, through which the air naturally circulated, and in that it could be driven by a simple wheel and crank drive directly off the axle. This thesis presents the results of the investigation of the first condition. ...|$|R
