40|$|Terminal drought {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of yield losses in {{chickpea}} (Cicer arietinum L.) and there is scope for recovery of major part of this loss through genetic improvement. The progress in breeding for drought tolerance is slow due to the quantitative and temporal variability of available moisture across years and the low genotypic variance in yield under drought. Deep and prolific root system is a high priority trait that can improve drought tolerance in chickpea. Ten accessions which were identified as drought tolerant based on drought susceptible index (DSI) and drought tolerant <b>efficiency</b> <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> (DTE%) were evaluated during rabi 2006 – 07 along with stanadred check Annigeri- 1 and drought tolerant checks ICC 4958 and ICC 10448 under irrigated and rainfed condition for seed yield and root traits. Wide range of genetic variability, moderate to high heritability and high genetic advance for yield and its component traits was observed in drought tolerant accessions evaluated under moisture stress and irrigated situations during 2006 – 07. Among the drought tolerant genotypes evaluated, ICC 13124 showed maximum yield levels under irrigated (1220 kg/ha) as well as rainfed condition (990 kg/ha). The per cent reduction in yield was minimum (18. 9 %) as compared to checks under moisture stress for this genotype. Observations on root length, root weight and root volume showed that ICC 13124 was equally good in respect of root traits which can be used in the breeding programme aimed at drought tolerance...|$|E

40|$|The present study, {{conducted}} during 2005 - 06, in two districts, viz. Amritsar and Faridkot of Punjab, (former having pre-dominantly tubewell-irrigated {{area and the}} latter having canal + tubewell irrigation facilities) has assessed the extent of water depletion and has measured irrigation efficiency at the farm level. Due to profitability and availability of water at shallow depths during 1970 s, paddy and wheat (two of the high water-consuming crops) replaced other crops like maize, groundnut and pulses in the entire state. The area under these two crops increased from 7. 22 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> to 32. 92 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> for paddy and from 37. 12 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> to 43. 53 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> for wheat, from TE 1965 to TE 2005. Consequently, the problem of groundwater depletion has become severe in the Amritsar district, with a fall of 77 cm/ annum in watertable. In the district of Faridkot, this fall has been of 33 cm/annuum. The technical efficiency of irrigation on farms estimated through Data Envelopment Analysis, has indicated the mean irrigation <b>efficiency</b> of 57 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> and 65 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> in paddy production and 61 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> and 68 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> in wheat production, in tubewell-irrigated and canal+tubewell irrigated farms, respectively.

The system installed at Antwerp was somewhat different, in that its primary purpose was the production of electricity for lighting. It was commissioned in 1894, and used pumping engines producing a total of [...] to supply water at [...] Ellington, writing in 1895, stated that he {{found it difficult to}} see that this was an economical use of hydraulic power, although tests conducted at his works at Chester in October 1894 showed that <b>efficiencies</b> of 59 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> could be achieved using a Pelton wheel directly coupled to a dynamo.|$|R
40|$|The flight {{performance}} of animals depends greatly on the efficacy {{with which they}} generate aerodynamic forces. Accordingly, maximum range, load-lifting capacity and peak accelerations during manoeuvres are all constrained by the efficiency of momentum transfer to the wake. Here, we use high-speed particle image velocimetry (1 kHz) to record flow velocities in the near wake of desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria, Forskål). We use the measured flow fields to calculate time-varying span efficiency throughout the wing stroke cycle. The locusts are found to operate at a maximum span <b>efficiency</b> of 79 <b>per</b> <b>cent,</b> typically at a plateau of about 60 <b>per</b> <b>cent</b> {{for the majority of}} the downstroke, but at lower values during the upstroke. Moreover, the calculated span efficiencies are highest when the largest lift forces are being generated (90 % of the total lift is generated during the plateau of span efficiency) suggesting that the combination of wing kinematics and morphology in locust flight perform most efficiently when doing the most work...|$|R
40|$|A {{plantain}} chips {{slicing machine}} was designed, fabricated and tested. This {{is perhaps a}} major advancement {{in the development of}} plantain chips. A cam and spring return mechanism was used to achieve both the feeding and the slicing operations. The machine was made as simple as possible for easy repairs and maintenance. It is designed such that the machine slices one tuber of plantain over one revolution of the cam. A conveyor rolls sliced chips to a tray {{with the help of a}} Geneva drive mechanism (or timer). A variable speed pulley system was used to reduce the motor speed to desired value. Test performance gave an <b>efficiency</b> of 74 <b>per</b> <b>cent.</b> Further modification is in view to further improve on the efficiency...|$|R
