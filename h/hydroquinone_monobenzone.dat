5000|$|Monobenzone, {{also called}} 4-(Benzyloxy)phenol and monobenzyl ether of {{hydroquinone}} (MBEH) is an organic chemical in the phenol family with chemical formula C6H5CH2OC6H4OH. It {{is used as}} a topical drug for medical depigmentation. [...] It is a colourless solid that is classified as the monobenzyl ether of <b>hydroquinone.</b> <b>Monobenzone</b> is soluble in alcohol, benzene, and diethyl ether, and practically insoluble in water.|$|E
40|$|<b>Monobenzone</b> (<b>hydroquinone</b> monobenzylether, 1) is {{a potent}} skin depigmenting agent that causes {{irreversible}} loss of epidermal melanocytes {{by way of a}} tyrosinase-dependent mechanism so far little understood. Herein, the authors show that 1 can be oxidized by mushroom tyrosinase to an unstable o-quinone (1 -quinone) that has been characterized by comparison of its properties with those of a synthetic sample obtained by o-iodoxybenzoic acid-mediated oxidn. of 1. Preparative scale oxidn. of 1 with tyrosinase and catalytic L-DOPA, followed by reductive workup and acetylation, led to the isolation of two main products that were identified as the acetylated catechol deriv. 4 and an unusual biphenyl-type dimer of 4, acetylated 5, arising evidently by coupling of 4 with 1 -quinone. In the presence of L-cysteine or N-acetyl-L-cysteine, formation of 4 and 5 was inhibited, and the reaction led instead to monoadducts (6 or 9) and diadducts (7 and 8). A similar behavior was obsd. when the tyrosinase-promoted oxidn. of 1 was carried out in the presence of sulfhydryl-contg. peptides, such as reduced glutathione, or proteins, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), as inferred by detection of adduct 9 by HPLC-electrochem. detection (HPLC-ED) after acid hydrolysis. The generation and reaction chem. of 1 -quinone described in this article may bear relevance to the etiopathogenetic mechanisms of monobenzone-induced leukoderma {{as well as to the}} recently proposed haptenation hypothesis of vitiligo, a disabling pigmentary disorder characterized by irreversible melanocyte loss...|$|R
