While en route from Vik to Balestrand, the steamer was bombed and strafed by a German bomber.

5|$|Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate {{the unity of the}} Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting with family and friends at his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E
5|$|Pre-planning for a year, {{including}} {{ten months}} for production issues {{and two months}} for his character, was tiring for Aamir. As a first-time producer, he obtained a crew of about 300 people for six months. Due {{to the lack of}} comfortable hotels in Bhuj, he hired a newly constructed apartment and furnished it completely for the crew. Security was set up and a special housekeeping team was brought {{to take care of the}} crew's needs. Most of the 19th century tools and equipment depicted in the film were lent to the crew by the local villagers. Initially, they did not want to part with their equipment, but after much coaxing, they gave in. They then travelled to different parts of the country to collect the musical instruments used <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> and era.|$|E

5|$|The {{preferred}} {{method of}} honor killing <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> was a duel. Despite Cooke's admonition that Sharp {{would not accept}} a challenge to duel, Beauchamp traveled to Frankfort to gain an audience with him. He had recently been named the state's attorney general by Governor John Adair. Beauchamp's account of the interview states that he bullied and humiliated Sharp, that Sharp begged for his life, and that Beauchamp promised to horsewhip Sharp every day until he consented to the duel. For two days, Beauchamp remained in Frankfort, awaiting the duel. He discovered that Sharp had left town, allegedly destined for Bowling Green. Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green, {{only to find that}} Sharp was not there and was not expected. Sharp was saved from Beauchamp's first attempt on his life.|$|E

25|$|Non-scholarly literature, however, {{continued}} {{to rely on}} adaptation.

25|$|McDaniel's last {{will and}} {{testament}} of December 1951 bequeathed her Oscar to Howard University, {{where she had}} been honored by the students with a luncheon after she had won her Oscar. At the time of her death, McDaniel would have had few options. Very few white institutions <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> preserved black history. Historically, black colleges had been where such artifacts were placed. Despite evidence McDaniel had earned an excellent income as an actress, her final estate was less than $10,000. The IRS claimed the estate owed more than $11,000 in taxes. In the end, the probate court ordered all of her property, including her Oscar, sold to pay off creditors. Years later, the Oscar turned up where McDaniel wanted it to be: Howard University, where, according to reports, it was displayed in a glass case in the university's drama department.|$|E
25|$|At age 21 Holliday {{earned a}} degree in {{dentistry}} from the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery. He set up practice in Atlanta, Georgia, but he was soon diagnosed with tuberculosis, the same disease that had claimed his mother when he was 15, having acquired it while tending to her needs while she was still in the contagious phase of the illness. Hoping the climate in the American Southwest would ease his symptoms, he moved to that region and became a gambler, a reputable profession in Arizona <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> Over the next few years, he reportedly had several confrontations. While in Texas, he saved Wyatt Earp's life and they became friends. In 1880, he joined Earp in Las Vegas, New Mexico and then rode with him to Prescott, Arizona, and then Tombstone. In Tombstone, local members of the outlaw Cochise County Cowboys gang repeatedly threatened him and spread rumors that he had robbed a stage. On October 26, 1881, Holliday was deputized by Tombstone city marshal Virgil Earp. The lawmen attempted to disarm five members of the Cowboys, which resulted in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.|$|E
25|$|The {{members of}} the roster that would {{come to be known}} as the architects that earned the Club´s first {{promotion}} into the highest category of Spanish soccer are: Zamora, Vendrell, Febrer, Arqué, Diego, Cobo, Magín, Juanele, Guillamón, Bolao, Boixet, Ladaria, Forteza, Garcés, Currucale, Gassó, Martínez, Lorenzo, Villamide, Sureda, Oviedo, Rodríguez II, Czoka, Mir, and Laguardia. RCD Mallorca was one of only 16 professional teams to compete in this top division. And the team reinforced by picking up players from FC Barcelona, among others, where the likes of Haro, Davoine, Irusqueta and Flotats all arrived. This first season in the top division ended with RCD Mallorca in ninth place of the sixteen total teams, and coach Lorenzo did not last through the season, just like the president, who was replaced by Sir Lorenzo Munar. In the following season, the team finished eleventh. And so, with many ups and downs, RCD Mallorca did not last more than three years in the top echelon of Spanish soccer. The team dropped into the second division until 1964-65, when it rose up again. But, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> in age, the only direct promotion came via winning the Segunda Division, while the second-place finisher had to play in the playoff for promotion.|$|E
