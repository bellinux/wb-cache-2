30|$|The {{construction}} industry provides graduates with {{several types of}} job positions, such as project engineer, <b>document</b> <b>controller,</b> manager, executive, coordinator, planning engineer, quantity surveyor, and estimator. The integration of BIM into CM curricula for educating students so that they suit {{construction industry}} jobs is essential. This process of integrating BIM within a CEM department’s curriculum can furnish students with essential BIM concepts, technology, and process-related knowledge, and accommodate them within the current AECO industry. CEM educationalists from the USA, the UK, and Malaysia have taken efforts to conduct BIM courses for built environment, QS, and C&FM departments. These BIM courses were tested by adopting process-oriented teaching and learning approaches, real case studies, AECO industry involvement, and constant tracking of learning outcomes.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a micro-level study of an organisation considering to standardise a facility management process. Standards serve an instrumental {{purpose in the}} built environment reducing complexity by promoting similarity across time and space. However, differences in practices and perceptions of involved actors can make standardisation a complex endeavour itself, limiting its effectiveness {{as a mode of}} governance. Science and technology studies (STS) approaches are used to study standards in the inspection process. Standardisation is understood in this study as performative and a process of power, understanding, and emerging interests. The empirical material stems from a case study of a pier facility management process at the port of Gothenburg. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with actors involved in the inspection process – asset managers, structural engineers, inspectors and a <b>document</b> <b>controller.</b> Additional observations made during pier inspections and project meetings at the port were used to develop the context of the study. The analysis shows the multiple demands and interpretations present among involved actors prior to an attempt to standardise the pier inspection process. Asset managers and structural engineers voice a preference for guidelines that support ideal ways of working implemented using a checklist. Alternatively, inspectors wish to receive a common terminology. More strategically, the symbolic value of an ISO type standard matches a perceived need by the port management for credibility to satisfy customer demands. Simultaneously, a standard is expected to give clear directives to hired consultants, make the process more cost efficient and ensure a stable quality. The variety of interpretations and demands observed in this study underlines the social character of asset and facility management and the uses of standards. It is suggested to reflect on socio-technical conditions in standard design...|$|E

Also presented are the experimental results of a whirl test designed to select a final controller configuration to be included in a future wind-tunnel test of this innovative rotor system. A brief explanation of the FTR concept and its history are included. The paper <b>documents</b> the <b>controller</b> design constraints, each prototype's operating principle, the evaluation test, and the individual prototype test results. A recommended design is identified, along with the selection rationale...|$|R

Abstract is included in. pdf <b>document.</b> Multivariable <b>controllers</b> are often avoided in the chemical process industries {{in favor of}} simpler diagonal or block-diagonal controllers. Such "decentralized" controllers are desirable because they result in control systems with fewer tuning parameters and greater failure tolerance. However, the ensuing simplicity in controller design must be weighted against the interactions which result from ignoring the off-diagonal system blocks. These can lead to performance deterioration and even instability. The purpose of an Interaction Measure (IM) is to indicate under what conditions {{the stability of the}} diagonal loops/blocks will guarantee that of the complete system. One such measure, the Relative Gain Array (RGA), has found widespread acceptance both in industry and academia despite its empirical basis. This measure, in fact, has sound theoretical justifications. Rigorous relationships are derived in this study linking the RGA to closed-loop stability and robustness with respect to model uncertainty. Using the notion of Structured Singular Value, a new dynamic IM is also defined for multi-variable systems under feedback with diagonal or block-diagonal controllers. This measure, the [ [...] . ] IM, can be used to select the "best" variable pairings for the controller as well as predict the stability of the decentralized control system. Its steady-state value also provides a sufficient condition for achieving offset-free performance with the closed-loop system. The relationship of this new IM with Rijnsdorp' IM and Rosenbrock's Direct Nyquist Array is clarified. Finally, it is shown how the [ [...] . ] IM, in conjunction with the RGA, can form the basis of a novel and useful methodology for the design of decentralized controllers...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} the complete development process of a DMA controller for an on board computer {{of a small}} satellite. Objectives of the project were to implement a complete pool of source code for the <b>controller,</b> <b>document</b> testing results, and produce a detailed specification. Briefly, work proceeded roughly as planned- with small changes due to various minor problems which were solved satisfactorily. Once development was complete the end results were working source code for the controller, and a specification which {{was related to the}} functionality of the final design. The code was tested as fully as possible and worked correctly to the specifications. Synthesis to a semiconductor device was also tested. Finally this documentation was produced. All the aims set out initially have been achieved. Some extra work was also completed with regards to improving the design. Therefore the author judges the project to be a success and also a rich learning experience. Material in this report covers an introductory overview of the project, the work carried out to finish the project, documentation produced {{in the development of the}} controller, detailed suggestions for improvement and a chapter of final conclusions...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{document}} the system design, tradeoffs {{and implementation of}} a magnetic disk controller for the IBM 2311 -type disk drive. The controller is specifically configured {{to operate in the}} chassis of an S 100 -Bus computer. Rationale behind this design concept {{comes from the fact that}} both S 100 -Bus computers and 2311 -type drives are falling in price and gaining in accessibility to the general public. The 2311 -type drive, in past years, was the industry standard for mass storage in large computer systems. Its obsolescence has drastically reduced its price. S 100 -Bus computer, considered to be a ???personal computer??? standard by many, is nevertheless used in many industrial and business applications. The availability of S 100 -Bus main frames, CPU cards, memories and peripheral controllers is well known today. The mass storage peripheral today found on most current S 100 -Bus computer is the ???floppy disk???. It will be shown that the 2311 -type drive, when mated to the disk <b>controller</b> <b>documented</b> herein, will provide 25 times the mass storage available from a ???standard??? floppy disk drive. In addition, the cost-per-drive today is directly competitive. The design is microprocessor based for overall control flexibility. A DMA channel is employed for high speed requirements and independent data transfer. The hardware design is documented with schematics and timing diagrams. Complete control software is developed, with flowcharts, for a set of primitive subroutines which interact with the hardware. In addition, intermediate level sub-routines and a command interpreter are developed to assist in the checkout phase of development...|$|R
