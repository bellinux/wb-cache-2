5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} {{was that the}} trial judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself, and that the {{failure to do so}} caused a miscarriage of justice.

5|$|In 2000, the ACLU's Massachusetts {{affiliate}} {{represented the}} North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA), on first amendment grounds, in the Curley v.

5|$|Bede {{addressed}} {{his work}} In regum librum XXX quaestiones to Nothhelm, who <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> thirty {{questions on the}} biblical book of Kings that Bede answered. Bede's work De VIII Quastionibus may have been written for Nothhelm. While he was archbishop, Boniface wrote to him, requesting {{a copy of the}} Libellus responsionum of Pope Gregory I for use in Boniface's missionary efforts. Boniface also asked for information on when the Gregorian mission to England arrived in England. This text of the Libellus responsionum {{has been the subject of}} some controversy, with the historian Suso Brechter arguing that the text was a forgery created by Nothhelm and a Roman archdeacon. The historian Paul Meyvaert has refuted this view, and most historians incline towards the belief that the text is genuine, although it is not considered conclusively proven.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Orr turned 16 in 1964, {{he was still}} two years away from playing in the NHL and his father Doug was {{dissatisfied}} with the Bruins' treatment of the prospect. Doug <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Bruins' Blair for more money for Bobby and was turned down. Doug Orr met Toronto lawyer Alan Eagleson at a juvenile fastball tournament dinner in Parry Sound and asked Eagleson to help out with the situation. Eagleson agreed {{to work with the}} family for free and continued to do so for the next two years. Bobby and Eagleson developed a relationship Orr would later describe as being like brothers. The two soon became a team, discussing Bobby's future plans without his father Doug.|$|E
5|$|George {{inherited}} the throne at a politically turbulent time. Lloyd George's People's Budget had been rejected {{the previous year}} by the Conservative and Unionist-dominated House of Lords, contrary to the normal convention that the Lords did not veto money bills. Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> previous king to give an undertaking that he would create sufficient Liberal peers to force the budget through the House. Edward had reluctantly agreed, provided the Lords rejected the budget after two successive general elections. After a general election in January 1910, the Conservative peers allowed the budget, for which the government now had an electoral mandate, to pass without a vote.|$|E

5|$|In July 1945 {{was sent}} to the Far East. A group was created which was a {{collection}} of RAF forces that were to be used to recover Singapore from the Japanese. Cunningham and Rawnsley flew out to Rangoon via Malta, Cairo, Baghdad and Karachi. Soon after they arrived they learned of the atomic attacks against Japan. On 2 September 1945, Japan surrendered and the Second World War was over. Cunningham was offered a permanent commission in the RAF but he feared his career, if he stayed, would become mired in administration, policy-making staff courses and committees. It would mean flying would become a secondary occupation. He decided to return to de Havilland. The company <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> RAF to release him the previous summer but had been refused. He was formally de-mobilised in November 1945 and re-joined de Havilland on 1 December.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 2013, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh {{said that}} the central {{government}} <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> UP government to provide details of the case. On 19 August, associations of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS) met with the Secretary of Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) S K Sarkar and demanded that the central government should modify the rules related to suspension of bureaucrats by state governments, as those rules were widely abused. The three associations want the central government instead of various state governments to {{have the authority to}} suspend any All India Services officer.|$|E

Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police the next day and began calling people he thought might have seen his wife. He got a lead when he spoke to friends of Patricia's who carpooled to work with her. The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> carpool driver to drop her off at a street corner in Independence, which he had done. The occupants of the carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E
5|$|South Ledge {{falls within}} the {{apparently}} overlapping territorial waters generated by the mainland of Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks.

Therefore, it simply held that South Ledge, as a low-tide elevation, belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.|$|E
5|$|Athens had {{recently}} become a democracy, overthrowing its own tyrant Hippias. In their fight {{to establish the}} democracy, the Athenians <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Persians for aid (which {{was not in the}} end needed), in return for submitting to Persian overlordship. Some years later, Hippias had attempted to regain power in Athens, assisted by the Spartans. This attempt failed and Hippias fled to Artaphernes, and tried to persuade him to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. Needless to say, the Athenians had baulked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Since they were already an enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities in their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of the Athenian democracy no doubt helped persuade the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt, especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.|$|E

5|$|In May 2012, Böcker {{announced}} that he was working on a concert of music solely from the Final Fantasy series, to be titled Final Symphony. The idea for the concert was first proposed by Uematsu in 2009 after Symphonic Fantasies; the concert had featured Final Fantasy music as one of its four components, but unlike the other three the music had been a straightforward medley rather than a more complicated arrangement. While Uematsu <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> team to keep the arrangements similar to those in other Final Fantasy concerts, after the concert he felt that an opportunity had been missed to create something unique like the other three arrangements, especially the Secret of Mana section. He encouraged Böcker to take more liberties with the source material if the opportunity arose, and hoped that another concert could be created in the future. Böcker proposed Final Symphony later that year to Uematsu, and got approval from Square Enix while coordinating a Tokyo concert of Symphonic Fantasies. Final Symphony is the first concert consisting entirely of new Final Fantasy arrangements in over ten years, since 20020220 - Music from Final Fantasy.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was built}} between 1220 and 1223, during {{the rule of}} the Prince of Achaea Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, {{as a result of a}} dispute between the Prince and the clergy of the Principality. Geoffrey <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> clergy, which owned almost a third of the Principality's lands but was not obliged to render {{military}} service, for additional donations to help defend the realm. When the clergy refused, claiming that they owed allegiance only to the Pope, Geoffrey confiscated Church property, and began construction of Chlemoutsi with the new funds. The fortress was set on a new foundation, with no previous structure identifiable on this site. Its French name, Clairmont or Clermont, most probably gave rise to the Greek form of Chlomoutsi, which more recently became Chlemoutsi, although various theories have been proposed as to the name's origin, with suggestions of Greek, Albanian or Slavic roots pre-dating the Frankish fortress. From the 15th century, Italian sources came to call it Castel Tornese, apparently through a confusion with the seat of the Principality's mint in nearby Glarentza, which until the middle of the 14th century minted silver tornese coins.|$|E
5|$|Yasui had {{consulted}} {{a friend in}} the FBI prior to arrest, and consulted with other legal minds to try to test the legality of the orders. At trial he was defended by private attorney Earl Bernard. Gus J. Solomon, later a judge for the same court, <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> national American Civil Liberties Union to defend Yasui as no local Oregon groups elected to support Yasui. One part of the strategy was to proceed with a non-jury trial, leaving the decision only to the judge. Solomon was asked by Fee to help advise the court on the issues, along with eight other attorneys. At his trial, federal judge James Alger Fee {{came to the conclusion that}} laws specifically targeting a race, such as the curfew, were unconstitutional when applied to citizens. However, he also declared in his November 16, 1942, decision that Yasui had demonstrated his loyalty to Japan and was therefore no longer a U.S. citizen. Yasui was sentenced to one year in prison and given a $5000 fine.|$|E

5|$|On July 17, 1962, the NYCTA {{announced}} that it <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> city for money to build a $190,000,000 high-speed, non-stop subway line from Midtown to the Bronx. The line would have only operated during rush hours. It was estimated that if the funds {{were given to the}} project, it would be completed in 1970. The line would be a two-track line running from 59th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues to the Bronx, running under Central Park. Running non-stop for 6.5 miles, {{it would have been the}} longest continuous run in the subway system. The line, on its southern end, would connect to the BMT Broadway Line at Seventh Avenue near 59th Street and to the IND Sixth Avenue Line near 58th Street and Sixth Avenue. The line would then run through a deep tunnel under Central Park until 110th Street. There would be provisions for a future crosstown line under 76th Street to Queens. The line would then turn east and run along Madison Avenue to 138th Street. One branch would connect to the express track of the IRT Pelham Line, which would be converted to accommodate larger B Division trains. In the morning rush hour, trains from Pelham Park would only make express stops. A new stop would be built at 138th Street and Grand Concourse where transfers would have been available to the IRT White Plains Road and IRT Jerome Avenue Line trains. The second branch would continue under the Grand Concourse until 161st Street where it would connect to the IND Concourse Line at 161st Street. This connection would allow for the diversion of Concourse Line express trains onto the new line, allowing for the addition of an equal number of trains to the Washington Heights express service and provide relief to that line. The construction of this line was viewed as necessary to relieve the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.|$|E
