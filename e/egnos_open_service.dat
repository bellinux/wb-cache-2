40|$|Although not {{recognised}} by all mariners, nowadays European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) {{provides a}} powerful Europe-wide usable Global Positioning System (GPS) augmentation system, which can support ship navigation with position accuracies {{of up to}} a few meters and additional integrity information. This paper shows {{the results of a}} comparative study between the <b>EGNOS</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Service</b> and the IALA Beacon differential GPS. It is based on a measurement campaign of 62 days in the Baltic Sea, mainly in the transition zone between a German and Polish IALA Beacon station. Results indicate that both EGNOS and IALA Beacon services provide the mariner within their service area with highly accurate augmentation data, so that it is possible for them to obtain horizontal positions with accuracies better than 1 m for EGNOS and 3 m for IALA Beacon (95 % criteria) independently from nautical tasks and environmental conditions. It is also shown how unintentional man-made interferences of the broadcasting channel can reduce the IALA Beacon performance significantly...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{current status}} of EGNOS (December 2006) is {{described}} as Initial Operations Phase and the <b>EGNOS</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Service</b> is just about to be formally declared as available for non-safety of life service. In meanwhile the EGNOS Signal in Space is provided almost in its nominal level and delivering, when available, the nominal system performance. New positioning technologies, such as EGNOS in Europe, create a new quality in marine navigation and bring further improvement of the maritime transport safety. It may be expected that very soon EGNOS will find significant interest among the maritime community serving as the augmentation system in the maritime transport applications of GNSS. The paper discusses the EGNOS status and the expected EGNOS performance {{in the context of}} marine navigation requirements. The system performance analysis is backed with the study of the various field tests results where the EGNOS positioning performance was verified by author in the experimental way. 1 EGNOS STATUS European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is designed to provide in Europe the regional augmentation to GPS and GLONASS systems.

40|$|Additional {{corrections}} from augmentation systems {{improve the}} Global Navigation Satellites Systems (GNSS) position accuracy {{up to one}} to two meters. As one of the satellite based augmentation systems (SBAS) the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) provides satellite clock, orbit as well as ionosphere corrections which improve ranging and positioning at user site. The investigation of the <b>EGNOS</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Service</b> in the maritime domain as an effective augmentation system for positioning and navigation is the topic of this paper. This includes a detailed positioning performance analysis {{as well as the}} future potential of implementation of EGNOS in the maritime domain. For evaluation of the EGNOS positioning performance the vessel "NAWIGATOR XXI" was travelling over 62 days in the year 2015 in the Baltic Sea. To obtain reference trajectories Precise Point Positioning (PPP) solutions were also generated. The intensive analysis results present a very high accuracy level for the position based on EGNOS corrections. The horizontal position error of GNSS augmented by EGNOS is lower than 0. 9 m (95...|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the Obama Administration’s pledge to repeal“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” in the United States, the Columbia LawSchool Sexuality 2 ̆ 6 Gender Law Clinic {{undertook}} a review of howallies of the United States moved from a policy of banning gay andlesbian servicemembers from serving in the armed forces to a policyof allowing these servicemembers to serve openly (“open service”). In documenting this review, this report aims to provide informationabout the decision to implement <b>open</b> <b>service</b> and the mechanics ofthe transition to <b>open</b> <b>service</b> in Australia, Canada, Israel, and theUnited Kingdom. In addition to addressing concerns about the effectof <b>open</b> <b>service</b> on unit cohesion and morale, this report also includesinformation about how the militaries of Australia, Canada, Israel, andthe United Kingdom have implemented their <b>open</b> <b>service</b> policieson the ground. The report examines, as well, the ways in which U. S. soldiers have worked as part of multinational forces with membersof other militaries that have <b>open</b> <b>service</b> policies. <b>Open</b> <b>Service</b> and Our Allies shows that no significant problemshave arisen {{as a result of a}} transition to <b>open</b> <b>service.</b> Notably, notone country studied in this report has made any changes to its housingor bathrooms. Moreover, although all of the countries studied inthis report have reported scattered incidents of harassment, thisreport also shows that there has been no pervasive discriminationagainst or harassment of gay and lesbian servicemembers. Whereassome countries achieved a successful transition through educationaland sensitivity training, others have not addressed harassment of gayand lesbian servicemembers in their trainings. The common thread, instead, has been an emphasis on strong leadership and a clear statementof the behavior that is expected of servicemembers. This reportalso shows that none of the countries studied have experienced a declinein unit cohesion or morale. To the contrary, many of the countriesstudied have seen an increase in morale due to servicemembers’increased ability to focus on work, rather than on hiding their sexualorientation, and a decrease in paranoia and suspicion as a result ofthe new open environment. Overall, this report shows that the transition to <b>open</b> <b>service</b> inAustralia, Canada, Israel, and the United Kingdom was smooth,although not always flawless, and provides some insight into whatsuch a transition might look like in the United States...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{progress}} of information techniques, {{people should have}} a relatively convenient environment and life. This project designs Web 2. 0 Situation and QoS-aware Services for Cross-LAN Appliances in the <b>Open</b> <b>Service</b> Platform (Web 2 SQS) for users to integrate locally and remotely devices without space constraint. Web 2 SQS is composed of Mobile users, integrated appliance service server (IASS) and the <b>open</b> <b>service</b> platform. Web 2 SQS {{is based on the}} standards of Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS), Mobile Gateway, <b>Open</b> <b>Services</b> Gateway initiative (OSGi), Cloud environment, and Web 2. 0 techniques. Users can use handheld devices to connect with remotely devices from the <b>open</b> <b>service</b> platform. When IASS finds a new home-appliance, this home-appliance will be registered into the <b>open</b> <b>service</b> platform. The <b>open</b> <b>service</b> platform records related information and services which are provided by this home-appliance. Through the Web environment, Web 2 SQS provides an inference engine to predict the actions of users and control the home-appliance. All delivered messages are based on Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Web Services Description Language (WSDL). Furthermore, for the Web QoS strategy, this study designs and proposes a Web 2. 0 qualIty of Service-aware maTching (WIST) model to satisfy different characteristics of users’ requirements. For the cross-LAN strategy, this study designs and proposes a DPWS-based Device Bridge Mechanism to communicate between the cloud environment and devices.
