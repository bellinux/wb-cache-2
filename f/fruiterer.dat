25|$|As a {{young man}} John Kane changed the {{spelling}} of his surname and converted to Anglicanism. He left no personal papers and very {{little is known about}} his youth (so little, indeed, that reference works published during his lifetime, and shortly after his death, continued to give the year of his birth as 1887). He had little education, and worked from an early age as a farm labourer. By 1907 he had moved to Melbourne, where he worked as a <b>fruiterer</b> in Northcote.|$|E
500|$|William Thomas Dartnell {{was born}} in the Melbourne suburb of Collingwood on 6 April 1885 to Henry Dartnell, an English-born <b>fruiterer,</b> and his Australian wife Rose Ann (née Hanley). He was brought up in Melbourne and, after leaving school, became an actor. In 1900, at the age of 15, Dartnell joined the Victorian Mounted Rifles, a {{part-time}} colonial militia unit. The regiment was mobilised as the 5th Victorian (Mounted Rifles) Contingent in early 1901 for service in the Second Boer War, and embarked for South Africa on 15 February. Arriving in Port Elizabeth the following month, Dartnell saw service in the Cape Colony and Orange Free State over the next twelve months and was wounded on 6 April—his 16th birthday. The Mounted Rifles returned to Australia in March 1902, and Dartnell was demobilised soon thereafter. He later returned to South Africa, and served as part of Royston's Horse during the Bambatha Rebellion in Natal in 1906. For his service in these two campaigns Dartnell was issued the Queen's South Africa Medal with [...] "Cape Colony" [...] and [...] "Orange Free State" [...] clasps, the King's South Africa Medal with the clasps [...] "South Africa 1901" [...] and [...] "South Africa 1902", and the Natal Native Rebellion Medal with [...] "1906" [...] clasp.|$|E

60|$|In fact, as Bromfield Corey {{found his}} way at his leisurely pace up through the streets on which the {{prosperity}} of his native city was founded, hardly any figure could have looked more alien to its life. He glanced {{up and down the}} facades and through the crooked vistas like a stranger, and the swarthy <b>fruiterer</b> of whom he bought an apple, apparently for the pleasure of holding it in his hand, was not surprised that the purchase should be transacted in his own tongue.|$|E
60|$|Once upon a time, {{that is to}} say, in this our time, - {{the exact}} year, month, and day are of no matter, - there dwelt {{in the city of}} London a {{substantial}} citizen, who united in his single person the dignities of wholesale <b>fruiterer,</b> alderman, common-councilman, and member of the worshipful Company of Patten-makers; who had superadded to these extraordinary distinctions the important post and title of Sheriff, and who at length, and to crown all, stood next in rotation for the high and honourable office of Lord Mayor.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{fortunate}} {{that even in}} such fevered moments his eye was cool and quick. Something in a shop-front went by him like a mere flash; yet {{he went back to}} look at it. The shop was a popular greengrocer and fruiterer's, an array of goods set out in the open air and plainly ticketed with their names and prices. In the two most prominent compartments were two heaps, of oranges and of nuts respectively. On the heap of nuts lay a scrap of cardboard, on which was written in bold, blue chalk, [...] "Best tangerine oranges, two a penny." [...] On the oranges was the equally clear and exact description, [...] "Finest Brazil nuts, 4d. a lb." [...] M. Valentin looked at these two placards and fancied he had met this highly subtle form of humour before, and that somewhat recently. He drew the attention of the red-faced <b>fruiterer,</b> who was looking rather sullenly up and down the street, to this inaccuracy in his advertisements. The <b>fruiterer</b> said nothing, but sharply put each card into its proper place. The detective, leaning elegantly on his walking-cane, continued to scrutinise the shop. At last he said, [...] "Pray excuse my apparent irrelevance, my good sir, but I should like {{to ask you a question}} in experimental psychology and the association of ideas." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{member of}} the Worshipful Company of Leathersellers, he became its master, {{as well as that}} of the Fan Makers and latterly the <b>Fruiterers.</b> This led to him {{becoming}} an Alderman of London between 1892 and 1915, for the Ward of Aldgate, and then a Lieutenant of the City of London.|$|R
60|$|The two {{men were}} with him. Slyme being on the box with the driver; and they let him lie. Happening to pass a <b>fruiterer's</b> on their way; the door of which was open, though the shop was by this time shut; one of them remarked how faint the peaches smelled.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Out of the question!' said Leander; 'I make {{it always}} a {{condition}} {{that the head of}} every department shall be appointed by myself. I take Pellerini with me for the confectionery. How often have I seen the effect of a first-rate dinner spoiled by a vulgar dessert! laid flat on the table, for example, or with ornaments that look {{as if they had been}} hired at a pastrycook's: triumphal arches, and Chinese pagodas, and solitary pines springing up out of ice-tubs surrounded with peaches, as if they were in the window of a <b>fruiterer</b> of Covent Garden.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Well, it is {{very odd}} to—be—sure,’ {{interposed}} {{the owner of the}} flat bottle, mixing another glass, ‘but I’ve been in difficulties, as one may say, now for thirty year. I went to pieces when I was in a milk-walk, thirty year ago; arterwards, when I was a <b>fruiterer,</b> and kept a spring wan; and arter that again in the coal and ’tatur line—but all that time I never see a youngish chap come into a place of this kind, who wasn’t going out again directly, and who hadn’t been arrested on bills which he’d given a friend and for which he’d received nothing whatsomever—not a fraction.’ ...|$|E
60|$|At Landrecies {{the rain}} still fell {{and the wind}} still blew; but we found a double-bedded room with plenty of furniture, real water- jugs with real water in them, and dinner: a real dinner, not {{innocent}} of real wine. After having been a pedlar for one night, and a butt for the elements during {{the whole of the}} next day, these comfortable circumstances fell on my heart like sunshine. There was an English <b>fruiterer</b> at dinner, travelling with a Belgian fruiterer; in the evening at the cafe, we watched our compatriot drop a good deal of money at corks; and I don't know why, but this pleased us.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} an attempt {{has been made}} to assess the {{economic}} performance of Christchurch fruit and vegetable retailers of various types. Of particular interest was the supermarket group. An attempt has also been made to make some judgements about the implications of this performance, in terms of economic welfare. The four retail groups studied were:- (1) 	Supermarkets. This group consisted of store s selling groceries, meat, and fruit and vegetables which had four checkouts or more. It also included variety stores and department stores which had, as one department, a supermarket. (2) 	<b>Fruiterers.</b> This group was classified according to the same criteria as used by the New Zealand Statistics Department. The requirement of this classification is simply that the retailer himself decides whether or not he belongs to this group. (3) 	Super <b>fruiterers.</b> This group was separated arbitrarily largely according to their size of operation and trading characteristics. Their average fruit and vegetable sales are about three times that of conventional <b>fruiterers</b> and a high proportion of their sales are in case lots. Because the group is small their results need careful interpretation and the implications for policy are limited. (4) 	Grocer/dairies. This group consisted of remaining food retailers who sold fruit and vegetable items. They are the major fruit and vegetable outlet in Christchurch with their 1967 wholesale purchases amounting to 47 % of Christchurch’s total wholesale purchases...|$|R
