50|$|The TTP/A {{protocol}} implements {{a communication}} layer and data access {{according to the}} Object Management Group smart transducer Interface standard {{which was published in}} late 2002. The interface to each transducer is known as an Interface File System (IFS), that includes both real-time data, as well as configuration and node management features. The IFS makes it possible to share data between different TTP/A clusters in a transparent fashion, so that for the application no distinction between data from local and remote nodes is made. The TTP/A protocol does not require special controller hardware and can be implemented on any standard embedded microcontroller. An open-source implementation exists for the Atmel AVR architecture. Like the fault-tolerant time-triggered protocol TTP, TTP/A follows the time-triggered paradigm featuring a clock synchronization and predefined time-triggered schedules for communication and execution of tasks. Thus, TTP/A communication implements a strict time division multiple access (TDMA) scheduling. TTP/A {{can be used as a}} sub-bus for a higher-performance and more dependable real-time systems, or to provide transducer data to a Linux system in a soft-real-time fashion. TTP/A was used in applications such as an <b>intercommunication</b> <b>system</b> for mobile robots.|$|E

40|$|During {{seedling}} establishment, cotyledons of {{the rain}} forest tree Hymenaea courbaril mobilize storage cell wall xyloglucan to sustain growth. The polysaccharide is degraded and its products are transported to growing sink tissues. Auxin from the shoot controls the level of xyloglucan hydrolytic enzymes. It is not yet known how important the expression of these genes is for the control of storage xyloglucan degradation. In this work, partial cDNAs of the genes xyloglucan transglycosylase hydrolase (HcXTH 1) and beta-galactosidase (HcBGAL 1), both related to xyloglucan degradation, and two other genes related to sucrose metabolism [alkaline invertase (HcAlkIN 1) and sucrose synthase (HcSUS 1) ], were isolated. The partial sequences were characterized by comparison with sequences available in the literature, and phylogenetic trees were assembled. Gene expression was evaluated at intervals of 6 h during 24 h in cotyledons, hypocotyl, roots, and leaves, using 45 -d-old plantlets. HcXTH 1 and HcBGAL 1 were correlated to xyloglucan degradation and responded to auxin and light, being down-regulated when transport of auxin was prevented by N- 1 -naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and stimulated by constant light. Genes related to sucrose metabolism, HcAlkIN 1 and HcSUS 1, responded to inhibition of auxin transport in consonance with storage mobilization in the cotyledons. A model is proposed suggesting that auxin and light are involved in the control of the expression of genes related to storage xyloglucan mobilization in seedlings of H. courbaril. It is concluded that gene expression plays a role in the control of the <b>intercommunication</b> <b>system</b> of the source-sink relationship during seeding growth, favouring its establishment in the shaded environment {{of the rain}} forest understorey.

So far the weather has been fine and {{everything}} is hunky-dory. I hope I {{feel the same way}} {{at the end of the}} trip. You know, I’m an old fatalist, don’t you? Sure as shooting it begins to rain like “cats and dogs” when we leave campt [sic] whereas prior to that the weather was fine. I look back into my memories and find rainy days on the following events—our wedding day; our trip to S. A., and our trip to Fort Sill 2 ̆ 6 COM School. Each experience turned out fine and I have no qualms that this one will turn out O. K. too. Our quarters are the same elegant quarters which we had hoped for. The food continues to be excellent and my moral [sic] is sky-high. The only bad feature about this trip is that I don’t have you sitting beside me in a deck chair where I can hug and kiss you at will. Last night the ocean was as calm as a mirror—the moon was round and full. The ship moved swiftly through the water. The scene ideal if I had you in my arms and my lips pressed hard against my loved one[‘]s. The man [sic] have been issued travel books such as regards practice 2 ̆ 6 customs in foreign countries. I am spending my time teaching the officers 2 ̆ 6 men foreign languages. Yesterday I was one of the fortunate men receiving 4 pieces of mail. Three letters from my darling and one letter from the folks. Naturally I boasted about my “little girl” to all the officers and got them extremely jealous. Gee, I’m mean, but I’m crazy about you and want the whole world to know it. I wonder if Mort got his leave? I hope so, sincerely! I was surprised at the folks’ letter. It was a fine letter wishing me luck and a speedy return. I hope they maintain that attitude always. It’s better for everybody concerned. At the present time some darn good musical recordings are coming over the ship’s <b>intercommunication</b> <b>system.</b> The men go for these in a big way. Precious, you don’t know how happy you make me feel when I learned that you got yourself a position with the Board of Education, that you are contemplating taking some course at night school and spending some time at USO. Perfect, darling, Perfect. To date I don’t know whether V-mail is faster or not. Off hand I would say send V-mail to supplement your ordinary air mail letters. I received your letter with the Pres. speech enclosed. The speech was a masterpiece. Thanks for the clipping. He’s my boy for the next term. I listened to Dewey’s speech Tuesday night and the only thing our hero could say was a series of platitudes—nothing specific and sling mud at Roosevelt’s associates. Bah! About the pilot—He got his just deserves [sic]. He can’t justify his actions. He was a ménage and took a life. The fact that he was young 2 ̆ 6 intelligent is a mitigating circumstance. His sentence will probably be reduced in about 5 years. You know, darling, I find sometime[s] that I can’t adequately describe my feelings for you. When I think of you (which is always) I smile to myself and say, “Gee, your [sic] a lucky guy to have a wife who loves you so intensly [sic].

40|$|In this thesis, I {{investigate}} private telegraphy {{from its}} {{rise in the}} late 1830 s to the advent of exchange telephony in the early 1880 s. In contrast to public telegraphy where telegrams were transmitted over a shared network infrastructure, private telegraphy was a direct, more immediate form of user-to-user communication delivered over private wires. My objective is to redress a historiographical distortion {{in the understanding of}} the Victorian telegraph created by the conflation of the concept of telegraph with telegram, and by the prominence given to the nationalisation of the telegraph industry in 1870 in the discourse of historians like Jeffrey Kieve or Charles Perry, thus obscuring the critical role played by private telegraphy in the history of communication. To begin with, I expose the dichotomy between public and private telegraphy by demonstrating the similarities and rivalry between telegrams and letters. I contend that this rivalry was an important factor behind the nationalisation. The extent to which private telegraphy was distinct from public telegraphy is demonstrated through a comprehensive history of private wires and the first domestic telegraph instruments. I track the development of private wires, from their inception at the hands of users of the telegraph to their assimilation by telephony, and show their versatility for diverse uses. I also reveal how telegraphic <b>intercommunication</b> <b>systems</b> – the so-called Umschalters – were reconfigured to become the Post Office’s first generation of telephone exchanges in the early 1880 s. From this novel perspective, I counter the received scholarly view that the Post Office obstructed the expansion of telephony to protect the Crown’s stake in telegraphy. I claim instead that the Post Office exploited the installed base of Umschalters and private wires, by then referred to as subscriber lines, to become an active participant in the nascent telephone industry alongside the private companies, thus accelerating the take-up of exchange telephony. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Real-time {{interactive}} {{virtual classroom}} with teleeducation experience {{is an important}} approach in distance learning. However, most current systems fail to meet new challenges in extensibility and scalability, which mainly lie with three issues. First, an open system architecture is required to better support the integration of increasing human-computer interfaces and personal mobile devices in the classroom. Second, the learning system should facilitate opening its interfaces, which will help easy deployment that copes with different circumstances and allows other learning systems {{to talk to each}} other. Third, problems emerge on binding existing systems of classrooms together in different places or even different countries such as tackling <b>systems</b> <b>intercommunication</b> and distant intercultural learning in different languages. To address these issues, we build a prototype application called Open Smart Classroom built on our software infrastructure based on the multiagent system architecture using Web Service technology in Smart Space. Besides the evaluation of the extensibility and scalability of the system, an experiment connecting two Open Smart Classrooms deployed in different countries is also undertaken, which demonstrates the influence of these new features on the educational effect.

Its basis is <b>intercommunication</b> between information <b>systems,</b> {{in order to}} provide faster and more effective decision making process. These results help minimize human error, improve overall productivity and guarantee customer satisfaction. Most enterprises or corporations started implementing integration by adopting automated solutions in a particular process, department, or area, in isolation {{from the rest of the}} physical or intelligent process resulting in the incapability for systems and equipment to share information with each other and with other computer systems. The goal in a manufacturing environment is to have a set of systems that will interact seamlessly with each other within a heterogeneous object framework overcoming the many barriers (language, platforms, and even physical location) that do not grant information sharing. This study identifies the data needs of several information systems of a corporation and proposes a conceptual model to improve the information sharing process and thus Computer Integrated Manufacturing.
