5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals he wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol {{but not more than}} three pills per day.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{writes a}} love song for Marge, who seems {{completely}} oblivious to him until he tells her {{that he is in}} love with her. She explains to him that she loves Homer, and that he should tell his wife how he feels about her. He agrees, and decides to take Marge back to Homer and then get rid of Verity. When the two arrive in Springfield, Homer and the children are ecstatic to see Marge. However, Verity has already decided to leave Charles, and has found a new partner: Marge's sister Patty. They were brought together by their hatred for Homer and begin to insult him. When an offended Homer threatens to vote in favor of a law that prohibits same-sex couples from adopting children, Patty forces Homer into confessing that he is too lazy to actually <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the episode, Homer plays a guitar and expresses his undying love for his newly bought plasma television and (to a lesser extent) Marge.|$|E

25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} the revolution, {{and during the}} communist persecutions up to 1970, no canonizations took place. Only in 1970 did the Holy Synod {{made a decision to}} canonize a missionary to Japan, Nicholas Kasatkin (1836–1912). In 1977, St. Innocent of Moscow (1797–1879), the Metropolitan of Siberia, the Far East, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and Moscow was also canonized. In 1978 it was proclaimed that the Russian Orthodox Church had created a prayer order for Meletius of Kharkov, which practically signified his canonization because that was the only possible way to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> that time. Similarly, the saints of other Orthodox Churches were added to the Church calendar: in 1962 St. John the Russian, in 1970 St. Herman of Alaska, in 1993 Silouan the Athonite, the elder of Mount Athos, already canonized in 1987 by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. In the 1980s the Russian Orthodox Church re-established the process for canonization; a practice that had ceased for half a century.|$|E

Both Moore and Bolland are well known for their meticulous and time-consuming work; both creators' then-recently finished 12-issue maxiseries titles—Moore's Watchmen and Bolland's Camelot 3000—had seen delays.

500|$|Initially {{intended}} to be a made-for-TV film, the film's producer Kenith Trodd upgraded his original plan to a cinema feature. The original working title for the film was [...] "Falling Man". Playwright Simon Gray was commissioned to write the screenplay, and Pat O'Connor chosen to direct. In contrast to the book, which is narrated as a recollection by Birkin as an old man, the film is set entirely in the 1920s, except for a brief moment towards the end. In initial drafts of the screenplay, Gray had included a narrator, but O'Connor felt this was not the correct way to present the story:I felt that if I couldn’t do it in the present, suggesting internal pain by performance, then I wouldn’t really want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E

Bluegrass is all the way swag." [...] Ocean described the making of his mixtape as a labor of love, stating that [...] "It was like difficult to make.

In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E

500|$|Gaven {{has had a}} {{prominent}} career in musical theatre and has appeared in many rock musicals. She told TheaterWeek in 1993 that she thinks those kinds of musicals are harder to sing in compared to standard musicals, and that [...] "the nature {{of rock and roll}} is that it's on the edge. It's written to be done dangerously. You can't be careful and <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the same time. If you don't do it dangerously, {{you run the risk of}} losing the impact." [...] During her career, Gaven has sung in both mezzo-soprano and soprano roles, and has been cited for her belting. According to Alvin Klein, theatre critic for The New York Times, she [...] "is categorically a mezzo soprano." [...] Gaven has also been noted for her strong voice, and was once told by a sound technician at An Evening Dinner Theater in Elmsford, New York that [...] "We always turn off the mikes when you sing" [...] because she did not need amplification.|$|E

Pam is not sure if he's joking. Alone with the camera, Jim reveals that he was not joking and shows an {{engagement}} ring that he bought [...] "the week after [...] started dating." [...] After work, while walking back to his car, he stops and gets down on one knee. When Pam stops and looks he says he has a question to ask her. After a second or so of hesitation, he asks her if she will wait while he ties his shoes. She laughs and they continue walking hand in hand.

He {{was named to the}} All-Star Futures Game but was unable to play in it because he was promoted to the major leagues by the Texas Rangers. Later, during his breakout 2013 season, Davis referred to his time with Round Rock in 2008: [...] "I know nobody really cares about Triple-A, but I put up these numbers up in Triple-A. That was kind of the question, 'Was he {{going to be able to}} <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the big league level?' The thing about it was, I just couldn't do it consistently.

500|$|Holtz's {{first job}} at {{his alma mater}} was to serve as wide {{receivers}} coach, and he filled the position for two years. In 1992, the team began {{a search for a}} new offensive coordinator. Lou's first choice, Joe Moore, declined. Lou then asked Skip for recommendations to fill the position. Skip initially said he wanted the position but said of Lou, [...] "he couldn't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> that time with me [...] being his son." [...] Skip then mentioned Mark Richt, who was then the offensive coordinator at Florida State. Lou Holtz called Coach Bowden to ask permission to speak to Mark Richt. Coach Bowden said Holtz could hire Richt {{as long as he could}} hire Skip. Coach Holtz said, [...] "Well, if I'm just going to switch coaches, I might as well hire Skip." [...] Skip became Notre Dame's offensive coordinator in 1992. Between 1992 and 1994, Skip and his father recorded 40 wins, eight losses, and one tie, an 82.7% winning percentage. Together, they coached Notre Dame to the Cotton Bowl Classic twice, beating Texas A both times. Skip had the third-best total offense in the NCAA during the 1992 football season.|$|E

[...] Similar to his high school decision, Barnes said, [...] "He wants to win a national championship and said he wants {{to do it in the}} state of Indiana and wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> a place he's never done it before." [...] Some people believe Barnes had ulterior motives in adopting Swanigan, to which Barnes said, [...] "Maybe if I wanted to develop the next hot-dog-eating champion, the next Joey Chestnut, people would have a legitimate gripe." [...] Swanigan had not consulted Barnes before he committed to Michigan State, and some believe that since Barnes played sports at Purdue he was a major influence in Swanigan decommitting from Michigan State. Barnes said that was not the reason Swanigan switched, and the primary reason for Swanigan choosing Purdue was the presence of two centers that were taller than 7', Isaac Haas and A.J. Hammons, which allowed Swanigan to play the 4 spot.|$|E
