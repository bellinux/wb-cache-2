5|$|While Article 34 of the {{constitution}} of Luxembourg formerly required the grand duke or duchess to sanction and promulgate a new law for it to take effect, the required sanction was removed in 2008, after Grand Duke Henri informed his prime minister {{that he could not}} <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>conscience</b> assent to a bill to permit euthanasia in the country. The subsequent constitutional amendment removed the need for assent while retaining the need for the Grand Duke to promulgate new laws. The Grand-Duke's signature is still required, but does not imply assent, only promulgation (announcement that the law has been enacted by Parliament). The Grand-Duke did sign the Euthanasia Act under this new constitutional arrangement.|$|E

25|$|The 1868 {{convention}} {{witnessed a}} meaningful {{discussion on the}} topic of pulpit and altar fellowship, one of the Four Points in American Lutheranism. Although there were several dissenting opinions, most of the pastors and lay delegates realized that they could not <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>conscience</b> exchange pastors with non-Lutherans or invite them to commune at their altar. They felt that the position the General Council took on this subject was inadequate. They resolved that, unless it changed course, they would withdraw from the General Council.|$|E
25|$|On May 8, 1869, James and Sarah {{had another}} son, James Rowland Angell, who later served as {{president}} of Yale University. That same year, the University of Michigan offered Angell its presidency following the resignation of Erastus Haven. He visited Ann Arbor with his wife, but felt that he owed it to his supporters in Vermont to stay on with the University of Vermont. The offer was repeated in 1871, his former teacher Henry S. Frieze having served as acting president in the meantime. This time, Angell felt that the University of Vermont had made enough progress that he could leave it <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>conscience,</b> and he accepted the offer. He made a trip to Ann Arbor to deliver his inaugural address at Commencement on June 28, 1871, then returned to Vermont to finish out the academic term before moving his family to Ann Arbor for good in September of that year.|$|E

That he should have wasted some years in ignorance of what alone was really important, that he may have entertained the thought of other women with any show of complacency, is a burthen almost too heavy for his self-respect. But it is the thought of another past that rankles in his spirit like a poisoned wound. That he himself made a fashion of being alive in the bald, beggarly days before a certain meeting, is deplorable enough <b>in</b> all <b>good</b> <b>conscience.</b> But that She should have permitted herself the same liberty seems inconsistent with a Divine providence.|$|R

Entertainment Weekly reported that One Life to Live agreed to let Howarth go on the condition he would not appear on another soap opera for twelve months.

5000|$|Democratic Party rules {{distinguish}} pledged and unpledged delegates. Pledged delegates {{are selected}} based on their announced preferences in the contest for the presidential nomination. In the party primary elections and caucuses in each U.S. state, voters express their preference among the contenders for the party's nomination for President of the United States. Pledged delegates supporting each candidate are chosen in approximate ratio to their candidate’s share of the vote. They fall into three categories: district-level pledged delegates (usually by congressional districts), at-large pledged delegates, and pledged PLEO (Party Leaders and Elected Officials) delegates. In {{a minority of the}} states, delegates are legally required to support the candidate to whom they are pledged. In addition to the states' requirements, the party rules state (Rule 12.J): [...] "Delegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall <b>in</b> all <b>good</b> <b>conscience</b> reflect the sentiments of those who elected them." ...|$|R
50|$|Named L'Arc, the {{monument}} {{is in the}} form of a curved tree whose branches reach down into the ground. L'Arc was designed as a complex symbol whose meaning was to be open to individual interpretation, though de Broin has said that he was inspired by a passage in Salvador Allende's last speech to the Chilean people where he says: « I am certain that the seeds which we have planted <b>in</b> the <b>good</b> <b>conscience</b> of thousands and thousands of Chileans will not be shriveled forever. They have force and will be able to dominate us, but social processes can be arrested by neither crime nor force. History is ours, and people make history. » Michel de Broin has also said that {{the monument}} represents the connection that Chileans living in Quebec have with that province, while maintaining their roots in Chile. L'Arc also symbolizes the present's memory of the past, and of a reconnection to one's origins.|$|R
60|$|Now Knox {{has been}} from the first a man well hated; and it is {{somewhat}} characteristic of his luck that he figures here in the very forefront {{of the list of}} partial scribes who trimmed their doctrine with the wind <b>in</b> all <b>good</b> <b>conscience,</b> and were political weathercocks out of conviction. Not only has Thomasius mentioned him, but Bayle has taken the hint from Thomasius, and dedicated a long note to the matter {{at the end of his}} article on the Scotch Reformer. This is a little less than fair. If any one among the evangelists of that period showed more serious political sense than another, it was assuredly Knox; and even in this very matter of female rule, although I do not suppose any one nowadays will feel inclined to endorse his sentiments, I confess I can make great allowance for his conduct. The controversy, besides, has an interest of its own, in view of later controversies.|$|R

She eventually decided to keep to the original release schedule, as she thought that making the game available to those struggling with their own problems was more important than any negative publicity she might receive, writing, [...] "I can’t <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>conscience</b> hold back offering someone something that could help them start making real changes in their life for the sake of reducing the risk of offending people or hurting my own reputation." ...|$|E

Back then, it was generally accepted that great whites were anthropophagus (they ate people) by choice.

50|$|Question 80: Can true believers be infallibly {{assured that}} they are in the estate of grace, and that they shall persevere therein unto salvation?Answer: Such as truly believe in Christ, and {{endeavor}} to walk <b>in</b> all <b>good</b> <b>conscience</b> before him, may, without extraordinary revelation, by faith grounded upon the truth of God's promises, and by the Spirit enabling them to discern in themselves those graces to which the promises of life are made, and bearing witness with their spirits {{that they are}} the children of God, be infallibly assured {{that they are in}} the estate of grace, and shall persevere therein unto salvation. Question 81: Are all true believers at all times assured of their present being in the estate of grace, and that they shall be saved?Answer: Assurance of grace and salvation not being of the essence of faith, true believers may wait long before they obtain it; and, after the enjoyment thereof, may have it weakened and intermitted, through manifold distempers, sins, temptations, and desertions; yet are they never left without such a presence and support of the Spirit of God as keeps them from sinking into utter despair.|$|R
