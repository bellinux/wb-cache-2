25|$|The {{reasons for}} the sex role in {{autoimmunity}} vary. Women appear to generally mount larger inflammatory responses than men when their immune systems are triggered, increasing the risk of autoimmunity. Involvement of sex steroids is indicated by that many autoimmune diseases tend to fluctuate in accordance with hormonal changes, for example: during pregnancy, in the menstrual cycle, or when using oral contraception. A history of pregnancy also appears to leave a persistent increased risk for autoimmune disease. It {{has been suggested that}} the slight, direct exchange of cells between mothers and their children during pregnancy may induce autoimmunity.

25|$|There {{has been}} an {{interesting}} evolution in the <b>gender</b> <b>balance</b> among PhD students.

Although data are not readily available on the number of PhD graduates choosing to stay on as faculty, the relatively modest level of domestic research spending would suggest that academic research suffers from inadequate funding.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to examine whether a gender equal board of directors {{have an impact on}} the equity performance during the examination period of December 2011 to December 2016. This study shows that the <b>gender</b> <b>balanced</b> portfolio outperforms the non-gender balanced portfolio in all investigated performance measures. The portfolios used in this thesis consists of firms listed on the Swedish stock market which have been classified due to their representation of women on the board. The portfolios are compared and analyzed using the Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, Jensen’s alpha and Appraisal Ratio. The result implies that a gender equal board improves the equity performance of a company. A regression analysis further implies that the performance of the <b>gender</b> <b>balanced</b> portfolio can not be explained by market movements contrary to the non-gender balanced portfolio. In other words, there must be other factors affecting the performance of the <b>gender</b> <b>balanced</b> portfolio. The main difference between the two portfolios is the share of women on the board which implies that this is one of the strengthening factors. The results can be of interest for investors seeking a socially sustainable investment strategy, but also add value to the ongoing debate regarding gender quotas...|$|R

25|$|In April 1974 the Arts Council of Great Britain gave COUM {{the first}} half of a £1,500 grant. The money stabilised the group, which now {{included}} P-Orridge and Tutti as directors, John Gunni Busck as technical director, and Lelli Maull as musical director. During that year, they made use of various artist-run venues in London, most notably the Art Meeting Place (AMP) in Covent Garden, where they regularly performed during 1974. A number of these works entailed P-Orridge and Tutti exploring the <b>gender</b> <b>balance,</b> including concepts of gender confusion. In one performance at the AWB, which was titled Filth, P-Orridge and Tutti performed sexual acts using a double-ended dildo. COUM were frustrated with the restrictions imposed on them by the Arts Council as a prerequisite for receiving funding; rather than performing at Council-accredited venues, they wanted to perform more spontaneously. In August 1974 they carried out a spontaneous unauthorised piece of performance art in Brook Green, Hammersmith; during the performance, police arrived and put a stop to the event, deeming it obscene.|$|E
