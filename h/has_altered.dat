5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the construction of Ithai Barrage <b>has</b> <b>altered</b> the Loktak Lake and its ecosystem. Siltation has reduced the water holding capacity and has consequently had a negative impact on the power generation capacity at the Loktak Hydro Electric Power Project. Thinning of the phumdi in the Keibul Lamjao area has affected the habitat of the sangai, and other aquafauna, avifauna and flora are on the decline; the 35 species (5 mammals, 3 birds, 9 reptiles, 3 amphibians, 12 fishes, 2 molluscs and 1 annelid) are reported to be disappearing gradually.|$|E

Independence Day activities require Metro to adjust service to provide extra capacity {{to and from}} the National Mall. WMATA makes similar adjustments during other events, such as presidential inaugurations. Metro <b>has</b> <b>altered</b> service and used some stations as entrances or exits only to help manage congestion.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{organization}} of the Roman fleets of late Antiquity, from the gradual break-up of the large provincial fleets into smaller squadrons in the 3rd century to the formation of a new navy at the onset of the Muslim conquests. Despite the evidence of considerable naval activity in this period, earlier scholars believed that the Roman navy had all but vanished by the 4th century, but more recent work <b>has</b> <b>altered</b> this picture towards a transformation into a mainly fluvial and coastal force, designed for close co-operation with the army.|$|E
5|$|The larger US dams {{are owned}} and {{operated}} by the federal government (some by the Army Corps of Engineers and some by the Bureau of Reclamation), while the smaller dams are operated by public utility districts, and private power companies. The federally operated system is known as the Federal Columbia River Power System, which includes 31dams on the Columbia and its tributaries. The system <b>has</b> <b>altered</b> the seasonal flow of the river in order to meet higher electricity demands during the winter. At the beginning of the 20thcentury, roughly 75percent of the Columbia's flow occurred in the summer, between April and September. By 1980, the summer proportion had been lowered to about 50percent, essentially eliminating the seasonal pattern.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{and with}} renewed hope, Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville, which Discord <b>has</b> <b>altered</b> in a chaotic manner: The day-night cycle is {{haphazard}} and buildings float off the ground. Discord continues to taunt Twilight, {{but she is}} determined {{to get back to}} the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them all into the library, Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the book, are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements. She forces her best friends to wear the Elements, though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that the sooner they defeat Discord, the sooner they never have to see each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but the Elements fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color.|$|E

A series of takeovers and mergers across the ITV network, instigated by the large groups Granada and Carlton, led to Tyne Tees becoming part of ITV plc in 2004.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to rapid}} urbanization, {{topographic}} elements, and {{the occurrence of}} severe storm events in Buenos Aires, flooding {{has become one of}} the most serious problems affecting the normal life of Buenos Aires citizens. Extensive and frequent damage to urban, commercial, and industrial infrastructure is also prevalent. The continuous increase in the degree of impermeable surfaces (only 10% of the city is open and green space) in the city <b>has</b> <b>altered</b> normal functioning of the stormwater drainage network.

25|$|This patriarchal {{backlash}} {{may indeed}} {{be the result of}} lack of employment opportunities for men and more women entering the workforce which <b>has</b> <b>altered</b> traditional gender dynamics and created a situation of conflict between the sexes. Other researchers attribute the murders to Mexico's structural crisis including increasing poverty, unemployment, the disintegration of the peasant economy, migration, and a dysfunctional justice system. Overall, in considering the potential motives for gendered violence against women, academic Mercedes Olivera has argued that femicide is a mechanism of domination, control, oppression, and power over women.|$|E
25|$|Evidence from {{microfossil}} records {{indicates that}} ferns and woody plants were present on Heard Island during the Tertiary (a period {{with a cool}} and moist climate). Neither group of plants is present today, although potential Tertiary survivors include the vascular plant Pringlea antiscorbutica and six moss species. Volcanic activity <b>has</b> <b>altered</b> the distribution and abundance of the vegetation. The vascular flora covers a range of environments and, although only six species are currently widespread, glacial retreat and the consequent connection of previously separate ice-free areas is providing opportunities for further distribution of vegetation into adjacent areas.|$|E
25|$|In 1950 few {{northern}} cities yet had majority or near majority {{percentages of}} blacks, nor did southern ones: Washington, DC was 35 percent African American and Baltimore was 40 percent. From 1950 to 1970, {{the black population}} increased dramatically in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Newark, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, Cincinnati and Indianapolis. By 1960 75 percent of blacks lived in urban environments, while whites had been moving to suburbs in large numbers following WWII. Black flight <b>has</b> <b>altered</b> the hyper-urban density that had resulted from the Second Great Migration to cities (1940‚Äì70), with hyper-segregation in inner-city areas, such as in Chicago, St. Louis, and East St. Louis.|$|E
