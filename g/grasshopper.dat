5|$|Species {{such as the}} Senegalese <b>grasshopper</b> (Oedaleus senegalensis) and the African rice <b>grasshopper</b> (Hieroglyphus daganensis), {{both from}} the Sahel, often display locust-like {{behaviour}} and change morphologically on crowding.|$|E
5|$|<b>Grasshopper</b> beam engines were beam engines pivoted at one end, {{the long}} {{horizontal}} arm resembling the hind {{leg of a}} <b>grasshopper.</b> The type was patented by William Freemantle in 1803.|$|E
5|$|In most <b>grasshopper</b> species, {{conflicts}} between males over females rarely escalate beyond ritualistic displays. Some exceptions include the chameleon <b>grasshopper</b> (Kosciuscola tristis), where males may fight {{on top of}} ovipositing females; engaging in leg grappling, biting, kicking and mounting.|$|E
50|$|Gomphocerinae is a {{subfamily}} of <b>grasshoppers,</b> {{commonly called}} slant-faced <b>grasshoppers.</b>|$|R
5|$|In some countries, <b>grasshoppers</b> {{are used}} as food. In {{southern}} Mexico, <b>grasshoppers,</b> known as chapulines, are eaten {{in a variety of}} dishes, such as in tortillas with chilli sauce. <b>Grasshoppers</b> are served on skewers in some Chinese food markets, like the Donghuamen Night Market. Fried <b>grasshoppers</b> (walang goreng) are eaten in the Gunung Kidul Regency, Yogyakarta, Java in Indonesia. In Native America, the Ohlone people burned grassland to herd <b>grasshoppers</b> into pits where they could be collected as food.|$|R

5|$|Some <b>grasshopper</b> species, {{like the}} Chinese rice <b>grasshopper,</b> are a pest in rice paddies. Ploughing exposes the eggs {{on the surface}} of the field, to be {{destroyed}} by sunshine or eaten by natural enemies. Some eggs may be buried too deeply in the soil for hatching to take place.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of wild birds {{may be seen in}} Cheddar Gorge {{including}} peregrine falcons, buzzards, kestrels, ravens and the <b>grasshopper</b> warbler (Locustella naevia).|$|E
5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain is an {{adventure}} game developed by <b>Grasshopper</b> Manufacture for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). It was initially published by Victor Interactive Software in Japan in 2001. A port for the Nintendo DS (DS) {{was developed by}} h.a.n.d. under supervision by <b>Grasshopper</b> Manufacture. It was published by Marvelous Entertainment in Japan (2008), Rising Star Games in Europe (2008), and Marvelous Entertainment USA in partnership with Xseed Games in North America (2009).|$|E
50|$|Eumorsea is a genus of <b>grasshoppers</b> in {{the family}} Eumastacidae, the monkey <b>grasshoppers.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Grasshoppers</b> {{are also}} {{featured}} in cinema. The 1957 film Beginning of the End portrayed giant <b>grasshoppers</b> attacking Chicago. In the 1998 Pixar film A Bug's Life, the heroes are {{the members of}} an ant colony, and the lead villain and his henchmen are <b>grasshoppers.</b>|$|R

5|$|In June 1939, several Locust class gunboats {{arrived on}} the Yangtze to take over {{operations}} from the existing Insect class vessels. Part of {{the crew of the}} Gnat transferred to HMS <b>Grasshopper,</b> including Judy. Following the British declaration of war on Germany in September that year, several of the river gunboats, <b>Grasshopper</b> included, were redeployed to the British base at Singapore. Judy was initially sea sick, but the crew ensured that she was properly exercised {{and by the time the}} ship arrived on station, she had recovered.|$|E
5|$|In The Ant and the <b>Grasshopper,</b> a <b>grasshopper</b> squanders {{the spring}} and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry <b>grasshopper</b> begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away. Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the <b>grasshopper</b> could just take the food. After Stanton had {{completed}} a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars – that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight. He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act. Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.|$|E
5|$|Judy (1936 – 17 February 1950) was a ship's dog {{on board}} HMS Gnat and HMS <b>Grasshopper</b> {{stationed}} on the Yangtze {{before and during}} World War II. She proved able to hear incoming aircraft, providing the crew with an early warning. After part of the crew transferred from the Gnat to the <b>Grasshopper</b> in June 1939 the ship was sent to Singapore after the British declaration of war on Germany. There she was on board the ship during the Battle of Singapore, which saw <b>Grasshopper</b> evacuate for the Dutch East Indies. It was sunk en route, and Judy was nearly killed having been trapped by a falling row of lockers. She was rescued when a crewman returned to the stricken vessel looking for supplies.|$|E
40|$|Each year, I {{hear the}} {{statement}} that <b>grasshoppers</b> must be sprayed when they are small because adult <b>grasshoppers</b> are notoriously hard to kill. I was not certain that this statement was true, so last year I sprayed adult differential <b>grasshoppers</b> in a laboratory experiment. Ten adult <b>grasshoppers</b> were singly caged in paper cups and covered with nylon mesh for each treatment. Cups containing the <b>grasshoppers</b> were then sprayed in a mechanical spray chamber with an insecticide {{at a rate of}} 19. 6 gallons of water per acre and 25 psi by using an 80005 -E nozzle...|$|R

5|$|After the Japanese {{captured}} the Malayan Peninsula, both ships moved to Singapore harbour. On 8 February, the Japanese launched an amphibious assault across the Strait of Johore and following heavy fighting, many ships began evacuating from the harbour. By 11 February Gnat and <b>Grasshopper</b> were the largest vessels left. The two ships left Singapore for Batavia at 21:00 on 13 February, having taken on other personnel to evacuate them. Amongst these was Commander Ian Forbes, {{formerly of the}} battleship , which had been sunk by the Japanese just over two months earlier. By the following morning {{they could hear the}} attacks by Japanese aircraft on other vessels in the distance. As they were sailing south, they were attacked by Japanese bombers. During the initial pass, <b>Grasshopper</b> was hit by a single bomb. When the planes returned, Dragonfly was hit three times and sank quickly. <b>Grasshopper</b> was hit twice and was set on fire. The order to abandon ship was given as the fire spread to compartments adjacent to an ammunition store.|$|E
5|$|The <b>grasshopper</b> {{nematode}} (Mermis nigrescens) {{is a long}} slender worm that infects grasshoppers, {{living in}} the insect's hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the <b>grasshopper</b> is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite {{to continue with the}} next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.|$|E
5|$|The island {{they arrived}} on {{turned out to}} be {{uninhabited}} with little food and no apparent water. After a camp had been set up ashore, White was sent back to the still floating <b>Grasshopper</b> to scavenge supplies. He boarded the vessel and descended below decks to search for any items that might be of use. Whilst there, he felt Judy in the darkness, pinned in her bed under a row of lockers. He constructed a raft out of materials on the <b>Grasshopper</b> and rowed the items, along with Judy, back to the island. The lack of water was becoming an issue, until Judy began to dig at a point on the waterline. It took a couple of minutes, but Judy managed to unearth a fresh-water spring and was credited with saving everyone's lives. During the first night, the magazine on the <b>Grasshopper</b> finally caught light and exploded, sinking the vessel. The survivors continued to camp on the beach for the following few days, with Judy protecting them from snakes.|$|E
5000|$|Melanoplus {{is a large}} genus of <b>grasshoppers.</b> They are {{the typical}} large <b>grasshoppers</b> (and in some cases migratory [...] "locusts") in North America. A common name is spur-throat <b>grasshoppers</b> (also [...] "spurthroat" [...] or [...] "spur-throated grasshoppers"), but this more {{typically}} refers {{to members of the}} related subfamily Catantopinae.|$|R
2500|$|Gordon {{kept the}} <b>grasshoppers</b> {{in a box}} {{for only a few}} days, but during that time the <b>grasshoppers</b> devoured one another and only 12 were left when Gordon finally got around to {{shooting}} them. Gordon also considered building miniatures for the <b>grasshoppers</b> to climb on, but this, too, was deemed too expensive. Instead, Gordon used still photographs of the Wrigley Building and other noted Chicago landmarks and simply filmed the <b>grasshoppers</b> moving about on top of the photograph. When the monsters are supposed to be wounded or killed by gunfire, Gordon merely tipped the photograph and the <b>grasshoppers</b> slid down it. According to one film historian, [...] "the effect looks (almost) real" [...] until one of the <b>grasshoppers</b> steps off the [...] "building" [...] into what is supposed to be thin air.|$|R

5|$|The {{ship was}} ordered on 9 August 1937 {{as one of}} the {{intended}} replacements for the existing river gunboats stationed on the Chinese rivers. <b>Grasshopper</b> was laid down on 29 December 1937 by John I. Thornycroft & Company at Woolston, Southampton, and launched on 19 January 1939.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1994, Pixar's story {{department}} began turning their thoughts to their next film. The storyline for A Bug's Life originated from a lunchtime conversation between John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft, the studio's head story team; other films such as Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo were also conceived at this lunch. Lasseter and his story team had already been drawn {{to the idea of}} insects serving as characters. Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop's fable The Ant and the <b>Grasshopper.</b> Walt Disney had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film The <b>Grasshopper</b> and the Ants. In addition, Walt Disney Feature Animation (now Walt Disney Animation Studios) had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled Army Ants, that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized.|$|E
50|$|Much {{like other}} crakes, it feeds on small fish, molluscs, worms and insects (beetles, <b>grasshoppers</b> and caterpillars). Large <b>grasshoppers</b> shaken about and {{battered}} before swallowing.|$|R
50|$|It flew anti-submarine {{missions}} using A-20 Havocs, B-25 Mitchells, and O-52 Owls, while undergoing observation {{training at}} these various {{bases in the}} southeastern states. They used L-1 Vigilants, L-2 <b>Grasshoppers,</b> Aeronca L-3s, L-4 <b>Grasshoppers,</b> L-5 Sentinels, L-6 <b>Grasshoppers,</b> and Douglas O-46s for observation sorties. P-39 Airacobras, P-43 Lancers, and P-51 Mustangs were also in the squadron aircraft inventory.|$|R
40|$|Summer feeding <b>grasshoppers</b> {{can cause}} severe damage to nearly all crops {{when they are}} {{abundant}} in field borders. Identification of the <b>grasshoppers</b> present is important because only four species are likely to cause significant crop damage. These four species are spur-throated <b>grasshoppers</b> that have a rounded head and a spur between their front legs. They are more common in weed-infested field borders and weedy adjacent pastures, but will move to cropland after consuming most of the weeds. Summer feeding <b>grasshoppers</b> overwinter as eggs and hatch through much of May and June...|$|R
5|$|Grasshoppers are {{sometimes}} used as symbols, as in Sir Thomas Gresham's gilded <b>grasshopper</b> in Lombard Street, London, dating from 1563; {{the building was}} for a while {{the headquarters of the}} Guardian Royal Exchange, but the company declined to use the symbol for fear of confusion with the locust.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers eat large {{quantities}} of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in <b>grasshopper</b> populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a massive population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so {{that large numbers of}} nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing <b>grasshopper</b> population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.|$|E
5|$|In mimesis (also called masquerade), the camouflaged object {{looks like}} {{something}} else which is of no special interest to the observer. Mimesis is common in prey animals, for example when a peppered moth caterpillar mimics a twig, or a <b>grasshopper</b> mimics a dry leaf. It {{is also found in}} nest structures; some eusocial wasps, such as Leipomeles dorsata, build a nest envelope in patterns that mimic the leaves surrounding the nest.|$|E
50|$|In some {{variations}} <b>grasshoppers</b> {{may also}} be present on the board in the opening position, {{in addition to the}} usual pieces. For example, pawns can be moved forward and <b>grasshoppers</b> put along the second and seventh ranks as shown on the diagram at right. Another possibility is to replace queens with <b>grasshoppers</b> in initial position, while pawns can still be promoted to queens.|$|R
5000|$|Cryptocatantops debilis [...] is {{a species}} of <b>grasshoppers</b> in the {{subfamily}} Catantopinae, a group of insects commonly called spur-throated <b>grasshoppers.</b> The type specimen was a female found in Omaruru, Namibia.|$|R
50|$|Cryptocatantops is a genus of <b>grasshoppers</b> in the {{subfamily}} Catantopinae, a {{group of}} insects commonly called spur-throated <b>grasshoppers.</b> As numerous other genera, {{it is not yet}} assigned to a particular tribe.|$|R
