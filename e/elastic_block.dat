40|$|A linear viscous {{model for}} {{evaluating}} the stresses and strains produced in masonry structures over time is presented. The model is based on rigorous homogenization procedures {{and the following two}} assumptions: that the structure is composed of either rigid or <b>elastic</b> <b>blocks,</b> and that the mortar is viscoelastic. The hypothesis of rigid block is particularly suitable for historical masonry, in which stone blocks may be assumed as rigid bodies, while the hypothesis of <b>elastic</b> <b>blocks</b> may be assumed for newly constructed brickwork structures. The hypothesis of viscoelastic mortar is based on the observation that non-linear phenomena may be concentrated in mortar joints. Under these assumptions, constitutive homogenized viscous functions are obtained in an analytical form. Some meaningful cases are discussed: masonry columns subject to minor and major eccentricity, and a masonry panel subject to both horizontal and vertical loads. The major eccentricity case is analysed taking into account both the effect of viscosity and the no-tension hypothesis, whereas the bi-dimensional loading case is analysed to verify the sensitivity of masonry behaviour to viscous function. In the masonry wall considered, the principal stresses are both of compression, and the no-tension assumption may therefore be discounted...|$|R

The example concerns a granitic rock mass at the km 3 scale where an underground hydropower scheme including a new 10 km long power conduit and a powerhouse complex located about halfway in the conduit and 500 m below ground level will be constructed. For design of the underground cavern and hydraulic pressure tunnel, several in situ stress measurements were carried out, using hydraulic, overcoring and flat jack techniques. Integration of the several in situ test results through a continuum mechanics model shows that the long-term behavior of this granite rock mass differs markedly from the short-term behaviour as defined by laboratory measurements on cores. The large scale stress field is found to depend mostly on the softer material that fills up the faults and hence results from the shear stress relaxation over a large number of pre-existing fractures and faults. The overall granite rock mass may be viewed as a combination of stiff <b>elastic</b> <b>blocks</b> separated by soft low strength material, leading to a fairly large scale homogeneous axisymmetrical stress field with vertical axis, with local strong anomalies that correspond to either high or low stress magnitudes...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the insight}} gained from 2 -D {{particle}} models, {{and given that}} the dynamics of crustal faults occur in 3 -D space, the question remains, how do the 3 -D fault gouge dynamics differ from those in 2 -D? Traditionally, 2 -D modeling has been preferred over 3 -D simulations because of the computational cost of solving 3 -D problems. However, modern high performance computing architectures, combined with a parallel implementation of the Lattice Solid Model (LSM), provide the opportunity to explore 3 -D fault micro-mechanics and to advance understanding of effective constitutive relations of fault gouge layers. In this paper, macroscopic friction values from 2 -D and 3 -D LSM simulations, performed on an SGI Altix 3700 super-cluster, are compared. Two rectangular <b>elastic</b> <b>blocks</b> of bonded particles, with a rough fault plane and separated by a region of randomly sized non-bonded gouge particles, are sheared in opposite directions by normally-loaded driving plates. The results demonstrate that the gouge particles in the 3 -D models undergo significant out-of-plane motion during shear. The 3 -D models also exhibit a higher mean macroscopic friction than the 2 -D models for varying values of interparticle friction. 2 -D LSM gouge models have previously been shown to exhibit accelerating energy release in simulated earthquake cycles, supporting the Critical Point hypothesis. The 3 -D models are shown to also display accelerating energy release, and good fits of power law time-to-failure functions to the cumulative energy release are obtained...|$|R

40|$|An {{appreciation}} of the physical mechanisms which cause observed seismicity complexity is fundamental {{to the understanding of}} the temporal behaviour of faults and single slip events. Numerical simulation of fault slip can provide insights into fault processes by allowing exploration of parameter spaces which influence microscopic and macroscopic physics of processes which may lead towards an answer to those questions. Particle-based models such as the Lattice Solid Model have been used previously for the simulation of stick-slip dynamics of faults, although mainly in two dimensions. Recent increases in the power of computers and the ability to use the power of parallel computer systems have made it possible to extend particle-based fault simulations to three dimensions. In this paper a particle-based numerical model of a rough planar fault embedded between two <b>elastic</b> <b>blocks</b> in three dimensions is presented. A very simple friction law without any rate dependency and no spatial heterogeneity in the intrinsic coefficient of friction is used in the model. To simulate earthquake dynamics the model is sheared in a direction parallel to the fault plane with a constant velocity at the driving edges. Spontaneous slip occurs on the fault when the shear stress is large enough to overcome the frictional forces on the fault. Slip events with a wide range of event sizes are observed. Investigation of the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of slip during each event shows a high degree of variability between the events. In some of the larger events highly complex slip patterns are observed...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, 2 D Discrete Element Models (DEMs) {{have been}} {{preferred}} over 3 D models, for fault gouge simu-lations, {{because of the}} computational cost of solving 3 D problems. In order to realistically simulate fault gouge processes {{it is important to}} characterise differences between 2 D and 3 D models and be able to assess whether 2 D models are adequate for approximating 3 D gouge dynamics. In this paper, 2 D and 3 D fault gouges are simu-lated as two rectangular <b>elastic</b> <b>blocks</b> of bonded particles, separated by a region of randomly sized non-bonded spherical gouge particles, sheared in opposite directions by normally-loaded driving plates. The dynamic behav-ior of multiple model parameterisations is analysed by examining instantaneous macroscopic fault friction (µI) statistics. The response of the mean macroscopic friction is characterised for varying values of inter-particle (microscopic) friction µP in 2 D and 3 D and for non-rotational and rotational particle dynamics. In the non-rotational models, realistic angular gouge mean macroscopic friction values (E[µI] ≈ 0. 6) are obtained in the simulations for a 2 D inter-particle friction value of µP = 0. 3 and 3 D value of µP = 0. 2. The rotational models exhibit mean macroscopic friction values of E[µI] = 0. 3 (in 2 D) and E[µI] = 0. 38 (in 3 D) for inter-particle friction values µP ≥ 0. 3. The 2 D rotational macroscopic friction values are in close agreement with comparable 2 D glass-rod (E[µI] ≈ 0. 3) laboratory experiments.

The purpose of the DST is to acquire a more in-depth understanding of coupled Thermal-Mechanical-Hydrological-Chemical (TMHC) processes likely {{to exist in the}} rock mass surrounding a potential geologic repository at Yucca Mountain. Moreover, the DST is located in a highly fractured and densely welded ash-flow tuff, and movement of fluids in this rock is thought to occur primarily through the fractures. Our work is concerned with describing fracture deformation due to thermal mechanical effects, as normal and shear deformation of fractures can substantially change the fracture permeability, and affect the coupled TMHC behavior. We modeled the DST by defining a rectangular rock mass 50 m x 50 m x 100 m in size. The rock mass was formed by an assemblage of discrete, <b>elastic</b> <b>blocks.</b> Excavations within the DST were closely simulated, and discrete fractures mapped from video logs of several boreholes in the DST test block were incorporated.

Results of the simulations show good agreement with deformations measured in the DST using multiple-point borehole extensometers. Our analysis also indicates that the most fracture deformation occurs above the drift, and co-located with micro seismic activity and acoustic emissions observed during the DST. Results to be presented include predicted temperature and stress fields, fracture displacements, and comparison between observed and predicted displacements at specific locations in the test.

When considering the approach taken in <b>elastic</b> <b>block</b> ciphers, the question arises as to whether cryptanalysis results, including methods of analysis and bounds on security, for the original fixed-sized cipher are lost or, since original components of the cipher are used, whether previous analysis can be applied or reused in some manner.

We show how they can be related to the corresponding security of the fixed-length version of the cipher. Concretely, we develop techniques that take advantage of relationships between the structure of the elastic network and the original version of the cipher, independently of the cipher.

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} when performing seismic vulnerability assessment of masonry buildings to tackle separately out-of-plane and in-plane failure mechanisms developed by load-bearing walls. The former {{are governed by}} the dynamics of rigid bodies while the latter is governed by the mechanics of anisotropic continuum media. The present thesis intends to give {{a contribution to the}} understanding and modelling of both these failure mechanisms. The behaviour of masonry walls under out-of-plane loads is addressed {{in the first part of}} the work (Chapter 3), where the results of a shake-table laboratory campaign on a tuff masonry U-shaped assemblage (façade adjacent to transverse walls) are presented. Scaled natural accelerograms have been adopted in order to analyse the seismic behaviour of the façade. The tests highlight the main factors affecting the dynamic behaviour of the wall, the effects related to the presence of mortar joints and of imperfections, the dependency of the response on the input and the mechanisms of energy dissipation. A modelling strategy based on the Discrete Element Method is then presented, which is shown to reproduce the experimental behaviour of the wall in terms of maximum rotation and time-history response. Finally, test results and numerical time-history simulations are compared to the Italian seismic code assessment procedures. The second part of the thesis (Chapter 4 and 5) deals with modelling in-plane loaded masonry walls by resorting to the homogenization theory for periodic media. First, a Cauchy identification for masonry is developed within the framework of the homogenization theory, which provides analytical expressions for the elastic constants and take into account Poisson effects deriving from the mismatch of brick/joint stiffness and anisotropy deriving from brick interlocking. The results are validated with finite element analyses and experimental data over a wide range of geometrical and mechanical properties of the constituents. Finally, a homogenized limit elastic domain is derived and compared with the experimental tests available in literature, in terms of macroscopic strength and corresponding failure mode. The extension to the non-linear range of homogenization techniques is then addressed within the framework of multi-scale methods. The problem is formulated by referring to a simple micro-mechanical model where masonry is tackled as a system of <b>elastic</b> <b>blocks</b> connected by non-linear interfaces obeying to a Mohr-Coulomb criterion with non associative flow-rule. By introducing affine kinematics within the blocks, the non-linear homogenization problem is expressed in terms of few unknowns and is solved locally by means of an iterative Newton-Raphson scheme.
