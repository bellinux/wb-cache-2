50|$|Forming tap: A quite {{different}} kind of tap is a Forming Tap. A forming tap, aka a fluteless tap or roll tap, simply forcefully displaces the metal into a thread shape upon being turned into the hole, instead of cutting metal {{from the sides of}} the hole as cutting taps do. A forming tap closely resembles a cutting tap without the flutes, or very nearly just like a plain thread. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. The threads behind the lobes are slightly recessed to reduce contact friction. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need to}} periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in a cutting tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to tap with a cutting tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Forming taps only work in malleable materials such as mild steel or aluminum. Formed threads are typically stronger than cut threads. Note that the tap <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> differs from that used for a cutting tap as shown in most tap drill tables, and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|E

30|$|The {{best fit}} {{transverse}} section method presented an excellent agreement to the drill sizes (0.899 of ICC) and a mean difference of 0.07  mm to the drill sizes, comparable to 2 D CT method with a 0.9222 ICC and 0.33  mm mean {{difference to the}} <b>drill</b> <b>size.</b> The intra-rater agreement was excellent (0.999 of ICC) because of the semi-automated nature of the measurement that only varied according {{to the position of}} the measurement. The ability of using the 3 D image avoids the possible bias of the image cut selection and the tunnel-images mismatch present on 2 D measurements. This method preserves the 2 D CT method ability of evaluating the enlargement in different portions of the tunnel length. The best fit cylinder method presented a good agreement to the <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> (0.745 of ICC), and the closest mean difference to the <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> 0.04  mm. It has the advantage of evaluating the entire tunnel at once and was automated. The wall thickness method presented a poor agreement to the <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> and had a mean difference compared to the drill sizes of 3.38  mm due to variability in orientation of the triangles that composed the 3 D model shape, downsizing the overall measurement.|$|E

40|$|Research in {{the field}} of minimally-invasive surgery is important, because it will allow {{surgeries}} at lower risk levels and will help to safe money and time as well. Several critical structures are located at the lateral skull base, so the minimally-invasive approach has not been performed in this area yet. Small errors in the drill placement could lead to severe complications for the patient. In this thesis a prototype for multi-port planning is developed, which models the critical structures and considers the placement inaccuracy of the drill. It also allows the surgeon to determine the <b>drill's</b> <b>size</b> and a minimal distance to the critical structures, which the drill paths have to respect. A prototype has been developed, which employs and extends the medical simulation framework SOFA. New models have been created, describing the drill paths and collision components, enabling the collision detection and its visualization. Another feature of the prototype is the option of simulating the drill feed for a single drill path. The simulation models the drill and its movement from the entry point to the surgical target. This option allows the user assess the spatial relation between the instrument and the critical structures. The prototype's visualization features, its results and performance are analyzed for different drill settings, datasets and computer systems. The drill settings are combinations of <b>drill</b> <b>sizes,</b> minimal distance and drill placement inaccuracies. The evaluation shows that the created collision model has been successfully integrated in SOFA's collision pipeline. The implemented visualization features adequately represents the collisions and drill path parameters. The prototype's performance is limited and needs to be improved.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to study the effect of process parameters on machining process. This procedure {{eliminates the need for}} repeated experiments, time and conserves the material by the conventional procedure. The drilling parameters and specimen parameters evaluated are speed, feed rate, <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> and specimen thickness. A series of experiments are conducted using Radial Drilling Machine to relate the cutting parameters and material parameters on the cutting thrust and torque. The measured results were collected and analyzed {{with the help of the}} commercial software package MINITAB 15. An orthogonal array, signal-to-noise ratio are employed to analyze the influence of these parameters on cutting force and torque during drilling. The method could be useful in predicting thrust and torque parameters as a function of cutting parameters and specimen parameters. The main objective is to find the important factors and combination of factors influence the machining process to achieve low cutting low cutting thrust and torque. From the analysis of the Taguchi method indicates that among the all-significant parameters, speed and <b>drill</b> <b>size</b> are more significant influence on cutting thrust than the specimen thickness and the feed rate.
