At follow-up at five years, no statistically significant differences were found in the clinical outcome measurements for either design. The prevalence of radiolucent lines and the survivorship were the same. In a subgroup of 15 knees, additional <b>image-intensifier</b> analysis in the horizontal and sagittal planes was performed during step-up and lunge activity. Our analysis revealed striking differences. Lunge activity showed a mean posterior displacement of both medial and lateral tibiofemoral contact areas (roll-back) which was greater and more consistent in the cruciate-substituting than in the cruciate-retaining group (medial p < 0. 0001, lateral p = 0. 011). The amount of posterior displacement could predict the maximum flexion which could be achieved (p = 0. 018). Forward displacement of the tibiofemoral contact area in flexion during stair activity was seen more in the cruciate-retaining than in the cruciate-substituting group. This was attributed mainly to insufficiency of the posterior cruciate ligament and partially to that of the anterior cruciate ligament.

A high-intensity neutron beam of broad spectral distribution with an average energy of 5. 5 MeV, was produced by 11. 5 MeV deuterons impinging upon a thick beryllium target. The capability of FNCT for high contrast imaging of low-Z materials embedded in thick high-Z shielding materials is demonstrated, which is superior to more conventional high-energy X-ray imaging techniques.

Two observers assessed the quality of the models independently on a five-point scale using specified criteria. The results indicate that large-field selection reduced the visibility of the teeth and the interproximal space. Also, large voxel size reduced the visibility of the occlusal surfaces and bone in the anterior region in both maxilla and mandible. Segmentation threshold was more variable in the maxilla than in the mandible. Closed-mouth scan complicated separating the jaws and reduced teeth surfaces visibility. The preliminary results from this <b>image-intensifier</b> system indicate that the use of medium or small scan fields in an open-mouth position with a small voxel is recommended to optimize quality of the 3 D surface model reconstructions of the dental arches from CBCT.

A protocol for scanning and reconstruction has been designed and implemented for a conventional mobile C-arm: a 9 inch <b>image-intensifier</b> OEC- 9600. Due to the narrow field of view (FOV), the reconstructed image contains strong truncation artifacts. We propose to improve the reconstructed images by fusing the observed x-ray data with computed projections of a prior 3 D anatomical model, derived from a subject-specific CT or from a statistical database (atlas), and co-registered (3 D/ 2 D) to the x-rays. The prior model contains a description of geometry and radiodensity as a tetrahedral mesh shape and density polynomials, respectively. A CT-based model can be created by segmentation, meshing and polynomial fitting of the object’s CT study. The statistical atlas is created through principal component analysis (PCA) {{of a collection of}} mesh instances deformably-registered (3 D/ 3 D) to patient datasets. The 3 D/ 2 D registration method optimizes a pixel-based similarity score (mutual information) between the observed x-rays and the prior. The transformation involves translation, rotation and shape deformation based on the atlas. After registration, the image intensities of observed and prior projections are matched and adjusted, and the two information sources are blended as inputs to a reconstruction algorithm. We demonstrate recostruction results of three cadaveric specimens, and the effect of fusing prior data to compensate for truncation.

40|$|Neuroblastoma {{cells were}} used to study the surface {{distribution}} and organization of opiate (enkephalin) receptors and the possible relevance of changes in these variables to biological functions. Opiate receptors readily form clusters that are visible by <b>image-intensifier</b> fluorescent microscopy and are localized on both the cell body and processes. These clusters do not become internalized even during prolonged incubation periods. The receptors appear to pre-exist largely in a diffuse state, with {{only a very small}} number pre-existing as clusters. The clusters are induced within 1 hr and they are stable for prolonged (7 - 9 hr) periods, even after removal of the receptor-bound ligand. Agonists and antagonists are both equally capable of inducing receptor clustering. However, the clusters induced by agonists are different from those induced by antagonists; the former can be dispersed by treatment with dithiothreitol. This dispersion requires removal of the receptor-bound agonist, indicating that the hormone protects or stabilizes disulfide bonds which are critical for maintenance of the clustered state. Pretreatment of cells with sulfhydryl-blocking reagents (iodoacetate, iodoacetamide, and N-ethylmaleimide) prevents cluster formation but does not alter the ability of agonists to inhibit adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4. 6. 1. 1] activity. Neither the number nor the affinity of binding sites is altered by pretreatment with opiates. These studies suggest that at least the acute, immediate biological effects of opiates and enkephalins occur prior to and are independent of the formation of gross receptor clusters. The possible relationship of cluster formation to the actions of opiates remains to be determined...|$|E
