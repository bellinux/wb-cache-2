5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often <b>difficult.</b> <b>It</b> killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E

However producer Kirkland Tibbels still faced several bottlenecks, as financing the whole film remained <b>difficult.</b> <b>It</b> was distributed through TLA Releasing, an independent film distributor, who picked it up through its partnership with production company Funny Boy Films, which specializes in gay-themed media.|$|E

5|$|If truly a gondwanathere, TNM02067 {{extends the}} known {{geographic}} {{range of the}} group {{to another part of}} Gondwana, the African mainland. The uncertain age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment of the significance of TNM02067 <b>difficult.</b> <b>It</b> may well be older than the oldest previously known gondwanathere, the Campanian Gondwanatherium. It also has implications for the hypothesis that Africa was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early dateas early as the early Cretaceousand consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may be closely related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly derived group.|$|E
5|$|Presently, the {{porcupine}} ray {{is caught}} incidentally in trawls, tangle nets, and beach seines. Its skin {{continues to be}} highly valued, while the meat and cartilage may also be utilized. In the Farasan Islands and some {{other places in the}} Red Sea, its liver is eaten as a seasonal dish. However, the economic importance of this ray is limited by how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> is to handle. The multi-species coastal fisheries that catch the porcupine ray are largely unregulated, which seems to have resulted in its dramatic decline or local extinction in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Thailand, and likely elsewhere in its range. Potential additional threats to this species include habitat degradation from coastal development, and depletion of its food supply from overfishing. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

Kennedy subsequently sought Shoup's advice in evaluating {{the implications of the}} Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. While his position in the Joint Chiefs of Staff was intended to be limited, he had gained Kennedy's confidence and was often called on for private consultations. Shoup supported the test ban, seeing it as a deterrent to nuclear war.|$|E
5|$|Soule {{was born}} in Keokuk, Iowa to a public school music teacher father and a graphic {{designer}} mother. He became interested in music and symphony orchestras {{at the age of}} five. Soule began taking piano lessons at an early age and became entranced with music, even writing music notation in the margins of his math homework; after his teachers and his father realized his talent, he began taking private lessons with professors from Western Illinois University when he was in sixth grade. He claims to have earned the equivalent of a master's degree in composition before completing high school, though, as he never enrolled in the school, he did not earn a degree. He was split between trying to become a concert pianist and a composer when he grew up; he ended up deciding to become a composer once he realized how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> would be to do both.|$|E
5|$|A {{television}} {{broadcast of the}} concert, titled Madonna: The MDNA Tour, aired on Epix in the United States on June 22, 2013. The concert premiered at 8 p.m. EST on Epix's TV network and online at EpixHD.com and on Epix apps. On June 18, the concert special had a world premiere screening at The Paris Theater, in New York City, with Madonna attending the event {{in a press conference}} with the media, celebrities, and fans. A contest was released just for US residents, who had the chance to win two invitations for the special event. The singer wore a black tuxedo and a top hat to the premiere, the ensemble being a tribute to actress Marlene Dietrich and her similar attire in the 1930 film, Morocco. During the Q, Madonna recalled how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> was to sometimes perform on the tour, but she and her troupe nevertheless did it. At the end of the session, she showed a trailer from her secretprojectrevolution film with photographer Steven Klein; the one-minute clip featured her background dancers and showed the singer being dragged on the floor. Other shots included Madonna wielding a gun, her dancers in underwear, and religious iconography.|$|E

5|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts in the Annales Piacentines the College of Cardinals {{was divided into}} adherents of Charles d'Anjou (pars Caroli) and the Imperial party (pars Imperii), but the exact reconstruction of these parties is very <b>difficult.</b> <b>It</b> is almost certain that this account is inaccurate when it claims that pars Caroli had six (or seven, in another place in that account) members, including Giovanni Gaetano Orsini and Ottobono Fieschi, while pars Imperii had eleven (or ten) members, Riccardo Annibaldi, Ottaviano Ubaldini and Uberto Coconati among them. Certainly five cardinals, namely Ottobono Fieschi, Guillame de Bray, Anchero Pantaleone, Simon Monpitie de Brie and Odo of Ch√¢teauroux belonged to the Angevin faction. But if Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was really one of their leaders, then his relatives Matteo Orsini Rosso and Giacomo Savelli should also be added here, and since Henry of Segusio {{is also likely to}} have belonged to this faction, its true size would have amounted to nine cardinals. Imperial party, on the contrary, could not have had more than ten members, including two who had died during sede vacante.|$|E
5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often <b>difficult.</b> <b>It</b> is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E
5|$|As an {{insufficient}} number of transport aircraft were {{allocated to the}} brigade, it was only possible to transport 3rd Parachute Battalion by air, with the battalion's strength consisting of its headquarters staff and 'B' and 'C' companies. The battalion landed at Gibraltar at dawn on 10 November, and its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Pine Coffin, was informed that the battalion was scheduled to conduct an airborne operation the next day. Pine Coffin was briefed by Lt. Gen. Kenneth Anderson, commander of the British First Army, on the mission; it was to take off from the airfield at Maison Blanche and conduct a parachute drop to capture an airfield near the port of B√¥ne, which bordered both Tunisia and Algeria. It was known by Allied intelligence that a battalion of German Fallschirmjaeger were currently stationed at Tunis, {{and that they were}} likely to be given the same task; as such, it was vital that the two companies capture the airfield first. Once this had been achieved, it would then hold the airfield until relieved by No. 6 Commando, which would conduct an amphibious landing, capture B√¥ne itself and link up with the battalion. This was a challenging task for Pine Coffin, as the battalion had arrived in fewer Dakotas than it would need to conduct a parachute drop, and two aircraft had failed to arrive at Gibraltar; however, sufficient aircraft were found and at 04:30 on 11 November they took off from Gibraltar, landing at Maison Blanche at 09:00. However, since the American pilots flying the Dakotas had no experience with night drops, and locating drop zones in darkness was extremely <b>difficult,</b> <b>it</b> was decided to delay the mission until dawn on 12 November.|$|E
