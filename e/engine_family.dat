25|$|The first {{generation}} was a project begun by General Motors as the M-car. When {{they realized that}} the project {{was not going to}} be profitable enough, the entire unfinished design was sold to Suzuki in return for a five per cent stake in the company. Suzuki completed the design and development work and put the car on sale from October 1983 in the Japanese market, as the Cultus. This is also why the car's design was such a natural fit in the General Motors lineup, with a clear GM corporate look. The model was also exported worldwide by Suzuki and assembled by a number of General Motors franchises, often undergoing badge engineering. The first-generation Swifts all share the SA model code prefix and was Suzuki's first earnest entry into a class of car with larger dimensions and engines than of the kei class Suzuki Fronte. Three- and four-cylinder versions of the G <b>engine</b> <b>family</b> were available, although some secondary markets installed Suzuki's one-liter four-cylinder F10A engine in a model which carries the SA410 chassis code.|$|E
25|$|It {{was decided}} to design a new diesel <b>engine</b> <b>family</b> that could be {{produced}} in various capacities and states of tune suitable for all of Rover's needs. The development was codenamed Project Storm and design responsibility was given to Land Rover who were to build the engines. The result was a range of engines using the L-Series as a base—the bore/stroke dimensions were the same and the Storm engine used the same piston and connecting rod assemblies. The Storm utilised Electronic Unit Injection by Lucas (at the time this technology was rare on small-capacity engine, being used only on large commercial vehicles) and a cross-flow aluminium alloy cylinder head on a cast-iron block. The designers had aimed at increasing servicing intervals so the engine incorporated both conventional and centrifugal oil filters. The electronic systems included an 'anti-stall' system to allow heavy loads to be started from rest at idle speed and two programmed operating modes for road and off-road use. The overhead camshaft (operating both valves and the unit injectors) was chain-driven. The Storm design encompassed 4-, 5- and 6-cylinder engines (of 2, 2.5 and 3 litres respectively).|$|E
500|$|The {{acquisition}} by Pigozzi {{took place}} in July 1954, just when Ford was poised to launch its new, modern Vedette, with a four-door saloon body of [...] "American" [...] style, much like the contemporary British Fords or Vauxhalls. The car was powered by an unusually small 2351cc sidevalve V8 engine called Aquillon in France, derived from Ford's Flathead <b>engine</b> <b>family,</b> whose displacement positioned the car into the [...] "13CV" [...] French tax class. Equipped with a two-barrel Zenith-Stromberg 32NX carburetor, it produced [...] Power {{was transferred to the}} rear live axle through a three-speed manual transmission with column shift. The Vedette had independent front suspension (by MacPherson struts) and drum brakes on all four wheels.|$|E
5000|$|The M156 {{displaces}} [...] {{and shares}} very little with other Mercedes-Benz <b>engine</b> <b>families</b> like the M155. The bore spacing, block design, {{and other features}} are unique to the AMG engine.|$|R
50|$|In January 2000 Ole Johansson, the President of Wärtsilä NSD {{said that}} both {{companies}} {{will continue the}} production and development of their own <b>engine</b> <b>families,</b> providing both parties better synergy benefits and improving profitability from the prevailing deficient level.|$|R
5000|$|The second (letter) {{formerly}} {{referred to}} the fuel type; [...] "D" [...] = diesel, [...] "G" [...] = gasoline. However, since the 1980s, this has changed. Two <b>engine</b> <b>families</b> were introduced using the letter [...] "A" [...] to denote that all the <b>engines</b> in the <b>family</b> had an alloy cylinder head. Their latest engines, however, do not follow any previous conventions (e.g. 4M4, 3B2, etc.).|$|R
2500|$|Beginning in April 1968, Ford began factory {{installing}} {{a version of}} the 428 engine known as the [...] "Cobra Jet". The G.T. 500 was subsequently known as The Cobra G.T. 500 KR. The initials KR stood for [...] "King of the Road." [...] Ford rated the Cobra jet at , but with 440 foot-pounds of torque at 3400 RPM, the horsepower was considered significantly underreported. Shelby's KR engine was left stock [...] adding die-cast aluminum valve covers with [...] "Cobra Lemans" [...] to note Ford's FE <b>engine</b> <b>family</b> victory over Ferrari at Le Mans in 1966 and 1967.|$|E
2500|$|The mid-sixties {{automobile}} {{market in}} the U.S. was marked an increasing influence of younger buyers who wanted a sporty image. Most of the [...] "sportiness" [...] of these was due to effective marketing. No longer satisfied with [...] "standard" [...] cars the market moved into new segments that included pony cars, muscle cars, and personal luxury cars. Many were heavily restyled derivatives of volume models and shared common parts. Moreover, they were image builders and big profit generators for their automakers. The objective of the Marlin was to move AMC in this direction. However, the AMC [...] "had an established image as {{an expert in the}} small-car field", and thus faced problems in marketing the Marlin as a sporty big car. Moreover, [...] "the Marlin actually represented a double leap" [...] for AMC: into performance, as well as personalization. The model had a good start, but sales quickly bottomed out in the 1967 model year. The automaker's anti-racing philosophy turned around after $40 million (US$ in dollars) was spent to develop a new V8 <b>engine</b> <b>family</b> and AMC turned to [...] "competitive events as a means of knocking down its avidly gathered reputation for economy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{new model}} was first {{announced}} for the Chinese market on the 2014 Beijing Auto Show {{and went on}} sale in August 2014. The four-door sedan has a fastback-like sloping roofline and a low drag coefficient of 0.28 comes {{with a choice of}} a [...] turbocharged direct injection engine with a power of [...] @ 5600 RPM and torque of [...] @1600–4000 RPM, which can be mated with a six-speed manual transmission or seven-speed Start/Stop enabled dual-clutch gearbox, or a [...] direct injection engine with a power of [...] @ 5600 RPM and torque of [...] @ 6000 RPM mated to a six-speed Start/Stop-capable automatic transmission. Both engines come from the new GM Small Gasoline <b>Engine</b> <b>family.</b> Weight reduction of 10% is achieved by using very high-strength steels and aluminum alloys. Watt's link torsion beam rear suspension, first used on the Opel Astra (J), comes as standard. The car comes equipped with a 4.2" [...] color screen radio or MyLink 2.0 infotainment system with a 8" [...] screen, and can be configured with OnStar Gen10 offering 4G LTE Internet connection with a built-in Wi-Fi hotspot.|$|E
50|$|Nikasil {{was very}} popular in the 1990s.

50|$|It {{would be}} succeeded by the Honda B engine. Although sharing similar {{nomenclature}} and some design elements, the earlier B20A substantially {{differs from the}} later B-series in architecture enough to be considered two different <b>engine</b> <b>families</b> and must {{not be confused with}} other B-series engines and the B20B, a 2.0 liter DOHC engine introduced alongside the Honda CR-V in 1994.|$|R
2500|$|The {{base engine}} was the [...] inline-six in all models except the Gran Torino Squire station wagon and the Gran Torino Sport which both had a 302-2V small-block V8 as standard. Available engines {{included}} the 302-2V, a 351-2V [...] "Windsor" [...] or [...] "Cleveland", a 351C-4V [...] "Cobra Jet" [...] (CJ), a 400-2V, and a 429-4V. The 400-2V {{was a new}} engine to the Torino line-up, and {{was part of the}} 335 series <b>engine</b> <b>family</b> like the 351 Cleveland. The 429-4V was not a high-performance engine like the Cobra Jets of previous years; instead, it was a high torque, low revving engine. Emissions, low lead and fuel economy requirements had become more strict for 1972. To meet these requirements, compression ratios on all Torino engines were dropped to at least 8.5:1, and all engines ran on regular gasoline. These engines generally produced less power than their predecessors in 1971, although this was exaggerated due to the switch to the new SAE net bhp ratings from the SAE gross figures used in 1971. As a result, the figures are not directly comparable. [...] All models came equipped with a three-speed manual transmission as a standard equipment. The Cruise-O-Matic remained optional, but was a mandatory option for the 351-2V, 400-2V and 429-4V. The 351-4V CJ required either the 4-speed or the Cruise-O-Matic as mandatory options.|$|E
