5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> to be {{used with}} the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power {{amplifiers}} with limiters, a power amplifier capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E
5|$|El 18 is a {{modification}} of the Swiss Re 460. The class was originally built in 119 units from 1992 to 1995 for the Swiss State Railways, where it was given the brand Lok 2000.

Bern–Lötschberg–Simplon-Bahn received eight units in 1994 (as Re 465), the Finnish State Railways received 46 units between the years 1995-2003 (as Sr2) and the Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation received 2 units in 1997. The units are designed to haul heavy passenger trains along existing curved railways at high speeds. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> as a universal locomotive, so it is also suitable for freight trains.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{ordered the}} Burmese Ruby Tiara in 1973, {{and it was}} made by Garrard & Co. using stones from her private collection. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> {{in the form of}} a wreath of roses, with silver and {{diamonds}} making the petals, and clusters of gold and rubies forming the centre of the flowers. A total of 96 rubies are mounted on the tiara; they were originally part of a necklace given to her in 1947 as a wedding present by the people of Burma (now Myanmar), who credited them with having the ability to protect their owner from sickness and evil. The diamonds were also given to her as a wedding present, by the Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar, who possessed a vast jewellery collection of his own.|$|E

5|$|Manta is {{a flying}} roller coaster, which simulates the {{sensation}} of flight. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> to resemble the way rays—mantas in particular—appear to fly through seawater. Guests are initially seated upright on the trains in one of eight rows that hold four passengers each, accommodating up to 32 riders. Manta operates with three trains. Before departure, mechanisms in the station raise the cars up to the track, such that the riders' spines are parallel to the track. Guests are secured in their seats using a locking lap bar, a vest-like harness, and flaps at the riders' ankles to hold their feet in place.|$|E
5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> to allow players {{to walk around}} and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and {{interior}} details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E
5|$|On Jan. 11, 2016, the Klein ISD Board of Trustees {{approved}} the Design Development for Intermediate School #10. Huckabee Architects has designed the 205,000 sf. campus in three separate learning areas: 6th Grade, 7th & 8th Grade STEM, and 7th & 8th Grade Humanities. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> {{to accommodate a}} site on West Rayford Rd next to Metzler Elementary with a 20ft. elevation change that runs front to back, as well as 2 acres of protected wetlands. Per the current instructional program for intermediate schools, the campus includes a Black Box theater classroom that is being designed to combine as a stage, collaboration areas within the communities for project-based learning and small group instruction, and Makerspace in the library or learning commons.

5|$|The Electra {{communications}} package is a UHF software-defined radio (SDR) {{that provides a}} flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. In addition to protocol controlled inter-spacecraft data links of 1kbit/s to 2Mbit/s, Electra also provides Doppler data collection, open loop recording and a highly accurate timing service based on a 5e13USO. Doppler information for approaching vehicles {{can be used for}} final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation. Doppler information on landed vehicles will also enable scientists to accurately determine the surface location of Mars landers and rovers. The two MER spacecraft currently on Mars utilize an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. The Electra radio has proven its functionality by relaying information to and from the MER spacecraft, Phoenix Mars lander and Curiosity rover.|$|E
5|$|The V7 {{client is}} {{the seventh and}} latest {{generation}} of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. It was released on March22, 2012. Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients. V7 uses Trac for managing its bug tickets so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.|$|E
