5000|$|Returning from a night out, Martha (Raquel Cassidy) hears {{footsteps}} {{behind her}} and becomes convinced she's being followed as she walks down a dark path on her way home. She ponders various strategies such as pretending to <b>do</b> <b>up</b> her <b>shoes</b> in order to let her follower overtake her or simply running away, but dismisses each idea as endangering her even more. Eventually she screws up her courage {{to turn around and}} confront the man behind her, but when she does so she sees nothing except a mobile phone glowing on the ground as it calls somebody. James (Lloyd Woolf), her follower, has actually been going {{out of his way to}} avoid the impression he is following her or is a threat, but every time he does so it somehow backfires. He tries speeding up to overtake her, but this only makes Martha walk faster. He ponders taking a different route, but there are no turnings off the path they are walking down. Eventually he decides to make a [...] "loud non-threatening phone call" [...] to his mum, reasoning that: [...] "I bet rapists never call their mums." [...] However as he is distracted with finding her number in his phone, he fails to notice a manhole in the ground and falls head over heels into it, his phone flying to the ground near Martha's feet.|$|R
