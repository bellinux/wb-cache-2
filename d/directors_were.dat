5|$|The South Dakotas {{were able}} to reap the {{benefits}} of developments in radar technology during World War 2. By the end of the war, the ships were equipped with air and surface-search radars and radar fire-control. When commissioned, the ships were equipped with the SC air-search radar. This radar would eventually get replaced by the SK and SK-2 air-search radar. The main battery <b>directors</b> <b>were</b> fitted with Mark 3 fire-control radar, which were replaced by the Mark 8 starting in 1942. This radar gave these ships a significant advantage over the Japanese, which for the most part relied on optical systems.|$|E
5|$|The city of Poznań {{was one of}} {{the largest}} urban and {{industrial}} centers of the People's Republic of Poland. Tensions were growing there, particularly since autumn of 1955. Workers in the largest factory in the city, Joseph Stalin's (or 'Cegielski's) Metal Industries, were complaining about higher taxes for most productive workers (udarnik), which affected several thousands of workers. Local <b>directors</b> <b>were</b> unable to make any significant decisions due to micromanagement by the higher officials; over several months, petitions, letters and delegations were sent to the Polish Ministry of Machine Industry and Central Committee of Polish United Workers' Party, to no avail.|$|E

Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot's sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal.

5|$|Although {{the prior}} {{introduction}} of the Princess Royal class had provided the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with more powerful locomotives to be used on the main line between London Euston and Glasgow Central, the board of <b>directors</b> <b>were</b> persuaded in 1936 that more such locomotives would be needed, particularly as they were being asked to approve {{the introduction of a}} new non-stop service between those cities, designated the Coronation Scot. Initially, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, William Stanier, planned to build five more Princess Royals, but the Chief Technical Assistant and Chief Draughtsman at the LMS Derby Works, Tom Coleman, argued that it would be preferable to design a new class of locomotive that was more powerful, more reliable and easier to maintain. Stanier was convinced and the drawing office commenced designing the new class. When Stanier was called on to perform an assignment in India, Coleman became responsible for most of the detailed design in his absence.|$|E
5|$|As {{business}} {{improved in}} 1904 the enterprise moved to larger premises in Pendleton, where an annual rent of £90 was payable.

To accomplish {{the transfer of}} manufacturing operations, Charles Churchill & Co sold the Pendleton business to the new company for £15,000, of which £7,500 was in cash and a similar amount in £1 ordinary shares. The <b>directors</b> <b>were</b> Charles Churchill, J W W Gabriel, Walter Chamberlain and C H Churchill. Herbert Chamberlain had died in 1904.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 and 1869, judgements {{went against}} the Met {{in a number of}} hearings, finding {{financial}} irregularities such as the company paying a dividend it could not afford and expenses being paid out of the capital account. In 1870, its <b>directors</b> <b>were</b> found guilty of a breach of trust and ordered to compensate the company. Although they all appealed and were allowed in 1874 to settle for a much lower amount, to restore shareholders' confidence the directors had all been replaced by October 1872 and Edward Watkin appointed chairman. Watkin was an experienced railwayman and already on the board of several railway companies, including the South Eastern Railway (SER), and had an aspiration to construct a line from the north through London to that railway.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, Selbie, then General Manager, {{thought that}} some professionalism was needed and {{suggested}} a company be formed {{to take over}} from the Surplus Lands Committee to develop estates near the railway. World War I delayed these plans and it was 1919, with expectation of a housing boom, before Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited (MRCE) was formed. Concerned that Parliament might reconsider the unique position the Met held, the railway company sought legal advice, which was that although the Met had authority to hold land, it had none to develop it. An independent company was created, although {{all but one of}} its <b>directors</b> <b>were</b> also directors of the Met. MRCE developed estates at Kingsbury Garden Village near Neasden, Wembley Park, Cecil Park and Grange Estate at Pinner, and the Cedars Estate at Rickmansworth, and created places such as Harrow Garden Village.|$|E
5|$|In {{the film}} industry, more than 300 actors, authors and <b>directors</b> <b>were</b> denied {{work in the}} U.S. through the {{unofficial}} Hollywood blacklist. Blacklists were at work throughout the entertainment industry, in universities and schools at all levels, in the legal profession, and in many other fields. A port security program initiated by the Coast Guard shortly {{after the start of}} the Korean War required a review of every maritime worker who loaded or worked aboard any American ship, regardless of cargo or destination. As with other loyalty-security reviews of McCarthyism, the identities of any accusers and even the nature of any accusations were typically kept secret from the accused. Nearly 3,000 seamen and longshoremen lost their jobs due to this program alone.|$|E
5|$|On {{her last}} {{training}} cruise in 1936, Karlsruhe was badly damaged by {{a tropical storm}} in the Pacific Ocean. Structural weaknesses in her mostly-welded hull plating caused significant damage, and the cruiser was forced to put into San Diego in April for repairs. There, her hull was repaired and strengthened, which increased her displacement and beam slightly. She returned to Germany in June 1936, and immediately went into drydock for more permanent repairs and a major overhaul. During this period in dockyard hands, she had her two single-mount 8.8cm anti-aircraft guns replaced with three twin-mounts. Fire control <b>directors</b> <b>were</b> also installed for these guns. After emerging from this refit, she conducted sea trials and then joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War, though she only remained off Spain for a few months.|$|E
