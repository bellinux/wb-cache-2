500|$|In {{the field}} of philanthropy, Parker donates a block of 20 tickets for each home game to {{underprivileged}} youth. Parker is also the first ambassador for Make-A-Wish France. The Foundation is a non-profit organization that grants wishes to children with life-threatening medical conditions. On his personal website, Parker states: [...] "I already knew Make-A-Wish as it is very famous {{around the world and}} I have previously taken part in the granting of wishes by meeting children and their families. I decided to commit to working with Make-A-Wish France when I understood the true dedication there and I realized that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> to grant as many wishes as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|In the borderlands {{south of}} Tombstone {{there was only}} one {{passable}} route between Arizona and Mexico, a passage known as Guadalupe Canyon. In August 1881, 15 Mexicans carrying gold, coins and bullion to make their purchases were ambushed and killed in Skeleton Canyon. The next month Mexican Commandant Felipe Neri dispatched troops to the border, where they killed five Cowboys, including Old Man Clanton, in Guadalupe Canyon. The Earps knew that the McLaurys and Clantons were reputed to be mixed up in the robbery and murder in Skeleton Canyon. Wyatt Earp said in his testimony after the shootout, [...] "I naturally kept my eyes open and did not intend that any of the gang should get the drop on me if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Jones {{was with}} the Eskimos, he {{acquired}} the nickname 'Batman' after an incident in which he chased down and apprehended a mugger who had stolen a woman's purse. [...] Jones said of the incident, [...] "God just {{put me in a}} good place where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> someone. He knows what kind of heart I have." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{reminded}} them that I haven't played a meaningful soccer game in {{almost two years}} and I certainly couldn't fill the holes left by those players. Over the ensuing days, I {{began to think about}} their inquiries and it struck me that perhaps this is something I should consider. I care so deeply about the Galaxy organization, and I believe <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> in a small way to aid the team in its quest for a sixth MLS championship." ...|$|E
2500|$|The title 10,000 Days {{refers to}} roughly the orbital {{period of the}} planet Saturn (actual time period is 10,759 days), which adds up to nearly 29 years and marks, {{according}} to Keenan, [...] "the time when you are presented the opportunity to transform from whatever your hang-ups were before to let the light of knowledge and experience lighten your load, so to speak, and let go of old patterns and embrace a new life." [...] Keenan expected that the songs composed would [...] "chronicle that process, hoping that my gift back would be to share that path and hope that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> somebody get past that spot." [...] It is rumoured that the album is a reference to Maynard James Keenan's mother who was paralyzed for 10,000 days (27 years) before she died.|$|E

2500|$|He {{afterwards}} recalled {{not being}} able to get a job with an NHL organization for over a decade and a half. [...] "I called the Canadiens {{at least two or three}} times [...] because I thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> the organization in some way, not necessarily as a coach but in some role that could be developed," [...] Bossy told Sports Illustrated in 2005. [...] They never called back." [...] When former linemate Bryan Trottier was hired as New York Rangers coach in 2002, Bossy was certain Trottier would hire him on in some capacity. [...] "The reason was," [...] Bossy said, [...] "I remember having umpteen conversations with Bryan, having roomed with him for 10 years, that went, 'One of these days, Mike, we're going to take a team and do it our way.' I've found out since from Bryan [...] that he wasn't going to be given that chance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Axelrod {{contemplated}} {{taking a}} break from politics during the 2008 presidential campaign, as five of the candidates—Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Chris Dodd and Tom Vilsack—were past clients. Personal ties between Axelrod and Hillary Clinton made it difficult, as she had raised significant funds for epilepsy on behalf of a foundation co-founded by Axelrod's wife and mother, Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (CURE). (Axelrod's daughter suffers from developmental disabilities associated with chronic epileptic seizures.) Axelrod's wife even said that a 1999 conference Clinton convened to find a cure for the condition was [...] "one {{of the most important things}} anyone has done for epilepsy." [...] Axelrod ultimately decided to participate in the Obama campaign, and served as chief strategist and media advisor for Obama. He told The Washington Post, [...] "I thought that if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> Barack Obama get to Washington, then I would have accomplished something great in my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|She remembered {{having a}} {{photographic}} memory as a child, {{making it easy}} to memorize songs, as well as get her through school tests. She got her first taste of singing solo at a fire hall, where she soaked up the crowd's appreciation. [...] "Sometimes I think that I cheated my own family and my closest friends by giving to audiences so much of the love I might have kept for them. But that's the way I was made; I truly don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> it." [...] (p.20) Martin's craft was developed by seeing movies and becoming a mimic. She would win prizes for looking, acting and dancing like Ruby Keeler and singing exactly like Bing Crosby. [...] "Never, never, never can I say I had a frustrating childhood. It was all joy. Mother used to say she never had seen such a happy child—that I awakened each morning with a smile. I don't remember that, but I do remember that I never wanted to go to bed, to go to sleep, for fear I'd miss something." [...] (p.20) ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You do {{not want}} self-satisfaction... Yet I could wish that you saw things differently, Andre.
