50|$|Dryopteris intermedia, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> fern, is an {{evergreen}} eastern North American species also occasionally {{found in}} Europe. It is a diploid species, {{and is the}} parent of several species of hybrid origin, including Dryopteris carthusiana.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{tetraploid}} {{of hybrid}} origin, one parent being Dryopteris intermedia, known in North America as the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> fern, and an unknown, apparently extinct species dubbed Dryopteris semicristata, {{which is also}} the presumed parent of the hybrid-origin Dryopteris cristata.This fern is often confused with several other wood fern species, including D. intermedia, D. campyloptera, and D. expansa. It especially extensively shares the range of D. intermedia, but the two may be distinguished by the innermost pinnule on the bottom side of the bottom pinna: this pinnule is longer than the adjacent pinnules in D. carthusiana, but shorter or even in D. intermedia. D. carthusiana is a sub-evergreen species, its fronds surviving mild winters but dying back in harsh winters.|$|E

30|$|The {{present study}} {{revealed}} that vacuoles play important roles in protein storage in sapwood and the completion of autolysis in the inner part of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood.</b> In addition, we detected obvious changes in the contents of vacuoles in ray parenchyma cells in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood.</b> The number of PSVs tended to decrease {{and the number of}} non-PSVs tended to increase towards the inner part of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> (Figs.  5 c–f, 6 c–e). It was reported that PSVs are converted into large central lytic vacuoles (LVs) by degradation of storage proteins and accumulated hydrolytic enzymes in the vacuoles of aleurone cells during endosperm maturation in cereal grains [29]. It is possible that these large central LVs are involved in the final quick degradation of the cytoplasmic contents due to the vacuole rupture and release of hydrolytic enzymes into the cytoplasm [13, 29]. Similar changes in vacuoles might occur in ray parenchyma cells from the outer part to the inner part of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood.</b> Therefore, the initial change in vacuoles might be a dramatic decrease in storage proteins in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> during the death of ray parenchyma cells.|$|E

30|$|Changes in the {{morphology}} {{and functions}} of vacuoles provide useful information about the mechanism of cell death. In the present study, we monitored the morphology and contents of vacuoles during the death of ray parenchyma cells in the conifer Cryptomeria japonica. In differentiating xylem, ray parenchyma cells had large central vacuoles. In sapwood, vacuoles in ray parenchyma cells contained proteins, an indication {{that one of the}} main functions of these vacuoles might be protein storage. A dramatic decrease in the protein content of some vacuoles was detected in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> before the initiation of vacuole rupture. Although vacuole rupture was detected from the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> to the outermost heartwood, some vacuoles were obviously enlarged in the inner <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood.</b> Condensed nuclei were first observed after the rupture of these large vacuoles in ray parenchyma cells. It seems plausible that the autolysis of the contents of ray parenchyma cells might be caused by the rupture of the enlarged vacuoles in the inner <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood.</b>|$|E
30|$|In the {{previous}} year’s xylem, ray parenchyma cells contained both PSVs and non-PSVs (Fig.  4). By contrast, {{in the sixth}} and ninth annual rings from the cambium, namely, in the middle part of the sapwood and the outer part of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood,</b> all the vacuoles in ray parenchyma cells were PSVs (Figs.  5 b, 6 b). These observations suggest that the main function of vacuoles in ray parenchyma cells might be storage of proteins from the outer part of the sapwood to the outer part of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood.</b> It was reported that PSVs contain hydrolytic enzymes and function in autophagy, even when proteins are accumulated [29, 31]. Therefore, PSVs in ray parenchyma cells from the outer part of the sapwood to the outer part of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> might also function in autophagy for maintenance of cellular homeostasis.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to clarify anatomical factors which determine specific permeability of sapwood and <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> in air-dried sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) wood. Superficial air permeability of sugi sapwood and <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> was measured and then specific permeability was determined. Using these specimens for permeability tests, the proportion of latewood and earlywood, the percentage of aspirated and incompletely aspirated pits, the number of bordered pits per tracheid, the number of tracheids per unit area and tracheid length were obtained. Specific permeability decreased with increasing levels in the stem except for the lowest level and also related to distance from pith, suggesting that cambial age is related to specific permeability. A clear relationship between percentage of latewood and specific permeability was not found, suggesting that effective pathways in earlywood determines permeability. Specific permeability of <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> and sapwood were significantly related to the number of effective open pits in earlywood, Nef, which was determined by anatomical properties such as aspirated and incompletely aspirated pits, the number of pits and tracheids, and proportion of latewood, suggesting that specific permeability of sugi sapwood and <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> is a physical value determined by the intrinsic properties of earlywood in addition to the condition of bordered pits. スギ辺材と移行材の比透過率を決定する木材組織構造因子を明らかにする目的で，地上高別に移行材，辺材内側と外側の比透過率を算出した。そのあと，その試験片の組織構造を計測し，比透過率との関係を見た．比透過率は樹幹上部に向かって減少，髄からの距離が大きくなるに伴って上昇する候向を示した。このことは比透過率への形成層齢の関与を示唆した．晩材割合と比透過率との問に有意な相関関係が認められなかったことから，比透過率には早材が大きな役割を担うことが明らかになった．比透過率を決定する組織構造因子として，軍材の有縁壁孔閉塞率，不完全閉塞率，仮道管当たりの有縁壁孔数，単位面積当たりの仮道管数および晩材割合を考慮して算出した有効開放壁孔数Nefが提案された．すなわち，有効開放壁孔数と比透過率との間に直線関係が認められ，スギ辺材と移行材の比透過率が，有縁壁孔の状態に加えて他の早材組織構造によって決定されることを明らかにした...|$|E

During the programmed cell death of tracheary elements in the Zinnia system in vitro, the vacuole rupture is followed by the rapid degradation of nuclei and other organelles [14 – 16]. By contrast, ray parenchyma cells might retain their organelles for some time after the initiation of vacuole rupture (Figs.  5 c–f, 6 c–e).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In recent years, the {{performance}} of copper naphthenate as a wood preservative has been in question. To understand the varying results of copper naphthenate in preventing wood decay, {{a closer look at}} eight naphthenic acid (NA) supplies was undertaken. Initial studies of NA samples from individual suppliers revealed large differences in chemical composition and wood preservation ability. Samples were rated from best to worst determined by percent weight loss due to fungal activity. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that one of the <b>intermediate</b> quality <b>wood</b> preservatives from our wood decay studies contains a large portion of phenolic and aliphatic impurities in addition to the naphthenic acid components. To determine the effect of the impurities on the efficacy studies, we developed a method using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) to remove them from the sample without changing the characteristics of the naphthenic acid composition.

30|$|Nobuchi and Harada [19] {{reported}} finding large vacuoles in {{the inner}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> (white zone) of C. japonica by transmission electron microscopy. They suggested that these large vacuoles might be involved in autophagy [19]. In the present study, we identified the timing of rupture of these large vacuoles. In the inner part of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood,</b> some non-PSVs had clearly enlarged and others were ruptured (Figs.  5 d, e, 6 d). In the same region, all the ray parenchyma cells contained elliptical nuclei (Figs.  5 d, 6 d).

In the inner region of the outermost heartwood, only osmiophilic aggregates and some lipid-like oily droplets were observed (Figs.  5 g, 6 f). These observations suggest that dramatic changes associated with autolysis might start after the rupture of enlarged vacuoles. In tracheary elements, the autolysis of cellular contents follows rupture of a central vacuole [14 – 16].

40|$|When {{softwoods}} are {{dried and}} subsequently impregnated with waterborne preservatives two problems frequently occur—preservative screening of multi-salt preservatives and difficult re-drying. To study the causes, the permeability of Dacrydium cupressinum Lamb, (rimu) and Pinus radiata D. Don wood was measured along the three principal directions. These two softwood species are anatomically very similar, but differ in that rimu has no resin canals. The radial and tangential permeabilities {{of the green}} sapwood of the two species were similar and {{of the order of}} 10 - 16 m 2. The transverse permeability of the green rimu <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> was lower and of the order of 10 " 17 m 2. After drying andresaturation the radial and tangential permeability of the rimu <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> were practically unchanged, while the transverse permeability of the sapwood dropped to that of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood.</b> For P. radiata sapwood the tangential permeability decreased to IO- 18 m 2. In contrast, after drying and resaturation the radial permeability of P. radiata sapwood was of the order of 10 ~ 14 m 2, two orders of magnitude greater than for the green wood. This increase in radial permeability was caused by an interplay of flow along the radial and axial resin canals. It is believed that the absence of preservative screening in P. radiata sapwood during impregnation is due to rapid dispersal of preservative solution along the resin canals, followed by movement into the tracheids where the preservative fixes to the cell walls. This mechanism cannot operate in rimu wood as it does not have resin canals, and so preservative screening occurs...|$|E
30|$|Water {{distribution}} in green stems ofCryptomeria japonica D. Don was observed by soft X-ray photography. In the sapwood, much water was present and evenly distributed. In the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> (the white zone), little water was present. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>wood</b> appeared in all cross {{sections of the}} stem and separated the heartwood from the sapwood in the intertracheid water connection. Maldistribution of water was generally observed in the heartwood, and three types of water presence were distinguishable: a “wet area” with accumulated water, a “dry area” with little water, and a “moderate moisture area” with intermediate accumulation. The distribution pattern and amount {{of water in the}} heartwood varied dramatically among and even within trees. Separation of the heartwood from the sapwood in the intertracheid water connection suggested that the presence of water in the heartwood was caused by rewetting of the tracheid lamina that occurred after heartwood formation. The maldistribution of water in the heartwood suggested that a difference in the process of rewetting causes both uneven distribution and the various types of water presence.|$|E

However, their influences on delignification was greater than on pulping reactions. The <b>intermediate</b> density <b>wood</b> sample which had the lowest amount of lignin and the highest amount of sapwood underwent the most delignification and showed the highest yields.

These results agreed with the relationships of Kappa numbers to cooking times for each wood sample. A non-linear relationship between fluorescent intensities of waste liquors to cooking times were found at 185 °C which may be due to lignin condensation reactions.
