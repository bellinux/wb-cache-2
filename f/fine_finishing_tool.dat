50|$|Despite the {{difficulty}} presented for the prospective carver, wood from Pemphis species is highly prized for its extreme heaviness, toughness {{and resistance to}} warping.

50|$|In boring, a tool with {{a single}} bent pointed tip is {{advanced}} into a roughly made hole in a spinning workpiece to slightly enlarge the hole and improve its accuracy. It is a <b>fine</b> <b>finishing</b> operation used {{in the final stages}} of product manufacture.|$|R
50|$|Subsequent to grinding, {{the blade}} is {{polished}} to {{various degrees of}} gloss. The <b>finest</b> <b>finish,</b> used in the most expensive razors, is the mirror finish. Mirror finish is the only finish used if gold leafing is {{to be part of}} the decoration of the blade.|$|R
50|$|Use of lubricant/coolant/metalworking fluid: Can carry away swarf (preventing loading), {{transport}} heat (which {{may affect}} the physical properties of the workpiece or the abrasive), decrease friction (with the substrate or matrix), suspend worn work material and abrasives allowing for a <b>finer</b> <b>finish,</b> conduct stress to the workpiece.|$|R

2500|$|Grinding uses an {{abrasive}} {{process to}} remove {{material from the}} workpiece. [...] A grinding machine is a machine tool used for producing very <b>fine</b> <b>finishes,</b> making very light cuts, or high precision forms using an abrasive wheel as the cutting device.

25|$|A {{drawknife}} {{is commonly}} used to remove large slices of wood for flat faceted work, to debark trees, or to create roughly rounded or cylindrical billets for further work on a lathe, or it can shave like a spokeshave plane, where <b>finer</b> <b>finishing</b> is less of concern than a rapid result. The thin blade lends itself to create complex concave or convex curves.|$|R

50|$|Emery is a {{naturally}} occurring rock of impure crystalline aluminum oxide or corundum. The emery is milled and sieved into different mesh sizes. Emery {{of a certain}} size range is then bonded to a paper backing to produce emery paper. The larger the mesh size, the smaller the abrasive particles. Smaller particles abrade smaller amounts of material and are used to produce a <b>finer</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a variety of}} surface and subsurface characterization techniques for workpieces prepared by <b>fine</b> <b>finishing</b> processes which are beginning to emerge as useful tools. Further a summary of examples from the recent literature {{on the nature of}} the near surface produced by various processes is provided. Despite the availability of new characterization techniques most of the examples from the literature use older, well-developed techniques...|$|R
