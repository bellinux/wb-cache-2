40|$|This paper {{tests for}} the {{existence}} of a lending channel in the transmission of monetary policy in Brazil using aggregate monthly data for the period 1995 : 12 through 2008 : 6. The test is carried out in a VECM setting that allows for multiple cointegrating relationships among the variable of interest. We find evidence of two cointegrating vectors, which we identify as loan demand and supply functions by testing for a number of exclusion and exogeneity restrictions on the cointegrating relationships. Loan supply is found to be negatively related to the interbank <b>deposit</b> <b>certificate</b> rate, suggesting the existence of a lending channel for monetary transmission. The VECM's short-term dynamics show that loan demand is equilibrium-correcting. But short-term disequilibria in the supply of loans are corrected through changes in the interbank <b>deposit</b> <b>certificate</b> rate, suggesting that monetary policy plays a role in restoring equilibrium in the credit market by affecting the borrowing rate faced by banks to raise non-deposit funds.

40|$|In {{recent years}} Pakistan {{has moved to}} liberalise its {{financial}} and capital markets. Consequently the reforms will place heavy demand on the instruments of monetary policy to regulate the working of financial markets. Interest rate policy {{as a component of}} monetary policy not only determines the allocation of resources between assets but also within each class of assets. Given the scant research on intra-asset response to intertemporal interest rate movements, the present paper fills the gap by studying the determinants of financial assets and quantifies intra-asset substitutability within a system-wide portfolio framework. Using a simplified version of Brainard and Tobin (1968) model, we explain the asset holdings in terms of wealth and interest rates. We test the model on quarterly holdings of five assets, i. e., saving and fixed deposits, khas <b>deposits,</b> national <b>deposit</b> <b>certificates</b> and defence saving certificates. Asset substitutability is ascertained by single equation OLS, FIML (Iterative 3 SLS) and restricted FIML estimation techniques. The system-wide restricted model performs according to a priori expectations. Own interest rate effect is positive and significant in three of the four equations. Five of the six off-diagonals are negative, and three are statistically significant. Saving and fixed deposits exhibit weak complementarity. Khas deposit and national <b>deposit</b> <b>certificates</b> are strong substitutes. The model is also used to decompose the change in portfolio share due to wealth, interest rate and residual components. ...|$|R
