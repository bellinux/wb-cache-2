40|$|Stochastic partial {{differential}} equations (SPDEs) whose solutions are probabilitymeasure-valued processes are considered. Measure-valued processes {{of this type}} arise naturally as <b>de</b> Finetti <b>measures</b> of infinite exchangeable systems of particles and as the solutions for filtering problems. In particular, we consider a model of asset price determination by an infinite collection of competing traders. Each trader’s valuations of the assets are given by the solution of a stochastic differential equation, and the infinite system of SDEs, assumed to be exchangeable, is coupled through a common noise process and through the asset prices. In the simplest, single asset setting, the market clearing price at any time t is given by a quantile of the <b>de</b> Finetti <b>measure</b> determined by the individual trader valuations. In the multi-asset setting, the prices are essentially given by the solution of an assignment game introduced by Shapley and Shubik. Existence of solutions for the infinite exchangeable system is obtained by an approximation argument that requires the continuous dependence of the prices on the determining <b>de</b> Finetti <b>measures</b> which is ensured if the <b>de</b> Finetti <b>measures</b> charge every open set...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Two major {{strategies}} have typically {{been used to}} assess recent drinking: (1) Daily Estimation (<b>DE)</b> <b>measures</b> such as the Timeline Followback (TLFB) and (2) Quantity-Frequency (QF) summary measures. Although QF measures provide a quick and easy measure of consumption, they have been criticized as {{not being able to}} capture sporadic and unpatterned drinking (e. g., days that reflect important social and/or health risks). The TLFB, a psychometrically sound drinking assessment method, is able to capture all drinking, including sporadic heavy days and unpatterned drinking. In some situations, however, recall of daily drinking may not be possible or practical (e. g., limited time; no resources). This article compares results obtained by using a QF <b>measure</b> and a <b>DE</b> <b>measure</b> to assess problem drinkers’ pretreatment drinking. Method: The current study, part of a large community mail intervention with 825 alcohol abusers, compared results from two drinking measures covering the same time interval that were administered on two different occasions approximately 2. 5 weeks apart. Both measures, the Quick Drinking Screen (QDS; a QF summary measure that collected data by telephone) and the TLFB (a self-administered daily estimation measure), collected drinking data for the year prior to the interview. Results: Although the QDS and the TLFB are very different drinking measures, remarkably similar aggregate drinking data were obtained for five drinking variables. Conclusions: When it is not necessary or possible to gather detailed drinking data, the QDS produces reliable brief summary measures of drinking, at least for not severely alcohol dependent individuals. Also, respondents do not appear to use a repetitive response pattern when completing the TLFB...|$|R

Using updated panel data of 26 African countries spanning the period 1996 - 2010, this study examines the effect of liberalisation policies with particular focus on financial, trade, institutional, political and economic liberalisations on income-inequality. We find: that financial liberalisation has a levitated income-redistributive effect with {{the magnitude of the}} <b>de</b> jure <b>measure</b> (KAOPEN) higher than that of the <b>de</b> facto <b>measure</b> (FDI); that exports, trade and ‘freedom to trade’ have an equality incidence on income-distribution; and that institutional and political liberalisation has a negative impact and we also find that, economic freedom has a negative income-redistributive effect possibly because of the weight of its legal component. The impact of these policies implications are discussed in detail in this study. ...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{decline is}} a common condition, {{occurring}} each year in nearly 12 % of Canadians 75 {{years of age and}} older. The model of functional health proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) represents a useful theoretical framework and is the basis for the SMAF (Système <b>de</b> <b>measure</b> <b>de</b> l'autonomie fonctionelle or Functional Autonomy Measurement System), an instrument that measures functional autonomy. The functional decline syndrome, in which functional autonomy is diminished or lost, may present as an acute condition, i. e., a medical emergency for which the patient must be admitted to a geriatric assessment unit. The subacute form is a more insidious condition in which the patient requires comprehensive assessment and a rehabilitation program. A preventive approach based on screening of those at risk and early intervention should prevent or delay the appearance of functional decline or diminish its consequences. Effective strategies for the prevention of or rehabilitation from functional decline will help reduce the incidence of disabilities and the period of dependence near the end of life. These strategies are absolute prerequisites for controlling sociohealth expenses and, most importantly, for allowing people to live independently in old age...|$|R
