Distinguishing the policy of tension and traction dividend considering the investment opportunities and investment in suitable investing opportunities that needs traction policy of dividend, {{as well as the}} stockholders ’ satisfaction which takes the enforcement of tension policy of dividend in order to increase the Business Value-Added (BVA) is almost difficult and very sensitive. Moreover, it is more difficult to study and distinguish suitable approaches for consuming financing resources. We also should consider the way of distributing these resources as the dividend or consumption of these resources in using the profitable investment opportunities. This can be effective on fulfillment of increasing the efficiency of investment of investors and maximizing the stockholders ’ Wealth. Economic Value Added (EVA) can be used as an interior standard for the business operation. This standard result to creation of another external standard named Market Value Added (MVA). The firm’s value can be evaluated through this MVA which is used in this study. Generally, detecting ways of financing (borrowings) and the way of cash <b>distribution</b> (<b>dividend</b> divided) and their affects ratio on maximization of a corporate value are among the complicated problems and subjects that studying and researching them would be very important for the analysts, investors, stock assessors, stock brokers, financial and credit institutions and other beneficial individuals and institutions.

It investigates the announcement effect of dividend in India in the presence of <b>dividend</b> <b>distribution</b> tax with specific legislative intent of discouraging <b>dividend</b> <b>distribution.</b> Using data on large profitable firms, we show that despite firm-level tax, higher dividend payout announcement leads to significant rise in share price. This implies that despite being tax-disadvantaged, investors of large profitable firms prefer higher payout, because it mitigates agency cost of retention. This shows that <b>dividend</b> <b>distribution</b> tax is inefficient.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the stock price {{adjustment}} after a <b>dividend</b> <b>distribution,</b> allowing for different types of investors and market imperfections, including taxes and transaction costs. Design/methodology/approach – An arbitrage model is developed to determine the possible equilibria for the stock price adjustment, after a <b>dividend</b> <b>distribution.</b> The approach is theoretical, providing general results. Findings – The model shows that, in the presence of different types of investors, a unique equilibrium only exists in the absence of transaction costs. The allowance for market imperfections, such as taxes and transactions costs, implies that there is not a unique equilibrium for the level of stock price adjustment following a <b>dividend</b> <b>distribution</b> event, but rather there is much possible equilibrium. It is showed that the observation of abnormal trading volume around the dividend event may give us some insights on the identification of which investors are present in the market. Practical implications – On future studies of the stock price adjustment after <b>dividend</b> <b>distributions,</b> it should be taken into account that there is no unique equilibrium. Originality/value – The main contribution of this paper is to show that the existence of taxes and transaction costs precludes the determination of a unique equilibrium point for the stock price adjustment after a <b>dividend</b> <b>distribution.</b> Arbitrage, <b>Dividends,</b> Stock markets, Taxes, Transaction costs...|$|R

First, dividends in Greece are paid annually rather than quarterly or semi-annually. Second, the Greek corporate laws 2190 / 1920 and 148 / 1967 specifically designate the minimum amount for distribution from the taxed corporate profits. Third, neither tax on dividends nor on capital gains was imposed during the period under examination. Fourth, Greek listed firms are characterized by high ownership concentration where major owners are usually involved in management and therefore have less need for dividend announcements as an information source. Despite this neutralized information and tax environment, we document significant market reaction to dividend change announcements, lending support to the "information content of dividends hypothesis".

With regards to gaining evidence of the financial benefits of SRI compared to conventional portfolios, no greater clarity was obtained, since there was diverging results of the studies undertaken.

40|$|Large {{shareholders}} {{may play}} an important role for firm policies and performance, but identifying an effect empirically presents a challenge due to the endogeneity of ownership structures. However, unlike other blockholders, individuals tend to hold blocks in corporations that are located close to where they live. Using this fact, we create an instrument – the density of wealthy individuals near a firm’s headquarters – for the presence of a large, non-managerial individual shareholder in a public firm. We show that these shareholders have a large impact on firms. Consistent with theories of large shareholders as monitors, we find that they increase firm profitability, increase dividends, reduce corporate cash holdings, and reduce executive compensation. Consistent with the view that there exist conflicts between large and small owners in public firms, we uncover evidence of substitution toward less tax-efficient forms of <b>distribution</b> (<b>dividends</b> over repurchases). In addition, our analysis shows that large shareholders reduce the liquidity of the firm’s stock.
