Nonetheless, {{there are still}} many ways in which the national college entrance system can be improved. This article initially analysed and synthesized the issues associated with the Korean college <b>admission</b> <b>system</b> that successive regimes had to tackle, the relevant policy alternatives, and the ensuing consequences of the policy alternatives instituted by different regimes. Based on the analysis, the persistent key issues embedded in major screening factors in the college <b>admission</b> <b>system</b> were determined.

In addition, the historical analyses of the Korean college <b>admission</b> <b>system</b> will contribute to providing education policy makers in other countries with insights and vicarious experience for the reform of their college entrance systems. <br /...|$|R

We {{address this issue}} by considering {{the effects of a}} particular college <b>admission</b> <b>system</b> on family formation. We show that the <b>admission</b> <b>system</b> affects mainly the timing of college enrollment and not the college-going decision. As such, we consider a specific type of career interruption and its consequences for relationship formation and fertility decisions. Specifically, we employ a regression discontinuity design based on the college <b>admission</b> <b>system</b> to estimate the effect of being above the admission requirement in the year of application on later family formation decisions. We find that the <b>admission</b> <b>system</b> has substantial effects on the timing of family formation and, specifically, that the timing of college enrollment is an important determinant hereof. This suggests that career interruptions such as delays in the educational system can have large effects on family decision-making...|$|R
40|$|The ACT {{automated}} <b>admissions</b> <b>system</b> {{was adopted}} by t he Colleges and Universities in the Utah system {{of higher education in}} 1974. The automated <b>admission</b> <b>system</b> was conceived at a time when College enrollment al l over the United States was decreasing, and thus was viewed by its proponents as a positive step in alleviating some of the 2 ̆ 7 articulation problems between post secondary institutions, high school counselors and prospective students. Educators who developed the program felt that it would be an advantage to prospective students by providing an admissions decision shortly after the ACT was taken. Automated admissions appears to be an advantage to high school counselors because i t eliminates the need for a high school transcript in the admissions process, and because it reduces the amount of time the counselor is involved in the mechanics of the admissions process. This study represents an effort to determine the impact of the Automated <b>Admissions</b> <b>system</b> on the high school counselor and on prospective college students.

Although the polytechnics were degree-teaching institutions, through the CNAA awards system, they were not eligible for admission to UCCA as it was reserved only for universities with degree awarding powers.

40|$|Europe’s higher {{education}} systems {{are struggling to}} respond to the established mass demand for {{higher education}}, especially given the proportional decline in available resources per student and, more generally the demand for an ever longer education and reduction of the population of working age due to demographic decline. In addition, growing student mobility puts pressure on <b>admission</b> <b>systems</b> to set up relevant procedures for applicants who wish to enter a country. <b>Admission</b> <b>systems</b> to higher education constitute one key element in the mitigation of these challenges.
