50|$|In 1950 Frank Rosenblatt {{looked into}} a new {{approach}} in neural net technology. He used <b>a</b> circuit consisting <b>of</b> <b>an</b> array <b>of</b> input units. These units are connected through <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> intermediate neurons. In Rosenblatt's trials, he used binary words in both input and output, and he called his invention Perception. Perception was the most basic and revolutionary type of neural net. In 1969, the limitations of Perception were explained by Minsky and Papert. Neural nets have been expanded by <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> neuroscientists and psychologists. Churchland discusses neural nets {{in the context of}} facial coding. The example consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> teller who could not remember the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> robber to provide a description. However, Churchland says the teller would likely recognize and discriminate the robber's face when she sees him again. This example contains not only the idea of neural nets, but also of vector coding.|$|R
40|$|Present-day {{central banks}} did not repeat the {{mistakes}} of the 1930 s by tightening money in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> crisis, or by desperately trying to balance their books when the economy crashed. Yet there is one area of policy-making where authorities may not have learned the lessons of history, and {{are in the process of}} repeating the same mistakes, argues Paul De Grauwe, Senior Research Fellow at CEPS. Ultimately <b>a</b> central <b>bank</b> has to make choices. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England chose massive programmes of liquidity creation, attaching a low weight to the possible inflationary consequences of their actions. The ECB has been more conservative in its liquidity creating programmes; attaching a low weight to the consequences for the exchange rate and to the chances <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quick recovery. Only time will tell us which of these choices was right...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} banking crises on manufacturing exports exploiting the fact that sectors differ in their needs for external financing. Relying on data from 23 banking crises episodes involving both developed and developing countries during the period 1980 - 2000 the authors separate the impact of banking crises on export growth from that of other exogenous shocks (i. e. demand shocks). Their findings show that during a crisis the export of sectors more dependent on external finance grow significantly less than other sectors. However, this result holds only for sectors depending more heavily on banking finance as opposed to inter-firm finance. Furthermore, sectors characterized by higher degree of assets tangibility {{appear to be more}} resilient in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> crisis. The effect of the banking crises on exports is robust and additional to external demand shocks. The effect of the latter is independent and additional to that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> shock, and is particularly significant for sectors producing durable goods.

40|$|A brush {{mattress}} is <b>a</b> layer (mattress) <b>of</b> interlaced live branches {{placed on}} <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> face, {{often with a}} live fascine and/or rock at the base. The live branches are cut from any adventitiously sprouting (sprouts roots from stems) woody plant, such as willow and some species of shrub dogwood and alder. The mattress and the live fascines are held in place with wire or twine, live stakes, and dead stout stakes. A brush mattress, with a live fascine and/or rock at its toe, is used along the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eroding <b>bank</b> and acts principally to armor the bank (Figure 1 a-c). The brush mattress {{has the potential to}} immediately slow velocities along the bank and accumulate sediment. Together with the sprouting plants, the brush mattress develops <b>a</b> strong network <b>of</b> interlocking roots and plant stems. The brush mattress helps to control bank erosion while serving as habitat for birds, small fur-bearing animals, and insects and other organisms that in turn are fed upon by fish and other higher organisms. Once the vegetation reaches <b>a</b> height <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few feet, it can provide shade to the stream- lowering water temperatures, offering protection from predators, and generally improving fish habitat. The brush mattress can also improve non-point pollution control by intercepting sediment and associated pollutants coming into the stream from overbank areas and in the flm»...|$|R
30|$|Horton (1933) {{compared}} {{the soil surface}} to a “diverting dam and head-gate” that divides net precipitation (precipitation received {{at the top of}} the vegetation canopy less interception losses) into an infiltration component limited by the infiltration capacity of the soil and a surface runoff component. The surface runoff component is commonly known as Hortonian overland flow or infiltration excess overland flow. The infiltration rate is supply controlled (or flux controlled) at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> storm (preponding infiltration; Rubin, 1966), and as soon as the rainfall rate exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil surface, infiltration becomes rainpond and the resulting infiltration excess flows off along the land surface as overland flow. In this stadium, infiltration is surface controlled. Whilst infiltration excess overland flow is common under dry initial conditions and on hillslopes with surface sealing, the saturation excess overland flow generating mechanism is more common under temperate climate conditions with frequent, low intensity precipitation, and occurs when the soil is saturated and unable to absorb more water (Dunne and Black, 1970). Under such conditions, infiltration is soil controlled or more specifically, profile controlled when the infiltration capacity of the topsoil exceeds that of the underlying soil layers, and the decline rate of the infiltration capacity depends on soil structure, texture, and water content. <b>A</b> special form <b>of</b> infiltration is channel infiltration, which is the infiltration into the channel bed and results in <b>a</b> loss <b>of</b> water in downstream direction. The reverse process, channel seepage, occurs when groundwater surfaces on the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stream <b>bank</b> or exfiltrates into the channel.|$|R
5000|$|Odynerus spinipes adults mate {{soon after}} {{emergence}} and mating {{is followed by}} a search for nest sites which are then prepared and the cells provisioned with prey by the females.

The location of the nest is first dampened with water before <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> five to six cells is created immediately behind the vertical <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bank.</b> <b>A</b> [...] "chimney" [...] up to 30 mm long which curves over and downwards is made from the spoil created by the excavation. It is not known what the function of the chimney is but one theory is that it may shelter the burrow from rain in the exposed situations the wasp chooses for nesting or the chimney may deter potential cleptoparasites and parasitoids. As suitable nesting sites are scarce several females may be found nesting close together in small aggregations.|$|R
