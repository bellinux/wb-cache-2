5|$|Even {{though the}} effects of raising {{children}} and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies, the men in such situations are affected greatly as well. This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility. In The Canadian Family in Crisis, the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies and surveys. This is because women's stress can be seen through <b>direct</b> <b>labor</b> consisting of housework and career whereas men's stress, in most cases, mostly come from decision making and work-family conflicts. These situations arise where the male must make {{the best choice for}} the future of his family. Specifically, these include things such as workload, overtime hours, shift decisions, and even accepting a promotion or a transfer. In these situations, the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family, which brings on more stress. The effects also go unnoticed since, in traditional gender roles, the male {{is supposed to be the}} backbone of the family and, in the past, it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his emotions to the rest of the family. In surveys and studies done, most males would not like to be seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household, which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for the family. With this in mind, it is very possible that some may have lied when surveyed about these topics.|$|E

2500|$|Presently, UK {{labor laws}} are defined within the Employment Relations Act 1999 (ERA) and the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, and give workers {{no right to}} strike. [...] One of the most {{significant}} cases of mass-dismissals in the UK occurred in 2005, involving the termination of over 600 Gate Gourmet workers at Heathrow Airport, which was viewed by some as a union busting tactic and caused a great deal of media scrutiny. The terminations prompted a walkout by British Airways ground staff that paralysed flights and stranded thousands of travellers in the UK. [...] The BBC reported that Andy Cook, Gate Gourmet's director of human resources at the time, said [...] "the company had not been looking to cut the size of the protests, only stop the minority engaged in harassment."

6000|$|Besides the {{two classes}} of {{indirect}} laborers here mentioned, those [...] engaged in producing materials and those in transportation, there [...] are several others who are paid fractions out of the bread. [...] Subsidiary to the <b>direct</b> <b>labor</b> of the bread-maker is the labor of [...] all those who make the instruments employed in the process (as, [...] e.g., the oven). Materials are completely changed in character by [...] one use, as when the coal is burned, or the flour baked into [...] bread; while an instrument, like an oven, is capable of remaining [...] intact throughout many operations. The producer of materials and [...] the transporter are paid by the bread-maker {{in the price of}} his [...] coal and flour when left at his door, so that the price of the [...] loaf is influenced by these payments. Those persons, moreover, [...] who, like the police and officers of our government, act to [...] protect property and life, are also to be classed as laborers [...] indirectly aiding in the production of the given article, bread [...] (and by his taxes the bread-maker helps pay the wages of these [...] officials). Shading off into a more distant, although essential, [...] connection is another class—that of those laborers who train human [...] beings in the branches of knowledge necessary to the attainment of [...] proper skill in managing the processes and instruments of an [...] industry. The acquisition of the rudiments of education, and, in [...] many cases, the most profound knowledge of chemistry, physics and [...] recondite studies, are essential to production; and teachers are [...] indirect laborers in producing almost every article in the market. [...] In this country, especially, are inventors a class of indirect [...] laborers essential to all ultimate production as it now goes on. [...] The improvements in the instruments of production are the results [...] of an inventive ability which has made American machinery known [...] all over the world. They, too, as well as the teacher, are paid (a [...] small fraction, of course) out of the ultimate result, by an [...] indirect path, and materially change the ease or difficulty, [...] cheapness or dearness, of production in nearly every branch of [...] industry. In the particular illustration given they have improved [...] the ovens, ranges, and stoves, so that the same or better articles [...] are produced at a less cost than formerly. All these indirect [...] laborers receive, in the way of remuneration, a fraction, some [...] more, some less (the farther they are removed from the direct [...] process), {{of the value of the}} final result.|$|E

50|$|The Portuguese Empire first {{established}} a de jure system of forced labour throughout its colonies in 1899, but the Portuguese {{government did not}} implement the system in Angola until 1911 and abolished it in 1913. Republicans overthrew King Manuel II in a coup d'état in October 1910. Workers in Moçâmedes, among other cities in Angola, campaigned for abolition and manumission. In some areas forced labourers declared strikes, hoping the economic slowdown would force political changes. Carvalhal Correia Henriques, the new governor of Moçâmedes, supported their claims and <b>directed</b> <b>labor</b> complaints his way. The Portuguese First Republic, the new state, abolished forced labour again, but the employers whose businesses depended on forced labour used their political clout to lobby the Portuguese government to fire Henriques. The Portuguese government legalized forced labour in Angola again in 1911, dismissed Henriques in January 1912, and abolished the practice again in 1913.|$|R
50|$|While {{leveraging}} colonialism in {{the same}} geographic operating theater as its imperial rivals, Spain maintained distinct imperial objectives and instituted a unique form of colonialism in support of its imperial agenda. Spain placed significant strategic emphasis on the acquisition, extraction, and exportation of precious metals (primarily gold and silver). A second objective was the evangelization of subjugated indigenous populations residing in mineral-rich and strategically favorable locations. Notable examples of these indigenous groups include the Taίno populations inhabiting Puerto Rico and segments of Cuba. Compulsory labor and slavery were widely institutionalized across Spanish-occupied territories and colonies, with an initial emphasis on <b>directing</b> <b>labor</b> towards mining activity and related methods of procuring semi-precious metals. The emergence of the Encomienda system during the 16th - 17th centuries in occupied colonies within the Caribbean basin reflects a gradual shift in imperial prioritization, increasingly focusing on large-scale production and exportation of agricultural commodities.|$|R

40|$|Increasing wage {{inequality}} between similar workers {{plays an}} important role for overall inequality trends in industrialized societies. To analyze this pattern, we incorporate <b>directed</b> <b>labor</b> market search into a dynamic model of international trade with heterogeneous firms and homogeneous workers. Wage inequality across and within firms results from their different hiring needs along their life cycles and the convexity of their adjustment costs. The interaction between wage posting and firm growth explains some recent empirical regularities on firm and labor market dynamics. Fitting the model to capture key features obtained from German linked employer-employee data, we investigate how falling trade costs and institutional reforms interact in shaping labor market outcomes. Focusing on the period 1996 - 2007, we find that neither trade nor key features of the Hartz labor market reforms account for the sharp increase in residual inequality observed in the data. By contrast, inequality is highly responsive to the increase in product market competition triggered by domestic regulatory reform...|$|R
