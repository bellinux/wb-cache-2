5|$|A {{few months}} later, Singaperumal is {{transferred}} and a corrupt officer (Vinu Chakravarthy) takes his place. The current DGP releases Teja and together, they urge Gemini to work <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> repay for the losses they incurred but Gemini refuses. To {{force him to}} return to his old ways, Teja persuades Isaac to conspire against Gemini. With Isaac's help, Teja plots and kills Kai. Gemini is infuriated and confronts Teja to settle the issue. During the fight, Gemini beats up Teja and swaps their clothes, leaving Teja bound and gagged. The new DGP arrives and shoots Gemini dead; he later realises that he had actually shot Teja who was in Gemini's clothes. While the DGP grieves over Teja's death, he receives news that he has been transferred to the Sewage Control Board.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Ben Tillman, his mother, and his wounded brother James (who died in 1866) {{worked to}} rebuild Chester plantation. They signed the plantation's freedmen as workers. They were {{confronted with the}} {{circumstance}} of several men refusing to work <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> legally leaving the plantation. From 1866 to 1868, Ben Tillman went with several workers from the plantation to Florida, where a new cotton-planting belt had been established. The Tillmans purchased land there. Tillman was unsuccessful in Florida—after two marginal years, the 1868 crop was destroyed by caterpillars.|$|E

5|$|Although kings, {{rulers and}} {{powerful}} {{people have always}} been able to pay for entertainment to be provided <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry. Sometimes referred to as show business, the industry relies on business models to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types. The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.|$|E

Noah returns home and tells Claire not to expose The Company, informing her that he has made a deal. He will work <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> in exchange his family will be left alone to lead normal lives.|$|E

Some, including General Glozelle, agree to do so, and Aslan creates a portal <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> the four Pevensies. Susan kisses Caspian, knowing they will never meet again, as Aslan told her and Peter that they will never return to Narnia. The Pevensies return to England, leaving Caspian as King.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{circumstances}} of the separation, Holopainen's appreciation of Turunen as an artist remained. He explained that he did not search for a similarly trained singer as a successor for Turunen because he considers her to be extraordinarily good in her genre and therefore irreplaceable.

She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wishes all the best <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> their subsequent lead singer Anette Olzon.|$|E
5|$|Determined to {{make one}} last show of defiance, Maxwell ordered the marines to wade towards the proas at low tide and open fire on them. This {{achieved}} no hits, but did persuade the Dayaks to move further offshore, and they departed entirely when the Ternate was spotted. The following day the survivors embarked on board Ternate, Maxwell having lost not one man on either the shipwreck or the island. At Batavia the crew were reunited with Amherst and his party, who had sent Ternate to search <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> subsequently chartered the East Indiaman Caesar {{for the remainder of}} the journey to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, or the gospel of success) is a religious belief among some Christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of God <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.|$|E

5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> none had been able to sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E

A Commissioner's portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs, they prepare proposals <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> if approved {{by a majority of}} Commissioners it goes forward to Parliament and Council for consideration. The Commission's civil service is headed by a Secretary General, currently Alexander Italianer.

In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> {{that they would have to}} find a distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a PC version.|$|E
5|$|The NK 6th Division shifted {{its axis}} of attack {{and its main}} attacking effort to the {{northern}} part of the Chinju-Masan corridor just below the Nam River in the 35th Infantry's sector. The 35th Infantry set to work to cover its front with trip flares, but they were in short supply and gradually it became impossible to replace them. Illuminating flares were also in short supply, and the reserve stocks had deteriorated to such a degree that only about 20 percent of the supply issued to the regiment was effective. Even when employed, the time lapse between a request <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> delivery by the big howitzers allowed some North Korean infiltration before the threatened area was illuminated.|$|E
5|$|The race {{starts in}} Port Town, with the winners {{traveling}} {{in a boat}} to a large desert.

According to the stone tablets, the actual location of the Crystal is hidden somewhere on the ancient map. Before he can investigate the matter further, Doctor Neo Cortex swoops in and snatches the map. As the two struggle for the map, the map is torn to shreds.|$|E
