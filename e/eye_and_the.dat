5|$|A. c. cervicapra (Linnaeus, 1758) : Known as {{the southeastern}} blackbuck. Occurs in southern, {{eastern and central}} India. The white eye ring of the male is narrow above the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leg stripe is well defined and reaches all along the leg.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the head of the female in {{breeding}} plumage is yellow, gradually changing to olive green {{at the back of the}} head, except for the broad yellow rear brow, while the area between the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bill is dark greenish grey, and the area around the ear is green. The head is surrounded by a broad yellow collar that includes the chin. The remainder of the female breeding plumage is identical to the male's.|$|E
5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more afflicted {{by the image}} of the Angel in her <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Doctor instructs her to keep her eyes closed, preventing her from seeing it. Octavian has the clerics guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River make for a secondary control room {{on the other side of}} the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from an explosion in time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E

5|$|Critics commented {{upon the}} character's {{resemblance}} both to horror film killers such as Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter, {{as well as}} to American Evangelists and to the biblical Jesus Christ. The series also follows Danes' rise and fall in the public <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> precariousness of fame. Though critics questioned the wisdom of having a pedophile as a character, the show's creative team was adamant that they had deliberately made him unlikable. In killing the character off, the creative team did not wish to suggest that the character had been redeemed for his earlier crimes, and made sure that this was emphasised even in his final act of self-sacrifice. Pullman has expressed interest in reprising the role in a future Torchwood series.|$|E
5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of the optic nerve known as the chiasm, which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the outer side of the visual field on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the optic nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. Visual acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a visual field defect. The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected. If the part of the nerve between the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> chiasm is compressed, the result is vision loss in one eye. If the part after the chiasm is affected, visual loss on one side of the visual field occurs.|$|E
5|$|Some {{distinctive}} {{characteristics in}} Garamond's letterforms are an 'e' {{with a small}} <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bowl of the 'a' which has a sharp hook upwards at top left. Other general features are limited but clear stroke contrast and capital letters {{on the model of}} Roman square capitals. The 'M' is slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the letter. The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward slope and ride above the cap height. The axis of letters like the ‘o’ is diagonal and the bottom right of the italic 'h' bends inwards.|$|E

5|$|The storm slowly {{strengthened}} {{over the}} warm {{waters of the}} eastern Atlantic thereafter as it tracked west-northwest. Some dry air from the Saharan Air Layer continued to slow development on September 14 as Helene remained a low-end tropical storm. However, a bout of intensification took place on September 15 as shear diminished. The storm became much better organized with well-defined banding, and leveled off that evening at just under hurricane intensity. On the morning of September 16, the storm began to develop a ragged <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> storm strengthened to hurricane status. The intensity leveled off for a while as a marginal Category 1 hurricane, as the intensification was slowed {{by the presence of}} moderate wind shear despite the absence of significant dry air. Late that evening, the storm began to slowly intensify once again.|$|E
5|$|While {{many critics}} refer to film noir as a genre itself, {{others argue that}} it can be no such thing. While noir is often {{associated}} with an urban setting, many classic noirs take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road; setting, therefore, cannot be its genre determinant, as with the Western. Similarly, while the private <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> femme fatale are character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of film noirs feature neither; so there is no character basis for genre designation as with the gangster film. Nor does film noir rely on anything as evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements of the horror film, the speculative leaps of the science fiction film, or the song-and-dance routines of the musical.|$|E
5|$|After {{fifteen minutes}} of combat, Boston lost its cross-jack yard and by 05:45 had {{suffered}} significant damage to its rigging and sails, rendering the ship significantly less manoeuvrable than Embuscade. At 06:10 the main topmast was knocked over and the mizzen mast badly damaged, and ten minutes later, as he was exhorting his men to greater efforts, a cannonball struck the rail where Captain Courtenay and Royal Marine Lieutenant James Butler were standing. Butler was killed instantly and Courtenay fell to the deck unresponsive, possibly killed. Believing his commander to be dead, Lieutenant John Edwards assumed command and had the bodies thrown overboard {{in an effort to}} prevent his sailors losing morale from the death of their captain. Boston continued to suffer under the heavier guns of the French ship and by 06:40 the mizzen mast was close to collapse and much of the remaining rigging had been shot away. Casualties mounted, with Lieutenant Edwards and Lieutenant Alexander Kerr both badly wounded, the latter blinded in one <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> former struck on the head and briefly rendered unconscious.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} Marianas Islands, {{the eye of}} Dolphin became much larger as the storm {{developed}} strong outflow channels, both indicative of further strengthening. On May16, the typhoon began rapid deepening as it reached the western periphery of the ridge, causing it to turn more to the north. At 06:00UTC that day, the JMA estimated peak 10minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). Based on the well-defined structure and Dvorak ratings of T7.0, the JTWC upgraded Dolphin to a super typhoon late on May16 with 1minute winds of 260km/h (160mph). The approaching westerlies turned Dolphin {{to the north and}} northeast on May17 while also imparting unfavorable conditions, causing the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> convection to elongate and weaken. By May18, increased wind shear had exposed the circulation as the winds continued to drop. After the convection decreased further, the JTWC discontinued advisories on Dolphin on May19, once Dolphin was beginning to become extratropical near the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. On the next day, the winds fell below typhoon force, and at 00:00UTC on May21, the JMA declared Dolphin extratropical. The storm accelerated to the northeast, passing through the Aleutian Islands on May22. The storm slowed once reaching the Gulf of Alaska, turning eastward to cross the International Date Line on May24.|$|E
5|$|Banding {{features}} and outflow continued to develop as {{a ring of}} convection formed around the center of Fabian, and on August 30, the storm intensified into a hurricane while gradually slowing its motion to the west-northwest. As banding {{features and}} outflow became better defined, an eye developed {{in the center of}} the deepest convection. Fabian quickly strengthened and attained major hurricane status late that day. Deep convection became very concentric around the 11.5mile (18.5km) wide <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hurricane reached winds of 125mph (205km/h) early on August 31. At this time, the deepest convection near the eye degraded in appearance, and Fabian temporarily stopped its strengthening trend. Later that day, the eye became distinct again within a perfectly round area of deep convection. Outflow continued to expand in all directions, and Fabian intensified into a Category 4 hurricane late on August 31. Thunderstorm activity near the eyewall became more intense, and the cloud tops in the eyewall became much cooler; simultaneously, outflow away from the eye became much more symmetrical, both signs of an intensifying tropical cyclone. Fabian reached its peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h) on September 1 while located 345miles (555km) east of the northern Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of November 7, the eye began to {{reappear}} and the storm turned towards the northwest and the foreword motion began to rapidly increase. Later that morning, Florence had developed a large, 35 to 40mi (55 to 65km/h) wide <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> foreword motion continued to increase. The intensification continued and by the afternoon hours, Florence was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (155km/h). A strong extratropical cyclone located {{to the north of}} Florence was causing the storm to move towards the northwest at a rapid pace of 30mph (48km/h). Operationally, Florence was reported to have peaked at that intensity, but post season analysis determined that the storm reached its peak intensity just short of major hurricanea storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higherstatus late on November 7. By {{the morning of}} November 8, Florence weakened slightly to Category 1 status. The large system to the north continued to cause Florence to move at 58mph (93km/h). Since the storm was very close to a cold front, Florence was expected to rapidly transition into an extratropical cyclone. Later that morning, Florence was absorbed into the extratropical cyclone while still maintaining hurricane-force winds.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distance as the thickness of a coat of paint, a sheet of paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second, and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{designation}} as a named storm, Carlos drifted generally north-northwestward while {{embedded within}} a weak steering regime. The cyclone struggled {{with a combination of}} northerly wind shear and dry air entrainment, limiting the storm's associated deep convection to the eastern quadrant. By early on June13, however, a ragged eye became evident on visible satellite imagery as the upper-level environment became increasingly conducive for intensification, and Carlos was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale at 12:00UTC. Deep convection became increasingly symmetric about the <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cyclone reached its initial peak intensity six hours later with winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). However, early on June14, the presentation of Carlos began to deteriorate as a result of upwelling and the ingestion of dry air; the eye became obscured and banding features decreased as evident on satellite imagery, while the eyewall became increasingly ill-defined on radar. At 00:00UTC on June15, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm about 75mi (120km) west-southwest of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, 2008, Judah lost to Joshua Clottey by {{technical}} {{decision in}} a fight for the vacant IBF Welterweight title at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. Judah began the busier fighter, showing quick hands and throwing effective combinations behind a jab. Clottey began steadily closing the distance between himself and his opponent from the third round, landing {{an increasing number of}} punches that took their toll on Judah. In round four, Clottey landed an uppercut that caused Judah to lose his balance, {{and by the end of}} the round, Judah had blood running down his nose. Judah staged a comeback in the sixth round, but in the middle of the seventh round, Clottey landed a right hand that hurt Judah and caused him to back into a corner. In round nine, Judah suffered a cut over his right <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fight was stopped after he said he could not see. The referee had ruled the cut was caused by an accidental clash of heads and so the fight went to the scorecards. Two judges scored the fight 86–85 and the other judge scored it 87–84, all in favor of Clottey.|$|E

5|$|The Sind sparrow (Passer pyrrhonotus) is a {{passerine}} bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found {{around the}} Indus valley region in South Asia. It {{is also known}} as the jungle, Sind jungle, or rufous-backed sparrow. Very similar to the related house sparrow, it is smaller and has distinguishing plumage features. As in the house sparrow, the male has brighter plumage than female and young birds, including black markings and a grey crown. Distinctively, the male has a chestnut stripe running down its head behind the <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> female has a darker head than other sparrow species do. Its main vocalisations are soft chirping calls that are extended into longer songs with other sounds interspersed by breeding males. Historically, this species was thought to be very closely related to the house sparrow, but its closest evolutionary affinities may lie elsewhere. Discovered around 1840, this species went undetected for several decades after its discovery.|$|E
5|$|The deities {{associated}} with the Eye were not restricted to feline and serpent forms. Hathor's usual animal form is a cow, as {{is that of the}} closely linked Eye goddess Mehet-Weret. Nekhbet, a vulture goddess, was closely connected with Wadjet, the <b>Eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> crowns of Egypt. Many Eye goddesses appear mainly in human form, including Neith, a sometimes warlike deity sometimes said to be the mother of the sun god, and Satet and Anuket, who were linked with the Nile cataracts and the inundation. Other such goddesses include Sothis, the deified form of the star of the same name, and Maat, the personification of cosmic order, who was connected with the Eye because she was said to be the daughter of Ra. Even Isis, who is usually the companion of Osiris rather than Ra, or Astarte, a deity of fertility and warfare who was imported from Canaan rather than native to Egypt, could be equated with the solar Eye.|$|E
5|$|Upon being classified, the {{disturbance}} had a broad circulation that {{was difficult to}} locate, with moderate convection in its eastern periphery. The thunderstorms organized further, and MFR upgraded {{the disturbance}} to a tropical depression at 0000UTC on February19. Three hours later, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 16S, and at 0600UTC that day, MFR upgraded the depression to a moderate tropical storm after an advanced scatterometer indicated winds of over 65km/h (40mph); as a result, the National Weather Service of Madagascar gave it the name Haruna. By that time, the circulation had become better organized with increased rainbands, and with an anticyclone aloft, the storm developed well-defined outflow. The structure of Haruna continued to become more symmetrical with a large radius of maximum winds, developing a ragged eye early on February20. Based on the improved appearance, MFR upgraded Haruna to a severe tropical storm at 0000UTC that day. About 12hours later, the agency upgraded Haruna further to tropical cyclone status, with 10minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). That day, an approaching trough weakened the ridge to the south, causing the cyclone to slow and move erratically. While Haruna was approaching the southwestern coast of Madagascar, it developed a 120km (75mi) wide <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eyewall passed over Europa Island. Initially, MFR estimated that the storm would intensify to intense tropical cyclone status, and the agency assessed that Haruna reached 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph) on February20. The next day, JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). In contrast, MFR estimated {{at that time that}} the cyclone had peaked when the eyewall thunderstorms warmed, followed by the eye becoming less organized and the winds decreasing.|$|E
