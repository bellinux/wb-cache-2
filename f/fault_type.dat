30|$|We have {{examined}} the focal mechanism distributions in the source region of the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake, {{before and after the}} mainshock, using F-net data, and then performed a stress tensor inversion by using the multiple inverse method. It is found that earthquakes were mainly reverse <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> events all over the source region before the main shock, whereas, after the main shock, many normal <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> events occurred in the hanging wall but focal mechanisms did not change in the deepest part in the source region. It is inferred from the stress tensor inversion that the stress state is a reverse <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> in the deepest part before, and after, the mainshock but that, in the central part, the stress state changed from reverse <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> before the mainshock to normal <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> after the mainshock. These results suggest that the absolute shear stress on the plate boundary fault in this region was almost completely released by the mainshock. Furthermore, we examined, in detail, the focal mechanism distributions and stress states in the shallower part near the trench axis off the Miyagi Prefecture and found that strike-slip events with the P-axis in the NS direction occurred in the footwall east of the mainshock hypocenter. This finding can be well explained by a slip model with a large moment release near the hypocenter. Our analysis constrains the spatial distribution of the moment release of the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake around the mainshock hypocenter rather than {{in the vicinity of the}} trench axis.|$|E
