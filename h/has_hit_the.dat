25|$|The match details, {{including}} {{runs and}} dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers, one representing each team. The scorers are {{directed by the}} hand signals of an umpire (see image, right). For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises both arms above his head if the batsman <b>has</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game.|$|E
25|$|The players spin {{a racket}} {{to decide who}} serves first. This player starts the first rally by electing to serve from either {{the left or right}} service box. For a legal serve, one of the server's feet must be in the service box, not {{touching}} any part of the service box lines, as the player strikes the ball. After being struck by the racket, the ball must strike the front wall above the service line and below the out line and land in the opposite back quarter court. The receiving player can choose to volley a serve after it <b>has</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> front wall. If the server wins the point, the two players switch sides for the following point.|$|E
25|$|Project Wing is {{a project}} that aims to rapidly deliver {{products}} across a city by using flying vehicles, similar to the Amazon Prime Air concept. At {{the time of the}} announcement on August 28, 2014, it had already been in development secretly at Google for about two years, with full-scale testing being carried out in Australia. The flying vehicles take off vertically, then rotate to a horizontal position for flying around. For delivery, it hovers and winches packages down to the ground. At the end of the tether is a small bundle of electronics which detects that the package <b>has</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground, detaches from the delivery, and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle. Dropping the cargo or landing were found to be unfeasible, as users compromised the safety.|$|E

25|$|A {{block is}} {{performed}} when, after a shot is attempted, a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball. In almost all variants of play, {{it is illegal}} to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc; this is known as goaltending. It is also illegal under NBA and Men's NCAA basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard, or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim. Under international rules {{it is illegal to}} block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball <b>has</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> rim. After the ball hits the rim, it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed.|$|E

500|$|Although the Algonquin was [...] "dry" [...] {{even before}} Prohibition (Case closed the hotel bar in 1917 and had harsh words {{for those who}} ran speakeasies), the hotel does have an eponymous cocktail, {{composed}} of rye whiskey, Noilly Prat and pineapple juice.

Hoy Wong was a notable bartender at the hotel and was the oldest person to hold such a position in the state, serving at the Algonquin for 30 years until retiring in 2009, well past the age of 90.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{cited the}} legacy {{aspects of the}} film for Scorsese and {{compared}} Scorsese to such established directors as Ingmar Bergman. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe said, [...] "The movie's being promoted as the third in the director's unofficial trilogy of faith, after The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) and Kundun (1997), and {{it feels like a}} self-conscious masterpiece, a summing-up from a filmmaker who, at 74, may be thinking of his legacy." [...] Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out London gave the film five stars out of five, saying, [...] "Scorsese <b>has</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> rare heights of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman and Carl Theodor Dreyer, artists who find in religion a battleground that leaves even the strongest in tatters, compromised and broken." [...] Emma Green of The Atlantic gave the film high praise, stating, [...] "This is what makes Scorsese's film so radical and so unlike many movies about religion: It's actually art." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph gave the film five stars out of five, stating, [...] "Scorsese's brutal spiritual epic will scald, and succor, your soul." [...] Collin further added, [...] "It's the kind of work a great filmmaker can only pull off with a lifetime's accrued expertise behind him". Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film 3 stars and a half out of four, stating, [...] "With the religious historical drama Silence, Martin Scorsese proves he‚Äôs as masterful a filmmaker with men of God as he is with gangsters." [...] Truitt also argued that the film [...] "marks one of the deeper and most thoughtful projects in Scorsese‚Äôs career." ...|$|E
