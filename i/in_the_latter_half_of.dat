5|$|A {{possible}} {{issue with}} the causeway's identification as a Roman structure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the twentieth century was its incorporation of many small bends along its course. Roman military roads are usually straight in both their overall course, and also typically from one vantage point to the next. Both the Foss Way and the Stanegate, roads of established Roman provenance, have sinuous courses similar to Wade's causeway, so the objection is not conclusive.|$|E

5|$|Boston has {{experienced}} gentrification <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s. Living expenses have risen; Boston {{has one of}} the highest costs of living in the United States and was ranked the 129th most expensive major city in the world in a 2011 survey of 214 cities.

50|$|The split-eyed owlflies {{form one}} of the two main {{lineages}} of living Ascalaphidae, the other being the Haplogleniinae which have unsplit eyes like their ancestors. The first fossil record of the Ascalaphinae dates to the Miocene, and the subfamily thus probably evolved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> or towards <b>the</b> end of the Paleogene.|$|R
50|$|The film moves at {{an amazingly}} rapid pace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half,</b> but sadly <b>in</b> no {{particular}} direction. People die {{as if there}} is they have some kind of death wish, and the abrupt conclusion confirms that the director, for reasons better known to him, was in a rush to wrap things up.|$|R
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> 1934, Himmler {{oversaw the}} {{creation}} of SS-Junkerschule (Junker schools), institutions where SS officer candidates received leadership training, political and ideological indoctrination, and military instruction. The training stressed ruthlessness and toughness {{as part of the}} SS value system, which helped foster a sense of superiority among the men and taught them self-confidence. The first schools were established at Bad Tölz and Braunschweig, with additional schools opening at Klagenfurt and Prague during the war.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> 1998, {{the team}} {{produced}} a polished and integrated interface, wrote the game manual and foreign language translations, painted the faction leader portraits and terrain, built the 3D vehicles and vehicle parts, {{and created the}} music. Michael Ely directed the Secret Project movies and cast the faction leaders. 25 volunteers participated in Firaxis' first public beta test. The beta testers suggested the Diplomatic and Economic victories and the Random Events.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> 2002, CIA reports {{contained}} {{assertions of}} Saddam Hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi {{biological and chemical}} weapons, and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions. Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.|$|E
50|$|The lake {{is located}} {{primarily}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> municipalities of Sables-Spanish Rivers, Baldwin and Nairn and Hyman, although its easternmost end enters {{the city limits}} of Greater Sudbury near High Falls.

Some {{of these works}} address the developmental and biomechanical constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from arthritic axles, and Pullman's Mulefa are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they coevolved.|$|E
5|$|Industrial metal {{developed}} in the late 1980s, as industrial and metal began to fuse into a common genre. In {{the early years of}} the 21st century, groups from the black metal scene began to incorporate elements of industrial music. Industrial metal did well in the early 1990s, particularly in North America, with the success of groups such as Nine Inch Nails. The industrial metal movement began to fade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 1990s.|$|E
