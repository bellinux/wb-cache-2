5|$|Few Privy Counsellors are {{required}} to attend regularly. The settled practice is that day-to-day meetings of the Council are attended by four Privy Counsellors, usually the relevant Minister to the matters pertaining. The Cabinet Minister holding the office of Lord President of the Council, currently the Rt Hon. Andrea Leadsom , invariably presides. Under Britain's modern conventions of parliamentary government and constitutional monarchy, every order made in Council is drafted by a Government Department and has already {{been approved by the}} Minister responsible—thus actions taken by the Queen-in-Council are formalities required <b>for</b> <b>validation</b> of each measure.|$|E

Steorn said that they would seek no further funding while attempting to prove their free-energy claim in order to demonstrate their genuine desire <b>for</b> <b>validation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Xbox One {{games are}} {{distributed}} at retail on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through Xbox Games Store. All Xbox One games must be installed to the console's storage: users {{can begin to}} play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while {{the remainder of the}} game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. If the game is installed from physical media, the disc is still required <b>for</b> <b>validation</b> purposes. If the game is installed on another console, and that console owner no longer has access to the disc, the owner has the option of unlocking the install on their hard drive by purchasing it through Xbox Live; the installed game then acts as a game installed on the hard drive. An active internet connection may be required for some games, particularly those that rely on server-side processing..|$|E

25|$|The liberal {{philosophical}} {{tradition has}} searched <b>for</b> <b>validation</b> and justification through several intellectual projects. The {{moral and political}} suppositions of liberalism {{have been based on}} traditions such as natural rights and utilitarian theory, although sometimes liberals even requested support from scientific and religious circles. Through all these strands and traditions, scholars have identified the following major common facets of liberal thought: believing in equality and individual liberty, supporting private property and individual rights, supporting the idea of limited constitutional government, and recognising the importance of related values such as pluralism, toleration, autonomy, bodily integrity and consent.|$|E
25|$|To {{be listed}} on the first-round ballot, {{candidates}} must secure 500 signatures (often referred to as parrainages) from national or local elected officials from at least 30 different departments or overseas collectivities, {{with no more than}} a tenth of these signatories from any single department. The official signature collection period followed the publication of the Journal officiel on 25 February to 17 March. The collection period had initially been scheduled to begin on 23 February, but a visit by Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve to China on that date forced a delay. French prefectures mailed sponsorship forms to the 42,000 elected officials eligible to give their signature to a candidate, which must then be delivered to the Constitutional Council <b>for</b> <b>validation.</b> Unlike in previous years, a list of validated signatures was posted on Tuesday and Thursday of every week on the Council's website; in the past, signatories were published only after the official candidate list had been verified {{after the end of the}} collection period. The end of the signature collection period also marked the deadline for the declaration of personal assets required of prospective candidates. The final list of candidates was proclaimed on 21 March.|$|E
500|$|The pass {{consisted}} of two parts: the Flash Pass card and the Flash Pass coupon. [...] A nontransferable Flash Pass card used <b>for</b> <b>validation</b> had to be acquired before a Flash Pass coupon can be purchased. [...] To obtain a card, a passenger needed to visit a designated station and fill out an application form. [...] Although the card is issued free of charge and contains no expiry date, {{it is expected to}} be issued only once. [...] Should it be lost, an affidavit of loss had to be submitted before a replacement can be issued. The Flash Pass coupon, which served as a ticket, was linked to the passenger's Flash Pass card through the card number printed on the coupon. [...] Coupons were sold for ₱250 and were valid for unlimited rides on all three lines of the LRTA and MRTC for one week. The card and coupon were used by showing them to a security guard at an opening along the fare gates, who after checking their validity allowed the holder to pass through.|$|E

She, Jonathan, and Nicola later discover Elodie's dead body, {{but when they}} return with policemen, the corpse has been switched for a prop dummy. Glenn reveals that he and Elodie were in love, and had recently married in secret. He suspects that Gessler may have murdered Elodie out of jealousy after she confessed their marriage to him. The police, however, receive a video of Elodie walking through a park the morning after she was supposedly murdered, with the day's newspaper in plain view <b>for</b> <b>validation.</b> Jonathan realizes that Gessler had manipulated Delia Gunning (Ellen Ashley), {{the editor of the}} local newspaper, into printing a fake copy a week in advance. By making the video before killing Elodie, he could deflect suspicion from himself, leading the police to believe that she had faked her own death and run away. Gessler ensured the front page's authenticity by having Delia create the day's headline herself, releasing a briefcase full of bees {{in the middle of a}} local council meeting. Jonathan's suspicions became aroused as the following story about the construction of a motorway through six villages would have been far more engaging as a front-pager. Jonathan and Joey arrive at Delia's home just in time to save her from being murdered by Gessler, who later kills himself by [...] himself in his car.|$|E

2500|$|King William {{felt himself}} so safe that he {{interfered}} autocratically with {{the management of}} the church, forbade the bishops to visit Rome, made appointments to bishoprics and abbeys, and showed little anxiety when the pope lectured him on the different principles which he had as to the relationship of spiritual and temporal powers, or when he prohibited him from commerce or commanded him to acknowledge himself a vassal of the apostolic chair. [...] William was particularly annoyed at Gregory's insistence on dividing ecclesiastical England into two provinces, in opposition to William's need to emphasize the unity of his newly acquired kingdom. Gregory's increasing insistence on church independence from secular authority in the matter of clerical appointments became a more and more contentious issue. He sought as well to compel the episcopacy to look to Rome <b>for</b> <b>validation</b> and direction, demanding the regular attendance of prelates in Rome. Gregory had no power to compel the English king to an alteration in his ecclesiastical policy, so he was compelled to ignore what he could not approve, and even considered it advisable to assure King William of his particular affection. On the whole, William's policy was of great benefit to the Church.|$|E

The VEHIL facility {{provides the opportunity}} to make the entire development process of intelligent vehicles safer, cheaper, and more manageable, and to make simulation more reliable. The main feature of VEHIL is that a complete intelligent vehicle, including its sensors and actuators, can be tested in a Hardware-In-the-Loop simulation environment. In this way VEHIL can be applied in the design phase for fast and easy optimization of the sensor configuration. Moreover, due to its ability for providing very accurately controllable testing conditions, VEHIL can also be used <b>for</b> the <b>validation</b> of the performance of intelligent vehicle control and fault management systems. In this paper, we particularly focus on the use of VEHIL <b>for</b> the <b>validation</b> of fault management systems for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems...|$|R
