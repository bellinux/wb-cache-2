5|$|With the bar full, {{the guys}} begin their routine, but are soon {{stopped by the}} police, who explain that due to zoning regulations, {{stripping}} is illegal at The Warsaw. Drew and the guys go before the city council, but their request is denied. Drew questions how the council can deny something without seeing it and the guys, including Lewis, decide to demonstrate their striptease routine before the council members. Their request is then approved. After performing the striptease at the bar, Drew counts out the money and finds that they have $4,800. Mr. Wick asks {{what they should do}} with the extra money and Drew replies that they should give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> that earned it. He then walks off stage and into the audience and starts handing out the extra cash, apologising for them having seen his naked buttocks.|$|E

25|$|The core of Eisa {{consists}} of nembutsu songs. The Ryūkyū-koku yuraiki (1713) attributes {{the introduction of}} nembutsu to Taichū (1552–1639), a Jōdo sect monk from Mutsu Province. According to the record, he translated Buddhist teaching into the vernacular speech and taught <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Naha {{during the reign of}} Shō Nei. Other sources confirm that Taichū stayed in the capital region for three years in the early 1600s and converted the king and other high-ranking officials. Some researchers speculate that he introduced odori nembutsu or dancing nembutsu to Naha. However, Taichū's teaching did not prevail; it was barely carried on by his followers in Kakinohana, Naha.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with convention, the Governor-General, {{to maintain the}} stability of government, must appoint as prime minister the individual most likely to maintain {{the support of the}} House of Representatives: usually the leader of the political party with a majority in that house, but also when no party or coalition holds a majority (referred to as a minority government situation), or other scenarios in which the Governor-General's judgement about the most suitable candidate for prime minister has to be brought into play. The Governor-General also appoints to Cabinet the other ministers of the Crown, who are, in turn, accountable to the Parliament, and through <b>it,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> The Queen is informed by her viceroy of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearing-in of a new prime minister {{and other members of the}} ministry, and she holds audience with her Australian ministers where possible.|$|E
25|$|Near the {{entrance}} to the departure building is a statue of an eagle's head. According to the inscription on the base, this is all that remains of the 4.5m statue of an eagle, designed by Sagebiel and executed by the sculptor Walter Lemcke, which stood {{on the roof of the}} building and was visible from a considerable distance. Contrary to the assumptions of many, it grasped in its claws not a swastika (like the eagle which symbolised the Third Reich) but a globe (like the planned summit of the Great Hall designed for Germania). In 1962 it was removed to permit the installation of new radar equipment and sent to the museum at the United States Military Academy at West Point. The U.S. Air Force returned <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Berlin and since 1985 the part of the square where it stands has been Eagle Square.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Tomašević {{was buried}} {{on a hill}} near Jajce. Europe was stunned <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> Bosnian state fall almost {{completely}} within weeks of his death. The country's quick submission is said <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> consequence of a poor cooperation between Stephen and his noblemen, but it is perhaps most accurate <b>to</b> attribute <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people's</b> low morale and general belief that the conquest was inevitable. [...] Additionally, the religiously diverse Bosnians were aware, much like the neighbouring Serbians, that {{the country would be}} overrun by Hungary if not by the Ottomans, and that they would enjoy far less freedom of religion and far higher taxes in that case. Therefore, resistance was not as strong as it could have been. Pope Pius's claim that adherents of the Bosnian Church betrayed the kingdom is groundless.|$|R

If anybody wishes to complain, he should do <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who make the rules." [...] Somerset's president, Colin Atkinson spoke to representatives from Worcestershire {{the day after the}} game and offered to play the match again, but his suggestion was rejected. The TCCB chairman, Carr, made a statement after the game that [...] "Somerset's action is totally contrary to the spirit of the competition, but is not in breach of the rules as they are written" [...] and announced that an inquiry would be held at season's end. However, due to the strength and volume of complaints, a special meeting of the TCCB was called for 1 June. At that meeting, Somerset were disqualified from the competition by seventeen votes to one. Only the representative from Derbyshire opposed it, with even Somerset voting for the expulsion. Due to Somerset's disqualification, Glamorgan joined Worcestershire in the quarter-finals. As it turned out, had Somerset played the game as normal, they would have qualified, as Glamorgan's match against the Minor Counties ended with no result due to rain, leaving them two points behind Somerset and Worcestershire.|$|E

500|$|The {{extent to}} which money or {{patronage}} affected {{the outcome of the}} election is unclear. Congressman Burton stated, [...] "I never saw any evidence of the use of money in Columbus and don't believe that any money was used corruptly." [...] In an interview after Hanna's death, James Rudolph Garfield, son of the late president and floor leader of the Hanna forces in the Ohio Senate, recalled that the senator [...] "had been asked to shut his eyes to some things. But he declined to do it." [...] However, Garfield also noted, [...] "I have never been sure as to what some of the men who called themselves Senator Hanna's friends really did do." [...] Croly believed that Hanna did not personally authorize bribes of legislators, but concedes that Hanna's supporters [...] "may have been willing to spend money in Mr. Hanna's interest and without his knowledge." [...] The biographer suggested, [...] "If Mr. Hanna had himself planned to purchase the vote of John C. Otis, it is reasonable to believe that the business would have been better managed." [...] Horner believes it impossible to ascertain if corruption took place, but if Hanna bribed legislators, it was because it was a common practice on both sides. He notes of Hanna, [...] "his career as a senator continued, but accusations of wrongdoing remain a part of his legacy well over a century later." [...] Public dismay at what was seen as a corrupt means of choosing federal lawmakers was {{a major factor in the}} ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, which took the privilege of electing senators out of state legislators' hands and gave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Karma {{system in}} the game came about {{as a result of}} the team wanting to include the [...] "judicious use of power" [...] within the game. Fox commented that they wanted to lead the player along a path of doing the harder tasks believing that these actions were the right things to do. However, without the {{contrast}} of [...] "evil" [...] tasks that were simpler to complete, there would be no means of motivating the player to be a [...] "selfless hero". The team wanted to encourage players to think about the results of not only large decisions—Karma moments in the game where Cole thinks of which option to select—but also every moment-to-moment action, such as considering the presence of civilians in the area around a battle. They arranged for the first major use of Cole's powers to turn the city's inhabitants against him, to encourage players to consider both sides. In this mission, Cole is given the option to keep a drop-supply of food for himself or to give it to the people; they found that most players would give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> but very shortly after this event, the population turns against Cole due to evidence linking him to the explosion, forcing the player to run or to attack them. Fox compared the Karma dichotomy to the differences in styles of Batman versus the Punisher; the former using precision attacks to avoid harming innocents while the latter would hurt anything in his path to complete his goal. To that end, they designed the powers in the game to reflect this nature; powers acquired with Good Karma would be more precise while Evil Karma powers were more destructive.|$|E
