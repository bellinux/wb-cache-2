Her second single, a tribute to her late father, is also meant to reach anyone else who has suffered a loss of a loved one. [...] "Sometimes I hear it and {{feel that this is}} going to touch a lot of people, and that's why it's important that no matter what's ever happened to me over my career, that I stay the course and continue to write and try and reach people who need."

[...] "His {{performance}} {{over the past}} 12 months has been sensational", said Border. [...] "He cops a lot of flak because his strike rate is {{not as high as}} some bowlers' but he's a 100 per cent man. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>come</b> down to him taking wickets but I think he can do a job for us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>come</b> with the job of being on the show and {{you have to learn to}} deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E
2500|$|R.L. Shaffer of IGN {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} 8 out of 10, taking [...] "a moment to thank The Hunger Games for {{reminding}} us how awesome Battle Royale really is" [...] and concluding that Battle Royale is [...] "a masterpiece of mayhem, violence and unfettered teen melodrama." [...] J. Hurtado of Twitch Film noted that many [...] "reviews of Battle Royale focus on the violence, which is extreme to be sure, {{and not so much}} on the humanity of the film." [...] He stated that [...] "cranking up that already elevated hormonal level of emotional hysteria by throwing these students into a real life-or-death situation is incredibly effective" [...] and that [...] "the story of Battle Royale is the story of those teenage years and just how wrong we all were about the extent of our emotional turmoil." [...] DVD Talk gave the original theatrical cut of the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and 4 out of 5 for the Director's Cut, concluding that it gives [...] "a glimpse into what might very well happen should the rules of society, such as they are, ever do crumble to the point where it's everyone for themselves. There's enough black humor here and enough tense action that the film never quite feels bleak or depressing (though <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>come</b> close) – but most importantly it makes you think." [...] Devon Ashby of CraveOnline gave the film a score of 8.5 out of 10, referring to it as [...] "Japanese legend Kinji Fukasaku’s adolescent shooting spree opus" [...] and [...] "a compassionate and technically accomplished masterpiece." [...] Brent McKnight of PopMatters gave the film a score of 9 out of 10, describing it as [...] "savage, sharp, satirical, and brutally funny" [...] and [...] "a bleak commentary on humanity and society." ...|$|E
