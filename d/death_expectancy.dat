Design/methodology/approach – After providing a brief overview of the mathematics of the mortality table, explores the reasonableness of using a simple analytic function to model the mortality hazard rate.

A text grammar is proposed based on Brown and Yule's (1983) discourse topic framework. The four parts of the text grammar are analyzed. We argue that the language of obituaries reveals important understandings of the beliefs our society holds about our lives and our deaths, especially with respect to the causes of <b>death,</b> life <b>expectancy,</b> and gender differences in our life stories.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the association between unemployment and life expectancy in the United States during 1990 – 2010. Census-based unemployment rates were linked to US county-level mortality data. Life expectancies were calculated by age, sex, race, and unemployment level during 1990 – 2010. Differences in life expectancy were decomposed by age and cause of <b>death.</b> Life <b>expectancy</b> was consistently lower in areas with higher unemployment rates. In 2006 – 2010, those in areas with high unemployment rates (≥ 9 %) had a life expectancy of 76. 9 years, compared with 80. 7 years for those in areas with low unemployment rates (< 3 %). The association between unemployment and life expectancy was stronger for men than for women. Life expectancy ranged from 69. 9 years among black men in high unemployment areas to 90. 0 years among Asian/Pacific Islander women in low unemployment areas. Disparities persisted over time. In 1990 – 1992, life expectancy was 4. 7 years shorter in high unemployment than in low unemployment areas. In 2006 – 2010, the life expectancy difference between the lowest and highest unemployment areas decreased to 3. 8 years. Heart disease, cancer, homicide, unintentional injuries, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and liver cirrhosis contributed most to the lower life expectancy in high unemployment areas.

Analysis of survival in 233 patients who lived more than 1 year (189 overweight) using stepwise multiple regression indicated as significant (p less than 0. 05) adverse independent variables: age at diagnosis, presence of clinical ischaemic heart disease at diagnosis, plasma glucose at diagnosis; and as significant favourable variables: oral hypoglycaemic drug therapy, weight loss in the first year, and an interaction between weight loss and BMI for patients with BMI greater than 25 kg m- 2.

The completeness of death reporting and the subsequent effect on mortality estimates were examined in six municipalities of Bohol province in the Philippines using a system review and capture-recapture analysis. Methods: Reports of deaths were collected from records at local civil registration offices, health centers and hospitals, and parish churches. Records were reconciled using {{a specific set of}} matching criteria, and both a twosource and a three-source capture-recapture analysis was conducted. For the two-source analysis, civil registry and health data were combined due to dependence between these sources and analyzed against the church data. Results: Significant dependence between civil registration and health reporting systems was identified. There were 8, 075 unique deaths recorded in the study area between 2002 and 2007.

40|$|Aims: Life {{expectancy}} in Sweden {{is among}} the highest in the world, and the province of Halland has the highest life expectancy in Sweden today. In an earlier paper the authors reported that life expectancy in the province of Halland in the south-west of the country was approx. 3. 5 years above the national average between 1911 and 1950. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of different causes of <b>death</b> on life <b>expectancy</b> in Sweden and the distribution of these causes of death in Halland compared with Sweden as a whole during the same period of time. Method: Causes of death between 1911 and 1950 in the whole of Sweden and in Halland were obtained from the archives of Statistics Sweden. A trend analysis was performed on the impact of the various causes of <b>death</b> on life <b>expectancy</b> in Sweden. Calendar year, age, and sex were controlled for in a Poisson model. The distribution and incidence of the most frequent causes of death were compared between Halland and Sweden as a whole. Results: The decreasing mortality risk due to infectious diseases and the simultaneous increase in the risk of mortality from tumours and circulatory diseases contributed most to the change in life expectancy in Sweden. In Halland there was a lower mortality risk in the seven most important causes of death, which accounted for approx 80 % of all deaths during the study period. Conclusions: The lower mortality risk from infectious diseases mostly favoured the improvement in life expectancy in Halland up to the mid- 1930 s. Thereafter, a low mortality risk from tumours and particularly circulatory diseases gained increasing importance although there was always a difference in favour of Halland from the beginning of the study period. Thus, the positive trend in life expectancy that favours Halland today seems to have existed for a long period of time...|$|R

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate mortality, causes of <b>deaths,</b> life <b>expectancy</b> and co-morbidities in Italian persons with haemophilia (PWH). Data pertaining to a total of 443 PWH who died between 1980 and 2007 were retrospectively collected in the 30 centres who are members of the Italian Association of Haemophilia Centres that chose to participate. The mortality rate ratio standardized to the male Italian population (SMR) was reduced during the periods 1990 - 1999 and 2000 - 2007 such that during the latter, death rate overlapped that of the general population (SMR 1990 - 1999 : 1. 98 95 % CI 1. 54 - 2. 51; SMR 2000 - 2007 : 1. 08 95 % CI 0. 83 - 1. 40). Similarly, life expectancy in the whole haemophilic population increased in the same period (71. 2 years in 2000 - 2007 vs. 64. 0 in 1990 - 1999), approaching that of the general male population. While human immunodeficiency virus infection was the main cause of death (45 %), 13 % of deaths were caused by hepatitis C-associated complications.

To further improve population health, consistent and comparative evidence on mortality attributable to preventable risk factors {{is necessary for}} setting priorities for health policies and programs. Although several past studies have quantified the impact of individual risk factors in Japan, to our knowledge no study has assessed and compared the effects of multiple modifiable risk factors for non-communicable diseases and injuries using a standard framework.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We obtained data on risk factor exposures from the National Health and Nutrition Survey and epidemiological studies, data {{on the number of}} cause-specific deaths from vital records adjusted for ill-defined codes, and data on relative risks from epidemiological studies and meta-analyses. We applied a comparative risk assessment framework to estimate effects of excess risks on <b>deaths</b> and life <b>expectancy</b> at age 40 y. In 2007, tobacco smoking and high blood pressure accounted for 129, 000 deaths (95 % CI: 115, 000 - 154, 000) and 104, 000 deaths (95 % CI: 86, 000 - 119, 000), respectively, followed by physical inactivity (52, 000 deaths, 95 % CI: 47, 000 - 58, 000), high blood glucose (34, 000 deaths, 95 % CI: 26, 000 - 43, 000), high dietary salt intake (34, 000 deaths, 95 % CI: 27, 000 - 39, 000), and alcohol use (31, 000 deaths, 95 % CI: 28, 000 - 35, 000). In recent decades, cancer mortality attributable to tobacco smoking has increased in the elderly, while stroke mortality attributable to high blood pressure has declined. Life expectancy at age 40 y in 2007 would have been extended by 1. 4 y for both sexes (men, 95 % CI: 1. 3 - 1. 6; women, 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 1. 7) if exposures to multiple cardiovascular risk factors had been reduced to their optimal levels as determined by a theoretical-minimum-risk exposure distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco smoking and high blood pressure are the two major risk factors for adult mortality from non-communicable diseases and injuries in Japan. There is a large potential population health gain if multiple risk factors are jointly controlled...|$|R
