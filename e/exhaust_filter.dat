The ability of the ventilation system and respiratory protection program to limit worker exposures was examined through air sampling during painting of F/A- 18 C/D strike fighter aircraft, in four field surveys. Air velocities were measured across the supply filter, <b>exhaust</b> <b>filter,</b> and hangar midplane under crossflow ventilation. Air sampling conducted during painting process phases (wipe-down, primer spraying, and topcoat spraying) encompassed volatile organic compounds, total particulate matter, Cr[VI], metals, nitroethane, and hexamethylene diisocyanate, for two worker groups: sprayers and sprayer helpers ("hosemen"). One of six methyl ethyl ketone and two of six methyl isobutyl ketone samples exceeded the short term exposure limits of 300 and 75 ppm, with means 57 ppm and 63 ppm, respectively. All 12 Cr[VI] 8 -hr time-weighted averages exceeded the recommended exposure limit of 1 25 g/m 3, 11 out of 12 exceeded the permissible exposure limit of 5 25 g/m 3, and 7 out of 12 exceeded the threshold limit value of 10 25 g/m 3, with means 38 25 g/m 3 for sprayers and 8. 3 25 g/m 3 for hosemen. Hexamethylene diisocyanate means were 5. 95 25 g/m 3 for sprayers and 0. 645 25 g/m 3 for hosemen. Total reactive isocyanate group [...] the total of monomer and oligomer as NCO group mass [...] showed 6 of 15 personal samples exceeded the United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive workplace exposure limit of 20 25 g/m 3, with means 50. 9 25 g/m 3 for sprayers and 7. 29 25 g/m 3 for hosemen. Several exposure limits were exceeded, reinforcing continued use of personal protective equipment. The supply rate, 94. 4 m 3 /s (200, 000 cfm), produced a velocity of 8. 58 m/s (157 fpm) at the supply filter, while the exhaust rate, 68. 7 m 3 /s (146, 000 cfm), drew 1. 34 m/s (264 fpm) at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>filter.</b> Midway between supply and exhaust locations, the velocity was 0. 528 m/s (104 fpm).

At the genus level, about 30 % of sequences from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>filter</b> were classified as bacteria of probable human origin, such as Streptococcus and Corynebacterium species.

Samples of median weight 18 g containing a median concentration of Fel d 1 of 9000 mg andDer p 1 of 198 mg were collectedby thedifferentVCsoperating for 15 min. Fel d 1 and Der p 1 levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Indoor Biotechnologies, Chester, UK) (4). The amount of airborne Der p 1 and Fel d 1 recovered by Vortex filter are shown in. Fig. 1. VC 1 and VC 2 showed lower allergen leakage than VC 3, even in absence of the PE or HEPA filter. VC 1 and VC 2 demonstrated a markedly higher efficiency when equipped with PE or HEPA filters. PE and HEPA filters were comparable in terms of Fel d 1 and Der p 1 trapping.

Methods used to achieve these aims involved: a) The construction of a test rig to measure the efficiency and backpressure of new and used disposable filters b) The testing of the in service fleet at four of BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal mines using an R&P Series 5100 diesel analysis system mounted in a trailer c) Comparison of a newer design engine with three current vehicles under mining conditions d) A detailed statistical review of all available data from the Tower Colliery Research group. Key outcomes from research conducted for this thesis are: a) The filtration efficiency and backpressure of disposable diesel <b>exhaust</b> <b>filters</b> used by BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal have been improved. These improvements, together with changes to work practices, generate potential cost savings of $ 395, 000 per annum while affording increased protection to equipment operators. b) Seven engines with unacceptable raw exhaust elemental carbon emissions were identified in a fleet of 66 tested. Some faults identified as causing these elevated emission levels were- blocked exhaust flame traps (scrubber tanks), incorrectly set tappets and worn injectors. c) Testing of a prototype 4 WD fire protected vehicle powered by an "over the road" engine as against three current vehicles, highlighted reductions in atmospheric elemental carbon concentrations of 67 90 %. Significant reductions in raw exhaust elemental carbon levels were also observed. d) A statistical review of data produced by the Tower Colliery Diesel Research group identified elevated exposures within mine transportation roadways.

Further, diesel exhaust filtration significantly reduced pro-inflammatory responses (measurement of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) gene expression and quantification of the secretion of their gene products TNF-α and IL- 8).

The exposure period was from day 7 until day 20 of pregnancy. In addition, 15 pregnant rats were treated with aromatase inhibitors or testosterone to clarify the process by which diesel exhaust exerts its toxicity. The anogenital distance was significantly longer in male and female fetuses from both exhaust-exposed groups than in those of the control. Differentiation of the testis, ovary, and thymus was delayed and disturbed. Maternal testosterone and progesterone levels, which increased due to pregnancy whether or not the rats were exposed, were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in the pregnant rats exposed to total <b>exhaust</b> and <b>filtered</b> <b>exhaust.</b> The serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level and urinary excretion of 17 -hydroxycorticosteroids (OHCS) did not differ among the pregnant groups.

The feto-placental-ovarian unit and inhibition of aromatase activity and synthesis caused by diesel exhaust inhalation might have played an essential role in the accumulation of testosterone. Since both exhaust-exposed groups showed almost the same reactions toward the inhalation, the gaseous phase must have included the relevant toxicants. Key words: diesel exhaust...|$|R

Emissions of particles between 0. 009 and 20 µm and bacteria were measured from 21 vacuums. Ultrafine (< 100 nm) particle emission rates ranged from 4. 0 × 10 ^ 6 to 1. 1 × 10 ^ 11 particles min- 1. Emission of 0. 54 to 20 µm particles ranged from 4. 0 × 10 ^ 4 to 1. 2 × 10 ^ 9 particles min- 1. PM 2. 5 emissions were between 2. 4 × 10 - 1 and 5. 4 × 10 ^ 3 µg min- 1.

Diesel engines have high thermal efficiency and thus, high fuel efficiency. They are widely used in commerce prompting continuous improvement in diesel engines and fuels. Concern for health effects from exposure to diesel exhaust arose in the mid- 1900 s and stimulated development of emissions regulations and research to improve the technology and characterize potential health hazards. This included epidemiological, controlled human exposure, laboratory animal and mechanistic studies to evaluate potential hazards of whole diesel exhaust. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (1989) classified whole diesel exhaust as – “probably carcinogenic to humans”.

Our findings show {{that all of the}} samples contained compounds that were able to induce ER-mediated gene expression as well as compounds that suppressed the activity of the endogenous hormone 17 β-estradiol (E 2). Estrogenic activity prevailed over antiestrogenic activity. We found an overall ER-mediated activity of 1. 63 ± 0. 31 ng E 2 CALUX equivalents (E 2 -CEQs) per m 3 of unfiltered <b>exhaust.</b> In <b>filtered</b> <b>exhaust,</b> we measured 0. 74 ± 0. 07 (iron-catalyzed DPF) and 0. 55 ± 0. 09 ng E 2 -CEQ m− 3 (copper/iron-catalyzed DPF), corresponding to reductions in estrogenic activity of 55 and 66 %, respectively. Our study demonstrates that both catalytic DPFs lowered the ER-mediated endocrine-disrupting potential of diesel exhaust. Keywords Diesel exhaust. Diesel particles. Diesel particulate filter.
