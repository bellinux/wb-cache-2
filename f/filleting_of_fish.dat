Petatán is {{a fishing}} village {{bordering}} Lake Chapala, the largest lake in Mexico. Most fish {{caught in the}} lake and in other water bodies {{in the region are}} processed here. Petatán houses the second largest fish processing industry in the region. The fish filleted here goes to the second largest fish market in the country, from where it is widely distributed. In this community all the fishers are male while women are experts in the <b>filleting</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> and Petatán’s economy depends on fishing. This paper explores the socioeconomic importance of women processing activities for the local fishing industry and the household survival. Although the research design is mainly qualitative and explorative, some quantitative data was obtained to show the socioeconomic impact of the activity. Fieldwork was carried out during 2015. Findings indicate that the women of Petatán have entered the labor market for two main reasons: the town depends on middlemen who buy fish only if it is already filleted and packed in ice, making women’s processing work {{an essential part of the}} value chain; and when fish-catch volumes are low women’s income becomes crucial for household subsistence. Moreover, women feel independent and empowered by being able to earn their own money, and they are known as the bravest in the region. But, this job requires prolonged periods of standing, which causes extreme fatigue, and they are prone to many forms of ailments. Despite that, they prefer processing fish than going to work in the fields in neighboring villages...|$|E
40|$|High labour costs, {{due to the}} {{existing}} technology that still involves {{a high degree of}} manually based processing, incur overall high production costs in the fish processing industry. Therefore, a higher degree of automation of processing lines is often desirable, and this strategy has been adopted by the Norwegian fish processing industry to cut-down production costs. In fish processing, despite a slower uptake than in other domains of industry, the use of computer vision as a strategy for automation is beginning to gain the necessary maturity for online grading and evaluation of various attributes related to fish quality. This can enable lower production costs and simultaneously increase quality through more consistent and non-destructive evaluation of the fish products. This thesis investigates the possibility for automation of fish processing operations by the application of computer vision. The thesis summarises research conducted towards the development of computer vision-based methods for evaluation of various attributes related to whole fish and flesh quality. A brief summary of the main findings is presented here. By application of computer vision, a method for the inspection of the presence of residual blood in the body cavity of whole Atlantic salmon was developed to determine the adequacy of washing. Inadequate washing of fish after bleeding is quite common in commercial processing plants. By segmenting the body cavity and performing a colour analysis, it was shown that the degree of bleeding correlated well with colour parameters, resulting in correct classification of the fish with residual blood. The developed computer vision-based classifier showed a good agreement with the manual classification of the fish that needed re-washing. The proposed method has potential to automate this type of inspection in fish processing lines. In addition, a computer vision-based classifier for quality grading of whole Atlantic salmon in different grading classes, as specified by the industrial standard, was developed. In the proposed solution, after segmentation of the salmon from the image scene, {{with the use of the}} computer vision techniques, it was possible to extract non-redundant geometrical features describing the size and shape of fish. Based on these features, a classifier was developed for classification of fish into respective grading classes. The average correct rate of classification was in good agreement with the manual labelling, and the method has a potential for grading of Atlantic salmon in fish processing lines. Regarding fillet grading, a computer vision-based sorting method for Atlantic salmon fillets according to their colour score was developed. The method and classifier/matching algorithm was based on the present industrial standard NS 9402 for evaluation of fillets by colour according to Roche Cards. As a result, fillets or parts of fillets, could be classified into different colour grades. This is important for the industry since different markets tend to have different preferences for fillet colour. This classification method is suitable for online industrial purposes. In addition, the method gives colour evaluation of fresh and smoked fillets in the CIELab space, similar to the L, a, and b values generated by a Minolta Chromameter, for different parts of fillets as well as for the entire fillet. The advantage of the computer vision-based method derives from the flexibility in the choice of the size of the region of interest of the fillet for colour measurement, as opposed to the Chromameter, where the Minolta generated values are obtained by interrogating a very small area of the fillet (8 mm). The method can also be used for detection of colour non-uniformities (discoloration) in both fresh and smoked fillets. A method for computer vision-based measurements and monitoring of transient 2 D and 3 D changes in the size and shape of fillets during the rigor process and ice storage was developed. The method successfully measured the size (length, width, area) and shape (roundness) of Atlantic salmon and cod fillets, and monitored changes to these during ice storage with high precision. This was demonstrated by comparison of the exhausted and anesthetized fillets. By laser scanning of the fillet, it was possible to obtain size changes in the height (mm) and area of the fillet in cross-section. The method can be used not only for size and shape analysis of fillets but also for other fish products, both in on-line, as well as off-line conditions as a tool for monitoring 2 D/ 3 D size and shape changes. The method can also be used for determination of fillet yield measured in thickness, which is an important parameter for the industry. Together with the colour grading ability, this method can also be used for full feature evaluation and classification of any fish or food product from a single image (colour, size and shape in 2 D/ 3 D). If <b>filleting</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> is done pre-rigor, care should be exercised during colour grading since transient colour changes occur in the post-mortem period. As these changes are more pronounced than those that occur during ice storage, incorrect colour grading can occur. The computer vision method developed for evaluation of colour changes in fillets during rigor, ice storage, and due to effects of perimortem handling stress was considered as the most suitable method for industrial purposes when compared to both the Minolta Chromamater and sensory analysis by a panel. A computer vision-based method for evaluation of fresh and smoked fillets with respect to bleeding was developed. This form of evaluation is important for the industry as residual blood in fillets may lead to reduced visual acceptance of the product. The method was considered suitable for the purpose of this type of evaluation. The developed computer vision methods have potential for automation of the mentioned grading operations in the commercial fish processing lines. Application of the proposed solutions would lower the production costs, while simultaneously increasing the quality of the products through a more consistent and non-destructive evaluation of these products.

40|$|Seafood {{represents}} {{the most important}} source of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) in the human diet. However, consuming fish can present risks from persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that bioaccumulate in edible tissues following dietary exposure. In farmed fish, POPs accumulate {{as a result of}} feeding diets based on fish oil (FO). Fish oil substitution can reduce POP accumulation, but also results in loss <b>of</b> beneficial LC-PUFAs. <b>Fish</b> oil-based finishing diets at the end of production can restore LC-PUFAs, but this strategy also increases POPs. The present study assessed the use of saturated fatty acid (SFA) -rich lipids to replace fish oil in grow-out feeds in conjunction with a fish oil-rich finishing diet to determine if this strategy could produce hybrid striped bass with equal production performance, equivalent LC-PUFA levels, and reduced POP concentrations. Triplicate tanks of hybrid striped bass were raised on diets containing fish oil (100 % FO), fish oil spiked with additional POPs (100 % FO Spike), or blends (50 / 50 or 25 / 75) of FO and coconut (CO) or palm (PO) oils (50 % CO, 50 % PO, 75 % CO, 75 % PO) with and without an eight week finishing period with the 100 % FO diet prior to harvest. Production performance, fillet LC-PUFA, and POP content were assessed. Production performance was not adversely affected by any of the feeding regimens. However, fatty acid profile was altered, with <b>fillets</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> consuming less fish oil having lower LC-PUFA and POP levels. Finishing yielded a modest increase in fillet LC-PUFAs and POPs, but POPs accumulated more readily than LC-PUFAs during finishing. However, harvest fillet POP and LC-PUFA levels in the experimental groups were lower relative to levels in the 100 % FO group. Replacing fish oil in aquafeeds can produce fish with reduced LC-PUFAs, and also reduced POPs. Feeding fish oil results in more rapid accumulation of POPs than LC-PUFA. Overall, the 75 % fish oil replacement feeds yielded fish with the highest ratio of LC-PUFAs to POPs.

In storage on ice, <b>fillets</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> fed the diets high in α-tocopheryl acetate exhibited significantly lower (P< 0. 05) levels of oxidation. These results suggested that increased dietary α-tocopheryl acetate could increase its flesh deposition, increase the activity of SOD and prevent lipid peroxidation <b>of</b> Sparus macrocephalus <b>fillets</b> in retail storage on ice...|$|R
40|$|Feeds rich in {{saturated}} (SFAs) and monounsaturated {{fatty acids}} (MUFA) appear {{to maximize the}} retention of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) in the <b>fillets</b> <b>of</b> sunshine bass (female white bass Morone chrysops × male striped bass M. saxatilis). To determine whether different sources of SFA and MUFA have equivalent effects on tissue fatty acid (FA) profile change, coconut (CO) and palm oils(PO) were evaluated as partial and complete substitutes for fish oil (FO) in feeds for juvenile sunshine bass. After 8 weeks of culture, the production performance of all groups was within the acceptable range for sunshine bass; however, weight gain was significantly reduced within the 100 %-CO group. Partial replacement of FO with CO or PO resulted in significant alteration <b>of</b> <b>fillet</b> FA profiles, and these changes were exacerbated in the complete-FO-replacement groups. The LC-PUFA were disproportionately enriched in the <b>fillets</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> fed the reduced or FO-free feeds, whereas dietary surpluses of 12 : 0 and 14 : 0 (CO-based feeds) and 16 : 0 (PO-based feeds) were not reflected {{in any of the}} tissues analyzed. Rather, the levels of the SFA elongation–desaturation products (i. e., 18 : 0 and 18 : 1 [n- 9]) were elevated, particularly within liver lipid, suggesting enhanced FA biotransformation activity among fish fed higher levels of either alternative lipid source. Based on tissue FA composition, PO and CO appear to be approximately equivalent in terms <b>of</b> <b>fillet</b> LC-PUFA retention. However, the digestibility and utilization of these feedstuffs must be further investigated to maximize the ability of PO and CO to (partially or completely) replace FO in sunshine bass feeds...|$|R
50|$|The <b>filleting</b> process <b>of</b> the <b>fish</b> starts {{after the}} {{pretreatment}} and trimming stage. Fish filleting is either done by mechanical filleting machine or by hand. The machine {{which is used}} for the production <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>fillet</b> has cutting knives which cut the fillet from the backbone and take out the collarbone. The filleting department and the pretreatment department are always separated from each other because ensures that workers from non-sterile pretreatment area are not coming across the hygienic filleting care area.|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{administration}} of krill meal (KR) and synthetic astaxanthin (AS) during the finisher {{phase of the}} fattening cycle of rainbow trout were studied on flesh pigmentation and quality traits. The inclusion of krill meal increased the body weight and size and decreased the perivisceral fat and visceral weight indexes. AS diet produced the highest accumulation of total carotenoids in the fillet compared to KR diet: difference was significant after 15 days of feeding (2. 55 vs 2. 14 mg/kg) {{to the end of}} trial (5. 76 vs 4. 82 mg/kg). The same pattern was observed for astaxanthin concentration with the highest values in the <b>fillet</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> fed AS diet. Fillet lightness (L*) was not affected by trout diets whereas redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) were significantly higher in fish fed the AS diet till 30 day of the trial. Hue was not affected by feeding, whereas Chroma was significantly higher in AS fish throughout the trial excepted on 45 d sampling. Using SalmoFan scale, trout fed KR diet had paler pink-red colour than those receiving AS diet. No significant differences emerged in proximate composition and cholesterol content of trout in the two groups. The fatty acid profile <b>of</b> the <b>fillets</b> reflected fatty acids of the diets administered to trout. EPA, DPA, DHA and total n- 3 were significantly higher in KR fish...|$|R
40|$|Cryptosporidium, a {{protozoan}} parasite {{that can}} cause severe diarrhea {{in a wide range}} of vertebrates including humans, is increasingly recognized as a parasite of a diverse range of wildlife species. However, little data are available regarding the identification of Cryptospo-ridium species and genotypes in wild aquatic environments, and more particularly in edible freshwater fish. To evaluate the prevalence <b>of</b> Cryptosporidiumspp. in <b>fish</b> from Lake Geneva (Lac Léman) in France, 41 entire fish and 100 <b>fillets</b> (cuts <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> flesh) were col-lected from fishery suppliers around the lake. Nested PCR using degenerate primers fol-lowed by sequence analysis was used. Five fish species were identified as potential hosts of Cryptosporidium: Salvelinus alpinus, Esox lucius, Coregonus lavaretus, Perca fluviatilis...|$|R
