5|$|Shiva– The main {{character}} in the story. He is a Tibetan immigrant to Meluha and {{the chief of the}} Guna tribe. On arriving in Meluha and consuming the Somras (a potion), his throat turns blue making him the Neelkanth of the Meluhan legend, which speaks of the appearance of Neelkanth as a destroyer of evil. The Meluhans end up believing that Shiva would be their saviour. Shiva searches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> Evil, and deciding that it is Somras which would destroy India, he declares war to eradicate the drink completely.

5|$|Shakespeare {{is known}} for {{borrowing}} plots and characters from other stories, but the source of A Midsummer Night's Dream has proved difficult to trace. There is no clear parallel to its plot {{in the literature of}} his time. However, many of its characters' names and relationships are borrowed from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Philostrate is no exception. His name is the pseudonym adopted by Arcite upon covertly returning to Athens in The Knight's Tale to work for Theseus. (A Knight's Tale was dramatised nearly twenty years later by Shakespeare and Fletcher as The Two Noble Kinsmen.) Chaucer himself took the name Philostrate from Boccaccio's poem Il Filostrato, a story about Troilus and Criseyde. Because Chaucer's Arcite adopts this identity to become a servant at Theseus' court, {{it is possible that the}} Midsummer Night's Dream character is meant to be the same person in a continuation of the story. However, the two characters have little else in common. Another candidate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> Philostrate's character is Philostratus the Elder, the author of Comus, a play which has similarities to Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E

George decides to break in, finding Susarro, Petra, and Flap (who survived {{falling out of the}} train in Shadows of the Templars) interrogating Nico about her investigations; George quickly rescues her when Flap is left on his own with her, knocking him out in the process. After the pair reveal what led them to crossing paths with each other, they decide to continue searching the theatre, looking <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the energy Bruno detected. In the process, they find two keys - one in a safe, which is made of stone and decorated with crystals, and was the energy source Bruno detected, while the other, a stone, is found in a weird chamber, within a column of energy, bearing an omega symbol on it. Heading outside, after escaping from Susarro and Petra (who had been dealing with a mysterious, hooded man), George is tazed by an unknown assailant, who takes the strange energy key from him.|$|E
5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the red paint on the silencer.

This was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer. Casts were taken of the marks on the mantel, and the marks were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact several times with the mantelpiece. The implication was that the silencer had scratched the mantelpiece during a fight for the gun.|$|E

25|$|Astronomers {{have been}} unable to observe Sgr A* in the optical {{spectrum}} because of the effect of 25 magnitudes of extinction by dust and gas between the source and Earth. Several teams of researchers have attempted to image Sagittarius A* in the radio spectrum using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). The current highest-resolution measurement, made at a wavelength of 1.3 mm, indicated an angular diameter <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> 37 μas. At a distance of 26,000 light-years, this yields a diameter of 44 million kilometers. For comparison, Earth is 150 million kilometers from the Sun, and Mercury is 46 million kilometers from the Sun at perihelion. The proper motion of Sgr A* is approximately −2.70mas per year for the right ascension and −5.6mas per year for the declination.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} radon {{is present in}} indoor air has been known at least since 1950s and {{research}} on its effects on human health started on early 1970s. The danger of radon exposure in dwellings received more widespread public awareness after 1984, {{as a result of}} a case of Stanley Watras, an employee at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. Mr. Watras set off the radiation alarms (see Geiger counter) on his way into work for two weeks straight while authorities searched <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the contamination. They were shocked to find that the source was astonishingly high levels of radon in his basement and it was not related to the nuclear plant.

25|$|A 183m (600ft) {{cargo ship}} called the MV Pacific Adventurer was {{carrying}} 60 containers of ammonium nitrate when it encountered rough seas produced by Hamish, while located about 13km (8mi) east of Cape Moreton.

25|$|The {{autopilot}} {{reached the}} limits of its programming and disengaged. After checking their circuit breakers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the warnings, the crew then reduced thrust to lower the speed. This immediately triggered the 757's stick-shaker stall alert, warning the confused pilots that the aircraft was flying dangerously slow, seconds after it was warning them that the speed was too high. The co-pilot and the relief pilot Muhlis Evrenesoğlu both seemed to recognise the approaching stall and tried to tell the captain, but did not intervene directly, possibly out of deference to the captain's age and experience. The captain then tried {{to recover from the}} stall by increasing the plane's thrust to full, but the plane was still in a nose up attitude, preventing the engines from receiving adequate airflow to match the increase in thrust. The left engine flamed out, which caused the right engine, still at full power, to throw the aircraft into a spin. Moments later, the plane inverted. At 11:47p.m., the Ground Proximity Warning System sounded an audio warning, and eight seconds later the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. All 13 crew members and 176 passengers were killed.|$|E
