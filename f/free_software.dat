5|$|In 1996, Bruce Perens {{assumed the}} project leadership. Perens was a {{controversial}} leader, regarded as authoritarian and strongly attached to Debian. He drafted a social contract and edited suggestions from a month-long discussion into the Debian Social Contract and the Debian <b>Free</b> <b>Software</b> Guidelines. After the FSF withdrew their sponsorship {{in the midst}} of the <b>free</b> <b>software</b> vs. open source debate, Perens initiated the creation of the legal umbrella organization Software in the Public Interest instead of seeking renewed involvement with the FSF. He led the conversion of the project from a.out to ELF. He created the BusyBox program to make it possible to run a Debian installer on a single floppy, and wrote a new installer. By the time Debian 1.2 was released, the project had grown to nearly two hundred volunteers. Perens left the project in 1998.|$|E
5|$|In July 2002, {{the project}} {{released}} version 3.0, code-named Woody, the first release to include cryptographic software, a free licensed KDE and internationalization. During these last release cycles, the Debian project drew considerable {{criticism from the}} <b>free</b> <b>software</b> community because of the long time between stable releases.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Bell Labs' new owner Lucent Technologies dropped {{commercial}} {{support for the}} project and in 2000, a third release was distributed under an open source license. A fourth release under a new <b>free</b> <b>software</b> license occurred in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Early {{versions}} of Slash {{were written by}} Rob Malda, co-founder of Slashdot, {{in the spring of}} 1998. After Andover.net bought Slashdot in June 1999, several programmers were hired to structure the code and render it scalable, as its users had increased from a few hundred to tens of thousands. This work was done by Brian Aker, Patrick Galbraith and Chris Nandor, resulting in version 2 of the software, released in 2001. Slash remains <b>Free</b> <b>software</b> and anyone can contribute to development.|$|E
5|$|Richard Stallman and the <b>Free</b> <b>Software</b> Foundation {{have criticized}} the Debian project for hosting the non-free {{repository}} and because the contrib and non-free areas are easily accessible, an opinion echoed by some in Debian including the former project leader Wichert Akkerman. The internal dissent in the Debian project regarding the non-free section has persisted, but the last time {{it came to a}} vote in 2004, the majority decided to keep it.|$|E
5|$|The Debian project handles {{security}} {{through public}} disclosure {{rather than through}} obscurity. Debian security advisories are compatible with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures dictionary, are usually coordinated with other <b>free</b> <b>software</b> vendors and are published the same day a vulnerability is made public. There {{used to be a}} security audit project that focused on packages in the stable release looking for security bugs; Steve Kemp, who started the project, retired in 2011 but resumed his activities and applied to rejoin in 2014.|$|E

5|$|The Debian project {{released}} the 0.9x versions in 1994 and 1995. During {{this time it}} was sponsored by the <b>Free</b> <b>Software</b> Foundation for one year. Ian Murdock delegated the base system, the core packages of Debian, to Bruce Perens and Murdock focused on the management of the growing project. The first ports to non-IA-32 architectures began in 1995, and Debian 1.1 was released in 1996. By that time and thanks to Ian Jackson, the dpkg package manager was already an essential part of Debian.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Stardock {{released}} {{a remake of}} Galactic Civilizations, which was praised by reviewers who saw the game {{as a replacement for}} the Master of Orion series. In 2004 the Creative Assembly released the critically acclaimed , which has spawned many sequels. Civilization IV was {{released a}}t the end of 2005 and was considered the PC game of the year according to several reviewers, including GameSpot and GameSpy. It is now considered one of the greatest computer games in history, having been ranked the second-best PC game of all time by IGN. By 2008, the Civilization series had sold over eight million copies, followed the release of Civilization Revolution for game consoles soon after, Civilization V in 2010, and Civilization VI in 2016. Meanwhile, Stardock released , which was considered the sixth-best PC game of 2006 by GameSpy. Additionally, French developer Amplitude Studios released both Endless Space and Endless Legend. These successes have led Stardock's Brad Wardell to assert that 4X games have excellent growth potential, particularly among less hardcore players. This is in addition to the loyal base of 4X gamers who have supported <b>free</b> <b>software</b> releases such as Freeciv, FreeCol, Freeorion, Golden Age of Civilizations, and C-evo.|$|E
5|$|MIT {{has kept}} pace with and helped to advance the digital age. In {{addition}} to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies, students, staff, and faculty members at Project MAC, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote {{some of the earliest}} interactive computer video games like Spacewar! and created much of modern hacker slang and culture. Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: Richard Stallman's GNU Project and the subsequent <b>Free</b> <b>Software</b> Foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology; the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee; the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2,000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002; and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.|$|E
