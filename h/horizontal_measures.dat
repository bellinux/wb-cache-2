This report assesses the regulatory framework for trade and investment in five areas - <b>horizontal</b> <b>measures,</b> information and communications technologies, transport services, professional services, and tourism services in Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago under the CARIFORUM - European Union Economic Partnership Agreement. The analysis concludes that of the five areas reviewed, adjustments are recommended principally to legislation covering information and communications technologies, professional services, and transport services. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the geographical {{impact of the}} recent austerity measures in Greece. Owing to compositional differences across regions, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>measures</b> are found to amplify existing disparities. It is argued that under certain conditions, relating to wider spatial imbalances in the country, this can trigger cumulative divergence processes that {{may be hard to}} address in the future. To correct this, it is proposed that revenue-generating efforts should concentrate more on tackling tax evasion and increasing tax progressivity; while the reduction in public consumption should be compensated by targeted increases in public investment. Facilitating the early release of already earmarked European Union funds can be central for such a strategy...|$|E

Results of studies suggest a low to medium efficiency of allover measures for plants and invertebrates and low efficiency for birds.

40|$|We {{prove that}} closed {{negatively}} curved locally symmetric spaces are locally characterized up to isometry by the Lyapunov spectra of the periodic orbits of their geodesic flows. This {{is done by}} constructing a new invariant measure for the geodesic flow that we {{refer to as the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>measure.</b> We show that the Lyapunov spectrum of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>measure</b> alone suffices to locally characterize these locally symmetric spaces up to isometry. We associate to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>measure</b> a new invariant, the horizontal dimension. We tie this invariant to extensions of curvature pinching rigidity theorems for complex hyperbolic manifolds to pinching rigidity theorems for the Lyapunov spectrum. Our methods extend to give rigidity theorems for smooth flows obtained as perturbations of the geodesic flows of these locally symmetric spaces. The techniques developed in this paper are focused on the symmetric spaces of nonconstant negative curvature and extend many methods used to prove rigidity theorems for uniformly quasiconformal Anosov diffeomorphisms and flows.

40|$|Horizontal and {{vertical}} measures of inequality are related through mobility. The paper {{draws attention to}} two types of mobility: quantity mobility, which refers to mobility in income itself, and rank mobility, which refers to mobility in the position {{in the distribution of}} income. Individually matched census data for earnings in Israel are used to illustrate these concepts empirically. Mobility is measured between 1983 and 1995. It is shown that earnings in Israel are highly mobile. The high degree of earnings mobility implies that <b>horizontal</b> <b>measures</b> of inequality considerably overstate the underlying level of inequality. The method of errors in variables is used to distinguish between current and permanent mobility and inequality. Permanent earnings are more equal than current earnings and less mobile. Finally, the methodology is applied to PSID. It is shown that earnings were more mobile in Israel than in the United States. Copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|E
30|$|Research {{focused on}} {{topographic}} changes has {{relied heavily on}} pre-event topographic data sets (e.g., Wasklewicz and Hattanji 2009; Wheaton et al. 2010). Some studies use the same instrumentation and apply a consistent methodology throughout the observation period (e.g., Wester et al. 2014; Staley et al. 2014; Wasklewicz and Scheinert 2015). The integration of topographic data from a single source {{with the aid of}} a repeatable surveying campaign over time has presented an opportunity to reduce the systematic errors while accounting for other positional errors and surface representation uncertainties. However, when repeatable surveying campaigns are not followed, researchers found data can possess erroneous calibration and improper error modeling (Oskin et al. 2012; Glennie et al. 2014). These inherent issues are expressed as substantial systematic errors, which lead to improper measurements when compared with the post-event data. Glennie et al. (2014) warn systematic errors must be minimized or removed prior to differencing the pre- and post-event airborne laser scanning (ALS) data sets. Schaffrath et al. (2015) identified comparable issues with both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>measures</b> from pre- and post-flood ALS data being inadequately defined from the use of different geoid models and poor co-registration of flight lines, respectively.|$|E
40|$|How to hold {{autonomous}} {{schools and}} school governing boards {{accountable for their}} decisions and performance has become a particularly pressing question for central governments in many OECD countries. Increasing complexity in education systems {{has led to a}} greater degree of freedom in decision making for many local authorities, school governing boards and schools. However despite this increasing decentralisation, central governments are still held responsible by the general public for ensuring high quality education. During the last ten years, school accountability has become a critical topic, triggered by the results of international benchmarks such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). This paper analyses trends in accountability mechanisms and processes and argues that vertical measures of accountability, that is, regulatory and school performance accountability, can be usefully augmented by <b>horizontal</b> <b>measures</b> involving multiple stakeholders. This system of multiple school accountability aims to efficiently and effectively take into account the nuanced nature and purposes of education.

For this study, the researchers used x-ray records of 217 children between 6 and 9 years of age, in the mixed dentition stage and with unilateral posterior crossbite. All the horizontal variables were traced and evaluated by the principal researcher, using the tpsDig version 2 computer program. Subsequently, a descriptive and statistical analysis was carried out, using the SPSS 17. 0 for Windows program. After analysing the vertical mandibular traces on the x-rays, the researchers found, in all cases, quantifiable differences between the crossbite side and the non-crossbite side.

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} {{the effects}} of trade, inward FDI and technological development upon the demand for skilled and unskilled workers in the UK. By focussing on industry level data panel data on smaller firms, the paper also contrasts these effects with those generated by large scale domestic investment. The analysis is placed within the broader context of shifts in British industrial policy, which has seen significant shifts from sectoral to <b>horizontal</b> <b>measures</b> and towards stressing the importance of SMEs, clusters and new technology, all delivered at the regional scale. This, however, is contrasted with continued elements of British and EU regional policy which have emphasised the attraction of inward investment in order to alleviate regional unemployment. The results suggest that such policies are not naturally compatible; that while both trade and FDI benefit skilled workers, they have adverse effects on the demand for unskilled labour in the UK. At the very least this suggests {{the need for a}} range of policies to tackle various targets (including in this case unemployment and social inclusion) and the need to integrate these into a coherent industrial strategy at various levels of governance, whether regional and/or national. This has important implications for the form of any ‘new’ industrial policy...|$|E

40|$|Currently, the {{majority}} of scientific and expert community and politicians recognize the key role of “new industry” in economic growth of countries and their competitiveness in world markets. The new industrial policy – characterized as “industrial Renaissance” – of some leading countries (after the 2008 global financial crisis) combines focus {{on the development of}} breakthrough technology and a new approach to cooperation in the framework of formation and implementation of industrial policy. The existing Russian practice of formation and implementation of industrial policy is poorly linked to national priorities and the objectives of ensuring sustainable economic growth and increase in welfare. This hampers the effective use of the country’s own resources in order to ensure competitiveness and progressive development. The author considers “national industrial policy” to be a set of measures that aim to develop the industrial sector and increase its competitiveness through the system interaction between the government, business and society; this set of measures also aims to provide sustainable economic growth and increase national welfare. Russia needs a convergent approach that combines, in definite proportions, the advantages of vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>measures,</b> because the break-up of vertical (inter-sectoral) and horizontal (cross-sectoral) relationships and the antagonism between the interests of the main actors became Russia’s specific features resulting from the chaos of post-Soviet reforms.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyEnvironmental Design and Planning ProgramTimothy D. KeaneThe {{original}} {{purpose of this}} investigation was to develop streambank erosion prediction curves for Northeast Kansas streams. Rosgen's (2001, 2006) methods were employed and eighteen study banks were measured and monitored over a four-year period, summer 2007 through summer 2010. At each study bank, a toe pin and two to three bank pins were set at a recorded longitudinal profile station of the stream. Vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>measures</b> from the toe pin to the bank face were taken each summer, 2007 as the baseline measure and 2008 - 2010 as bank change years. Bank profiles were overlaid to gain insight into bank area lost or gained due to erosional or depositional processes. A Bank Erosion Hazard Index (BEHI) and Near Bank Stress (NBS) combination rating was assessed and calculated for each study bank during the initial survey of 2007. The streambanks experienced varied erosion rates for similar BEHI/NBS combinations producing R 2 values from 0. 43 as the High/Very High BEHI rating and 0. 80 as the Moderate BEHI rating. In addition, Moderate BEHI ratings provided higher erosion rates than the High/Very High BEHI rating and curves intersected at lower NBS ratings, suggesting a discrepancy in the fit of the model used in the Northeast Kansas region and conditions. In this light, modification of the BEHI model was evaluated and variables were assessed in the model for additional influence exerted in the Northeast Kansas region. Vegetation seemed to provide the most influence to bank resistance and was more closely evaluated. Banks with and without woody riparian vegetation were then plotted against BEHI and NBS values, as banks lacking woody vegetation eroded at higher rates. This study's findings can allow us to calibrate the BEHI model according to woody vegetation occurrence levels along streambanks in the Black Vermillion watershed. Modifications regarding vegetation occurrence of the BEHI model was completed and the results of these modifications generated R 2 values of 0. 78 for High/Very High BEHI and 0. 82 for Moderate BEHI ratings. High/Very High ratings provided higher predicted erosion rates than Moderate ratings, while the curve slopes did not intersect at lower NBS ratings...|$|E

40|$|In {{the light}} of the weak {{performance}} of the Philippine manufacturing industry and the absence of structural transformation of the economy from agriculture to manufacturing in the last two decades, the paper calls for the implementation of a new industrial policy. This is crucial not only to upgrade Philippine industries, generate more and better jobs, and reduce poverty but also {{to take advantage of the}} market opportunities and face the challenges arising from the ASEAN Economic Community. Based on the sectoral roadmaps submitted by industries to the Department of Trade and Industry and Board of Investments, the paper has formulated a comprehensive industrial strategy to enable manufacturing firms to upgrade, thrive, and become catalysts and engines for sustained and inclusive growth. The long-term vision of the Manufacturing Industry Roadmap is to develop a globally competitive manufacturing industry supported by strong backward and forward linkages with both domestic and global supply chains. Through the implementation of the roadmap, manufacturing contribution to the economy would account for 30 percent of total value added and generate 15 percent of total employment. Industry policies will focus on horizontal and vertical measures and a coordination mechanism to enhance firm productivity, strengthen supply chains to enable firms to move up the technology scale, link domestic firms with multinational companies, and aggressively court more investment. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>measures</b> will cover human resource development, small and medium enterprises development, technology upgrading and innovation, investment promotion, and a competitive exchange rate policy. It will also address issues such as high power and logistics cost, smuggling, and infrastructure weaknesses. Vertical measures will address gaps in industry supply chains and expand the domestic market base as springboard for exports. A coordination mechanism will be designed to allow more interaction between government agencies and industries in identifying obstacles and determining the most appropriate interventions. The roadmap implementation will be private-sector led while the government acts as facilitator. As facilitating government, it will encourage producers to take risks, correct market and government failures, and address changes in policies and institutions. By creating the proper environment and strengthening industries, the government can promote the success of domestic firms in both the local and international markets that will lead to economic transformation. Only with the right environment can manufacturing unleash its full potentials to take advantage of the market opportunities currently facing us and become an engine for sustained and inclusive growth...|$|E
40|$|A {{literature}} survey {{has been conducted}} regarding international traffic calming measures that could have a potential use in Sweden and other Nordic countries. Focus has been on measures in new traffic environments and ITS (Intelligent Transport System) based solutions. Information has been obtained through searches in literature databases and on different homepages, {{as well as from}} contacts in networks. Initially, we describe common traffic calming measures used today in Swedish traffic environments. For example, different forms of vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>measures,</b> and different types of surfaces, road markings and paintings. In the case of existing ITS solutions, we mention speed reminder signs, variable message signs and Motorway Control System (MCS). New kinds of physical measures that have most potential for use are e. g. modifications of speed bumps and the construction of small curves that enforce lower speed. Such curvatures can be used at entrances to communities or before roundabouts. Different concepts of "shared space" (e. g. walking speed zones) are something that could be used more extensively, even at intersections and other locations in urban areas. In such cases, all traditional road equipment is removed and a synergy between different user groups is created, leading to lower speeds. Different types of road markings and paintings can be used to visually narrow the road, but also in order to create an optical illusion that makes one feel as if the speed is high. However, such measures are not fully effective during winter conditions. Applications in 3 D {{can also be used to}} create the illusion of obstacles in the roadway and result in reduced speeds. It is important to consider the overall picture and to combine various measures in a correct way. This report gives some examples on how to implement speed reduction measures in communities with thoroughfares. Furthermore, we give example on how strategic approaches and policy design may help to efficiently implement different kinds of traffic calming measures. ITS-solutions, where a two-way communication between vehicles and between vehicles and the infrastructure is used, have gained momentum in Europe and internationally. Three possible systems that have not yet been introduced on the market are described. Most of the cooperative systems are still in a research and development phase. The potential of the systems is considered to be large, and this is also reflected in the extensive research and development investments in the area. Furthermore, ITS as a whole, i. e. cooperative systems as well as other ITS solutions is believed to have a great potential...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Before any {{medicinal}} product is authorised {{for use in}} adults, it must undergo extensive pharmaceutical consistency and stability tests, toxicological tests and clinical trials {{to ensure that it}} is of high quality, safe and effective. The same approach may not always be applied to {{medicinal product}}s used to treat children. Studies showed that over 50 % of the medicinal products used in children may not have been tested for use in this age group. The absence of suitable authorised medicinal products to treat conditions in children results from the fact that pharmaceutical companies do not adapt medicinal products {{to the needs of the}} paediatric population. This leaves health care professionals with no alternative other than to use medicinal products "off-label" and to use unauthorised products with the associated risks of inefficacy and/or adverse reactions. The Regulation (EC) No 1901 / 2006 sets up a system of requirements, rewards and incentives, together with <b>horizontal</b> <b>measures,</b> to ensure that medicinal products are researched, developed and authorised to meet the therapeutic needs of children. The Regulation is addressed to: 1. The pharmaceutical industry by setting out the legal framework for receiving rewards and incentives by conducting clinical trials in the paediatric population. 2. The Member States to set out to support research into, and the development and availability of, medicinal products for paediatric use. 3. The Community as funds for research into medicinal products for the paediatric population shall be provided for in the Community budget in order to support studies relating to medicinal products or active substances not covered by a patent or a supplementary protection certificate. The legal framework for conducting clinical trials, including children/minors, is set up in Directive 2001 / 20 /EC, the Clinical Trials Directive (CTD), for the European Union (EU). The CTD establishes specific provisions regarding conduct of clinical trials, including multi-centre trials, on human subjects involving medicinal products and in particular relating to the implementation of good clinical practice. Compliance with this good practice provides assurance that the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects are protected, and that the results of the clinical trials are credible. The CTD is addressed to all investigators conducting clinical trials including clinical trials in the paediatric population and had to be applied accordingly. In the framework of the authorisation of medicinal products regulated by the Regulation (EC) No 726 / 2004 and Directive 2001 / 83 /EC as amended and the CTD, and additional implementing Directives and guidelines, the new Regulation (EC) No 1901 / 2006 is an important new piece of legislation focusing on the requirements to improve the situation for the paediatric population.

40|$|The EU drugs {{action plan}} (2009 – 12) {{includes}} wide-ranging measures to strengthen European cooperation {{to curb the}} adverse consequences of drug use and cut drug-related crime. It is conceived around five priorities: •	reducing the demand for drugs; •	mobilising European citizens; •	reducing supply; •	improving international cooperation; •	and improving understanding of the drugs phenomenon Illicit drugs are a major concern for the citizens of Europe, {{a major threat to}} the security and health of European society and a threat to living conditions worldwide. In December 2004, the European Council unanimously endorsed the EU Drugs Strategy for 2005 - 2012 (1), which aims to achieve a high level of protection, well-being and social cohesion by preventing and reducing drug use. The adoption of the Strategy in itself gave a clear signal that political concern about drugs across the European Union transcends the differences in approach that exist among Member States. The Strategy, implemented by two successive EU Drugs Action Plans, confirmed that all Member States subscribe to the same set of basic principles: {{that there should be a}} balanced approach to reducing the supply and demand for drugs, which is based first and foremost on the fundamental principles of EU law and, in every regard, upholds the founding values of the Union: respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, solidarity, the rule of law and human rights. The Strategy and its Action Plans aim to protect and improve the well-being of society and of the individual, to protect public health, to offer a high level of security for the general public. This should be accompanied by <b>horizontal</b> <b>measures</b> in which drug policy is based on reliable data regarding the nature and extent of the problem, on — increasingly — cross-border — coordination and on cooperation with and towards third countries and international organisations. The Strategy and its Action Plans are also based on the relevant UN Conventions, which are major legal instruments for addressing the world drug problem. The Drugs Strategy also provides the framework for two consecutive four-year Action Plans. The first Action Plan (2005 - 2008) (2) set out over 80 actions to help coordinate major areas of government intervention in the field of illegal drugs, covering public health, law enforcement, customs, criminal justice and external relations. While implementation is often the responsibility of the Member States, the Commission plays an active part in facilitating and evaluating the work in progress, in addition to monitoring anti-drug legislation, such as Council Framework Decision 2004 / 757 /JHA on Illicit Drug Trafficking, on which it will report in mid 2009. Moreover, guided by the lessons learnt over the past four years, the Commission is now proposing a second Action Plan (2009 - 2012) to be endorsed by the Council...|$|E
