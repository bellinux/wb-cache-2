50|$|Closed-cycle cryostats {{consist of}} a chamber through which cold helium vapour is pumped. An {{external}} mechanical refrigerator extracts the warmer helium <b>exhaust</b> <b>vapour,</b> which is cooled and recycled. Closed-cycle cryostats consume a relatively large amount of electrical power, but need not be refilled with helium and can run continuously for an indefinite period. Objects may be cooled by attaching them to a metallic coldplate inside a vacuum chamber which is in thermal contact with the helium vapour chamber.|$|E

40|$|Providing {{reliable}} power {{services to}} remote Arctic and Antarctic locations presents a formidable task. Delivery of fossil fuel poses expensive logistical challenges, especially for sites subject to restricted seasonal access. Locally renewable {{wind and solar}} energy resources help to supplement diesel and other hydrocarbon fuels, but the search continues for viable energy alternatives. Latent heat from freezing seawater or meltwater {{can be used to}} boil a high pressure organic working fluid and drive a fluid expander to generate electrical power. The extreme chill of cold polar air provides the essential heat sink to recondense the <b>exhaust</b> <b>vapour.</b> These sources provide an opportunity to generate power from seawater using glaciothermal power cycles. Ambient temperatures may fall below - 80 °C during winter at elevated interior sites, and as low as - 60 °C at high latitude ice shelf sites. A large amount of heat is released when water freezes (335 MJ per tonne of ice formed) – equivalent to energy released from a liquid water heat source with a temperature difference of 80 °C. Nett thermal efficiencies of 9 — 11...|$|E

Grease ducting is closely related and highly regulated in North America as well; its main purpose is <b>exhaust</b> of grease-laden <b>vapours</b> from commercial cooking operations, as opposed to smoke exhaust from accidental building fires.|$|R
40|$|AURAMS (version 1. 4. 0) is an {{off-line}} {{chemical transport}} model (CTM) that {{is driven by}} the Canadian operational weather forecast model, GEM (Global Environmental Multiscale model). GEM (version 3. 2. 2) was used to produce meteorological fields with a 15 -km horizontal grid spacing. GEM was run for 12 -hr periods from reanalysis files with a 6 -hr spin-up and 6 -hr of simulation stored for the CTM. AURAMS was run with a 15 km horizontal grid spacing for a domain covering the northeastern U. S. and eastern Canada and using climatological chemical boundary conditions. Gridded hourly anthropogenic point, area and on-road mobile emissions files were prepared for the CTM with the 2005 Canadian and 2005 U. S. national criteria-aircontaminant emissions inventories and version 2. 2 of the SMOKE emissions processing system. Total gasoline <b>exhaust</b> organic <b>vapour</b> was treated as an additional gas-phase species in the on-road mobile emissions stream of the emissions processing system. This species was emitted, transported, lost by gas-phase chemistry and allowed to reach an equilibrium partitioning with sulphate aerosol based on the effective uptake coefficient fi...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{monitoring of}} contamination of atmosphere with organic substances during ordinary {{operation of a}} petrol station, namely during pumping of fuel by a consumer. The measurements were performed {{by means of a}} portable analyser ECOPROBE 5 equipped with an IR detector. The analyser was calibrated using standard mixtures of petrol vapours and air as well as by means of gaseous standards of volatile portions of Diesel fuel. The calibration curves obtained were used for determination of real concentrations of the analysed substances in the units of mg m– 3. The practical measurements have shown that the reverse <b>exhaust</b> of petrol <b>vapours</b> cannot prevent contamination of the atmosphere unless the dispensing nozzle is properly inserted during filling the tank...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of <b>exhaust</b> plume water <b>vapour</b> {{concentration}} and temperature are acquired on the Rolls-Royce Environmentally Friendly Engine (EFE) demonstrator. Line-of-sight tunable diode laser spectroscopy (TDLS) measurements yield the absorption spectra of water vapour downstream {{of the engine}} exhaust, using direct measurement and wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) to recover absorption from both the high temperature plume and the surrounding ambient airflow. The annular array of 24 exhaust nozzles {{has been identified as}} a suitable platform for future tests to create tomographic maps of exhaust products. Initial field trials were performed to evaluate optical system performance in the harsh environments experienced downstream of aero engine exhaust nozzles. Beam steering in the exhaust plume and highly vibrating mounting hardware provide the greatest challenges to achieving adequate signal-to-noise ratios. The optical layout of the test bed installation and the overall experimental system is described. The recovered spectra are used to fit a theoretical signal, created using an assumed temperature and concentration distribution based on anticipated plume dimensions, showing plume temperatures up to 850 K. The presence of water vapour hot lines is also confirmed using high sensitivity WMS techniques and these are compared to lines predicted by the HITRAN 08 spectral databas...|$|R
40|$|Application of SCR {{catalyst}} {{technology in}} a light-duty Diesel exhaust system requires injection of a reductant. Aqueous urea is injected with a spray unit {{directly into the}} exhaust upstream of an SCR catalyst. Ideally, the aqueous urea droplets must first evaporate and break down to ammonia and HCNO before reaching the catalyst. Multiple chemical reactions then occur on the catalyst reducing NOx. Droplet size is thus critical in this process. Laser PDPA measurements {{have been made in}} the laboratory of the diameter of water droplets from a commercially available urea spray unit in hot air flow to characterize the spray. These measurements have shown significant numbers of droplets with diameters greater than 120 microns. Measurements have also been made with a typical mixer unit downstream of the spray unit and the effect of this on the droplet size distribution is reported. A simple model of the warm up and evaporation of an aqueous urea droplet convecting in a Diesel exhaust has been developed. This can be run as a single droplet simulation programme but could be incorporated into a full CFD model. The latter is required for designing SCR injection systems without recourse to testing. The model is valid for the early part of the evaporation process where it is assumed that water leaves the aqueous urea droplet and also for the later stage where the urea leaves the droplet prior to breaking down by thermolysis. The model has been tested against data available in the literature. The effect of initial droplet size, droplet injection temperature and velocity, and of the <b>exhaust</b> temperature, <b>vapour</b> pressure and flow rate under typical operating conditions are demonstrated. The implications of the model are that the urea droplets must be very small, less than 50 microns, if they are to evaporate in the short distance between the injector and the catalyst in a typical light duty Diesel exhaust system...|$|R
40|$|Improvements in the {{efficiency}} of combustion within a vehicle can lead to reductions in the emission of harmful pollutants and increased fuel efficiency. Gas sensors {{have a role to}} play in this process, since they can provide real time feedback to vehicular fuel and emissions management systems as well as reducing the discrepancy between emissions observed in factory tests and ‘real world’ scenarios. In this review we survey the current state-of-the-art in using porous materials for sensing the gases relevant to automotive emissions. Two broad classes of porous material – zeolites and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) – are introduced, and their potential for gas sensing is discussed. The adsorptive, spectroscopic and electronic techniques for sensing gases using porous materials are summarised. Examples of the use of zeolites and MOFs in the sensing of water vapour, oxygen, NOx, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen are then detailed. Both types of porous material (zeolites and MOFs) reveal great promise for the fabrication of sensors for <b>exhaust</b> gases and <b>vapours</b> due to high selectivity and sensitivity. The size and shape selectivity of the zeolite and MOF materials are controlled by variation of pore dimensions, chemical composition (hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity), crystal size and orientation, thus enabling detection and differentiation between different gases and vapours...|$|R
