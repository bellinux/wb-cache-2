25|$|A second platform, for an {{extension}} of the siding, or a full-blown second track, was originally planned for the station. The pedestrian bridge is wide enough for this extra construction, and the bridge's stairway {{on the far side of}} the station has a landing on the same level as the unbuilt outbound platform, symmetrical with the landing on the other side which is part of the <b>existing</b> <b>platform.</b> A ticket window was proposed to be established but it has yet to occur.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{a project}} to {{regenerate}} Bletchley as a whole, Milton Keynes Council has proposed {{the creation of a}} new eastern pedestrian access to the station by extending the <b>existing</b> <b>platform</b> overbridge across the tracks to reach Saxon Street. The proposed eastern entrance is to open out into a new station square and a transport interchange where an at-grade pedestrian crossing across Saxon Street would give access to the town centre and bus station. In the longer term it is planned to construct an underground concourse to link the eastern and western station entrances.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2006, the Department of Transport {{announced}} {{a plan to}} upgrade the station. The first phase added a down fast line platform 6, so that the <b>existing</b> <b>platform</b> 5 {{could be used for}} stopping express trains in either direction. The second phase provided an additional terminating bay platform (2A), nominally to extend the Marston Vale Line / service via the West Coast Main Line (WCML) to Milton Keynes Central. [...] This 5-car bay platform is indented into platform 1. The original platform 1 line was extended northwards from 'bay' to 'through' (becoming the up slow line), and platform 2 line is now a 'centre' terminating and reversing line, avoiding conflicting crossing movements.

2500|$|The {{station was}} greatly {{in need of}} {{renovation}} for decades and was not capable of handling peak hour traffic partly due to its narrow stairs. For a long time there proposals to restructure {{it in order to}} make the stairs and passages more usable. In the mid-1950s, the Berliner Zeitung surveyed its readers for ideas to improve the situation. As a result, Deutsche Reichsbahn announced in early 1956 that the stairs from the Ringbahn platform to the low-level platform D would be widened by one metre. However, a complete renovation of the station would be necessary after this [...] "small solution" [...] was carried out. Planning for more extensive remodelling continued. In 1957, the construction of a second Ringbahn platform west of the <b>existing</b> <b>platform</b> to relieve congestion was considered. In 1959, it was announced that the reconstruction of the railway station would begin in 1962 or 1963. This would involve the construction of a six-metre-wide tunnel below the lower platforms to connect with both the station’s entrance hall and the broad steps down from the lower platforms. Provision was made for the construction of escalators. It was expected to cost 7.5 million marks. In 1986, Erich Honecker announced [...] the beginning of the [...] "complex reconstruction" [...] of the Ostkreuz S-Bahn junction for the period up to 1990.|$|E

The new platforms opened on 15 October 2007. The underground platforms, numbered 1 and 2, are known as Perth Underground, but are considered part of the overall Perth station.

50|$|The MBTA began holding public {{meetings}} in 2012, {{with the new}} platform now to be located next to the <b>existing</b> <b>platform.</b> It will be split in two sections connected by a short pedestrian tunnel under the busway bridge; the gap will be short enough to allow all doors on a train to still open onto the platform. In September 2014, the MBTA received a $20 million TIGER grant for the project, which is estimated to cost $30 million in total. Besides the new platform, work will include lighting and security upgrades, elevator improvements, and rehabilitation of the deteriorated northern half of the <b>existing</b> <b>platform,</b> which is blocked off from use.|$|E
