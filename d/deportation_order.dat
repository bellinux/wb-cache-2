However, by 1946, he had established himself in a luxurious seven-room apartment in Park Lane.|$|E
5000|$|Two <b>deportation</b> <b>orders</b> {{had been}} issued for the perpetrator, but not carried out because Algeria and Belgium lack a {{diplomatic}} agreement under which Algerian citizens can be involuntarily {{sent back to}} Algeria. [...] The perpetrator was not securely detained because Belgium has fewer spaces in secure detention facilities than individuals for whom <b>deportation</b> <b>orders</b> have been issued.|$|R

25|$|When {{travelling}} to the U.S., {{the passenger}} must hold a valid, unexpired U.S. visa {{in order to}} clear U.S. immigration and customs. However, an expired U.S. visa is acceptable for transit when travelling from the U.S. to a third country if the passenger has not overstayed the authorized period in the U.S. and is not under a removal or <b>deportation</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
25|$|After his {{acquittal}} at {{the criminal}} trial, Al-Hussayen was still held in custody by immigration authorities. A few weeks later, he {{agreed not to}} appeal his <b>deportation</b> <b>order</b> if the prosecution agreed not to retry him for the remaining immigration charges. He was deported to Saudi Arabia in July 2004. His wife and three sons returned there voluntarily to meet him, rather than await deportation orders.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, 48,000 Bulgarian Jews {{native to}} the old borders of Bulgaria, were neither {{deported}} nor murdered by the Nazis. News of the fate of Thracian and Macedonian Jewry, sparked a strong public reaction. A delegation of Bulgarians with the collaboration of the speaker of parliament, Dimitar Peshev, and 43 parliamentarians, presented a strongly worded protest to the government. Thanks to that lobbying, the intervention of public figures with influence on the regime, and the opposition of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, the <b>deportation</b> <b>order</b> was canceled.|$|E
25|$|His {{family is}} said to have had a long history of {{involvement}} in Chechen resistance to Russian rule. His grandfather fought for the abortive attempt to create a breakaway North Caucasian Emirate after the Russian Revolution. The Basayevs, along with {{most of the rest of}} the Chechen population, had been deported to Kazakhstan during World War II on the orders of the NKVD leader Lavrenti Beria as a means of cutting off support to the 1940-1944 Chechnya insurgency. They were only allowed to return when the <b>deportation</b> <b>order</b> was lifted by Nikita Khrushchev in 1957.|$|E
25|$|Despite the <b>deportation</b> <b>order,</b> the British {{government}} {{found that}} it could not deport Stanley, because no country was willing to receive him. He had lost citizenship in his home country of Poland, which was unwilling to take him in. Due to the changes in Poland's borders since World War II, the Polish government required all Polish citizens to re-register home and abroad. Stanley had not done so, and in addition, the Polish Foreign Ministry announced {{that he would not be}} allowed to return. As a result, Stanley was rendered a stateless person, and could not be deported unless his country of origin or some other country was willing to receive him.|$|E

50|$|By 2006, many {{immigrants}} were paying people smugglers in Libya {{to help get}} them to Lampedusa by boat.

25|$|Traficant {{championed the}} unpopular cause of John Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian-born autoworker from Seven Hills, {{who had been}} convicted in Israel and sentenced to hang for having been the brutal {{concentration}} camp guard Ivan the Terrible For almost a decade, Traficant (along with Pat Buchanan) insisted that Demjanjuk had been denied a fair trial, and {{been the victim of}} mistaken identity; in 1993 the Supreme Court of Israel overturned the conviction, on the basis of doubt. Demjanjuk was later deported to Germany on May 11, 2009, after the Supreme Court of the United States refused to overturn his <b>deportation</b> <b>order.</b> Demjanjuk was tried and convicted by a German criminal court of being an accessory to murder, but died before the German Appellate Court could hear his case, thereby voiding the conviction.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of Book One describes which Armenians decide on resistance and which on {{cooperating with the}} <b>deportation</b> <b>order.</b> Bagradian camps out {{with his family and}} friends on Musa Dagh, to ensure that it is the right place to make a stand. Those who decide to resist, dig up a cache of rifles left over from the revolution of 1908, when they were allies of the Young Turks and subsequently bury their church bells, so that these do not fall into Turkish hands. Eventually the Ottoman military police, the dreaded saptiehs, arrive led by the red-haired müdir. They instruct the Armenians to prepare for deportations—- and then leave after beating Ter Haigasun and Bagradian. Instead of complying, the 6,000 Armenians march with everything they can carry, their animals and their weapons to a plateau on Musa Dagh. Bagradian hangs behind and observes the wailing women and the other graveyard folk—- who represent the old ways and sympathetic magic of pagan Armenia—- sacrifice a goat. Its meaning is propitious as well as cautionary. The chapter ends with Bagradian helping Krikor carry the last volumes of his magnificent if eclectic library to the Damlayik, the plateau the Armenians have chosen as their refuge.|$|E
500|$|In 1941, Bloeme {{attended}} the Jewish lyceum, where she befriended Anne Frank and her sister, Margot. Bloeme {{was in the}} same grade as Margot, but in a different class. In July 1942, Bloeme received a <b>deportation</b> <b>order</b> from the local government office. Her father went to the Central Room for Jewish Resettlement and found a sympathetic German who stamped the order [...] "released." [...] She returned to the high school in September, but her class kept shrinking from deportations throughout the year, to the point that only three students were left {{at the end of the}} year. By the time oral examinations were administered three weeks later, Bloeme was the only student in her class.|$|E

500|$|On 23 March 1973, Lennon {{was ordered}} to leave the US within 60 days. Ono, meanwhile, was granted {{permanent}} residence. In response, Lennon and Ono {{held a press conference}} on 1 April 1973 at the New York City Bar Association, where they announced the formation of the state of Nutopia; a place with [...] "no land, no boundaries, no passports, only people". Waving the white flag of Nutopia (two handkerchiefs), they asked for political asylum in the US. The press conference was filmed, and would later appear in the 2006 documentary The US vs. John Lennon. Lennon's Mind Games (1973) included the track [...] "Nutopian International Anthem", which comprised three seconds of silence. Soon after the press conference, Nixon's involvement in a political scandal came to light, and in June the Watergate hearings began in Washington, DC. They led to the president's resignation 14 months later. Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, showed little interest in continuing the battle against Lennon, and the <b>deportation</b> <b>order</b> was overturned in 1975. The following year, his US immigration status finally resolved, Lennon received his [...] "green card" [...] certifying his permanent residency, and when Jimmy Carter was inaugurated as president in January 1977, Lennon and Ono attended the Inaugural Ball.|$|E
500|$|When Chotiner {{appeared}} before the subcommittee on May 2, he testified {{that he had been}} retained by the firm when it was seeking to expand to California, that he had conferred with Justice Department attorneys regarding the criminal charges, and that no special favors had been asked or given. Under questioning by subcommittee counsel Robert F. Kennedy, the younger brother of committee member and future president John F. Kennedy, Chotiner also disclosed that he had been retained by New Jersey mobster Marco Regnelli in an attempt to stave off a <b>deportation</b> <b>order.</b> He testified that he never discussed his clients with Nixon, and had not used the Vice President's offices for business purposes. In a press release, Chotiner fired back at Kennedy, suggesting that he had been subpoenaed for political reasons. Denying any influence peddling, Chotiner asked whether the subcommittee counsel could [...] "explain whether any influence was used in connection with his own appointment as attorney for a subcommittee of a committee of which his brother... is a member." [...] Patrick Murphy Malin, head of the American Civil Liberties Union concurred that requiring Chotiner to testify had [...] "overtones of political harassment." [...] Time magazine summed up the hearings, [...] "At week's end two points were clear: 1) Murray Chotiner had been sought out by, and had gone to work for, unsavory clients who obviously regarded him as a man of influence; and 2) on the basis of evidence so far adduced, he had been remarkably unsuccessful in wielding any." ...|$|E
500|$|Oldfield, an Australian national, said he {{was making}} [...] "a protest against inequalities in British society, {{government}} cuts, reductions in civil liberties and a culture of elitism". Oxford number two, William Zeng, denounced Oldfield and described him as [...] "a mockery of a man", while Oxford boat club president Karl Hudspith tweeted [...] "my team went through seven months of hell, this {{was the culmination of}} our careers and [...] took it from us". [...] Educated at the Sydney Church of England Grammar School, the University of Sydney and the London School of Economics, and Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, Oldfield tweeted the day after the race, [...] "Having been deep within elite institutions I have a very good understanding of them. I protest their injustices – ask anyone that knows me". On his blog, Oldfield compared his actions to those of Emily Davison, the suffragette killed after stepping in front of the King's horse at The Derby in 1913. [...] Despite later stating he had some sympathy for both the rowers and spectators, he said he had no regrets and that he [...] "would have felt less of a man" [...] had he not made the protest. [...] In October 2012, Oldfield was jailed for six months for causing a public nuisance and ordered to pay £750 costs. In June 2013, he was refused leave to remain in the United Kingdom, the Home Office claiming his presence there was not [...] "conducive to the public good". Oldfield, whose wife is from India, appealed on the grounds that she would be threatened in Australia, and in December 2013, the <b>deportation</b> <b>order</b> was overturned. [...] Security for the 2013 race was increased as a result of Oldfield's actions, with Royal Marines, additional stewards and the Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit in attendance.|$|E
