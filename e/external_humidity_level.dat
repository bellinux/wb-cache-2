40|$|Herein {{we report}} the {{covalent}} functionalization of multiwall carbon nanotubes by grafting sulfanilic acid and their dispersion into sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone). The nanocomposites were explored {{as an option}} for tuning the proton and electron conductivity, swelling, water and alcohol permeability aiming at nanostructured membranes and electrodes for application in alcohol or hydrogen fuel cells and other electrochemical devices. The nanocomposites were extensively characterized, by studying their physicochemical and electrochemical properties. They were processed as self-supporting films with high mechanical stability, proton conductivity of 4. 47 × 10 - 2 S cm- 1 at 30 °C and 16. 8 × 10 - 2 S cm- 1 at 80 °C and 100 % humidity level, electron conductivity much higher than for the plain polymer. The methanol permeability could be reduced to 1 / 20, keeping water permeability at reasonable values. The ratio of bound water also increases with increasing content of sulfonated filler, helping in keeping water in the polymer in conditions of low <b>external</b> <b>humidity</b> <b>level.</b> © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Rattlesnakes {{use their}} facial pit organs to sense {{external}} thermal fluctuations. A temperature {{decrease in the}} heat-sensing membrane of the pit organ {{has the potential to}} enhance heat flux between their endothermic prey and the thermal sensors, affect the optimal functioning of thermal sensors in the pit membrane and reduce the formation of thermal ‘‘afterimages’’, improving thermal detection. We examined the potential for respiratory cooling to improve strike behaviour, capture, and consumption of endothermic prey in the South American rattlesnake, as behavioural indicators of thermal detection. Snakes with a higher degree of rostral cooling were more accurate during the strike, attacking warmer regions of their prey, and relocated and consumed their prey faster. These findings reveal that by cooling their pit organs, rattlesnakes increase their ability to detect endothermic prey; disabling the pit organs caused these differences to disappear. Rattlesnakes also modify the degree of rostral cooling by altering their breathing pattern in response to biologically relevant stimuli, such as a mouse odour. Our findings reveal that low humidity increases their ability to detect endothermic prey, suggesting that habitat and ambush sites election in the wild may be influenced by <b>external</b> <b>humidity</b> <b>levels</b> as well as temperature...|$|R
40|$|In Ile-Ife, it is {{very common}} to see {{quite a lot of}} local people {{engaging}} in mud bricks moulding, concrete block making, mud house construction and the bricklaying profession in general. These have particular bearing on the economy and the political situation of the people involved as in the profession there is set of rules and regulations guiding the rate and procedure for carrying out any such moulding or construction work. Considering the importance of this, the present study investigated the thermal performance of some selected building materials in the ancient city of Ile-Ife in Nigeria. The work demonstrated how a building envelope responds to outdoor conditions through graphic illustrations. This was followed by constructing three physical building models, with model 1 constructed of mud bricks, model 2 constructed of concrete blocks and model 3 constructed of cast concrete. Each of the models was first roofed with galvanised Iron roofing sheets, later with aluminium roofing sheets and finally with asbestos roofing. Readings were taken by inserting TGP- 4500 Data loggers into appropriate positions. The results showed that internal temperatures in the mud-brick and cast concrete buildings remained fairly stable despite <b>external</b> diurnal fluctuations. <b>Humidity</b> data collected also showed that fluctuations in <b>external</b> <b>humidity</b> <b>levels</b> do not affect <b>humidity</b> <b>levels</b> within the mud-brick and cast concrete structures significantly. On the other hand, the structure made of concrete blocks responded more to external fluctuations in temperature and <b>humidity.</b> Moreover, <b>humidity</b> <b>levels</b> in the cast concrete building were the least, followed by those in the mud-brick house; while the concrete block structure had the highest <b>level</b> of <b>humidity.</b> It was also discovered that aluminium roofing gave the highest internal temperature, followed by galvanised iron roofing and the least was seen with asbestos roofing. For external diurnal fluctuations, building model 3 with cast concrete gave the most satisfactory performance in terms of thermal comfort; however, building model 1 with mud bricks also gave a satisfactory performance close to that of model 3. The study concludes that building model 1 with mud bricks roofed with Asbestos is the best building model in terms of thermal comfort and affordability. The study also concluded that developing model 1 (mud bricks) in the regional setting of Ile-Ife {{will go a long way}} to developing people’s sustainably...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Amazonian bumble bee, Bombus transversalis, {{is mostly}} {{restricted}} to {{tropical rain forest}} of the Amazon Basin. Little is known of its biology, in part because its surface nests are cryptic and hard to find. Here we examine nest site characteristics, nest architecture and construction behavior from 16 colonies observed in different regions of Amazonia. We quantify structural features of the nest habitat and external and internal characteristics of the nests. We ascertain that nests are constructed on terra firme, {{on the surface of}} the ground and incorporate elements of growing vegetation as physical support. Nests consist of a thatched canopy of tightly woven leaves and rootlets, beneath which lies the brood and food storage pots. To build the nest, workers cut and transport leaves from the surrounding forest floor.

40|$|Summary The paper {{outlines}} a derivation of {{a fundamental}} equation of humidity for any enclosed space {{or set of}} spaces exchanging air {{with each other and}} with the external environment.

A number of simpler solutions for room <b>humidity</b> <b>levels</b> are given and discussed. A program to allow users to evalu-ate different hypothetical effects in the general case easily is cited. A brief discussion, using some specif-ic examples, is made of the various factors contributing to the resultant room humidity and the effec-tiveness of ventilation.

40|$|When {{a mixture}} of {{propylene}} glycol and water is deposited on a clean glass slide, it forms a droplet of a given apparent contact angle rather than spreading {{as one would expect}} on such a high-energy surface. The droplet is stabilized by a Marangoni flow due to the non-uniformity of the components' concentrations between the border and the center of the droplet, itself a result of evaporation. These self-contracting droplets have unusual properties such as absence of pinning and the ability to move under an <b>external</b> <b>humidity</b> gradient. The droplets' apparent contact angle is a function of their concentration and the <b>external</b> <b>humidity.</b> Here we study the motion of such droplets sliding down slopes, how they deform when moving at large speeds, and compare the results to normal non-volatile droplets. We precisely control the <b>external</b> <b>humidity</b> and explore the influence of the volume, viscosity, surface tension, and contact angle. We find that the droplets suffer a negligible pinning force so that for small velocities the capillary number (Ca) is directly proportional to the Bond number (Bo) : Ca=Bosinα with α the angle of the slope. When the droplets move at larger velocities they deform when Ca exceeds a threshold, and deposit smaller droplets when Ca reaches twice this threshold...|$|R
