500|$|St. Charles Bay {{is shaped}} {{laterally}} from south to north, and {{is located on}} the Texas Coastal Plain between the Lamar and Blackjack peninsulas. Its mouth opens into Aransas Bay between Goose Island and Blackjack Point, but is nearly cut off by islands and reefs that stretch across it. North of Blackjack Point to Bird Point, is an extension called the East Pocket, which forms an <b>indention</b> at the tip of Blackjack peninsula. Beyond the East Pocket are mudflats, included in the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. North of Bird Point, the shore continues northward, passing the La Punta Windmill. Further north, past a large tidal swamp, Egg Point juts into the bay, above which an inlet forms the Bill Mott Bayou. Past several more swamps, Little Devil Bayou and Big Devil Bayou are formed, separated by Indian Head Point. Past the Mille Dietrich Point, the McHubb Windmill and Bayou are found, as the bay narrows in width. The northernmost point is located slightly to the east and meets {{at the mouth of the}} small Twin Creek. A narrow strip of marshland and a dam, separates St. Charles Bay from the similarly shaped Burgentine Lake, which continues to the northeast, and is fed by Burgentine Creek. Past Twin Creek, the shore curves to the southwest to a small opening, that forms the mouth of Salt Creek. Further south, the shore is largely marsh, until reaching the rather large mouth of Cavasso Creek. From there, the shore forms a straight line southeast to the Big Sharp Point, from which a gas well can be seen in the bay. South of Big Sharp Point is Little Sharp Point, which forms on the edge of a swamp. From this point, the shore curves back to the southwest to a swamp, where a lagoon is located further inland. South of this, is the large oak tree known as the [...] "Big Tree", in Goose Island State Park. Further south are several piers which jut into the bay, below which Halls Point is formed. Directly south of Halls Point is Goose Island, back at to the confluence with Aransas Bay.|$|E

60|$|We {{were already}} rather close in; but I ordered the U-33's prow turned inshore and we crept slowly along, {{constantly}} dipping {{up the water}} and tasting it to assure ourselves that we didn't get outside the fresh-water current. There was a very light off-shore wind and scarcely any breakers, so that the approach to the shore was continued without finding bottom; yet though we were already quite close, we saw no indication of any <b>indention</b> in the coast from which even a tiny brooklet might issue, and certainly no mouth of a large river such as this must necessarily be to freshen the ocean even two hundred yards from shore. The tide was running out, and this, together with the strong flow of the freshwater current, would have prevented our going against the cliffs even had we not been under power; as it was we had to buck the combined forces in order to hold our position at all. We came up to within twenty-five feet of the sheer wall, which loomed high above us. There was no break in its forbidding face. As we watched {{the face of the}} waters and searched the cliff's high face, Olson suggested that the fresh water might come from a submarine geyser. This, he said, would account for its heat; but even as he spoke a bush, covered thickly with leaves and flowers, bubbled to the surface and floated off astern.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the third}} trial, the {{prosecution}} presented several witnesses who testified that Dean {{told them that}} Fugate would [...] "get what was coming to him". It was also revealed that Daniel Dean had borrowed a rifle from a neighbor named Franciso. Dean's own rifle was left at the Cleek Store (a gun shop at the time) in Estiville for repairs. The rifle that Dean borrowed was a large-bored rifle with a square barrel. This rifle would prove in court to be Dean's undoing. Police officers at that time examined where they believed the shot came from, and located {{what seemed to be}} a square <b>indention</b> on a rail. Police felt that the shooter sat on the ground behind a bush, and rested the rifle on the fence rail to steady his aim. When the murderer fired the rifle it obviously jumped leaving the <b>indention.</b> When the Fransico gun was placed on this <b>indention,</b> it matched. The bullet pulled from Fugate’s body had a similar weight to the bullet that the Francisco gun fired. When this gun was sent for by court officials, Dean swore that it would not shoot, because the trigger wouldn’t stay cocked. Examination of the rifle proved that Dean had fired it and that the trigger was recently tampered with. Dean's two boys testified on his behalf. Both boys swore that they were with their father on Monday morning when Fugate was shot, and therefore he couldn’t possibly be the murderer.|$|E

40|$|Wear {{in forming}} tools and contact {{problems}} between sheet-metal and tool-material are common problems in manufacturing industries and sheet-metal-parts production. In this paper recent tool material experiences are presented. Quantitative determination of wear has been performed using micro hardness <b>indentions</b> {{made on the}} tool surface prior to pressings and thereafter measured. Wear tests are performed with both model tools in a wear test press and in one case study. It is shown in this paper that: VANCRON shows equally good anti-galling properties as VANADIS 4 with TICRON treatment in model tools. VANCRON was successfully used in a production tool (case study) for 1, 000, 000 pressings without galling problems. The wear is small and production can continue further. VANADIS 4 with TICRON treatment in the same application is recoated before 1, 000, 000 parts. The method of using micro hardness <b>indentions</b> {{appears to be a}} promising way to quantitatively determine wear depths on tool surfaces. The studied wear depths are of magnitude 0 - 10 μm and the precision of the method is estimated to ± 0. 05 μm. It is possible to follow the wear already in an early stage with the method of using micro hardness <b>indentions</b> both in model tools and in production tools. It is complex to measure wear with a test method outside the actual pressing operation {{and it is difficult to}} compare the results from different test methods due to the differences in how the wear is achieved. The method with special Wear Test Press WTP is a method with result very close to the wear appearing in an actual pressing operation of heat exchanger plates. Increased depth accelerates test procedure compared to a production tool...|$|R

The analysis modeled orienting by dividing the total movement time into three periods {{in order to determine}} the separate effects of the object angular width, angular tolerance and amplitude. The results explain that the mouse wheel with physically discrete <b>indentions</b> is particularly adept at precise orienting but slow at rotating the object through large angles...|$|R
5000|$|The {{toughness}} {{of ceramics}} {{can be determined}} from a Vickers test under a load of 10 [...] - [...] 20 kg. Toughness {{is the ability of}} a material to resist crack propagation. Several calculations have been formulated from the load (P), elastic modulus (E), microindention hardness (H), crack length (c in Fig. 5) and flexural strength (σ). [...] Modulus of rupture (MOR) bars with a rectangular cross-section are indented in three places on a polished surface. The bars are loaded in 4-point bending with the polished, indented surface in tension, until fracture. The fracture normally originates at one of the <b>indentions.</b> The crack lengths are measured under a microscope. The toughness of most ceramics is 2 - 4 MPa√m, but toughened zirconia is as much as 13, and cemented carbides are often over 20. The toughness-by-indention methods have been discredited recently and are being replaced by more rigorous methods that measure crack growth in a notched beam in flexure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hardness}} of {{a material}} {{can be measured}} in many ways. The Knoop hardness test, a method of microindention hardness, is the most reproducible for dense ceramics. The Vickers hardness test and superficial Rockwell scales (e.g., 45N) can also be used, but tend to cause more surface damage than Knoop. The Brinell test is suitable for ductile metals, but not ceramics. In the Knoop test, a diamond indenter in the shape of an elongated pyramid is forced into a polished (but not etched) surface under a predetermined load, typically 500 or 1000 g. The load is held for some amount of time, say 10 s, and the indenter is retracted. The <b>indention</b> long diagonal (d, μm, in Fig. 4) is measured under a microscope, and the Knoop hardness (HK) is calculated from the load (P, g) and the square of the diagonal length in the equations below. The constants account for the projected area of the indenter and unit conversion factors. Most oxide ceramics have a Knoop hardness in the range of 1000 - 1500 kgf/mm2 (10 [...] - [...] 15 GPa), and many carbides are over 2000 (20 GPa). The method is specified in ASTM C849, C1326 & E384. Microindention hardness is also called microindentation hardness or simply microhardness. The hardness of very small particles and thin films of ceramics, on the order of 100 nm, can be measured by nanoindentation methods that use a Berkovich indenter.|$|E
5000|$|Pterophyllum altum, also {{referred}} to as the altum angelfish, deep angelfish, or Orinoco angelfish, occurs strictly in the Orinoco River Basin and the Upper Rio Negro watershed in Southern Venezuela, Southeastern Colombia and extreme Northern Brazil. The species is the largest member in its genus and specimens may have a height (from tip of dorsal to tip of anal fin) of as much as 38 cm. Its natural base color is silver but with three brownish/red vertical stripes and red striations into the fins. The species may show red spotting and a blueish green dorsal overcast when mature and when aroused exhibits a black operculum spot. Characteristic of this species is an acute incision or notch above the nares (supraorbital <b>indention).</b> All true Orinoco altum specimens show this trait, whereas commercial hybrids product of crosses to Pterophyllum scalare, that are occasionally performed by breeders to sell them as [...] "Orinoco altum", may not exhibit the trait or it may appear in a lesser degree. The true wildcaught Orinoco altum is very difficult to breed in captivity. Most altum angelfish are more frequently found in the well oxygenated, extremely soft waters of Upper and Middle Orinoco tributaries shed from the Guiana Shield Highlands, preferring a pH range between 4.5 to 5.8. These are very transparent blackwaters with almost nil conductivity. Temperature range in these waters is between 78 and 84 F. They are also found in the Atabapo River and Inirida River floodplain, down the Casiquiare and Guainía floodplain where the Rio Negro is born, before entering Brazilian territory. Unlike P. scalare which prefer to spawn on the submerged leaves of plants and trees in the flooded rainforest, P. altum prefers to spawn on submerged roots and tree branches in a moderate water current. This species is recommended for intermediate to advanced aquarists due to the detailed maintenance it requires for proper health. Pterophyllum altum is the national fish of Venezuela and an image of the fish appears on some currency bills of that country.|$|E

40|$|The complex {{morphology}} of {{an insect}} campaniform sensillum {{is responsible for}} transforming strains of the integument into a displacement of the campaniform dome and subsequently a deformation of the dendritic membrane. In this paper, {{the first step in}} this coupling process was investigated in identified campaniform sensilla on the wing of the blowfly by stimulating the sensilla with chord-wise deflections of the wing blade. Campaniform sensilla neurones were sensitive to both dorsal and ventral deflections of the wing, and thus exhibited no strong directional sensitivity to the chord-wise components of wing deformation. These results are consistent with a simplified mechanical model in which the wing veins act as cylinders that undergo bending and torsion during chord-wise wing deformation. By comparing the responses of campaniform neurones to chord-wise deflections of the wing with those evoked by direct punctate stimulation of the dome, it is possible to estimate the dynamic properties of the coupling process that links wing deformation to dome deformation. In the identified campaniform neurone examined, wing-dome coupling attenuates high frequencies and transforms the chord-wise deflections of the wing into dome deformation similar in degree of excitation to that caused by direct punctate <b>indentions</b> that are two or more orders of magnitude smaller in size...|$|R
