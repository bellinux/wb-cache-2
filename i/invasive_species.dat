5|$|Starfish {{sometimes}} have {{negative effects on}} ecosystems. Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish have caused damage to coral reefs in Northeast Australia and French Polynesia. A study in Polynesia found that coral cover declined drastically {{with the arrival of}} migratory starfish in 2006, dropping from 50% to under 5% in three years. This had an unintended effect on reef-feeding fish and the whole benthic community. Asterias amurensis is one of a few echinoderm <b>invasive</b> <b>species.</b> Its larvae likely arrived in Tasmania from central Japan via water discharged from ships in the 1980s. The species has since grown in numbers {{to the point where they}} threaten commercially important bivalve populations. As such, they are considered pests, and are on the <b>Invasive</b> <b>Species</b> Specialist Group's list of the world's 100 worst <b>invasive</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Invasive</b> alien <b>species</b> {{are one of}} {{the main}} drivers of {{biodiversity}} loss, due to their ability to disperse and cause negative effects on native species and the environment. To reduce the introduction of <b>invasive</b> alien <b>species</b> in the future, preventive measures need to be implemented, and knowledge about pathways of introduction of new and potentially <b>invasive</b> alien <b>species</b> can facilitate tailor-made measures. The aim of this project is to contribute to the fulfilment of obligations in the CBD Aichi target 9 and the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020 target 5, by identifying and prioritising the most significant pathways of introduction for <b>invasive</b> alien <b>species</b> by conducting a pathway analysis and horizon scanning. This identification and prioritisation is done for 10 participating countries and territories part of the NOBANIS network to assist them in minimising and preventing further introductions and establishment of <b>invasive</b> alien <b>species.</b> Based on the results from the pathway analysis and horizon scanning, this report presents a prioritised list of pathways of interest, general recommendations on measures to control pathways of interest, and advice on development of an early warning system for <b>invasive</b> alien <b>species.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|On 1 January 2015 a new European {{regulation}} on <b>invasive</b> alien <b>species</b> {{entered in}} force.

There is a wealth of experience on positive and negative responses of <b>invasive</b> alien <b>species</b> to forestry interventions. This knowledge should be synthesized and further developed to help prevent and manage invasions in forests and adjacent habitats and to minimize the risks of <b>invasive</b> alien <b>species.</b> We thus recommend that decisions regarding the application of the regulation will include actors responsible for, or involved in, the management and use of forests and related semi-natural habitats...|$|R

5|$|C. mutica {{are native}} to shallow {{protected}} {{bodies of water}} in the Sea of Japan. In as little as 40 years, they have become an <b>invasive</b> <b>species</b> in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and along the coasts of New Zealand. They are believed to have been accidentally introduced to these areas through the global maritime traffic and aquaculture. Outside of their native range, C.mutica are often exclusively synanthropic, being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity.

40|$|<b>Invasive</b> plant <b>species</b> can {{establish}} in diverse environments, and, {{with the increase}} in human mobility, they are no longer restricted to isolated pockets in remote parts of the world. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) in rangelands, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.) in wetlands, and tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) in riparian areas are examples of <b>invasive</b> plant <b>species</b> that are common to the United States and can be found in monocultures and patches covering many thousands of hectares. Across the world, <b>invasive</b> plant <b>species</b> like water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), cogon grass (Imperata cylindrica), and mile-a-minute weed (Persicaria perfoliata L.) have choked waterways, altered fire regimes, or caused the abandonment of farmland due to their dominating andpersistent characteristics.

40|$|<b>Invasive</b> alien <b>species</b> {{occur within}} several biodiverse regions of South Africa. It {{is not yet}} fully {{understood}} {{the extent to which}} <b>invasive</b> alien <b>species</b> affect natural vegetation. It is important to classify such species based on abundance and distribution in order to determine invasion patterns and set priorities for management within a region. Such a study was adapted for the Agulhas Plain of South Africa in the Cape Floristic Region. Eucalyptus lehmannii was recognised as the top <b>invasive</b> alien <b>species,</b> occupying both natural and transformed landscapes at high densities, > 130 % canopy cover. Acacia saligna and Acacia cyclops are the most widely distributed species, covering 41 % and 53 % of the total area. Effectively determining <b>invasive</b> alien <b>species</b> richness required the use different variables to those used in this study. <b>Invasive</b> alien <b>species</b> invasion pattern was classified into two groups, namely coastal invasion and interior invasion. These characteristics differed with regards to vegetation types and species composition. Natural vegetation within the Mountain fynbos (100 % invaded), Dune fynbos (91 % invaded) and Mountain top fynbos (99 % invaded) vegetation types were largely threatened by <b>invasive</b> alien <b>species.</b> Vegetation types largely affected by transformation include Elim asteraceous fynbos (89 % transformed) and Renoster fynbos.

5|$|As {{a center}} for trade and travel between the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, South Florida is {{especially}} vulnerable to <b>invasive</b> <b>species,</b> or species {{of plants and animals}} that adapt aggressively to conditions in the Everglades, allowing them to reproduce faster and grow larger than they would naturally in their native environments. Approximately 26% of all species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Controlling <b>invasive</b> <b>species</b> in 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) of infested land in South Florida costs authorities about $500 million a year.|$|E
