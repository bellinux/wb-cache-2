50|$|Italian Renaissance art showed {{maritime}} scenes when required, but {{apart from}} the Venetian artist Vittore Carpaccio there were few artists in this or the next century who often returned to such scenes, or did so with special sensitivity. Carpaccio's scenes show Venetian canals or docksides; there are several arrivals and departures in his Legend of Saint Ursula. In the German-speaking lands, Konrad Witz's Miraculous <b>Draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fishes</b> (1444) is both the first landscape painting to show a recognisable rural location, and an atmospheric view across Lake Geneva.|$|R

In that year all the preliminary drawings were finished, and Holloway retired with his associates to Edgefield in Norfolk, and later to Coltishall, near Norwich, to pursue their work on the plates, of which the fifth, The Miraculous <b>Draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fishes,</b> was issued in 1824. This was the last that Holloway lived to complete.|$|R
50|$|Witz is {{most famous}} for {{painting}} three altarpieces, {{all of which}} survive only partially. The earliest is the Heilspiegel Altarpiece of about 1435 (today mostly in the Kunstmuseum, Basel, with isolated panels in other collections). The next is the Altarpiece of the Virgin (c. 1440), which {{has been associated with}} panels now in Basel, Nuremberg, and Strasbourg (Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame). Witz's final altarpiece is the St. Peter Altarpiece of 1444, painted for St. Peter's Cathedral, Geneva, and now in the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire, Geneva, which contains his most famous composition, the Miraculous <b>Draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fishes.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Originally, {{the school}} {{provided}} education for 153 children of [...] "all nacions and countries indifferently", primarily {{in literature and}} etiquette.

50|$|For the Delaj family, {{starting}} in 1688, Celesti and his studio began painting {{a series of}} religious canvases for the Cathedral of Peter and Paul in Toscolano {{on the shores of}} Lake Garda. The initial canvases included the Vocation of Paul and Andrew, St Paul liberated from prison, the Death of Simon Magus, the Keys given to St Peter, a Martyrdom of Saints, the Miraculous <b>Draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fishes,</b> St Peter heals the sick. He painted the canvases of the presbytery, including an Annunciation, Adoration by Magi and Adoration by the Shepherds. In 1700, he returned to Toscolano to paint a Massacre of the Innocents for the space behind the facade. In 1708, he returned to paint for the chorus, Evangelists in the lunettes and an Exaltation of the Eucharist.|$|R
5000|$|The great mass {{of works}} that he executed, chiefly in Paris, many of which, {{including}} his celebrated Miraculous <b>Draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fishes</b> (engraved by Jean Audran) {{are now in}} the Louvre, show his fertility in invention and execution, and also that he possessed in a high degree that general dignity of arrangement and style which distinguished the school of Le Brun. Anthony Blunt found in Jouvenet's manner reminiscences of Poussin, Le Sueur, and the late work of Raphael, but with a characteristic Baroque emotionalism that [...] "is still far from the full Baroque ... His compositions are primarily planned as high reliefs, and the movements are in sharp diagonal straight lines rather than in curves." [...] The naturalism of Jouvenet's style sets his work apart from most of the religious painting of his time.|$|R
2500|$|The {{distinctive}} background view across Lake Geneva to the Le Môle peak in The Miraculous <b>Draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fishes</b> by Konrad Witz (1444) {{is often}} cited as the first Western rural landscape to show a specific scene. The landscape studies by Dürer clearly represent actual scenes, which can be identified in many cases, and were at least partly made on the spot; the drawings by Fra Bartolomeo also seem clearly sketched from nature. Dürer's finished works seem generally to use invented landscapes, although the spectacular bird's-eye view in his engraving Nemesis shows an actual view in the Alps, with additional elements. Several landscapists {{are known to have}} made drawings and watercolour sketches from nature, but the evidence for early oil painting being done outside is limited. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood made special efforts in this direction, {{but it was not until}} the introduction of ready-mixed oil paints in tubes in the 1870s, followed by the portable [...] "box easel", that painting en plein air became widely practiced.|$|R
50|$|He first apprenticed with painter Cesare Baglioni. By {{the early}} 17th century, Spada was active, {{together}} with Girolamo Curti, {{as a member}} of a team specializing in decorative quadratura painting in Bologna. His early independent canvases reflect a mannerist style akin to the Flemish Denis Calvaert who resided in Bologna. In 1604 he made an unsuccessful bid for the commission to decorate the sacristy of the Basilica of Santa Maria di Loreto. By then he had already gravitated to the Carracci Academy, having contributed to the decorations for the funeral of Agostino Carracci in 1603. His earliest surviving major painting, the altarpiece of the Virgin and Saints Dominic & Francis Interceding with Christ (1604), shows that he had modeled his style on that of Ludovico Carracci. He frequently collaborated with other students of Ludovico, especially Francesco Brizio and remained in Bologna until 1607. Spada’s figurative style gradually became more robust, as shown by the Miraculous <b>Draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fishes</b> (1607).|$|R
5000|$|Harold Wethey {{regards the}} {{painting}} as a [...] "masterpiece of extraordinary originality". The powerful {{effect of the}} painting especially depends upon his original and forceful use of colour. Something {{of the effect of}} the grand images of the Saviour in Byzantine art is recalled; by this date the disrobing was a rare subject in Western art. [...] The motif of the crowding round Christ suggests an acquaintance with the works of Northern artists, like Bosch (the best collection of whose works belonged to Philip II); the figure preparing the Cross could be derived from the similar figure bending forward in Raphael's tapestry and cartoon <b>of</b> the Miraculous <b>Draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fishes,</b> which he would have known from Rome. This is, however, the last time that there are any hints of specific borrowings. The original altar of gilded wood that El Greco designed for the painting has been destroyed, but his small sculptured group of the Miracle of St. Ildefonso still survives on the lower center of the frame.|$|R

5000|$|There are two screens, each a {{memorial}} {{to one of the}} World Wars. The stained glass in the windows is by Shrigley and Hunt.

[...] Another window, known as the Parkin Window or the Golfers' Window, includes depictions of golfers with their golf bags and Liverpool landmarks. [...] The ring consists of eight bells. Six of these were cast in 1911 by John Warner & Sons, and the other two date from 1977 and were cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. [...] The three-manual pipe organ was made in 1911 by John Nicholson of Worcester.
