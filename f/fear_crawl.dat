5000|$|One of Melissa’s {{abilities}} is {{what she}} calls a “mind rip”. Melissa has the ability to enter someone’s psyche and force them to go insane, {{to the point where they}} cannot take care of themselves and are left completely incompetent. She once accidentally did this to Rex's father when he gave Rex beatings and let spiders (Rex's greatest <b>fear)</b> <b>crawl</b> all over him in attempt to make him a [...] "man".|$|E

6000|$|The yellow water, {{thick as}} pap, [...] Is {{crawling}}, crawling to the thwarts, [...] And as they mark its upward lap, [...] So <b>fear</b> goes <b>crawling</b> up their hearts.|$|R

60|$|This {{put me in}} a great <b>fear,</b> and I <b>crawled</b> {{under cover}} of the nearest live-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse.|$|R
50|$|Finding Honey and Harry, Harry hides {{under the}} desk in pure <b>fear.</b> He <b>crawls</b> away, feeling more scared then he has ever felt; Nancy is back for revenge. Trying not to scream or cry, he runs to his car. Nancy follows him and dumps him in her hand. Capturing Harry, she flees into the desert with National Guard {{helicopters}} pursuing her. Stopped by some high voltage power lines and confronted by her father and the authorities, she asserts herself and announces her father's ambitions to buy out the town using her money.|$|R
50|$|The Sydney Morning Herald said:The author {{makes no}} better than commonplace use of the clever idea... playwright and play could have been helped by clevered hints of the general heat malaise, <b>crawling</b> <b>fear</b> and eginess of jungle {{fighting}} from producer Christopher Muir, whose imagination never rose above neat routine. The cast performed creditably, powerful or rich playing being excluded {{for the most part}} by flat, everyday commonplace of the dialogue... Paul Karo's portrait... was much too overdone to be convincing, but there was much conviction in the performance of young and intense Denis Miller and sufficient conviction in the work of his more experienced co players.|$|R
50|$|Sara Linton is the {{pediatrician}} and coroner {{for the town}} of Heartsdale, in rural Grant County, Georgia. She was born in Heartsdale at the Grant Medical Center {{and grew up in}} the town. An excellent student, in middle school she developed an interest in science and was able to get college-level tutoring from some of the professors at the local technological university. Sara went to Robert E. Lee High School, where, due to her intelligence and hard work, she finished a year early. She spent her teenage summers working for her father's plumbing business, Linton & Daughters, and as a result is still an accomplished plumber. She could have gone into the family business but a <b>fear</b> of spider-ridden <b>crawl</b> spaces and the desire for challenge took her off to school amid the bright lights and big city excitement of Atlanta.|$|R
6000|$|A one-legged, one-armed, one-eyed man, [...] A {{bundle of}} rags upon a crutch, [...] Stumbled on windy Cruachan [...] Cursing the wind. It {{was as much}} [...] As the one sturdy leg could do [...] To keep him upright while he cursed. [...] He had counted, where long years ago [...] Queen Maeve's nine Maines had been nursed, [...] A pair of lapwings, one old sheep [...] And not a house to the plain's edge, [...] When close to his right hand a heap [...] Of grey stones and a rocky ledge [...] Reminded {{him that he could}} make, [...] If he but shifted a few stones, [...] A shelter till the {{daylight}} broke. [...] But while he fumbled with the stones [...] They toppled over; 'Were it not [...] I have a lucky wooden shin [...] I had been hurt'; and toppling brought [...] Before his eyes, where stones had been, [...] A dark deep hole in the rock's face. [...] He gave a gasp and thought to run, [...] Being certain it was no right place [...] But the Hell Mouth at Cruachan [...] That's stuffed with all that's old and bad, [...] And yet stood still, because inside [...] He had seen a red-haired jolly lad [...] In some outlandish coat beside [...] A ladle and a tub of beer, [...] Plainly no phantom by his look. [...] So with a laugh at his own <b>fear</b> [...] He <b>crawled</b> into that pleasant nook. [...] Young Red-head stretched himself to yawn [...] And murmured, 'May God curse the night [...] That's grown uneasy near the dawn [...] So that it seems even I sleep light; [...] And who are you that wakens me? [...] Has one of Maeve's nine brawling sons [...] Grown tired of his own company? [...] But let him keep his grave for once [...] I have to find the sleep I have lost.' [...] And then at last being wide awake, [...] 'I took you for a brawling ghost, [...] Say what you please, but from day-break [...] I'll sleep another century.' [...] The beggar deaf to all but hope [...] Went down upon a hand and knee [...] And took the wooden ladle up [...] And would have dipped it in the beer [...] But the other pushed his hand aside, [...] 'Before you have dipped it in the beer [...] That sacred Goban brewed,' he cried, [...] 'I'd have assurance that you are able [...] To value beer--I will have no fool [...] Dipping his nose into my ladle [...] Because he has stumbled on this hole [...] In the bad hour before the dawn. [...] If you but drink that beer and say [...] I will sleep until the winter's gone, [...] Or maybe, to Midsummer Day [...] You will sleep that length; and at the first [...] I waited so for that or this-- [...] Because the weather was a-cursed [...] Or I had no woman there to kiss, [...] And slept for half a year or so; [...] But year by year I found that less [...] Gave me such pleasure I'd forgo [...] Even a half hour's nothingness, [...] And when at one year's end I found [...] I had not waked a single minute, [...] I chose this burrow under ground. [...] I will sleep away all Time within it: [...] My sleep were now nine centuries [...] But for those mornings when I find [...] The lapwing at their foolish cries [...] And the sheep bleating at the wind [...] As when I also played the fool.' [...] The beggar in a rage began [...] Upon his hunkers in the hole, [...] 'It's plain that you are no right man [...] To mock at everything I love [...] As if it were not worth the doing. [...] I'd have a merry life enough [...] If a good Easter wind were blowing, [...] And though the winter wind is bad [...] I should not be too down in the mouth [...] For anything you did or said [...] If but this wind were in the south.' [...] But the other cried, 'You long for spring [...] Or that the wind would shift a point [...] And do not know that you would bring, [...] If time were suppler in the joint, [...] Neither the spring nor the south wind [...] But the hour when you shall pass away [...] And leave no smoking wick behind, [...] For all life longs for the Last Day [...] And there's no man but cocks his ear [...] To know when Michael's trumpet cries [...] That flesh and bone may disappear, [...] And souls as if they were but sighs, [...] And there be nothing but God left; [...] But I alone being blessed keep [...] Like some old rabbit to my cleft [...] And wait Him in a drunken sleep.' ...|$|R
