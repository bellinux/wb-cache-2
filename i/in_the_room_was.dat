5|$|The dining room, on {{the other}} hand, saw {{extensive}} remodeling in 1895. The room size was increased by {{the construction of a}} bay window, parquet floor was installed, and the room was decorated in cherry woodwork, with a gilt and crystal chandelier and sconces. The only original item remaining left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> the fireplace mantel. The Pink Room, named for the pink damask which covered the walls in 1895, the library, the Best Chamber (Daisy Grubb's bedroom), was also extensively remodeled.|$|E
5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E
5|$|The Third of May {{is cited}} as an {{influence}} on Pablo Picasso's 1937 Guernica, which shows {{the aftermath of the}} Nazi German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. An exhibition in 2006 at the Prado and the Reina Sofía showed The Third of May, Guernica, and the Execution of the Emperor Maximilian in the same room. Also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> Picasso's Massacre in Korea, painted in 1951 during the Korean War—an even more direct reference to the composition of The Third of May. The perpetrators in this painting were intended to be the United States Army or their United Nations allies.|$|E

Smaller still lifes were used to frame the larger pictures.|$|E
25|$|The Portrait Hall is {{a formal}} {{apartment}} covering 100 square meters. The room's walls boast large formal portraits of Empress Catherine I and Empress Elizabeth Petrovna, {{as well as}} paintings of Natalya Alexeyevna, sister of Peter the Great, and Empress Catherine II. The inlaid floors of the hall contain precious woods. The Drawing Room of Alexander I was designed between 1752 and 1756 and belonged to the Emperor's private suite. The drawing room stood out {{from the rest of}} the formal rooms in the palace due to the fact that the walls were covered in Chinese silk. Other decor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> typical for the palace's formal rooms−a ceiling mural and gilded carvings.

25|$|During the Clinton {{administration}} the Committee for the Preservation of the White House {{and then}} Curator of the White House Betty Monkman began initial assessment for the refurbishment of the room. While {{most of the}} furniture and artwork <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> found to be of similar related periods, and much {{was associated with the}} presidency of Lincoln, the room's carpeting, mantel and anemic painted walls were not of the period. Initial decisions were made to replace the existing Neoclassical mantel with a mid-19th-century style mantel design, and to use more pattern as would have been used in Lincoln's day for the wallpaper and carpet. Two etchings and a drawing consistently showed a diamond patterned wallpaper and a Renaissance Revival style gas chandelier. A small oil painting showed a color representation of the same diamond patterned wall paper in dark green, mustard and teal.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Bryson's escape, Berdella was arrested on charges pertaining to the sexual assault of Christopher Bryson. He declined to allow officers inside his home, and the search warrant earlier requested was drafted to search his property. Corroborating Bryson's claims to have been restrained and tortured in a second floor bedroom, investigators discovered the bedroom {{on the second floor}} was found to have burnt ropes attached to the posts {{at the foot of the}} bed. Also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> an electrical transformer, plugged into a wall, and with wires leading to the bed. A metal tray containing syringes, small bottles apparently containing prescription drugs, swabs, and eye drops was also close to the bed. Also found in the room were a long iron pipe, various lengths of rope, and leather belts. Investigators also noted that although Bryson's restraints had been tied to posts at each corner of the bed, other posts on the bed had been extensively worn, suggesting that restraints had earlier been tied to these posts, and that the individual or individuals had struggled to free themselves.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} floor are located the parlor, the library, two dining rooms, and the kitchen. One of the dining rooms {{is located in the}} western wing, off of the hallway, and was used {{primarily}} used by the family for smaller meals like breakfast or tea. The kitchen is also in the wing, directly adjacent to the dining room. The other dining room, located in the front western side of the main house, was used only for formal dinners and as the sitting room where the men would converse after dinner. The fireplace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> enclosed in marble when Buchanan bought Wheatland and had a furnace installed. Across the hall, {{on the other side of}} the main house is the parlor, where the women guests would congregate after dinner. The library is located off the hallway in the east wing. The woodwork, doors, a bookcase, and a bookshelf built into the wall were grained to resemble oak. The shelves in the bookshelf no longer exist; but, the backboard of the bookshelf is visible, as is the plaster wall made to resemble wood. Two mahogany bookcases, flanking the fireplace in the library, were furnished by Jenkins and having been sold to each successive owner by the previous one. The library was primarily used by Buchanan as the place to meet with guests.|$|E

For three months after that Adams practiced various shots each day, and some of the shots he developed during that time became part of his regular exhibition repertoire.|$|E

Bosbyshell recalled Lincoln, [...] "yes, here, towering over all <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> the great central figure of the war.

2500|$|One Day is a sparse, tersely written {{narrative}} {{of a single}} day of the ten-year labor camp imprisonment of a fictitious Soviet prisoner, Ivan Denisovich Shukhov. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had first-hand experience in the Gulag system, having been imprisoned from 1945 to 1953 for writing derogatory comments in letters to friends about {{the conduct of the}} war by Joseph Stalin, whom he referred to by epithets [...] such as [...] "the master" [...] and [...] "the boss". Solzhenitsyn claimed the prisoners wept when news of Stalin's death reached them. He uses the epithet [...] "old man whiskers" [...] in his novel, where it is translated as [...] "Old Whiskers" [...] or [...] "Old Man Whiskers". This title was considered offensive and derogatory, but prisoners were free to call Stalin whatever they liked: [...] "Somebody <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> bellowing: 'Old Man Whiskers won't ever let you go! He wouldn't trust his own brother, let alone a bunch of cretins like you!" [...] Drafts of stories found in Solzhenitsyn's map case were used to incriminate him (Frangsmyr, 1993).|$|E
2500|$|The East Room was radically redecorated in 1873 {{during the}} {{administration}} of Ulysses S. Grant. Architects Orville Babcock (Commissioner of Public Buildings and Grounds), Richard Ezdorf, William J. McPherson, and Alfred Mullett were faced with both a decorative and structural task. The heavy walls above the East Room as well as inadequate structural support had caused the ceiling to sag appreciably. Furthermore, the Grants wanted to renovate the East Room into a far more modern space reflective of their Midwest tastes. The architects added new load-bearing beams across the ceiling, which made the room appear to be much lower in height. Corinthian columns were added to support these beams. To integrate the beams into the room, they extended the 1815 freize decoratively across the beams. The ceiling, divided into three sections by the beams, was refrescoed as well. Elaborately carved new fireplaces painted in white and gold replaced the simpler 1829 fireplaces. To help integrate the load-bearing columns into the room, white and gold painted pilasters {{were added to the}} room. White-painted carved paneling with Greek Revival designs; massive, low-hanging, cut-glass chandeliers (replacing those which had hung since 1834); pearl gray and gilt wallpaper, and wall-to-wall carpeting in a floral pattern completed the redecoration. Much of the furniture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> sold at public auction (a common and unremarkable practice until the 20th century). The architects called the style [...] "Pure Greek", and architectural historian Patrick Phillips-Schrock called it [...] "sumptuous", but it was widely derided as [...] "Steamboat Gothic". Nellie Grant's lavish wedding took place in the East Room on May 21, 1874.|$|E
2500|$|During the Truman White House {{reconstruction}} {{that began}} in 1949, the East Room {{was found to be}} in very poor condition. Previous renovations had seriously damaged the interior walls. In one [...] section of wall, no fewer than five doors had been cut through the masonry, severely weakening it. Paneling, windows, and furnishings were dismantled, numbered, and stored. Although great care was taken in removing the plasterwork, {{there was no way to}} avoid cracking it during removal. Molds were made from the originals, and new plasterwork installed. Even so, architect Lorenzo Winslow simplified many of the designs before they were cast, allegedly to make them look less Renaissance Revival and more [...] "American". Less care was taken in removing the woodwork, some of which was damaged when pried loose. Other pieces were too brittle to be reused, and what could be reused had to be restored (often by removing many layers of paint). But by late 1951, with the White House renovation months behind, costs soaring, and President Truman demanding that the work be sped up, workers found it easier to machine new pieces than restore old wood. All of the paneling for the East Room was condemned as unfit for reuse, whether it was actually unusable or not, and replaced with new wood. (Although some of the East Room woodwork would be chopped up for souvenirs, most of it was used as landfill at Fort Myer in Arlington County, Virginia.) The new panelling was also simpler and had considerably less presence, and was covered in a somewhat lighter color than the 1902 paint. A simpler crown molding and ceiling medallions were also installed. The Herter pilasters and Piccirilli marble panels were either lost or too damaged to be reused during removal, and their fate remains unclear. To cut costs, the replacement entablature was made of a composite glue and sawdust mixture pressed into forms rather than carved from wood. While the feeling was similar, the robust architectural effect was diminished. Red marble mantels were installed, and the remaining Venetian window <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> narrowed to help create the [...] "American" [...] feel. (The 1902 mantels were given away.) The East Room's chandeliers were rewired and cleaned. The size of the large chandeliers was reduced by several inches, assuming their correct size ( [...] wide and [...] high). They were also outfitted with softer internal illumination, and the chains holding the chandeliers shortened. The East Room also had a new parquet floor in a style taken from a design at the Palace of Fontainebleau, and silk curtains over the windows.|$|E
