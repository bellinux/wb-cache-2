2500|$|Star-like waxy {{flowers are}} {{produced}} on [...] inflorescences {{arising from the}} stem from June to September in the wild with most flowers wilting by August. When cultivated in Europe however, the plant flowers between December and January. This flowering habit is what lends the orchid several of its common names, such as [...] "Comet orchid" [...] due {{to the shape of}} its flower and [...] "Christmas orchid" [...] due to the timing of its flowering. Each flower opens up with a green coloration, but eventually turns white with tones of light green. The amount of green in each flower can vary from plant to plant. It is claimed that the age-dependent color change is more pronounced in wild A.sesquipedale than in greenhouse-grown plants. The sepals tend to stay green for a longer time than the petals. As the flower ages further it goes from white to yellowish and then from orange to brown as it begins to wilt. As the wilting progresses the <b>dorsal</b> <b>sepal</b> bends down and then the lateral sepals bend inward with the lip remaining fairly stationary. Finally the entire flower closes in on itself. A distinctive feature of the flowers is that they have a long green spur attached. The spur of the flower is [...] from its tip to the tip of the flower's lip. The specific epithet sesquipedale is Latin for [...] "one-and-a-half-feet-long," [...] referring to the distance between the end of the spur and {{the very top of the}} <b>dorsal</b> <b>sepal.</b> At the end of the spur is a small amount of nectar usually about 40–300µl in volume. In general, longer spurs tend to have greater concentrations of nectar. This nectar fills the spur up to within [...] from the bottom of the spur. The nectar has been found to contain the sugars fructose, sucrose, glucose, and raffinose. The flowers produce an extremely intense spicy scent that can easily fill a room; this fragrance is only present during the night and is reminiscent of lily and some nocturnally flowering Nicotiana species. The scent has been found to be composed of approximately 39 different chemical constituents with its greatest concentration consisting of isovaleraldoxime, methyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, isovaleronitrile, benzyl benzoate, phenylethyl alcohol, isovaleraldehyde, and phenylacetaldoxime. Usually 1 to 5 flowers are produced at a time.|$|E

40|$|Phalaenopsis is {{the most}} {{important}} economic crop in the Orchidaceae family. There are currently numerous beautiful and colorful Phalaenopsis flowers, but only a few species of Phalaenopsis have an aroma. This study reports the analysis volatile components present in P. Nobby’s Pacific Sunset by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results show that the optimal extraction conditions were obtained by using a DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber. A total of 31 compounds were identified, with the major compounds being geraniol, linalool and α-farnesene. P. Nobby’s Pacific Sunset had the highest odor concentration from 09 : 00 to 13 : 00 on the eighth day of storage. It was also found that in P.

40|$|AbstractThe Caesalpinioideae {{are widely}} {{variable}} in their floral ontogeny, and among caesalpinioids, {{members of the}} polyphyletic tribe Cassieae are particularly diverse. Within the Cassieae, the monophyletic Dialiinae clade is also marked by {{a high degree of}} organ loss, particularly in the largest genus, Dialium. The purpose of this work is to explore the ontogeny of several previously undocumented species of the diverse Dialiinae clade, with the goal of building a more complete picture of floral development and evolution in this group and especially within Dialium. We have documented the floral ontogeny of six species of the Dialiinae; four from Dialium, as well as Poeppigia procera and Mendoravia dumaziana. Mode and timing of organ initiation were mostly consistent across the Dialium species studied. With the exception of Dialium dinklagei, which undergoes helical calyx initiation, all flowers initiated sepals bidirectionally. In the instances of both gains and losses of floral organs in Dialium, one trend is apparent — an absence of abaxial organs. Gains in both sepals and stamens occur in the adaxial median position, while stamens and petals which are lost are always the ventral-most organs. Organ initiation in Poeppigia and Mendoravia is unlike that seen in Dialium. Poeppigia shows a ventral to <b>dorsal</b> unidirectional <b>sepal</b> initiation, while both Poeppigia and Mendoravia display near-synchronous initiation of the corolla and staminal whorls. The taxa examined here exemplify the apparent lack of developmental canalisation seen in caesalpinioid legumes. This ontogenetic plasticity is reflective of the morphological diversity shown by flowers across the subfamily, representing what has been described as an “experimental” phase in legume floral evolution...|$|R
