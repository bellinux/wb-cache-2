50|$|When {{the line}} is {{assembled}} to the correct length, the operator presses down on a lever which raises the assembling elevator up into the <b>delivery</b> <b>channel</b> and starts the automatic casting cycle. The <b>delivery</b> <b>channel</b> transfers the matrices out of the assembler and into the first elevator. The first elevator then descends to a position {{in front of the}} mold, and if the elevator has not descended fully by the time the machine starts the process of aligning the matrices (most often caused by a ‘tight’ line), the first of the two safeties - the vise automatic - brings the machine to a full stop before the supporting lugs on the matrices are crushed by the mold. Once the matrices are in proper position, two actions take place in sequence: the matrices are aligned vertically and face-wise while a bar rises from below to force the movable sleeves on the space bands upwards to cause them to fill out the line to the exact width of the mold. If the justification bar has made a full cycle and {{the line is}} still not fully justified, the second safety - the pump stop - prevents the plunger in the metal pot from going down. The space bands were an important feature of this machine, providing automatic justification of each line by equally adjusting the white space between each word. Since the type used was proportional and not fixed in width, solving this justification problem mechanically was very important. Some later models had a feature that permitted the lines to be cast with the alignment to either left, right or centered. Operators running earlier models would use special ‘blank’ matrices (in 4 sizes) to manually create the proper amount of whitespace beyond the space bands’ range.|$|E
