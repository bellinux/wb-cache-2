Services are operated to Aboa (Finnish), Dome F (Japanese), Halley (British), Kohnen (German), Maitri (Indian), Neumayer (German), Novolazarevskaya (Russian), Princess Elisabeth (Belgian), SANAE IV (South African), Showa (Japanese), Tor (Norwegian) and Wasa (Swedish).

5|$|Pick became traffic {{development}} officer in 1909 and commercial manager in 1912. Albert Stanley replaced Gibb as managing director in 1910. During 1912 and 1913, the UERL increased its control over transport services in London by purchasing two tube railways, the City & South London Railway (C) and Central London Railway (CLR), {{and a number}} of bus and tram companies. One of Pick's responsibilities was to increase passenger numbers, and he believed {{that the best way to}} do so was by encouraging increased patronage of the company's services outside peak hours. He commissioned posters which promoted the Underground's trains and London General Omnibus Company's (LGOC's) buses as a means of reaching the countryside around London and attractions within the city. Pick realised that variety was important to maintain travellers' interest and he commissioned designs from artists working in many different styles. At the same time, he rationalised bus routes to ensure that they complemented and acted as <b>feeder</b> <b>services</b> for the company's railway lines, tripling the number of LGOC operated routes during 1912 and extending the area covered to five times its previous size. Sunday excursion services to leisure destinations were implemented to fully utilise otherwise idle buses and agreements were established with rural bus operators to coordinate services rather than compete with them.|$|E
5|$|State {{funding was}} allocated, {{allowing}} {{the airport to}} be upgraded. The regional airport opened on 1 August 1974, {{the same day as}} four other airports in Finnmark. Both Widerøe and Norving applied to operate the subsidized regional routes in Finnmark, which included the route to Berlevåg. Widerøe was awarded the contract in 1973. Because of the steadily more regular flights to Berlevåg, Norving applied to the government for permission to operate these as taxi routes. While the airline had been forced to operate its taxi service on the time specifications of the customer, taxi routes would allow the airline to operate <b>feeder</b> <b>services</b> with timetables. No such permission was granted. Widerøe took over operations from 1 August 1974 using the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter. On 14 November 1980 the garage and workshop burned down; a new building was built and opened in 1982. The passenger terminal was expanded in 1988 with a new arrivals and departure hall. Widerøe introduced the Dash8 in 1994. The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership and operations of the airport from 1 January 1997, in exchange for 2.2 million Norwegian krone (NOK) being paid to Berlevåg Municipality. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005.|$|E

25|$|The {{withdrawal}} of trams from the Brighton tramline {{and the introduction}} of diesel buses to the route saw Pleasant Point services combined with those to Brighton in a new timetable, effective from 18 October 1952.

The first LRT line was opened in 1999 and the system has since expanded to three lines, each serving a public housing estate, namely Bukit Panjang, Sengkang and Punggol. Trains on these lines have at least one station linking it to the MRT and in turn the remainder of the LRT network.|$|E

25|$|Another tramway line, the Buenos Aires PreMetro, {{operates}} as a feeder {{at the end of}} Underground Line E, running through some of the city's southern districts. Though there is currently only one PreMetro line (E2), originally many other lines were planned to run as <b>feeder</b> <b>services</b> to the Buenos Aires Underground, however due to their planned construction coinciding with the privatisation of the Underground network, these never materialised. The creation of new lines has been proposed as late as 2012, however it is now accepted that, with the creation of the Metrobus network in 2011, the need for further PreMetro lines has been made redundant.|$|E
25|$|In January 1990, North American Airlines began {{providing}} <b>feeder</b> <b>services</b> to El Al's US destinations. El Al held a 24.9 {{percent stake}} in the airline until selling it back to Dan McKinnon in July 2003. By this time, El Al was operating a fleet of 20 aircraft, including nine Boeing 747s, and had begun replacing its aging Boeing 707s with the Boeing 757. Early that year, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, El Al inaugurated regular flights to Moscow. No airlifts from the former Soviet Union were possible at the time but permission was granted in 1991. Charter flights commenced in August 1991, with immigrants also occupying all available seats on El Al's scheduled routes. In cooperation with Aeroflot, El Al flew more than 400,000 Jewish immigrants to Israel within a three-year period.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with French airline Union des Transports Aériens (UTA) in January 1964, which saw the two airlines cooperating on flights between Africa and Europe. UTA operated a Johannesburg-Salisbury-Léopoldville-Paris service with Douglas DC-8 equipment, and Air Congo operated Boeing 707s on the Léopoldville-Douala-Paris route. The airline added four Beech Barons in October 1964 in order to provide <b>feeder</b> <b>services,</b> and in November 1964, Zambia Airways reintroduced the Ndola-Élisabethville route which was formerly operated by Central African Airways. Zambia Airways operated the flight on Mondays, and Air Congo operated the same service on Fridays. On 29 November 1964, a Douglas DC-4 of the airline, leased from Belgian International Aviation Services crashed upon take-off from Stanleyville, killing seven of the fifteen people on board. It was initially reported the aircraft, which was carrying Belgian soldiers, may have been shot down by rebels, but it was later revealed the aircraft had hit an empty fuel drum on the runway upon taking off.|$|E

25|$|The 1913 Nottingham Corporation Bill {{proposed}} tramway extensions along Derby Road, via Hucknall Road to Bagthorpe Hospital, along Sneinton Road to Sneinton Dale, {{and from}} Bulwell Market to Bulwell Hall Park, together with various motorbus and trolley vehicle routes. The principal motorbus routes were in West Bridgford, i.e., via Trent Boulevard to Adbolton Grove, and a circular route via Musters Road, Chaworth Road and Loughborough Road. Others {{were between the}} tramcar terminus at Sherwood, continuing via Daybrook Square to Arnold, and along Carlton Road o Newgate Street, both of these being routes for which tramway powers had been taken over from the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company. Suggestions were made that powers would probably also be required for other <b>feeder</b> <b>services</b> to tramways, such as from Mansfield Road, via Gregory Boulevard and Alfreton Road to Bentinck Road, along Forest Road, along Hucknall Road to the Bagthorpe Workhouse, via Sneinton Road to Sneinton Dale, between Bulwell Market Place and Bulwell Hall Park, and from the Mapperley tramway terminus to Spout Lane (now Coppice Road).|$|E
25|$|AirAsia Zest Airways, Inc., {{operating}} as AirAsia Zest (formerly Asian Spirit, and Zest Air), {{is a joint}} venture between AirAsia & AMY Holdings Inc., the company who owns Zest-O corporation in the Philippines. It operates scheduled domestic and international tourist services, mainly <b>feeder</b> <b>services</b> linking Manila and Cebu with 24 domestic destinations in support of the trunk route operations of other airlines. In 2013, the airline became a sister airline of AirAsia Philippines operating their brand separately. Its main base is in Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Manila, and with a hub at Mactan-Cebu International Airport, Cebu. The airline was founded as Asian Spirit, the first airline in the Philippines to be run as a cooperative. It was rebranded to Zest Air in March 2008. On 16 August 2013, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), the regulating body of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for civil aviation, suspended Zest Air flights until further notice due to safety issues. Less than a year after AirAsia and Zest Air's strategic alliance, the two companies rebranded as AirAsia Zest on 18 September 2013.|$|E
