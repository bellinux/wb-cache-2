Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, <b>having</b> <b>become</b> uniquely neotenic {{as a result of}} selective breeding by humans. A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{placed the}} young heir to Ludlow, another Edmund Mortimer, {{under house arrest}} {{in the south of}} England, and kept a firm grip on Ludlow Castle himself.

As a result, the Mortimers rarely visited the castle during {{the first part of the}} century, despite the {{surrounding}} town <b>having</b> <b>become</b> prosperous in the wool and cloth trades. Edmund fell heavily into debt and having sold his rights to his Welsh estates to a consortium of nobles, before dying childless in 1425.|$|E

5|$|However, {{during this}} time Inglis' {{relationship}} with his brigade commanders, particularly Brigadier Howard Kippenberger deteriorated. Kippenberger had become highly rated as a field commander {{during the war and}} Inglis may have become resentful. This was uncomfortable for Kippenberger, who had served under Inglis in the Territorial Force and considered him a mentor in the art of warfare. This was further exacerbated on 30 June when Inglis went to Cairo without informing his staff who, in his absence, subsequently asked Kippenberger to take temporary command of the division. Inglis returned on 1 July <b>having</b> <b>become</b> lost when returning from Cairo.|$|E

As the 21-year-old Mitra had no prior filmmaking experience, the choice was met with scepticism by those who knew of the production.
