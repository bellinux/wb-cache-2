Additionally, as Robert Eisenman points out:Most scholars agree that the scrolls were deposited in the cave in or around 68 AD, but often mistake this date … for the terminus <b>ad</b> <b>quem</b> for the deposit of the scrolls in the caves/cessation of Jewish habitation at the site, when it cannot be considered anything but the terminus a quo for both of these, i.e., not the latest but the earliest possible date for such a deposit and/or Jewish abandonment of the site. The actual terminus <b>ad</b> <b>quem</b> for both of these events, however difficult it may be to accept at first, is 136 AD. (Italics in original.) ...|$|R

50|$|Flanary Archeological Site is a {{historic}} archaeological site located near Dungannon in Scott County, Virginia, United States. Located across the Clinch River from Dungannon, the site was inhabited as early as 6000 BC and remained in periodic use into the Woodland period, with occupation potentially continuing until c. AD 1600. The terminus <b>ad</b> <b>quem</b> for occupation is 1750, when Thomas Walker's expedition passed through the area and found no Indian villages.

50|$|Terminus post quem ("limit after which", often {{abbreviated}} to TPQ) and terminus ante quem ("limit before which") specify the known limits of dating for events.

An event {{may well have}} both a terminus post quem and a terminus ante quem, {{in which case the}} limits of the possible range of dates are known at both ends, but many events have just one or the other. Similarly, terminus <b>ad</b> <b>quem</b> ("limit to which") is the latest possible date of a non-punctual event (period, era, etc.), while terminus a quo ("limit from which") is the earliest.|$|R

50|$|The {{classical}} scholar Isaac Casaubon, in De rebus sacris et ecclesiasticis exercitationes XVI (1614), showed, {{through an}} analysis of the Greek language used in the texts, that those texts believed to be of ancient origin were in fact much more recent: most of the philosophical Corpus Hermeticum can be dated to around AD 300. However, flaws in this dating were discerned by the 17th century scholar Ralph Cudworth, who argued that Casaubon's allegation of forgery could only be applied to three of the seventeen treatises contained within the Corpus Hermeticum.
