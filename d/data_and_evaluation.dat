5000|$|Toxicity can be {{measured}} by its effects on the target (organism, organ, tissue or cell). Because individuals typically have different levels of response to the same dose of a toxic substance, a population-level measure of toxicity is often used which relates the probabilities of an outcome for a given individual in a population. One such measure is the [...] When such data does not exist, estimates are made by comparison to known similar toxic things, or to similar exposures in similar organisms. Then, [...] "safety factors" [...] are added to account for uncertainties in <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> processes. For example, if a dose of a toxic substance is safe for a laboratory rat, one might assume that one tenth that dose would be safe for a human, allowing a safety factor of 10 to allow for interspecies differences between two mammals; if the data are from fish, one might use a factor of 100 {{to account for the}} greater difference between two chordate classes (fish and mammals). Similarly, an extra protection factor may be used for individuals believed to be more susceptible to toxic effects such as in pregnancy or with certain diseases. Or, a newly synthesized and previously unstudied chemical that is believed to be very similar in effect to another compound could be assigned an additional protection factor of 10 to account for possible differences in effects that are probably much smaller. Obviously, this approach is very approximate; but such protection factors are deliberately very conservative, and the method {{has been found to be}} useful in a deep variety of applications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: E-Learning {{frameworks}} are conceptual {{tools to}} organize networks of e-learning services. Most frameworks cover areas {{that go beyond}} the scope of e-learning, from course to financial management, and neglects the typical activities in everyday life of teachers and students at schools such as the creation, delivery, resolution <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> of assignments. This paper presents the Ensemble framework- an e-learning framework exclusively focused on the teaching-learning process through the coordina-tion of pedagogical services. The framework presents an abstract <b>data,</b> integration <b>and</b> <b>evaluation</b> model based on content and communications specifications. These specifica-tions must base the implementation of networks in specialized domains with complex evaluations. In this paper we specialize the framework for two domains with complex evaluation: computer programming and computer-aided design (CAD). For each do-main we highlight two Ensemble hotspots: <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>evaluations</b> procedures. In the former we formally describe the exercise and present possible extensions.
