Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E

At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
25|$|I {{was very}} much {{surprised}} when Mill informed {{me that he had}} not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with the opinion of the man at the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, Hans Brochner, who knew, so to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I {{came to the conclusion that}} here was a task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually understand one another.

500|$|Murphy created Burt as [...] "a working-class dude who's {{not okay}} {{with his son}} being gay, a guy who's having a tough time." [...] The {{character}} is loosely based on his own father. He had O'Malley in mind when casting the role, and felt confident about his capability: [...] "It's a real tour de force role and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> Mike could do. This isn't an after-school special. ... It's heavy and Mike {{has the ability to}} cut through the sentiment." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Mike's talent is deep. I will always write for Mike O'Malley." [...] The actor did not have to audition, and was invited to read for the part by Murphy personally. The two men, along with Falchuk, had previously worked together on the television movie Pretty/Handsome. While reading the first twenty pages of script, O'Malley was not initially enthusiastic about playing the role, as the character appeared to be an intolerant stereotype. He changed his mind, however, after realizing that Burt was to be portrayed as a more accepting man, with [...] "grace and love that comes first for his son." ...|$|E

Fellow guitarist Steve Lukather recalled, [...] "Initially, we rocked it out as Eddie had played a good solo—but Quincy thought it was too tough.

Dubbing the character [...] "a bonafide feminist warrior", Daily Life Ruby Hamad praised Clair for teaching her [...] "that a woman is no less of a woman, {{a mother and a}} wife for working." [...] Slate critic Jason Bailey observed that, during The Cosby Shows initial run, critics and audiences were too busy commenting on the race of the sitcom's main characters to notice that Cosby had imbued his series with [...] "proud and vocal feminism" [...] in the form of Clair. According to Bailey, The Cosby Show was not only successful because Clair [...] "was a strong, liberated woman with a career"; she also [...] "had a husband and family who supported and valued her endeavors." [...] Dubbing Clair's influence on pop culture as [...] "one of TV’s great feminists" [...] the [...] "Other Huxtable Effect", Bailey concluded that the character's impact remains indisputable despite Cosby's recent sexual assault allegations, and thus maintains that The Cosby Shows legacy as a feminist series should not be discredited.|$|E

She was raised in Patterson, Georgia, which she said is a [...] "one-stoplight town", {{and she had a}} job picking tobacco on a local farm for eight years. When she was a child, Strickland watched the Woody Allen film Annie Hall (1975) and was, as she put it, [...] "wanting to be in that place, and being completely taken with the energy of those people.

During her childhood, she was well known locally {{as a member of the}} Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements (she was the Homecoming Queen in elementary, middle and high school, the student council president and a cheerleader).

By college, he had {{abandoned}} any pretense of faith. [...] He later said that [...] "the Olympics had become an idol in my life." [...] After not making the Olympics in 2008, he met Doug Banister who challenged Tarwater to re-examine his worldview. [...] "The 'A-ha' moments were many," [...] Tarwater later recalled. [...] "y the time I had the ability to prayerfully repent and rebuke the stuff in my life, I was finally at a good time in life.... I would say I recommitted my life because I grew up in a Christian home, but really {{it was the first time}} where <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> I was doing and committed my life to Christ." [...] Tarwater credits his Christian faith for helping him get through the ups and downs of being a competitive swimmer. On his 2012 Olympic experience, he said [...] "It was a real gift from God. [...] I felt His presence so much the past few weeks. [...] It was an unbelievable feeling." [...] Tarwater attends Hope Community Church in Charlotte.|$|E
