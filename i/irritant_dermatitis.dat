25|$|Dermatitis is a {{group of}} skin {{conditions}} that includes atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, and stasis dermatitis. The exact cause of dermatitis is often unclear. Cases are believed to often involve a combination of irritation, allergy, and poor venous return. The type of dermatitis is generally determined by the person's history and the location of the rash. For example, <b>irritant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> often occurs on the hands of people who frequently get them wet. Allergic contact dermatitis, however, can occur following brief exposures to substances a person is sensitive to.|$|E

50|$|Beccariella is a genus of Flowering {{plants in}} the family Sapotaceae. This genus {{consists}} of at least 30 species of evergreen trees± found around the Pacific in the subtropics and tropics, mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia to northern Australia. They have simple leatherly leaves, usually elliptical and glossy, they are basically deep green but often suffused with other colors. The stems and leaves contain latex, which may cause an <b>irritant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in some people. The flowers are paired or in clusters and are very small; the ovoid fruits that follow are sometimes more conspicuous.|$|E

5000|$|The skin {{reaction}} of gatherers {{of the fruit}} was described in Israel and is known as [...] "sabra dermatitis". This condition {{is characterized by a}} papular or vesicular reaction that is sometimes scabies-like. It has also been described as tinea-like and dyshidrosis-like. The hard palate and tongue are occasionally affected. Typical areas of involvement of this <b>irritant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> include fingers, wrists, genitals, thorax, and buttocks. Biopsy of these lesions will reveal that they contain glochidia. Glochidia may be transferred to the workers' clothing and thence to other individuals. It is recommended that the fruit should be picked only when wetted, and picking should be stopped when it is windy since the glochidia can become airborne.|$|E
50|$|White {{spirit is}} mainly classed as an irritant. It has a fairly low acute {{toxicity}} by inhalation of the vapour, dermal (touching the skin) and oral routes (ingestion). However, acute exposure {{can lead to}} central nervous system depression resulting in lack of coordination and slowed reactions. Exposure to very high concentrations in enclosed spaces can lead to general narcotic effects (drowsiness, dizziness, nausea etc...) and can eventually lead to unconsciousness. Oral ingestion presents a high aspiration hazard. Prolonged or repeated skin exposure {{over a long period}} of time can result in severe <b>irritant</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> also called contact dermatitis. Exposure to white spirit in direct contact with the skin for several hours can cause severe chemical burns.It is recommended that skin exposure be kept to a minimum by use of gloves, and that hands be washed after contact. Occasional exposure to skin is highly unlikely to cause any problems.|$|E

40|$|Wood dust is an {{irritant}} substance {{and if it}} directly contact with the skin for a long time, it can cause workers exposed {{to the risk of}} <b>irritant</b> contact <b>dermatitis.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the relationship between {{irritant substance}}s exposure with <b>irritant</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> to sanding workers in PT X Jepara. The type and design of this study was an observational study using cross sectional approach. The instruments of this research are clinical examination by medical personnel, Personal Dust Sampler, questionnaires and observation. The population which used in this study were 139 with a sample of 60 sanding workers. The sampling technique that was use is proportionate stratified random sampling, and the data were analyzed using Chi Square test. The measurement results of respirable wood dust level showed the wood dust level exceed the Threshold Limit Value (TLV), which is 5 mg/m 3. The result of this study indicates there are 21, 7 % of workers who had <b>irritant</b> contact <b>dermatitis.</b> Based on correlation test, researcher concluded that age is not associated with iritant contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 368), there is no correlation between years of service with the occurrence of <b>irritant</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> (p-value = 0, 182), there is no correlation between personal hygiene with the occurrence of <b>irritant</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> (p-value = 0, 689), and wood dust exposure is associated with iritant contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 005).

40|$|Differentiation between {{allergic}} and <b>irritant</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> reactions is difficult, as both inflammatory {{diseases are}} clinically, histologically, and immunohistologically very similar. Previous studies in mice {{revealed that the}} chemokine IP- 10 is exclusively expressed in allergic contact dermatitis reactions. In the present study, we investigated whether the mRNA expression of IP- 10 and the related CXCR 3 activating chemokines, Mig and IP- 9 are also differentially expressed in human allergic contact <b>dermatitis</b> and <b>irritant</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> reactions. Skin biopsies from allergic (13 cases) and sodium lauryl sulfate-induced irritant patch test reactions (13 cases), obtained 1 – 72 [*]h after patch testing, were studied {{by means of an}} in situ hybridization technique. Results of chemokine mRNA expression were correlated with clinical scoring, histology, and immunohistochemical data including the proportion of inflammatory cells expressing CXCR 3, the receptor for IP- 10, Mig, and IP- 9, and ICAM- 1 and HLA-DR expression on keratinocytes. IP- 10, Mig, and IP- 9 mRNA were detected in seven of nine allergic contact dermatitis reactions after 24 – 72 [*]h, but not in sodium lauryl sulfate-induced <b>irritant</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> reactions. ICAM- 1 expression by keratinocytes was only found in allergic contact dermatitis reactions and correlated with chemokine expression. Moreover, up to 50 % of the infiltrating cells in allergic contact dermatitis expressed CXCR 3, in contrast to only 20 % in <b>irritant</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> reactions. In conclusion, we have demonstrated differences in chemokine expression between allergic contact <b>dermatitis</b> and <b>irritant</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> reactions, which might reflect different regulatory mechanisms operating in these diseases and may be an important clue for differentiation between allergic contact <b>dermatitis</b> and <b>irritant</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> reactions...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} of various <b>irritant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> involves {{the elimination of}} the casual or favoring factor, the control of aggravating factors, and administration of topical agents. Even though corticosteroids are extensively used in these conditions to reduce the inflammation, it can also result in undesirable side effects. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a non steroidal topical agent to be used in these conditions. Aims: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of repairing cream "RV 2427 B" in children and adults in <b>irritant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> care. Materials and Methods: In this phase III open labeled, multicenter, non-controlled, non-randomized trial, <b>irritant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in children and adults either due to diaper rash, pityriasis alba and <b>irritant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (eczema), perioral dermatitis, perleche or intertrigo were administered; repairing cream RV 2427 B containing a) 4 % zinc oxide, b) 2. 5 % dry colloidal oat extract, (c) 0. 5 % oat oil, (d) 0. 2 % copper sulfate, and (e) 0. 1 % zinc sulfate to be applied twice-daily in the affected area. The subjects were evaluated on day 7 and day 21 for both efficacy and tolerance and last visit for cosmetic acceptability. The trial was conducted in accordance with the good clinical practices (GCP) after obtaining ethical clearance from respective Institutional Review Boards. Statistical evaluation was by variance analysis and student test for the quantitative variables, chi-square test for the qualitative variables. Results: Of the 136 enrolled subjects, 95 completed the study.

40|$|<b>Irritant</b> <b>dermatitis</b> {{represents}} innate inflammatory {{responses to}} toxic chemicals. We have reported recently that ATP released from chemically injured keratinocytes {{may serve as}} a causative mediator for <b>irritant</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> In this study, we examined whether ATP release from keratinocytes would serve as a reliable readout for predicting skin irritating potentials of structurally diverse compounds. A vast majority (19 / 20) of the tested compounds, i. e., strong and weak irritant chemicals selected from the literature, induced rapid (< 10 min) and significant (P< 0. 05) ATP release from Pam 212 keratinocytes. Two compounds caused no detectable skin inflammation in our standard mouse model, documenting relatively high sensitivity (false negative rate of 0 / 18) and specificity (false positive rate of 1 / 20) of our ATP release assay. Selected compounds, primarily those containing phenol residues or hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains, triggered rapid (< 10 min) and robust leakage of a fluorescence probe from liposomes, suggesting that lipid bilayers serve as one, but not the only, target moiety on keratinocytes. Not only do our data support the pathogenic role for keratinocyte-derived ATP in <b>irritant</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> they also form the basis for a formal validation study to evaluate the utility of the keratinocyte-based in vitro assay in screening environmental and industrial chemicals...|$|E
