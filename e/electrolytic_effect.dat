The emulsion contains {{a large number of}} surfactants and other additives,so this Emulsifying Wastewater is quite stable. However, There is the higher cost in the existing approach of processing. It was reported that The pulse electrolytic process can be used to carry on the treatment the waste emulsion in the text. So the influence on the waste emulsion chemical oxygen demand(COD) elimination rate effect by the factorsof pulse electrolysis were investigated,such as the electric current size, width pole plate spacing and pH value.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{model is}} developed {{to study the}} performance of a planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) running on steam/methane mixture. The model considers the heat/mass transfer, electrochemical reactions, direct internal reforming of methane (CH₄), and water gas shift reaction in an SOFC. It is found that at an operating potential of 0. 8 V, the upstream and downstream of SOFC work in electrolysis and fuel cell modes, respectively. At the open-circuit voltage, the electricity generated by the downstream part of SOFC is completely consumed by the upstream through electrolysis, which is contrary to our common understanding that electrochemical reactions cease under the open-circuit conditions. In order to inhibit the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>effect,</b> the SOFC can be operated at a lower potential or use partially pre-reformed CH₄ as the fuel. Increasing the inlet gas velocity from 0. 5 m s⁻¹ to 5. 0 m s⁻¹ does not reduce the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>effect</b> but decreases the SOFC performance. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E

This condition, which is commonly seen in children, may cause damage, particularly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, {{as well as in the}} nose, external ear canal, and middle and inner ears. Ulceration due toxin contact is a very rare condition. In this study, we present the case of an 18 -month-old male who swallowed a cell which caused damage in the medial femoral area after harmlessly passing through the entire gastrointestinal tract. The battery caused skin necrosis with the contribution of the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>effect</b> of stool in a diaper is an infrequent case and avoidable with only the parents' attention. Usually, swallowing watch batteries does not cause any symptoms or findings, and it easily excreted in stool. However, serious injuries and even deaths in cases involving the nasal cavities, outer and inner ear, esophagus, stomach, intestines, and neighboring organs have been reported in the literature. It is important to acknowledge the negative consequences and signs and symptoms of such conditions, and note that the battery may stick to body parts such as genital, medial femoral, anal, and intergluteal regions that remain in the diaper-covered area and may cause skin ulcerations due to the electrolytic characteristics of the stool...|$|E

It {{is not to}} be {{supposed}} that the different strengths of the acids produced the differences above; for within certain limits I found the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>effects</b> to be nearly as the strengths of the acids, so as to leave the expression of force, when given in equivalents, almost constant. Thus, when the trough was charged with a mixture of 200 water and 8 nitric acid, each plate lost 1.854 equivalent of zinc. When the charge was 200 water and 16 nitric acid, the loss per plate was 1.82 equivalent. When it was 200 water and 32 nitric acid, the loss was 2.1 equivalents. The differences here are not greater than happen from unavoidable irregularities, depending on other causes than the strength of acid.|$|R
40|$|The {{aggregation}} {{behavior of}} a charged amphiphilic graft copolymer, prepared from poly(styrene-co-methyl methacrylate-co-maleic anhydride) and poly(ethylene oxide) monomethyl ether, was studied using flow field-flow fractionation (flow FFF). This method determines the hydrodynamic size of aggregates. The polymer was shown to have a complex aggregation behavior in aqueous solutions containing salt. This was expressed {{in the formation of}} differently sized structures, from single polymer chains to large polymolecular aggregates. The polymer changed its aggregation ability in the presence of different salts and salt concentrations, as reflected by changes in hydrodynamic size. Three different salts were tested: potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, and sodium phosphate. Even at micromolar concentrations of sodium sulfate, a pronounced aggregation was observed, probably due to reduced charge repulsion. At higher concentrations of the ''salting-out'' salts, the hydrodynamic size increased rapidly, reflecting the reduced solubility of the hydrophilic parts of the polymer, i. e. the poly(ethylene oxide) grafts. Sodium sulfate, and sodium phosphate in particular, had a stronger influence on polymer aggregation than potassium chloride. This agrees with current knowledge of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>effects</b> on poly(ethylene oxide) solutions. Flow FFF was found to be a suitable characterization technique for these complex systems, rapidly and efficiently separating different polymer aggregate populations ranging from a few nanometers up to 0. 1 mu m...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol (2, 4 -DCP) from {{aqueous solution}} on ferric oxide {{was carried out}} in a batch process. The experiments were done to determine the equilibrium time of adsorption, effect of temperature, pH, electrolytes and substituted groups of adsorbate to elucidate the mechanism of the adsorption. The estimated equilibrium time was found to be three hours. The adsorption was found to increase with increasing temperature from 30 - 50 ºC. The numerical values of differential heat of adsorption increased with increasing surface coverage suggesting that the adsorption on ferric oxide might be chemical in nature. The adsorption of 2, 4 -DCP on ferric oxide was found to increase with increasing pH of the solution from 3. 0 - 5. 0 but further increase of solution pH from 5. 0 - 8. 0 decreased the adsorption. <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>effect</b> showed that the adsorption was favorable in presence of NO 3 - ion as compared with Cl- ion. The effect of substituted groups showed that the amount of 2, 4 -DCP adsorbed on ferric oxide was lower than that of 2, 5 -DCP. Such observations suggest that the adsorption of 2, 4 -DCP on Fe 2 O 3 is dominated by the electrostatic force of attraction between DPC ions and iron oxide surface in aqueous media...|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to most other tomographic imaging techniques, EIT {{does not apply}} any kind of ionizing radiation. Currents typically applied in EIT are relatively small and certainly below the threshold at which they would cause significant nerve stimulation. The frequency of the alternating current is sufficiently high not to give rise to <b>electrolytic</b> <b>effects</b> {{in the body and}} the Ohmic power dissipated is sufficiently small and diffused over the body to be easily handled by the body's thermoregulatory system. These properties qualify EIT to be continuously applied in humans, e.g. during mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU).Because the equipment needed in order to perform EIT is much smaller and less costly than in conventional tomography, EIT qualifies for continuous real time visualization of lung ventilation right at the bedside.EIT’s major disadvantage versus conventional tomography is its lower maximum spatial resolution (approximately 15% of electrode array diameter in EIT compared to 1 mm in CT and MRI). However, resolution can be improved using 32 instead of 16 electrodes. Image quality can be further improved by constructing an EIT system with active surface electrodes, which significantly reduce signal loss, artifacts, and interferences associated with cables as well as cable length and handling.In {{contrast to}} spatial resolution, temporal resolution of EIT (0.1 milliseconds) is much higher than in CT or MRI (0.1 seconds).|$|R

40|$|Summary. Currently in {{the repair}} and {{manufacture}} {{at the stage}} of recovery of steel parts, widely used special coatings formed by <b>electrolytic</b> <b>effects</b> on ferrous ions. This technique offers high performance, ease of implementation, low cost of technological equipment and materials used, as well as easy automation of the process. However, this method has several disadvantages: low fatigue strength of reconditioned parts, insufficiently strong grip of the iron coating to the substrate, particularly in alloy steels, insufficient wear resistance. For the purpose of increasing durability and wear resistance of parts, restored through electrochemical action, it is proposed to use chemical-heat treatment, consisting {{in the application of}} carbonitriding. Investigated the efficacy of different modes of carbonitriding in the highly carburizing paste-and their influence on the structure and properties of iron plating. It is established that the nitrocarburizing both low and high temperatures repeatedly (6 - 7. 5 times) increases the microhardness of the coatings. The highest hardness is obtained by low-temperature carbonitriding with direct quenching in water. Conducting the carbonitriding process at low temperatures (650 °C), significantly increases the hardness of the iron coatings, increasing the limit of its fluidity, a and also greatly increases its endurance limit. Nitrocarburized fatigue strength of samples with iron precipitation on the surface, as shown by our studies, not only higher strength of the same samples without carbonitriding (more than 2 times), but higher than the fatigue strength of the base metal without coatings. Raising the temperature of the carbonitriding did not increase the hardness of electrolytic iron. Developed a rational technology of hardening of steel parts, re-chain iron fortification. Selected optimum conditions for carbonitriding hardening restored iron fortification, with the purpose of increasing durability of machine parts Optimal process temperature re-benching of the process of carbonitriding in which is possible to obtain maximum fatigue strength and wear resistance from the restored detail, is the process of carbonitriding at 650 °C, followed by quenching and tempering at 150 °C...|$|R

40|$|The size-modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB) {{equation}} is an efficient implicit solvation model which also captures <b>electrolytic</b> solvent <b>effects.</b> It combines {{an account of}} the dielectric solvent response with a mean-field description of solvated finite-sized ions. We present a general solution scheme for the MPB equation based on a fast function-space oriented Newton method and a Green's function preconditioned iterative linear solver. In contrast to popular multi-grid solvers this approach allows to fully exploit specialized integration grids and optimized integration schemes. We describe a corresponding numerically efficient implementation for the full-potential density-functional theory (DFT) code FHI-aims. We show that together with an additional Stern layer correction the DFT+MPB approach can describe the mean activity coefficient of a KCl aqueous solution over a wide range of concentrations. The high sensitivity of the calculated activity coefficient on the employed ionic parameters thereby suggests to use extensively tabulated experimental activity coefficients of salt solutions for a systematic parametrization protocol.

We report 2 cases of AN with marked repolarization abnormalities, the first clearly related to electrolyte imbalance, the second without a good explanation from metabolic, electrolytic or pharmacological sources. A retrospective analysis of 47 other consecutive patients with AN showed that sinus bradycardia was the most common ECG finding, but that QT or QTc interval prolongation was not a typical feature, being present in only 1 patient. The sole variable slightly correlated with QTc duration was the serum potassium concentration. Consequently, marked repolarization changes (QT interval and/or T wave morphology) in AN should not be taken as a feature of the disease, but should call for the search of potential causes such as metabolic and <b>electrolytic</b> disturbances, drug <b>effects,</b> or a possible genetic component...|$|R

The cathodes of Li-air cell are made by using five different carbon materials, such as Ketjen black EC 600 JD, Super P, Ketjen black EC 300 JD, Denka black, and Ensaco 250 G. The Ketjen black EC 600 JD provides discharge capacity of 2600 mAh/g per carbon weight, while that of Ensaco 250 G shows only 579 mAh/g.

40|$|A ZrO 2 -based solid {{membrane}} {{electrolytic cell}} with controlled oxygen flow was constructed: graphite rod /[O]Fe+C saturated / ZrO 2 (MgO) /(FeO) slag/iron crucible. The feasibility of extraction of iron from molten oxide slag containing FeO at an applied voltage was investigated {{by means of}} the <b>electrolytic</b> cell. The <b>effects</b> of some important process factors on the FeO electrolytic reduction with the controlled oxygen flow were discussed. The results show that: solid iron can be extracted from molten oxide slag containing FeO at 1450 °C and an applied potential of 4 V. These factors, such as precipitation and growth of solid iron dendrites, change of the cathode active area on the inner wall of the iron crucible and ion diffusion flux in the molten slag may affect the electrochemical reaction rate. The reduction for Fe 2 + ions mainly appears on new iron dendrites of the iron crucible cathode, and a very small amount of iron are also formed on the MSZ (2. 18 % MgO partially stabilized zirconia) tube/slag interface due to electronic conductance of MSZ tube. Internal electronic current through MSZ tube may change direction at earlier and later electrolytic reduction stage. It has a role of promoting electrolytic reduction for FeO in the molten slag at the earlier stage, but will lower the current efficiency at the later stage.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} has been to {{elucidate}} the neural pathways involved in the regulation of adrenal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. Administration of the dopamine-receptor agonists apomorphine (APM) and piribedil (PBD) to rats led to an increase in ODC activity of both the adrenal medulla and cortex. These effects were blocked by giving the animals the dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol. The APM-induced increase in adrenomedullary ODC activity was largely prevented by denervation of the adrenal, transection of the spinal cord, and transection of the mesencephalon-diencephalon. Section of ventral spinal roots reduced the induction to varying extents, depending on the number of roots cut and their location between T(, 4) and T(, 12). The inducing effect of APM on adrenocortical ODC was abolished by hypophysectomy. Splanchnicotomy, rhizotomy and bilateral adrenal demedullation each attenuated the action of the drug. In contrast to this, section of the spinal cord or surgical isolation of the hypothalamus (preparation of "hypothalamic island") potentiated its effect. Impairment of serotonergic nerve function by systemic administration of p-chlorophenylalanine and intraventricular injection of 5, 6 '-dihydroxytryptamine or <b>electrolytic</b> potentiated the <b>effect</b> of APM in the adrenal medulla, but reduced it in the cortex. These observations suggest that adrenal ODC activity is predominantly regulated by one or more central facilitatory dopaminergic pathways. The pathway for the regulation of the medullary enzyme involves nuclei in the diencephalon-telencephalon and ultimately acts through the sympathetic nervous sytem. The pathway for the cortex involves the hypothalamus and acts via the anterior pituitary gland. These pathways include serotonergic components, which have opposite net effects on the induction of ODC produced by APM: inhibitory for the medulla and facilitatory for the cortex...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three chapters. Each chapter addresses a specific topic and has been, or will be, submitted as a journal article. The overarching theme connecting {{the content of the}} three chapters is the problem of accurately determining the rate off corrosion in alloy-electrolyte systems. At the beginning of every chapter there is a separate abstract that has been prepared for the respective journal publication. Broadly, in order to computationally simulate the process of corrosion we need the following: a knowledge of the physical laws that govern the rate of corrosion, a framework to compute the rate for alloy-electrolyte systems using these laws, and a method to update the position and the electrochemical properties of a corrosive front using the computed reaction rate. In the <b>electrolytic</b> domain, the <b>effect</b> of ionic concentration on the reaction rate is computed using ionic transport models. The most commonly used ionic transport model combines a set of Nernst-Planck equations with the electroneutrality condition without including the Gauss' law. On the other hand, the methods using Gauss' law have been reported to be challenging for a numerical solution. We developed an alternative ionic transport model based on Onsager's theory of nearequilibrium dissipative processes. We assumed the flow caused due to ionic interactions, as obtained using Onsager's theory, to be an additional unknown for the ionic transport model. We proposed that the flux density created due to this additional flow is the minimum that is required to satisfy the electroneutrality condition. Using our method we were able to reproduce the transient characteristics of electrodes that agreed in behavior with experimental observations. Also based on our numerical simulations, we observed that the dissipation due to ionic interactions is higher near the ionic sources at the boundaries and diminishes gradually into the bulk of the electrolyte. The motion of an alloy-electrolyte interface due to corrosion is a multiscale problem in time. The ionic transport process evolves at a time step depending on the diffusivity of the ions and dimensions of the anodic-cathodic regions on an alloy surface. It turns out that this time step is several order of magnitudes smaller than the time step at which we can observe a significant change in the alloy-electrolyte boundary due to corrosion. We proposed a quasi-steady state assumption in order to alleviate this problem. We assumed that for a fixed description of the alloy-electrolyte boundary there exists a steady state solution to the corrosion current density as dictated by the ionic transport process. This is a reasonable assumption for several corrosive systems, particularly for the ones surrounded by seawater. A finite element framework with adaptive remeshing was developed that uses the ionic transport model described above to determine the corrosion rate and explicitly integrate the motion of the corrosive front. We studied and observed the convergence of this method with respect to refinement in time steps. This framework was built to modify the electrodic properties along an alloy-electrolyte interface depending upon the material composition of the alloy domain. Using this methodology we can computationally determine the evolution of the anode-cathode ratio and the corrosion current density for given organization of anodic and cathodic phases within an alloy domain. Most of the alloy structures that suffer corrosion are designed to transfer mechanical load. Hence, {{it is important to understand}} the impact of a stress field on the reaction kinetics that has been experimentally measured for an unstressed alloy. We used a stress-dependent chemical potential from the Gibbs-Duhem equation and used it to derive the reaction kinetics along the lines of the wellestablished Butler-Volmer model. In the presence of a stress field our model introduces an additional amplification-reduction factor to the forward and the reverse components of the Butler-Volmer kinetics. We further explored that the mechanical-electrochemical coupling produces a change in the shape of a dissolution front in addition to the change in the reaction rate. In our study we also examined the possible change in the reaction rate due stress-induced surface instabilities. Our calculations show that the combined shift in the reaction rate due to stress and surface patterns can be quite different from the change obtained due to the same stress field in the absence of patterns. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|R
