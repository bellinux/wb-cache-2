While financially successful, he was frustrated that his work was not being produced.

500|$|Even {{with this}} expansion, public {{officials}} wanted more. In 1922, Major John Hylan {{put out his}} plan for over 100 miles of new subway lines <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> five boroughs. His plan was intended to directly compete with the two private subway operators, the IRT and the BMT. This plan was never furthered. The next big plan, and arguably the most ambitious in the subway system's history, was the [...] "Second System." [...] The 1929 plan by the Independent Subway to construct new subway lines, the Second System would take over existing subway lines and railroad right-of-ways. This plan would have expanded service throughout the city with 100 miles of subway lines. A major component of the plan was {{the construction of the}} Second Avenue Subway. However, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 put a halt to the plan, and subway expansion was limited to lines already under construction by the IND.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2000, while {{recording}} {{their third}} album, Survivor, Destiny's Child revealed {{that they would}} produce solo albums to be released [...] "simultaneously" [...] in the [...] "hope" [...] that they would [...] "boost interest in Destiny's Child". Describing the stylistic differences of the albums' directions, Knowles said [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> do different types of music and support each other's album" [...] before saying [...] "hopefully it will broaden our audience, so it will help us all out". The idea of individual releases emanated from the group's manager and Knowles' father, Mathew. After the release of Survivor, the group announced in late 2001 a temporary break-up to focus on solo projects, including working on their own albums. Before undertaking their respective solo projects, the group released a Christmas album, 8 Days of Christmas.|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone {{called the}} video, [...] "a civilization that takes Jigga's lyrical motif of 'all black everything' very seriously." [...] He further added, [...] "When we first heard 'Run This Town', we pictured Jay-Z and his posse staging a siege on Manhattan, {{or at least}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> the VIP spots most civilians only dream about like in the [...] "D.O.A. (Death of Autotune)" [...] video. Instead, we're {{introduced}} to a Mad Max-like landscape full of proto-biker gear, torches, face scarves and bombed-out buildings. Jay-Z and his gang of ruffians actually look like they're {{on a mission to}} slay Auto-Tune. Also, according to the video, Rihanna is the only female to survive the apocalypse, and West's verse about Reeboks, Rav4s and girls with two bee stings seem starkly out of place in the dismal future."

2500|$|Following the {{departure}} from Geffen, the band {{has continued to}} tour. During the summer of 2009, they launched the ambitious Saturday Night Rebel Rockers Traveling Circus and Medicine Show tour with longtime Bay Area friend Michael Franti, his band Spearhead, and the band Augustana. Instead of the traditional concert format of a short set by an opening act, followed by a longer set from a main supporting act, and then a long set by the headlining band, the shows featured members {{of all of the}} bands joining each other for songs from each bands' catalogs at various points throughout the evening. As Duritz explained in a welcoming message on the official website for the tour, each show [...] "is going to start with EVERYONE onstage together and we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> be running on & off stage all night playing one each other's songs all together and basically just playing whenever we feel like playing." [...] The success of the first tour spawned a second in the summer of 2010 with Counting Crows and Augustana joined by rock/hip-hop artist (and formally trained jazz trumpeter) NOTAR, whom Duritz had signed to his independent Tyrannosaurus Records label, in place of Franti & Spearhead.|$|E

60|$|Had it been in Algernon Dusautoy's {{nature to}} receive the joke good-humouredly, {{it might have been}} {{regarded}} as an audacious exercise of wit, and have been quickly forgotten, but when it had actually made a breach between him and his wife's family, and driven him from Bayford when everything conspired to make his departure unfeelingly cruel, the caricature was regarded as a serious insult and an abuse of intimacy. Even Mr. Kendal was not superior to this view, feeling the offence with all the sensitiveness of a hot-tempered man, a proud reserved guardian of the sanctities of home, and of a father who had seen his daughter's weakest and most faulty action turned into ridicule, and he seemed to feel himself bound to atone for not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> the lengths to which Algernon would have impelled him, by showing the utmost displeasure within the bounds of common sense.|$|E

And, to tell the truth honestly at once, Mr Crosbie had been on terms of great friendship with Lady de Courcy's daughters, the Ladies Margaretta and Alexandrina--perhaps especially so with the latter, though I would not have my readers suppose by my saying so that anything more tender than friendship had ever existed between them.|$|E

6000|$|On Christmas Eve, then, {{this church}} was crowded, and the door-ways were {{constantly}} thronged with people passing in and out. I was puzzled {{to see so}} many young men present, for Young Italy is not usually in great number at church; but a friend explained the anomaly: [...] "After the guests at our Christmas Eve dinners have well eaten and drunken, they all go to mass in at least one church, and the younger offer a multiplied devotion by <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>all.</b> It is a good thing in some ways, for by this means they manage to see every pretty face in the city, which that night has specially prepared itself to be seen;" [...] and from this slender text my friend began to discourse at large about these Christmas Eve dinners, and chiefly how jollily the priests fared, ending with the devout wish, [...] "Would God had made me nephew of a canonico!" [...] The great dinners of the priests are a favorite theme with Italian talkers; but I doubt it is after all only a habit of speech. The priests are too numerous to feed sumptuously in most cases.|$|E
