40|$|Larvae of the {{tapeworm}} E. multilocularis cause {{alveolar echinococcosis}} (AE), {{one of the}} most lethal helminthic infections in humans. A population of stem cell-like cells, the germinative cells, is considered to drive the larval growth and development within the host. The molecular mechanisms controlling the behavior of germinative cells are largely unknown. Using in vitro cultivation systems we show here that the EGFR/ERK signaling in the parasite can promote <b>germinative</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation in response to addition of human EGF, resulting in stimulated growth and development of the metacestode larvae. Inhibition of the signaling by either the EGFR inhibitors CI- 1033 and BIBW 2992 or the MEK/ERK inhibitor U 0126 impairs <b>germinative</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and larval growth.

40|$|Background Alveolar {{echinococcosis}} (AE) is {{a life-threatening}} disease caused by larvae of the fox-tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Crucial to AE pathology is continuous infiltrative {{growth of the}} parasite's metacestode stage, which is driven by a population of somatic stem cells, called germinative cells. Current anti-AE chemotherapy using benzimidazoles is ineffective in eliminating the <b>germinative</b> <b>cell</b> population, thus leading to remission of parasite growth upon therapy discontinuation. Methodology/Principal findings We herein describe the characterization of EmPlk 1, encoded by the gene emplk 1, which displays significant homologies {{to members of the}} Plk 1 sub-family of Polo-like kinases that regulate mitosis in eukaryotic cells. We demonstrate germinative cell-specific expression of emplk 1 by RT-PCR, transcriptomics, and in situ hybridization. We also show that EmPlk 1 can induce germinal vesicle breakdown when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, indicating that it is an active kinase. This activity was significantly suppressed in presence of BI 2536, a Plk 1 inhibitor that has been tested in clinical trials against cancer. Addition of BI 2536 at concentrations as low as 20 nM significantly blocked the formation of metacestode vesicles from cultivated Echinococcus germinative cells. Furthermore, low concentrations of BI 2536 eliminated the <b>germinative</b> <b>cell</b> population from mature metacestode vesicles in vitro, yielding parasite tissue that was no longer capable of proliferation. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that BI 2536 effectively inactivates E. multilocularis germinative cells in parasite larvae in vitro by direct inhibition of EmPlk 1, thus inducing mitotic arrest and <b>germinative</b> <b>cell</b> killing. Since germinative cells are decisive for parasite proliferation and metastasis formation within the host, BI 2536 and related compounds are very promising compounds to complement benzimidazoles in AE chemotherapy. Author Summary The lethal disease AE is characterized by continuous and infiltrative growth of the metacestode larva of the tapeworm E. multilocularis within host organs. This cancer-like progression is exclusively driven by a population of parasite stem cells (germinative cells) that have to be eliminated for an effective cure of the disease. Current treatment options, using benzimidazoles, are parasitostatic only, and thus obviously not effective in <b>germinative</b> <b>cell</b> killing. We herein describe a novel, druggable parasite enzyme, EmPlk 1, that specifically regulates <b>germinative</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation. We show that a compound, BI 2536, originally designed to inhibit the human ortholog of EmPlk 1, can also inhibit the parasite protein at low doses. Furthermore, low doses of BI 2536 eliminated germinative cells from Echinococcus larvae in vitro and prevented parasite growth and development. We propose that BI 2536 and related compounds are promising drugs to complement current benzimidazole treatment for achieving parasite killing...|$|E
40|$|Background It is {{believed}} that in tapeworms a separate population of undifferentiated <b>cells,</b> the <b>germinative</b> <b>cells,</b> is {{the only source of}} cell proliferation throughout the life cycle (similar to the neoblasts of free living flatworms). In Echinococcus multilocularis, the metacestode larval stage has a unique development, growing continuously like a mass of vesicles that infiltrate the tissues of the intermediate host, generating multiple protoscoleces by asexual budding. This unique proliferation potential indicates the existence of stem cells that are totipotent and have the ability for extensive self-renewal. Results We show that only the <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> proliferate in the larval vesicles and in primary cell cultures that undergo complete vesicle regeneration, by using a combination of morphological criteria and by developing molecular markers of differentiated <b>cell</b> types. The <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> are homogeneous in morphology but heterogeneous at the molecular level, since only sub-populations express homologs of the post-transcriptional regulators nanos and argonaute. Important differences are observed between the expression patterns of selected neoblast marker genes of other flatworms and the E. multilocularis <b>germinative</b> <b>cells,</b> including widespread expression in E. multilocularis of some genes that are neoblast-specific in planarians. Hydroxyurea treatment results in the depletion of <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> in larval vesicles, and after recovery following hydroxyurea treatment, surviving proliferating cells grow as patches that suggest extensive self-renewal potential for individual <b>germinative</b> <b>cells.</b> Conclusions In E. multilocularis metacestodes, the <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> are the only proliferating cells, presumably driving the continuous growth of the larval vesicles. However, the existence of sub-populations of the <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> is strongly supported by our data. Although the <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> are very similar to the neoblasts of other flatworms in function and in undifferentiated morphology, their unique gene expression pattern and the evolutionary loss of conserved stem cells regulators suggest that important differences in their physiology exist, which could be related to the unique biology of E. multilocularis larvae...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{life-threatening}} diseases alveolar and cystic echinococcoses {{are caused}} by larvae of the tapeworms Echinococcus multilocularis and E. granulosus, respectively. In both cases, intermediate hosts, such as humans, are infected by oral uptake of oncosphere larvae, followed by asexual multiplication and almost unrestricted growth of the metacestode within host organs. Besides surgery, echinococcosis treatment relies on benzimidazole-based chemother-apy, directed against parasite beta-tubulin. However, since beta-tubulins are highly similar between cestodes and humans, benzimidazoles can only be applied at parasitostatic doses and are associated with adverse side effects. Mostly aiming at identifying alternative drug targets, the nuclear genome sequences of E. multilocularis and E. granulosus have recently been characterized, revealing {{a large number of}} druggable targets that are expressed by the metacestode. Furthermore, recent cell biological investigations have demonstrated that E. multilocularis employs pluripotent stem <b>cells,</b> called <b>germinative</b> <b>cells,</b> which are the only parasite cells capable of proliferation and which give rise to all differentiated <b>cells.</b> Hence, the <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> are the crucial cell type mediating prolif-eration of E. multilocularis, and most likely also E. granulosus, within host organs and should also be responsible for parasite recurrence upon discontinuation of chemotherapy. Interestingly, recent investigations have also indicated that <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> might be less sensitive to chemotherapy because they express a beta-tubulin isoform with limited affinity to benzimidazoles. In this article, we briefly review the recent findings concerning Echinococcus genomics and stem cell research and propose that future research into anti-echinococcosis drugs should also focus on the parasite’s stem cell population...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{mathematical}} model of cell renewal in epidermis is proposed for describing how psoriatic lesions might develop, based on available cell kinetic data for normal and psoriatic epidermis. Our simulations clearly demonstrate that {{an increase in}} the turnover rate in the <b>germinative</b> <b>cell</b> population cannot alone induce the typical psoriatic tissue architecture (i. e. increased number of germinative cells). Two perturbations are needed to account for the morphology of clinically‐stable psoriatic lesions. The first corresponds to a temporary disturbance of the steady state of the germinative layer, resulting in limited growth of this compartment; the second perturbation corresponds to a reduction in transit time in the differentiated compartment. Moreover, our simulation, based on a widely‐accepted hypothesis of homeostatic control of tissue kinetics, demonstrates that the primary cause of typical psoriatic morphology is probably an alteration in epidermal maturation. In this view, depletion of differentiated cells at the surface is the stimulus for the increased cell production rate in the germinative population. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

40|$|Psoriasis is {{a common}} chronic skin disease {{mediated}} by cellular immune mechanisms and characterized by an intense neutrophil cell infiltrate and proliferative activation of epidermal keratinocytes. We have previously described {{the expression of the}} inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in epidermal keratinocytes of psoriatic skin lesions. In this study, the role of iNOS in psoriatic inflammation was explored ex vivo in psoriatic skin biopsies and in vitro in primary cultures of human keratinocytes. Messenger RNA for the iNOS enzyme (iNOS mRNA) was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in skin biopsies from patients with psoriasis, but not in skin specimens from patients with atopic eczema or from healthy volunteers. As demonstrated by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, expression of iNOS mlLNA and its gene product was localized to the epidermal keratinocytes of psoriatic skin lesions. In situ hybridization further revealed a complete colocalization of mRNA expression for iNOS with interleukin (IL) 8 receptor [...] specific mRNA either in the basal <b>germinative</b> <b>cell</b> layer or at focal sites of ongoing neutrophil inflammation in suprabasal cell layers.

Sebaceous lobules are attached directly to the epidermis, without any association with hair follicles (Figure 1 B). Follicular induction appears as germ-like structures associated with condensed stroma resembling follicular papillae. In one focus, a heart-shaped bud can be recognized (Figure 1 C). Dermatofibroma is a common benign fibrohisti-ocytic lesion in which hyperplastic changes involv-ing the epidermis and adnexa may occur, for which the term “induction ” is often used. 1 Follicular induc-tion may appear as foci of follicular <b>germinative</b> <b>cells,</b> well-formed buds of follicular <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> (fol-licular germs) associated with mesenchymal aggrega-tions forming well-circumscribed follicular papillae, or, rarely, complete hair follicle with mature follicu-lar bulb of matrical cells, follicular papilla, and outer and inner sheath differentiation.

These early acute changes are dose-dependent and reflect damage to the <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> of the epidermis and to the cutaneous vasculature. Studies in the pig, for example, {{have shown that the}} degenerative phase of cell loss (2 – 3 weeks) results from reproductive failure in <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> and a sharp reduction in the proliferation rate of basal cell “survivors. ” D 0 values for epidermal cells in different species generally range from 100 – 140 rads. Cell maturation and ascension rates in the suprabasilar layers are largely unaffected. A regenerative phase of cell replacement, characterized by sharply increased cell replication rates, occurs from the 3 rd to 5 th postradiation weeks. The postregenerative phase of hyperplasia reflects a temporary overshoot of cell density above control levels; a subsequent decrease in hyperplasia indicates feedback control of cellular proliferation. Postradiation changes in the highly proliferative anagen hair matrix cell populations result in hair dysplasia, slowed growth rates, impaired metabolic processes, and alopecia. Dosages of 700 – 800 rads or more induce some degree of permanent hair loss.

40|$|Recent {{data suggest}} that {{imbalances}} in production and secretion of cytokines, in particular interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), may be crucial in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. In order to exert its role on target cells, IFN-gamma has to interact with a specific cell membrane receptor termed the IFN-gamma-receptor (IFN-gamma R). We studied the distribution of IFN-gamma Rs in frozen skin biopsies from 25 psoriatics and 5 normal controls with two unrelated monoclonal antibodies, and compared its distribution {{with that of the}} IFN-gamma-inducible HLADR- and ICAM- 1 antigens. In normal skin, IFN-gamma Rs were restricted to the basal cell layer; weak staining was found on scattered mononuclear cells in the papillary dermis. In 13 / 25 active psoriatic lesions, additional suprabasal immunoreactive foci, and in 5 / 25 cases, diffuse immunoreactivity of the entire epidermis were seen. No striking topographical similarities between the site and number of IFN-gamma R+, HLADR+ and ICAM- 1 + keratinocyte foci were observed, suggesting that cytokines other than IFN-gamma induce HLADR-antigens on psoriatic keratinocytes in vivo. The restricted distribution of IFN-gamma R on the <b>germinative</b> <b>cell</b> layer in normal skin confirms the role played by IFN-gamma in the normal growth regulation of the epidermis. The de novo suprabasal expression of IFN-gamma R in psoriasis argues against the current hypothesis that IFN-gamma R are down-regulated due to a local excess of IFN-gamma or transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). Whether IFN-gamma Rs in psoriatic skin are functionally normal and involved in signal transmission, remains to be studied. status: publishe...|$|E

Results: The suprabasal mitotic index was significantly higher in psoriatic lesions as compared to controls (P < 0. 001) with lower counts in palmoplantar psoriasis (n = 14). The cutoff of suprabasal mitoses for non-palmoplantar psoriasis was 1 / 100 keratinocytes with sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value of 94. 9 %, 86. 7 %, 90. 2 %, and 92. 9 %, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy was 91. 3 %. Palmoplantar psoriasis had comparatively lower values and a diagnostic accuracy of 70. 45 %. Conclusion: The morphological evaluation of suprabasal mitoses is a reliable and cost-effective cell kinetic tool in diagnosing psoriasis and its variants. This will aid in the differential diagnosis of plaque forming lesions...|$|E
40|$|Procambarus clarkii is an {{invasive}} {{alien species}} spreading worldwide. It is therefore mandatory to find new methods to manage this species since traditional techniques are not sufficient for this purpose. The present study investigates gonad damage induced by different doses of ionising irradiation: 20, 40 and 60. Gy. Testis were analysed after 10 and 30 days by means of light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Control unirradiated testes present an acinar structure with a well-defined <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> maturation from the distal proliferative zone to the proximal stalk of the lobes whilst, in irradiated testes, induced apoptosis of <b>germinative</b> and accessory <b>cells</b> and {{a high level of}} vacuolisation inside the acini were identified, progressively increasing in accordance to Gy dosage and time after exposure. We determined the dose of 40. Gy as the best compromise: it causes an extensive damage to germinative tissues without affecting crayfish vitality, differing from 60. Gy. From an applicative point of view, this dose reduces the efforts, in terms of cost and time, for the application of SMRT...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlveolar and cystic echinococcosis, {{caused by}} the metacestode larval stages of the {{tapeworms}} Echinococcus multilocularis and Echinococcus granulosus, respectively, are life-threatening diseases and very difficult to treat. The introduction of benzimidazole-based chemotherapy, which targets parasite β-tubulin, has significantly improved the life-span and prognosis of echinococcosis patients. However, benzimidazoles show only parasitostatic activity, are associated with serious adverse side effects {{and have to be}} administered for very long time periods, underlining the need for new drugs. Very recently, the nuclear genomes of E. multilocularis and E. granulosus have been characterised, revealing a plethora of data for gaining a deeper understanding of host-parasite interaction, parasite development and parasite evolution. Combined with extensive transcriptome analyses of Echinococcus life cycle stages these investigations also yielded novel clues for targeted drug design. Recent years also witnessed significant advancements in the molecular and cellular characterisation of the Echinococcus ‘germinative cell’ population, which forms a unique stem cell system that differs from stem cells of other organisms in the expression of several genes associated with the maintenance of pluripotency. As the only parasite cell type capable of undergoing mitosis, the <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> are central to all developmental transitions of Echinococcus within the host and to parasite expansion via asexual proliferation. In the present article, we will briefly introduce and discuss recent advances in Echinococcus genomics and stem cell research in the context of drug design and development. Interestingly, it turns out that benzimidazoles seem to have very limited effects on Echinococcus <b>germinative</b> <b>cells,</b> which could explain the high recurrence rates observed after chemotherapeutic treatment of echinococcosis patients. This clearly indicates that future efforts into the development of parasitocidal drugs should also target the parasite's stem cell system...|$|R
40|$|Hailey-Hailey disease (familial benign chronic {{pemphigus}} by Gougerot-Hailey-Hailey) is a  rare {{autosomal dominant}} skin disorder characterized by mostly symmetric skin lesions {{in the skin}} fold areas. However, segmental distribution of skin lesions in cases of epigenetic or genomic mosaicism can also occur. It is known that it is caused by a de novo post-zygotic mutation that appears {{at an early stage}} of embryogenesis both in somatic and in <b>germinative</b> <b>cells.</b> Depending on allele status, {{there are two types of}} segmental forms of autosomal dominant disorders. The article presents two clinical cases with manifestation of segmental form of Hailey-Hailey disease type 1 and type 2. These examples demonstrate not only the variety of clinical signs of the disease, but also speciﬁc features of this gene dermatosis and the prognosis of its inheritance in subsequent generations. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{characterized}} a novel human type II keratin, hK 6 irs 1, which is specifically expressed in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle. This keratin represents the ortholog of the recently described mouse inner root sheath keratin mK 6 irs. The two keratins were highly related and migrated {{at the same height}} as keratin 6 in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Both RNA in situ hybridization and indirect immunofluorescence studies of human hair follicles demonstrated hK 6 irs 1 expression in the Henle and Huxley layers {{as well as in the}} cuticle of the inner root sheath. In all three layers, the expression of hK 6 irs 1 mRNA and protein began simultaneously in adjacent cells of the lowermost bulb above the <b>germinative</b> <b>cell</b> pool. Higher up in the follicle, the detection limits for both hK 6 irs 1 mRNA and protein precisely coincided with the asynchronous onset of abrupt terminal differentiation of the Henle layer, inner root sheath cuticle, and Huxley layer. Mainly above the level of terminal Henle cell differentiation, both indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy revealed the occurrence of distinct Huxley cells that developed pseudopodal hK 6 irs 1 -positive extensions passing through the fully keratinized Henle layer. These outwardly protruding foot processes abutted upon cells of the companion layer, with which they were connected by numerous desmosomes. These specialized Huxley cells have previously been termed “Flügelzellen”, which means “winged cells”, with reference to their characteristic foot processes. We provide evidence that, together with Henle cells, Flügelzellen ensure the maintenance of a continuous desmosomal anchorage of the companion layer along the entire inner root sheath. This tightly connected companion layer/inner root sheath unit provides an optimal molding and guidance of the growing hair shaft...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} 9 {{cases of}} testicular tumors {{in the dog}} in the period 2000 – 2008 : 4 cases were seminomas, 3 cases sertoliomas, 1 case hemangiosarcoma and 1 case leydigoma. German Shepard breed was most frequently affected (2 cases). The age of the affected dogs was between 6 and 9 years. From the examined dogs, 3 were cryptorchids. Testicular tumors are common in old dogs, less common in bull, old stallion, and rarely encountered in other species. There are reported cases in cats, rams and boar. The most common testicular tumors derive {{from one of the}} three specifically testicular <b>cells</b> – <b>germinative</b> <b>cells,</b> Sertoli cells and interstitials cells. They appear in old dogs with approximately equal frequency. Multiple and bilateral tumors are common, but metastases are rare. Cryptorchidy is an important factor that contributes to the development of seminomas and Sertoli cell tumors in dogs,and it doesn’t seem to be a factor in the genesis of interstitial cell tumor, excepting stallion and possible tomcat. In horse the majority of interstitial cell tumors were found in cryptorchid testicules. This work aimed to accomplish a retrospective study over a period perio...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} to extract and to purify acid-soluble collagen from rabbit {{skin and a}} technique to prepare a semi-transparent collagen gel to support growth of postembryonic rabbit, mouse, and human skin epithelial cells are presented. When a suspension of trypsin-released epithelial cells is plated on a collagen gel, the reorganization and growth of cells takes place in 3 stages. In stage 1, the <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> attach to, and assume a polyhydral configuration {{on the surface of}} the gel. In Stage 2, the cells migrate actively over the surface of the gel and reassociate into a multicellular colony. In Stage 3, the cells both multiply horizontally and vertically to the surface of the gel. A quantitative method to study growth and metabolism of isolated epidermal cells and the factors which induce or repress epidermal growth in vitro are outlined...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this data}} was to analyze {{morphology}} and function of the seminiferous tubule in adult wild boars. Testes removed by unilateral castration of five animals were used. The testicular parenchyma was composed by 82. 1 ± 2. 2 % of seminiferous tubule and 17. 9 ± 2. 2 % of intertubular tissue. The tubular diameter was 249. 2 ± 33. 0 µm and the seminiferous tubule lenght per gram of testis was 19. 3 ± 4. 9 m. The spermatogonial mitoses efficiency coefficient, meiotic index and spermatogenesis efficiency were 10. 34, 2. 71 and 30. 5 respectively. Each Sertoli cell supported about 13 <b>germinatives</b> <b>cells.</b> The hystometric parameters studied were {{very similar to those}} related for domestic boars, however, the wild boars intrinsic efficiency of spermatogenesis and Sertoli cells indexes were smaller than in domestic boars...|$|R
40|$|The {{developmental}} {{stages of}} the ovaries of the lobster Panulirus echinatus Smith, 1869 were characterized using macroscopic and microscopic features and the gonadosomatic relation (GSR). Based on monthly samples (November, 1999 to October, 2000), a total of 711 females were captured using gillnets. The dorsal region of the carapace was removed to evaluate the ovaries, which were dissected, weighted, preserved in Bouin`s solution, and submitted to histological procedures. The microscopic analysis of the ovaries was assessed {{by the presence of}} <b>germinative</b> <b>cells</b> in different developmental phases. When this analysis was combined with macroscopical observations (changes in color and volume of the gonads in the cephalothorax) and GSR, five developmental stages could be identified: immature (I), intermediate (II); pre-maturation (III); mature (IV) and post-spawning stage (V). Statistical analyses confirmed that GSR can be used as an indicator of developmental stage...|$|R
40|$|Panfolliculoma is a {{distinctive}} and unusual benign follicular neoplasm. It shows differentiation towards all {{components of the}} hair follicle, including the upper and the lower segments. We report two cases of this rare disease. The first patient presented with a painful nodule on the scalp and the second patient had an asymptomatic skin-colored nodule on his left eyebrow. Histopathologic examination of both cases revealed lobular proliferation of solid-cystic follicular structures. The cystic structures contain laminated keratin, indicating infundibular differentiation. The solid tumor part was composed of basaloid <b>germinative</b> <b>cells,</b> matricial cells, and cells with trichohyalin granules, representing inner root sheath differentiation. The range of differentiations was highlighted using immunohistochemical stains, including labeling of cytokeratin 1, 5, 10, 14 (using 34 bE 12), cytokeratin 5 / 6, CD 34 (outer root sheath), and Ber-EP 4 (lower segment of hair follicle).
