25|$|This {{is often}} highly {{emphasized}} by spectators and novice vaulters, {{but it is}} arguably the easiest phase of the vault and {{is a result of}} proper execution of previous phases. This phase mainly consists of the vaulter pushing off the pole and releasing it so it falls away from the bar and mats. As the torso goes over and around the bar, the vaulter is facing the bar. Rotation of the body over the bar occurs naturally, and the vaulter's main concern <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> that their arms, face and any other appendages do not knock the bar off as they go over. The vaulter should land near the middle of the foam landing mats, or pits, face up.|$|E

2500|$|Climate {{engineering}} {{opens up}} various {{political and economic}} issues. The governance issues characterizing carbon dioxide removal compared to solar radiation management tend to be distinct. Carbon dioxide removal techniques are typically slow to act, expensive, and entail risks that are relatively familiar, such as the risk of carbon dioxide leakage from underground storage formations. In contrast, solar radiation management methods are fast-acting, comparatively cheap, and involve novel and more significant risks such as regional climate disruptions. As {{a result of these}} differing characteristics, the key governance problem for carbon dioxide removal (as with emissions reductions) <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> actors do enough of it (the so-called [...] "free rider problem"), whereas the key governance issue for solar radiation management <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> actors do not do too much (the [...] "free driver" [...] problem).|$|E
