25|$|Using these data, he {{quantified}} radical {{loss from}} particles, showing that simple <b>diffusion</b> <b>theory</b> {{could explain the}} results. Gilbert and his coworkers then revealed the mechanism for initiation in emulsion polymerisation by the entry of radicals into particles—in terms of fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic precepts—in a theory that clarifies the process as being through production of surface-active species in the water phase. This model produced various qualitative predictions. One prediction, that of {{the independence of the}} entry-rate coefficient of the size and surface properties of particles, was widely seen as counterintuitive because of the deep-rooted belief in models that he had shown to be wrong. Subsequently, this prediction was experimentally verified by Gilbert and others. He used the understanding from this knowledge to develop a priori models for particle formation and molecular-weight distribution.|$|E

Oppenheimer estimated the critical mass of a uranium-235 gadget with a formula based on <b>diffusion</b> <b>theory</b> derived at Berkeley by Stan Frankel and E. C. Nelson. This gave a value for a uranium-235 gadget with a perfect tamper of 25kg; [...] but this was only an approximation. It was based on simplifying assumptions, notably that all neutrons had the same speed, that all collisions were elastic, that they were scattered isotropically, and that the mean free path of neutrons in the core and tamper were the same. Bethe's T Division, particularly Serber's T-2 (<b>Diffusion</b> <b>Theory)</b> Group and Feynman's T-4 (Diffusion Problems) Groups, would spend {{the next few months}} working on improved models.

The regional neoclassical growth model focuses on the immediate diffusion of technological knowledge.

Cumulative causation assumes that there exists no diffusion of knowledge, while imperfect <b>diffusion</b> <b>theories</b> assume that <b>diffusion</b> will take place, though slowly.
