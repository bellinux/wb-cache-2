40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{assess the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} ratio of rifampin <b>for</b> 4 <b>months</b> and isoniazid <b>for</b> 6 <b>months</b> in contacts with latent tuberculosis infection. MethodsThe cost was {{the sum of}} the cost of treatment with isoniazid <b>for</b> 6 <b>months</b> or with rifampin <b>for</b> 4 <b>months</b> of all contacts plus the cost of treatment of cases of tuberculosis not avoided. The effectiveness was the number of cases of tuberculosis avoided with isoniazid <b>for</b> 6 <b>months</b> or with rifampin <b>for</b> 4 <b>months.</b> When the cost with one schedule was found to be cheaper than the other and a greater number of tuberculosis cases were avoided, this schedule was considered dominant. The efficacy adopted was 90 % for rifampin <b>for</b> 4 <b>months</b> and 69 % for isoniazid <b>for</b> 6 <b>months.</b> A sensitivity analysis was made for efficacies of rifampin <b>for</b> 4 <b>months</b> of 80 %, 69 %, 60 % and 50 %. ResultsOf the 1002 patients studied, 863 were treated with isoniazid <b>for</b> 6 <b>months</b> and 139 with rifampin <b>for</b> 4 <b>months</b> The cost-effectiveness ratio with isoniazid <b>for</b> 6 <b>month</b> was € 19759. 48 /avoided case of tuberculosis and € 8736. 86 /avoided case of tuberculosis with rifampin <b>for</b> 4 <b>months.</b> Rifampin <b>for</b> 4 <b>months</b> was dominant. In the sensitivity analysis, rifampin <b>for</b> 4 <b>months</b> was dominant <b>for</b> efficacies from 60 %. ConclusionsRifampin <b>for</b> 4 <b>months</b> was more cost-effective than isoniazid <b>for</b> 6 <b>months...</b>|$|R
