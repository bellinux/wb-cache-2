50|$|Further east in Europe, in more {{continental}} climates, {{the soils}} show greater leaching of clay and other minerals, and are mapped as luvisols in the WRB. These are rather similar to <b>brown</b> <b>earths,</b> {{and some other}} classifications, including the British and French, call these soils argillic <b>brown</b> <b>earths</b> (sol brun lessive), because they have an argillic, i.e. clay-enriched horizon at some depth well below the A horizon. The argillic character is rather weakly expressed in the oceanic climate of the UK, and the differences between <b>brown</b> <b>earths</b> proper (cambic <b>brown</b> <b>earths)</b> and argillic yellow earths are not apparent to the general observer.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the soils}} {{in the region}} are poor in {{minerals}} (with the exception of potassium and magnesium) and humus. These are the <b>brown</b> <b>earth</b> of the highlands and the podzolic soils that locally pass to <b>brown</b> <b>earth</b> of the lower locations towards the south. In the vales, there are very fertile <b>brown</b> <b>earth</b> and chernozem. High-quality floodplain soils surround the Morava River. It is rather difficult to cultivate soil in {{a large part of the}} Region due to the steep land and variety of the terrain.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>earth</b> {{is a type}} of soil. <b>Brown</b> <b>earths</b> {{are mostly}} located between 35° and 55° north of the Equator. The largest expanses cover western and central Europe, large areas of western and trans-Uralian Russia, the east coast of America and eastern Asia. Here, areas of <b>brown</b> <b>earth</b> soil types are found {{particularly}} in Japan, Korea, China, eastern Australia and New Zealand. <b>Brown</b> <b>earths</b> cover 45% of the land in England and Wales. They are common in lowland areas (below 1,000 feet) on permeable parent material. The most common vegetation types are deciduous woodland and grassland. Due to the reasonable natural fertility of <b>brown</b> <b>earths,</b> large tracts of deciduous woodland have been cut down and the land is now used for farming. They are normally located in regions with a humid temperate climate. Rainfall totals are moderate, usually below 76 cm per year, and temperatures range from 4°C in the winter to 18°C in the summer. They are well-drained fertile soils with a pH of between 5.0 and 6.5.|$|R

40|$|Soil {{moisture}} tension was monitored, {{for three}} years, at three sites representing different natural soil drainage classes that were defined morphologically. The soils comprised: • Gley, poorly drained, loam • <b>Brown</b> <b>Earth,</b> well drained, loam • <b>Brown</b> <b>Earth,</b> somewhat excessively drained, sandy loam. The main {{features of the}} moisture regime were: • Average annual soil water tension was analogous to the natural drainage classification and followed the sequence: somewhat excessively drained > well drained > poorly drained. • Some horizons that lacked visible evidence of reduction, in the subsoil of the <b>Brown</b> <b>Earths,</b> were saturated for long periods. • The <b>Brown</b> <b>Earths</b> were unsaturated, at 15 cm depth, throughout the three-year period. • The Gley was saturated at 15 cm depth for up to nearly four months per year. This implies {{that the risk of}} overland flow, due to saturation excess, differs among soil types. The risk is probably significant on Gleys, which occupy 25 percent of the land area; it is probably small or negligible on <b>Brown</b> <b>Earths</b> and analogous soils, which comprise over forty percent and account for virtually all of the intensive agriculture in the country.

5000|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>earths</b> have a {{long history}} of being a major {{grouping}} in most soil classifications. In France they have been included with [...] "sol brun acide", although these soils may tend to have more iron and aluminium in the B horizon, and tend to what, in the British classification, is called a brown podzolic soil. <b>Brown</b> <b>earths</b> are also classified in the German and Austrian soil taxonomy as [...] "Braunerde." [...] Braunerden are widespread and frequently occur on unconsolidated parent sand or loess parent materials. [...] "Parabraunerde" [...] is the classification for a <b>brown</b> <b>earth</b> with an elluvial horison above a slightly argillic, clayey illuvial horizon. This gives rise to a universal division of these, generally brown and well drained soils into the weakly leached <b>brown</b> <b>earths</b> - called cambisols in the international World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB); and more leached brown podzolic soils in which there is an orange-brown B horizon, but no pale leached horizon between the A and the B horizons. These are called Umbrisols in the WRB, and are particularly common in western Europe, covering large areas in NW Spain.|$|R

They often develop over relatively permeable bedrock of some kind, but are also found over unconsolidated parent materials like river gravels.

For example, in the UK reddish <b>brown</b> <b>earths</b> occur on the Old Red Sandstone (Devonian) and the New Red Sandstone (Permian), and are red because the rocks from which they formed are derived from strongly oxidised deposits that were laid down under desert conditions millions of years ago.|$|R

40|$|Temporal {{and spatial}} {{measurements}} of soil microbial biomass, activity and community structure and nematode abundance {{were made in}} grazed and ungrazed Agrostis-Festuca and Nardus dominated hill grasslands, with <b>brown</b> <b>earth</b> and podzolic soils, respectively. Microbial biomass and activity were significantly higher in podzolic soils with Nardus dominated vegetation, than in <b>brown</b> <b>earth</b> soils with Agrostis-Festuca vegetation. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLEA) revealed differences in microbial community structure between soils. The ratio of fungal-to-bacterial fatty acids was higher in the <b>brown</b> <b>earth</b> than in the podzolic soil, whereas the diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) of PLFAs was greater in the podzolic soil. A {{large proportion of the}} microbial biomass (50 %) and activity (40 - 70 %) was within the surface 0 - 5 cm soil, with reduced amounts at lower depths of 5 - 10 cm and 10 - 15 cm. Microbial biomass and activity and nematode abundance showed pronounced summer maxima and winter minima. The long-term removal of sheep grazing from both grassland types resulted in significant reductions in microbial biomass and activity in the surface soil. The abundance of active soil fungi, measured as the fungal fatty acid 18 : 2 omega 6, was significantly reduced by the removal of sheep grazing, as was the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial fatty acids. Bacterial fatty acids were unaffected by the removal of sheep grazing. Possible mechanisms for these changes are discussed. Numbers of soil nematodes were significantly lower in the ungrazed sites. The effects of removing sheep grazing on nematodes and microbial community structure were most pronounced in <b>brown</b> <b>earth</b> soils. Factors responsible for these changes are discussed.
