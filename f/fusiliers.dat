5|$|After being {{educated at}} Harrow School, Pilcher joined the Dublin City Artillery, a Militia unit, {{and from there}} {{transferred}} into the regular Army. He was initially commissioned into the 22nd Regiment of Foot, but transferred shortly afterwards into the 5th <b>Fusiliers</b> (later the Northumberland <b>Fusiliers).</b>|$|E
5|$|Against {{the west}} {{boundary}} of the churchyard are situated the Commonwealth war graves of a Royal Welsh <b>Fusiliers</b> soldier and two merchant seamen of World War I.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War, Phillips enlisted in the 20th (Service) Battalion Royal <b>Fusiliers,</b> and after refusing a commission, served as a Sergeant. The 20th Royal <b>Fusiliers</b> was one of four battalions of the {{regiment}} raised in 1914 by the Public Schools and University Men’s Force. Phillips was deployed to France with his unit on 16 November 1915. On the night of 14 March 1916, while out on a wiring party, he was shot through the chest and killed, near Cambrin, France.|$|E
5|$|Chaytor took {{command of}} the Jordan Valley {{garrison}} on 5 September 1918. The right sector, {{under the command of}} Brigadier General G. de L. Ryrie, was held by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the 20th Indian Brigade. The left sector, under the command of Brigadier-General W. Meldrum, was held by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, the 38th Battalion Royal <b>Fusiliers,</b> and the 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment, supported by a field artillery battery and an Indian mountain battery. The 39th Battalion Royal <b>Fusiliers</b> formed the sector reserve, while the 1st Light Horse Brigade was in force reserve.|$|E
5|$|He {{rejoined the}} British Army {{shortly after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I and was posted to his original regiment, joining the 12th (Service) Battalion of the Royal <b>Fusiliers</b> as a major on 26 September 1914. He was promoted temporary lieutenant colonel on 3 October 1914, and transferred back to the South Wales Borderers to command the Brecknockshire Battalion. He was later posted back to 12th Royal <b>Fusiliers,</b> and, according to official sources, was killed on 25 September 1915 while leading his battalion at the Battle of Loos. He is commemorated on the Loos Memorial to the Missing. At 59 years of age, he was the eldest of the 13 Wales international players to be killed during the war.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Virtually every town or city erected some form of memorial to commemorate their dead. During the war, only London provided more recruits to the British Army than Manchester. The Manchester Regiment and the Lancashire <b>Fusiliers,</b> which largely recruited from the city and towns to the north, were swollen by pals battalions drawn from local employers, social groups, and neighbourhoods. By the end of the war, over 13,000 men of the Manchester Regiment, including more than 4,000 from the pals battalions and 13,600 Lancashire <b>Fusiliers,</b> had been killed. An estimated 22,000 Mancunians died and 55,000 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|On {{capturing}} the second-line, {{elements of the}} Liverpool Scottish decided to consolidate the shallow trenches that afforded little protection. The battle had quickly degenerated into a disorganised and chaotic affair, with British battalions losing cohesion and becoming mixed up with each other. An intensive German barrage decimated the occupants of the second-line trenches, while the 10th's temporary commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel E.G. Thin, was wounded by gunfire. The remainder of the Liverpool Scottish continued onto the third-line with portions of the Royal Scots <b>Fusiliers</b> and 1st Northumberland <b>Fusiliers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The churchyard {{contains}} two Commonwealth war graves, of a Royal Welsh <b>Fusiliers</b> soldier of World War I and a RNVR officer of World War II.|$|E
5|$|A Christmas truce {{memorial}} {{was unveiled}} in Frelinghien, France, on 11 November 2008. Also on that day, {{at the spot}} where, on Christmas Day 1914, their regimental ancestors came out from their trenches to play football, men from the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welch <b>Fusiliers</b> played a football match with the German Battalion 371. The Germans won 2–1.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day the}} <b>Fusiliers</b> again {{assaulted}} Hill 217 {{from the}} south, and attempted {{to work their way}} around the eastern and western flanks of the feature. Despite preparation by the divisional artillery and the 3 RAR Machine Gun Platoon firing their Vickers medium machine-guns in support from Maryang San, the <b>Fusiliers</b> were unable to make progress due to Chinese machine-guns located in bunkers {{at the top of their}} objective. Meanwhile, their flanking movements were also blocked by Chinese small arms and grenades. 1 RNF had now taken over 100 casualties during two days of fighting and by the afternoon they were a spent force. Sensing the Fusiliers' weakness, the Chinese then launched their own assault, forcing them to withdraw in contact. Previous plans for an assault on the Hinge had not occurred due to issues with resupply and the dangerous approach march that would have been required. Again, despite their efforts, the <b>Fusiliers</b> had failed to capture their objective. It seemed that the only way to finally secure Hill 217 was along the ridge from Hill 317, via the Hinge, and as such the Australians would be tasked with capturing the Hinge the following day. B Company was subsequently allocated the attack. In preparation, they ascended Hill 317 late in the afternoon of 6 October, finally securing the crest, and at last light joined 9 Platoon on the knoll northwest of the summit where they would form up the next day to conduct the assault.|$|E
5|$|Godley {{intended}} {{to enter the}} Royal Navy but {{changed his mind and}} chose to pursue a career with the British Army. With the aid of his family's connections, he was educated at Haileybury College and entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1885. He was commissioned into the Royal Dublin <b>Fusiliers</b> the following year as a lieutenant, and became the unit's adjutant.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Gilligan entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, but {{his life}} at the {{university}} was interrupted by the First World War. He fought in France with the Lancashire <b>Fusiliers</b> from 1915, serving as Captain in the 11th battalion. When the war ended, Gilligan returned to Pembroke and resumed his cricket career.|$|E
5|$|In the 21stcentury, {{tourism is}} the Tower's primary role, the {{remaining}} routine military activities, under the Royal Logistic Corps, having wound {{down in the}} latter half of the 20th century and moved out of the castle. However, the Tower is still home to the ceremonial regimental headquarters of the Royal Regiment of <b>Fusiliers,</b> and the museum dedicated to it and its predecessor, the Royal <b>Fusiliers.</b> Also, a detachment of the unit providing the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace still mounts a guard at the Tower, and with the Yeomen Warders, takes part in the Ceremony of the Keys each day. On several occasions through the year gun salutes are fired from the Tower by the Honourable Artillery Company, these consist of 62 rounds for royal occasions, and 41 on other occasions.|$|E
5|$|Louise {{bestowed}} {{her name}} on four Canadian regiments: The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's) in Hamilton, Ontario; the Princess Louise Dragoon Guards in Ottawa, Ontario (inactive since 1965); the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's) in Moncton, New Brunswick; and the Princess Louise <b>Fusiliers</b> in Halifax, Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, 1970, a major counter-offensive was {{launched}} by the Portuguese army. The Gordian Knot Operation (Portuguese: Operação Nó Górdio) targeted permanent insurgent camps and the infiltration routes across the Tanzanian border {{in the north of}} Mozambique over a period of seven months. The operation involved some 35,000 Portuguese troops, particularly elite units like paratroopers, commandos, marines and naval <b>fusiliers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Percy Powell-Cotton {{was born}} in 1866, and was a Major in the Northumberland <b>Fusiliers.</b> His expeditions were {{conducted}} for scientific research, and would sometimes take 18 months. In 1896, Major Powell-Cotton founded the Powell-Cotton Museum at Quex Park to display his collection of mammals and artefacts acquired on his expeditions to Africa and Asia. The animals were mounted by the noted taxidermist Rowland Ward.|$|E
5|$|Phillips {{enlisted in}} the 20th (Service) Battalion Royal <b>Fusiliers</b> {{at the start of}} the First World War. He was {{deployed}} to the Western Front in November 1915. He was shot dead while out on a wiring party on the night of 14 March 1916, near Cambrin, France.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion of the Royal Norfolks, {{along with}} the 8th Lancashire <b>Fusiliers,</b> were holding the Allied line at the villages of Riez du Vinage, Le Cornet Malo and Le Paradis with the {{battalion}} headquarters based at Le Paradis. The battalions had been ordered to hold out {{for as long as}} possible against the Germans to give time for the BEF to evacuate from Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} had {{a complicated}} organisational history during this period, {{with a large}} number of units being attached or withdrawn for short periods, while others were merged or disbanded. About thirty infantry battalions were attached for short periods and the divisional artillery and supply columns remained in support of the front line, while one ambulance company was later transferred to serve with the American 27th Division. The future of the division was again in doubt by early September; the 197th Brigade had been transferred to a training role and the division was expected to be disbanded. Bethell argued for retaining the division and was ordered to prepare it for front-line service; the 197th Brigade was replaced by the South African Brigade to bring the division back up to strength. By the end of September, following amalgamations and reorganisation, the division was left with the South African Brigade (1st, 2nd, and 4th South African Infantry regiments), the 198th Brigade (5th Royal Inniskilling <b>Fusiliers,</b> 6th Royal Dublin <b>Fusiliers</b> and 6th Lancashire <b>Fusiliers)</b> and the 199th Brigade, with the 9th Manchester Regiment, 5th Connaught Rangers and 18th King's (Liverpool Regiment). The divisional pioneers were the 9th Gloucestershire Regiment. Less than {{a year and a half}} after arriving in France, the division retained only the 6th Lancashire and 9th Manchester of its twelve original battalions and both of these had been amalgamated with other units from the 42nd Division.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} of Jisr ed Damieh, the Umm esh Shert ford was {{captured}} by the 38th Battalion Royal <b>Fusiliers</b> (Chaytor's Force). At 03:00 on 22 September they {{took advantage of the}} absence of Ottoman defenders at Mellaha, to advance to occupy trenches overlooking the ford at Umm esh Shert, which was captured shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|A second {{senior officer}} {{was killed in}} action, when Brigadier-General Arthur Lowe, {{commanding}} the divisional artillery, was killed near Ypres on 24 November. In late December 1917, a new commanding officer, Major-General Neill Malcolm {{was appointed to the}} 66th Division. Malcolm was a decorated veteran of several colonial wars, who had served in staff posts since being wounded in the Second Boer War and had most recently served as {{chief of staff of the}} Fifth Army. The division was reorganised over the winter, with the brigade machine-gun companies being consolidated into a battalion and a pioneer battalion, the 1/5th Border Regiment joining the division. The most substantial change was the loss of three battalions, the 3/5th Lancashire <b>Fusiliers</b> and 2/8th and 2/10th Manchester Regiment, one from each brigade. This was a change made in all British divisions, to bring the remaining battalions in France up to strength and to increase the ratio of artillery to infantry. At this point, there was a general exchange of men between the 42nd and 66th Divisions; the core of the 1/6th Lancashire <b>Fusiliers,</b> 1/4th East Lancashires, and 1/9th Manchesters were transferred to the 66th Division, where they amalgamated with their second-line counterparts, while the 42nd Division received the men from the disbanded battalions in the 66th Division. The division remained in the Passchendaele area until February 1918.|$|E
5|$|After {{four years}} at Winchester College, Pinney entered the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst in 1882. He passed out of the Academy and was {{appointed}} to the Royal <b>Fusiliers</b> (7th Foot) as a lieutenant on 6 February 1884. He spent five years with his regiment before attending the Staff College, Camberley in 1889–90; after leaving Camberley, he was promoted to captain in December 1891. From 1896 to 1901 he served on the staff as the deputy assistant adjutant-general at Quetta, in India, with a promotion to major in December 1898. He married Hester Head in 1900; the couple had three sons and three daughters.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the war, his unit remained in Palestine until mid-1919. It was here that he met former Wales international George Latham who was a captain in the regiment and the pair would go on to be lifelong friends. During their time in Palestine, Latham and Beadles played football for their unit, the 7th battalion of the Royal Welch <b>Fusiliers,</b> and won the British Forces in Egypt Football League Cup Final in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Billy, a Kashmir goat, is {{descended from}} the same royal {{bloodline}} as the original herd, but was not selected from the wild population; {{he was born in}} Whipsnade Zoo. He was presented to the regiment by Queen Elizabeth II in 2001. The tradition is not new: since 1844, the British monarchy has presented an unbroken series of Kashmir goats to the Royal Welch <b>Fusiliers</b> from the Crown's own royal herd.|$|E
5|$|Chaytor's Force {{commanded}} by Major General Edward Chaytor, {{consisted of the}} Anzac Mounted Division, 20th Indian Brigade, 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment, 38th and 39th Battalions Royal <b>Fusiliers</b> (Jewish Volunteers), A/263 Battery Royal Field Artillery (RFA), 195th Heavy Battery Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA), 29th and 32nd Indian Artillery Mountain Batteries, No. 6 (Medium) Trench Mortar Battery, three anti–aircraft sections Royal Artillery (RA), two sections of captured 75mm Ottoman guns, one section of captured 5.9 Ottoman guns and No. 35 Army Troops Company Royal Engineers (RE).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{his army}} career, Pinney took up {{residence}} at Racedown Manor, in the village of Broadwindsor, Dorset, where he lived the life of a retired country gentleman. He became a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for the county, and served as its High Sheriff in 1923. He did not return to an active army post, though he held the ceremonial colonelcy of the Royal <b>Fusiliers</b> from 1924 to 1933, as well as the honorary colonelcy of the Dorset Coastal Brigade, Royal Artillery, and the 4th (Territorial) Battalion of the Dorsetshire Regiment.|$|E
5|$|For two years, the 2nd East Lancashire Division (numbered the 66th Division in August 1915), {{provided}} trained {{replacements for}} its parent unit {{and carried out}} home defence duties in England. Elements of the division assembled near Southport in late 1914, then moved south to the Kent–Sussex area in May 1915 and to Essex in early 1916. In early 1915, the 2/5th Lancashire <b>Fusiliers,</b> a second-line battalion, was detached for overseas service and joined the 51st (Highland) Division. The battalion was replaced by another duplicate battalion, the 3/5th Lancashire <b>Fusiliers,</b> which {{became one of the}} few third-line territorial battalions to see active service. One of the three companies of Royal Engineers, was sent to France in 1915 to join the 48th (South Midland) Division and during 1916, three of the four heavy and howitzer artillery batteries were withdrawn or broken up. Following the Military Service Act of January 1916, all Territorial soldiers were deemed to liable for overseas service and in February 1917, the 66th Division was instructed to prepare for a move to continental Europe and received a new and experienced commander, Major-General Herbert Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|Godley {{remained}} with the <b>Fusiliers</b> until 1896, {{at which time}} {{he was promoted to}} captain and appointed adjutant of the Mounted Infantry at Aldershot. Later that year he volunteered for service in Mashonaland, where he assisted in the suppression of a rebellion in the province. After serving with the Special Service Battalion of the Mounted Infantry, he returned to England the following year and was promoted brevet major.|$|E
5|$|He {{commanded}} the 33rd at Arras in 1917, with mixed results, {{and through the}} Spring Offensive in 1918, where the division helped stabilise the defensive line after the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps was routed. After the war, he retired to rural Dorset, where {{he served as a}} local justice of the peace, as High Sheriff for the county, and as a Deputy Lieutenant; he was also the ceremonial colonel of his old regiment, the Royal <b>Fusiliers.</b>|$|E
5|$|He later {{changed his}} stance on pacifism, joined the Territorial Army and was {{commissioned}} into the 8th Battalion, Royal <b>Fusiliers</b> as a Second Lieutenant on 11 September 1943. He was killed {{five months later}} on 18 February 1944 at Aprilia, during the Battle of Anzio, when Roger was five months old. He is commemorated at the Cassino War Cemetery. On 18 February 2014, Waters unveiled a monument to his father and other war casualties in Aprilia, and was made an honorary citizen of Anzio.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Pierlot began {{drawing up}} {{plans for the}} {{reorganization}} of the Belgian Army after the liberation, known as the Pierlot Plan (Plan Pierlot). The plan called {{for the formation of}} two brigades of infantry, six battalions of <b>fusiliers,</b> logistics and support units in Belgium immediately after liberation in order to fight alongside Allied troops during an invasion of Germany. In the longer term, these troops would form the core of a new division around which more troops could be raised.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the {{division}} {{was assigned to}} IV Corps and had moved to Sussex, the 18th Infantry Division having replaced them around Liverpool. In Sussex, {{the division}} was held in reserve and placed behind the 47th (London) Infantry Division and the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division which were defending the coast between Bognor Regis – in the west – to Beachy Head in the east. Michael Glover and Jonathan Riley note that while in reserve, the Royal Welch <b>Fusiliers</b> battalions of the 115th Brigade took part in coastal defence duties.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November Major J.G. Rees of the 25th Battalion, Royal Welch <b>Fusiliers</b> {{had only}} 60 men to hold Beit Ur el Foqa when the post was almost surrounded. They managed {{to break out}} of the {{position}} and joined the support company of the 10th Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry covering Et Tire and facing Signal Hill, which became the focus of the next Ottoman attack. This came at 14:30 when they attacked with 400 soldiers, driving the detachment from Signal Hill. This move made Et Tire untenable and forced the 10th King's Shropshire Light Infantry to fall back to its original line.|$|E
5|$|On Hill 217 the <b>Fusiliers</b> had {{maintained}} {{the pressure on}} the Chinese throughout the day, however they were still unable to capture the feature. Regardless, the efforts of the <b>Fusiliers</b> in conjunction with A Company's diversionary attack and the rapid advance of D Company with tank and artillery support had carried the day. A Company continued to attack against heavy opposition and indirect fire, slowly pushing the Chinese defenders back. Later, a platoon was detached to assist C Company consolidate the defence of Maryang San following its capture, while the remaining two platoons were withdrawn rearwards, again under heavy artillery fire. Indeed, although it had played a supporting role in the attack, the efforts of A Company had been vital, suffering 20 casualties while killing at least 25 Chinese and capturing two. Now with Maryang San captured the Australians began digging-in, modifying the south-facing linear Chinese trench system into an all-round defensive position with mutually supporting weapons pits. Fully expecting a Chinese counter-attack that evening, Hasset moved the Assault Pioneer Platoon to bolster the hasty defences. Meanwhile, the Chinese still occupied three key ridgeline positions—the 'Sierra' feature, the 'Hinge' and the summit of Hill 317 itself—which they continued to furiously defend. These would be the scene of considerable fighting in the days to come as the Australians attempted to clear them.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, the French {{attacked}} the British <b>Fusiliers</b> redoubt. The skirmish lasted two hours, {{in which the}} French were repulsed suffering several casualties. On October 1, the allies learned from British deserters that, to preserve their food, the British had slaughtered hundreds of horses and thrown them on the beach. In the American camp, thousands of trees were cut down to provide wood for earthworks. Preparations for the parallel also began.|$|E
5|$|Permission {{was granted}} to form another {{parachute}} brigade in July 1942, numbered the 2nd Parachute Brigade, and Brigadier Ernest E. Down {{was selected to}} become its first commander. The brigade was assigned the existing 4th Parachute Battalion, transferred from the 1st Parachute Brigade, and two new battalions converted from normal line infantry battalions to parachute duties: the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion, converted from the 7th Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders in May 1942; and the 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion, converted from the 10th Battalion, Royal Welch <b>Fusiliers</b> in August 1942.|$|E
