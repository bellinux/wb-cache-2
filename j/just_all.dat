This junction also serves as the south end of NY9A's overlaps with NY100. NY141 initially heads to the northeast as an independent route, following the two ramps not carrying either direction of NY100. After <b>just</b> , <b>all</b> four ramps merge into a four-lane divided highway, creating a short overlap between NY141 and NY100. The divided highway ends at Brighton Avenue, the first road that it intersects. NY100 splits from NY141 here, following Brighton Avenue southward while NY141 heads southeastward along the two-lane Broadway, passing through a lightly developed commercial area. After one block, the route intersects Bradhurst Avenue, here a state-maintained street serving as a one-block spur of NY100.|$|E

25|$|Marlon Brando was {{the first}} to bring a natural {{approach}} to acting on film. According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as natural as that conversation he would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, Listen To Me Marlon, he said before that actors were like breakfast cereals. He was calling them predictable. Critics would later say this was Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite would say it was <b>just</b> <b>all</b> part of his technique.|$|E

25|$|Rice {{showed that}} for every nontrivial class C (which {{contains}} some but not all r.e. sets) the index set E = {e: the eth r.e. set We is in C} has the property that either the halting problem or its complement is many-one reducible to E, that is, can be mapped using a many-one reduction to E (see Rice's theorem for more detail). But, many of these index sets are even more complicated than the halting problem. These type of sets can be classified using the arithmetical hierarchy. For example, the index set FIN of class of all finite sets is on the level Σ2, the index set REC {{of the class of}} all recursive sets is on the level Σ3, the index set COFIN of all cofinite sets is also on the level Σ3 and the index set COMP of the class of all Turing-complete sets Σ4. These hierarchy levels are defined inductively, Σn+1 contains <b>just</b> <b>all</b> sets which are recursively enumerable relative to Σn; Σ1 contains the recursively enumerable sets. The index sets given here are even complete for their levels, that is, all the sets in these levels can be many-one reduced to the given index sets.|$|E

The following month, it was reported that an accompanying soundtrack and Cyrus' debut studio album had both begun production, the latter of which was scheduled to be released in early 2007. The first soundtrack Hannah Montana (2006) debuted at number one with first-week sales of 286,000 copies, becoming the first television soundtrack to debut in the peak position of the chart.|$|E

[...] Jason Josephes from Pitchfork awarded the album a score of 0.0 out of 10; in a scathing review, Josephes criticized the album for being inaccessible, asking [...] "Do I want to buy three more CD players with which to enjoy Zaireeka or, say, eat?" [...] and derided the band's fans. Further, in October 2009, editor-in-chief of Pitchfork, Mark Richardson, wrote a book titled Zaireeka for the 33 1/3 book series, published by Continuum International Publishing, now owned by Bloomsbury Publishing. In it, Richardson chronicles {{the creation of the}} album, praises it from multiple angles, and discusses the impact the album has had on music since its release.

500|$|Milk's {{role as a}} {{representative}} of San Francisco's gay community expanded during this period. On September 22, 1975, President Gerald Ford, while visiting San Francisco, walked from his hotel to his car. In the crowd, Sara Jane Moore raised a gun to shoot him. A former Marine who had been walking by grabbed her arm as the gun discharged toward the pavement. The bystander was Oliver [...] "Bill" [...] Sipple, who had left Milk's ex-lover Joe Campbell years before, prompting Campbell's suicide attempt. The national spotlight was on him immediately. On psychiatric disability leave from the military, Sipple refused to call himself a hero and did not want his sexuality disclosed. Milk, however, took advantage of the opportunity to illustrate his cause that public perception of gay people would be improved if they came out of the closet. He told a friend: [...] "It's too good an opportunity. For once we can show that gays do heroic things, not <b>just</b> <b>all</b> that ca-ca about molesting children and hanging out in bathrooms." [...] Milk contacted a newspaper.|$|E

The Dio Years was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the Billboard 200, while the single [...] "The Devil Cried" [...] reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the Mob Rules era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. When asked about {{the name of the}} group, Iommi stated [...] "it really is Black Sabbath, whatever we do... so everyone knows what they're getting [...] so people won't expect to hear 'Iron Man' and all those songs.

500|$|Casting {{continued}} into August 2013, with {{the announcement that}} James Spader would play Ultron. In November, Marvel confirmed that Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson would play the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, respectively. Taylor-Johnson had been in negotiations since as early as June, while Olsen's potential involvement was first reported in August. By {{the end of the}} year, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Cobie Smulders were confirmed to be returning to their roles from the first film, and Don Cheadle, who portrayed James Rhodes in the Iron Man films, had committed to a part in the film. In the early months of 2014, Thomas Kretschmann was cast as Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, Claudia Kim was cast in an unspecified role, and Paul Bettany, who voiced J.A.R.V.I.S. in previous MCU films, was cast as the Vision. Whedon said [...] "juggling" [...] all the characters in the film was [...] "a nightmare" [...] explaining, [...] "They're very disparate characters.

Hendrickson was happy with the storyline, stating that [...] "it was my supporting actors who supported me through the entire shooting day, and the writing.

Under direction of producer Richardson, From Autumn to Ashes' third full length album, Abandon Your Friends, was released on August 30, 2005. The album stemmed from the idea that [...] " [...] kind of...what we do. I mean, {{in the sense of}} how life goes on when we go away [...]" [...] Abandon Your Friends met with speculation about the band's internal conflicts surrounding a potential break up. Perri had not been much involved in the process of creating the album and did not attend practice sessions, despite stating in interviews that the album was [...] "a full on collaborative effort" [...] and [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>all</b> had a say in what we were writing." [...] It was revealed in 2007, in interviews, and when Mark posted in the band's Myspace blog that he had ghostwritten Perri's lyrics in a matter of days. The band had made a further move away from the melodic sound of their past albums, and had been a point where the band shifted more focus to Mark's vocals. CMJ reviewer Tracey John explained that the album [...] "continues to unabashedly straddle both ends of the hardcore/emo spectrum", however, the band [...] "doesn't show much of a progression from 2003's The Fiction We Live." [...] The album generally garnered reviews in which it was noted that, as a reviewer at Punk News explained that if you're a [...] "fan of From Autumn to Ashes, you'll be disappointed."Others disagreed, like UK magazine Kerrang! who gave the album a 5 out of 5 review and called it a metal masterpiece. This album would also go on to sell over 100,000 copies. Abandon Your Friends produced one single, [...] "Where Do You Draw The Line?" [...] with an accompanying music video.
