5|$|Following {{the death}} of Al-Asad, Price's team hold off against Ultranationalist forces who arrive to avenge him. Later, a <b>joint</b> <b>task</b> <b>force,</b> {{composed}} of the SAS, Force Recon, and the Loyalists, attempt to capture Zakhaev's son, Victor, to learn Zakhaev's whereabouts. After ambushing him in an enemy convoy at a vehicle checkpoint, Victor flees the scene but is soon cornered {{on the roof of}} an apartment building. Refusing to surrender, he commits suicide. Enraged, Zakhaev retaliates by taking control of a nuclear launch facility.|$|E
50|$|All the Australian Army {{special forces}} units have been grouped {{together}} under the Special Operations Command (SOCOMD) since December 2002. Clearance divers are {{under the command of}} the Navy unless seconded to SOCOMD or <b>joint</b> <b>task</b> <b>forces</b> and the Air Combat Controllers are under the command of the Air Force unless operational when they are attached to SOCOMD units or <b>joint</b> <b>task</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|R
5|$|While the {{individual}} members of each service ultimately report to their service's Chief, the Chiefs do not control military operations. Control of ADF operations is exercised through a formal command chain headed by the Chief of Joint Operations (CJOPS), who reports directly to the CDF. The CJOPS commands the Headquarters Joint Operations Command (HQJOC) as well as temporary <b>joint</b> <b>task</b> <b>forces.</b> These <b>joint</b> <b>task</b> <b>forces</b> comprise units assigned from their service to participate in operations or training exercises.|$|R

5|$|In {{the past}} few years, many {{training}} exercises took place in Romania with other Balkan or Allied countries. Most of these exercises took place at Babadag, {{which is one of}} the largest and most modern training firing ranges and military facilities in Europe, with a total surface area of 270 square kilometres. It was announced on December 6, 2006 that 1,500 U.S. troops stationed at Mihail Kogălniceanu, which in time will form <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> East, will be using Babadag as a training base.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{to shore}} duty in Washington, he was {{assigned}} to <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 2, which was charged by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara with investigating whether it was necessary to have aircraft that could fly at low altitude at supersonic speeds. This was the subject of considerable debate between the Navy and the Air Force at the time. Tests were carried out at Sandia Base with the OV-1 Mohawk, A-1 Skyraider, A-4 Skyhawk, A-6 Intruder, F-4 Phantom, F-105 Thunderchief, B-52 and B-58 Hustler aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{formed the}} nucleus of the Multinational Force Haiti and <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 190 (JTF 190) in Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. More than 8,600 of the division's troops deployed during this operation. On 19 September 1994, the 1st Brigade conducted the Army’s first air assault from an aircraft carrier. This force consisted of 54 helicopters and almost 2,000 soldiers. They occupied the Port-au-Prince International Airport. This was the largest Army air operation conducted from a carrier since the Doolittle Raid in World War II.|$|E

50|$|Typically LEAs {{working in}} {{different}} jurisdictions which overlap {{in the type}} of law non compliance actively establish mechanisms for cooperation and even establish joint operations and <b>joints</b> <b>task</b> <b>forces.</b> Often, members of a LEA working outside of their normal jurisdiction on <b>joint</b> operations or <b>task</b> <b>force</b> are sworn in as special members of the host jurisdiction.|$|R
5|$|Elements of the {{division}} remained in the country until mid-2002, fighting to secure remote {{areas of the country}} and participating in prominent operations such as Operation Anaconda, the Fall of Mazar-i-Sharif, and the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi. The division also participated in fighting in the Shahi Khot Valley in 2002. In June 2002, elements of the 82nd Airborne Division arrived to relieve CJTF Mountain, and in September, Major General John R. Vines and his Combined Task Force 82 relieved CJTF Mountain as the major subordinate headquarters to Combined <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 180. Upon the return of the battalions, they were welcomed home and praised by President Bush.|$|E
5|$|In September 1947, Hull, Russell, who was {{designated}} test director on 14 October, and <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 7's scientific director, Darol K. Froman from the Los Alamos Laboratories, set {{out with a}} group of scientists and military officers to examine various proposed test sites in the Pacific. Enewetak Atoll was chosen as the test site on 11 October. The island was remote, but with a good harbor and an airstrip. It also had ocean currents and trade winds that would carry fallout out to sea, an important consideration in view of what had happened at Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads.|$|E
5|$|Reactivated in 1988, the 10th Mountain Division's Combat Aviation Brigade {{supported}} the division as it undertook numerous operations and overseas contingencies in the 1990s, including Operation Restore Hope, Operation Uphold Democracy, and Task Force Eagle, {{as well as}} disaster relief following Hurricane Andrew. The brigade has since {{become involved in the}} War on Terrorism, seeing four deployments to Afghanistan to support Operation Enduring Freedom and a deployment to Iraq to support Operation Iraqi Freedom. The brigade is currently on its fourth deployment to Afghanistan and is serving in Regional Command - East under Combined <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 101 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, the 615th {{opened an}} air {{base for the}} first time at an {{undisclosed}} location in Southwest Asia. The base was previously closed. Previous operations of the wing had been humanitarian relief missions or opening ports for <b>joint</b> <b>task</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|R
50|$|USSOUTHCOM {{is a joint}} {{command of}} more than 1,201 {{military}} and civilian personnel representing the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and several other federal agencies. Civilians working at USSOUTHCOM are, for the most part, civilian employees of the Army, as the Army is USSOUTHCOM's Combatant Command Support Agent. The Services provide USSOUTHCOM with component commands which, along with their Joint Special Operations component, two <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Forces,</b> one <b>Joint</b> Interagency <b>Task</b> <b>Force,</b> and Security Cooperation Offices, perform USSOUTHCOM missions and security cooperation activities.

5|$|The {{division}} {{formed the}} nucleus of the Multinational Force Haiti (MNF Haiti) and <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 190 (JTF 190) in Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. More than 8,600 of the division's troops deployed during this operation. On 19 September 1994, the 1st Brigade conducted the Army's first air assault from aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. This force consisted of 54 helicopters and almost 2,000 soldiers. They occupied the Port-au-Prince International Airport. This was the largest Army air operation conducted from a carrier since the Doolittle Raid in World War II.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} that initial investigations into the treatment of Afghan detainees sparked investigations into Canada's elite military unit, <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 2 (JTF2). The first investigation, named Sand Trap, examined allegations that a JTF2 member {{was involved in the}} 2006 shooting death of an Afghan who was surrendering. No charges were laid {{at the conclusion of the}} investigation. However, a larger investigation called Sand Trap II began hearing from witnesses in May 2009 regarding allegations of JTF2 members witnessing United States armed forces killing an unarmed man. This investigation is still being conducted by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service, and it has led to calls for civilian oversight of JTF2.|$|E
5|$|Loper {{returned}} to the United States to become Chief of the Joint Photo and Survey Section of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Intelligence Group in 1948. The next year he was appointed as an Army member of the Military Liaison Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. He wrote a report which {{became known as the}} Loper Memorandum, which was influential in the decision to develop thermonuclear weapons. He was Deputy Commander of <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 3, which was responsible for the conduct the Operation Greenhouse nuclear tests in the Pacific. In 1951 became Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, but was forced to retire after he suffered a heart attack in 1953. He subsequently served as Chairman of the Military Liaison Committee from 2 August 1954 to 14 July 1961.|$|E

50|$|Under CJOPS, HQJOC is {{responsible}} for the command and control of all ADF operations worldwide. This means that each of the ADF's Combined <b>Task</b> <b>Forces</b> (CTF) and <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Forces</b> (JTF), and the Australian contingents to UN peace monitoring operations, are directly subordinate to HQJOC, and their commanders report directly to CJOPS.|$|R
5|$|Operation Sandstone was {{a series}} of nuclear weapon tests in 1948. It was the third series of American tests, {{following}} Trinity in 1945 and Crossroads in 1946, and preceding Ranger. Like the Crossroads tests, the Sandstone tests were carried out at the Pacific Proving Grounds, although at Enewetak Atoll rather than Bikini Atoll. They differed from Crossroads in that they were conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission, with the armed forces having only a supporting role. The purpose of the Sandstone tests was also different: they were primarily tests of new bomb designs rather than of the effects of nuclear weapons. Three tests were carried out in April and May 1948 by <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 7, with a work force of 10,366 personnel, of whom 9,890 were military.|$|E
5|$|Teaming {{with his}} daughter, Christina Engelbart, in 1988 {{he founded the}} Bootstrap Institute to {{coalesce}} his ideas {{into a series of}} three-day and half-day management seminars offered at Stanford University 1989–2000. By the early 1990s there was sufficient interest among his seminar graduates to launch a collaborative implementation of his work, and the Bootstrap Alliance was formed as a non-profit home base for this effort. Although the invasion of Iraq and subsequent recession spawned a rash of belt-tightening reorganizations which drastically redirected the efforts of their alliance partners, they continued with the management seminars, consulting, and small-scale collaborations. In the mid-1990s they were awarded some DARPA funding to develop a modern user interface to Augment, called Visual AugTerm (VAT), while participating in a larger program addressing the IT requirements of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force.</b>|$|E
5|$|Warren was {{commissioned}} as a {{colonel in the}} United States Army Medical Corps in 1943 and appointed Chief of the Medical Section of the Manhattan Engineering District. He {{was responsible for the}} health and safety of the thousands of personnel involved in the Manhattan Project. He was present at the Trinity nuclear test in Alamogordo, New Mexico where he was responsible for the safety aspects of the detonation of the world's first nuclear weapon. He led a survey team from the Manhattan Project to assess the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1946 he was Chief of the Radiological Safety Section of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear test at Bikini Atoll.|$|E

50|$|Under {{the overall}} {{leadership}} of General Tommy Franks, Coalition Forces Commander (CENTCOM), four major <b>task</b> <b>forces</b> were raised to support Operation Enduring Freedom: the Combined <b>Joint</b> Special Operations <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> (CJSOTF), the Combined <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> Force-Mountain (CJTF-Mountain), the <b>Joint</b> Interagency <b>Task</b> Force-Counterterrorism (JIATF-CT), and the Coalition <b>Joint</b> Civil-Military Operations <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> (CJCMOFT).|$|R
50|$|Activated {{for their}} final time on January 5, 2004, the Roadhogs {{commanded}} by LtCol Rick Mullen deployed in March {{of that same}} year to Bagram air base, Afghanistan for seven months in support of Combined <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Forces</b> 180/76 for Operation Enduring Freedom 4 and 5.|$|R
5|$|In fall of 2003, the 45th Infantry Brigade was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{in support of}} Operation Enduring Freedom, assuming command of Task Force Phoenix II from 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. The purpose of the soldiers' deployment was to assist in training Afghan security forces. Over the next few years, soldiers of the 45th Infantry Brigade, including its Headquarters and Headquarters Company, would deploy {{in support of this}} mission. In April 2004, 350 soldiers from the brigade's 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry Regiment also {{deployed to}} <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> Phoenix. During this rotation, the brigade grew the size of the Afghan National Army to over 14,000 as well as fielding a corps-sized force ahead of schedule. In August 2004, the brigade was replaced in this mission by the 76th Infantry Brigade, and subsequently returned home to the United States. The brigade spent three years back home, and in that time transformed into an infantry brigade combat team {{as a part of a}} new transformation plan for the Army.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May, the RUF {{blocked the}} road {{connecting}} Freetown to Lungi Airport, prompting UNAMSIL staff to evacuate to the Mamy Yoko Hotel {{in preparation for}} a total withdrawal from Sierra Leone if the RUF advance continued towards Freetown. In response to the deterioration Richards requested that British troops be sent to Dakar, Senegal, to decrease the time required to launch an operation in Sierra Leone. Richards also spoke to the 1 PARA command to update them on the situation. Following the conversation, 1 PARA (with 2 PARA's D Company replacing A Company, who were on exercise in Jamaica, and with several attached assets including artillery) moved to the Air Movements Centre in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. The following day Richards was designated <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> Commander and his ORLT became the forward headquarters for a British deployment. At the same time, the authority to launch an evacuation operation was delegated to Richards and the British High Commissioner, Alan Jones.|$|E
5|$|The {{tests were}} {{authorized}} by President Harry S. Truman on 27 June 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's Director of Military Applications, Brigadier General James McCormack and his deputy, Captain James S. Russell, met with Bradbury and John Manley at Los Alamos on 9 July {{to make arrangements}} for the tests. They readily agreed {{that they would be}} scientific in nature, with Los Alamos supplying the technical direction and the armed forces providing supplies and logistical support. The cost of the tests, around $20 million, was divided between the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission. Lieutenant General John E. Hull was designated as test commander. Rear Admiral William S. Parsons and Major General William E. Kepner reprised their Operation Crossroads roles as deputy commanders. <b>Joint</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 7 was formally activated on 18 October 1947. As its commander, Hull was answerable to both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E
