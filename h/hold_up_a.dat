25|$|Josephus {{states that}} the cakes were placed in two equal piles (rather than rows), as does the Mishnah, which {{describes}} the existence of hollow golden tubes to carry air between the bread, and two golden fork-shaped supports attached to the table, each one to <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> pile Josephus also {{states that the}} frankincense was placed in two golden cups - {{one on top of}} each pile; the Mishnah states that a handful of incense was placed in each cup, and the Tosefta states that the cups, called bezikin, had flat bottoms/rims, so that they could also be placed on the table. According to the Mishnah, while the new bread was being carried in by the four priests, two other priests would carry in replacement cups of incense, and two further priests would go ahead of them to remove the old cups of incense.|$|E

25|$|In {{the absence}} through injury of Carr for {{the visit to}} Maribor, Ridgewell assumed the captaincy. Early in the game, Maribor had several shots off target, but they took a 29th-minute lead when Spector looped a casual back-pass which Colin Doyle missed entirely when {{attempting}} to clear. Dalibor Volaš picked up the loose ball and tapped into an empty net. The manner of the goal had a dampening effect on both players and fans. In the second half, Nikola Žigić and Wood were ready to come on as substitutes when King used his strength to <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> ball in midfield and played it through to Burke, who rounded Martin Milec and shot low past Jasmin Handanović. Only Žigić came on, to replace King. Both he and Wade Elliott missed chances, Žigić heading over the bar from close range and Elliott shooting straight at the goalkeeper when clean through. In the 79th minute, a long clearance was controlled by Morgaro Gomis who touched the ball to Elliott, possibly via a defender's arm. Elliott scored what proved the winning goal, hitting a clean volley from outside the area, which Handanovič partly blocked, {{but was unable to}} stop creeping underneath him.|$|E

She didn't just <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> mirror, she became the mirror". Barbara O'Dair from Rolling Stone also gave a positive review of the song, commenting that [...] "Madonna does a drive-by on her critics, complete with a keening synth line straight outta Dre", adding that [...] "Madonna's message is still 'Express yourself, don't repress yourself.' This time, however, it comes not with a bang but a whisper". Scott Kearnan of The Boston Globe included the track at number 11 on his list of [...] "30 Ultimate Madonna Singles", stating that the line [...] "Absolutely no regrets" [...] was a [...] "Madonna mantra {{if ever there was}} one".|$|E

500|$|The storyline {{was first}} {{conceived}} when EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown viewed {{a documentary about}} homelessness, featuring a mother and child {{at a bus stop}} with nowhere to go. Ashdown questioned what might happen if a child sex offender were to befriend the mother in order to grow closer to the child, and related the scenario to Bianca's return to the soap. BBC Head of Drama John Yorke explained that the idea when presented [...] "drew a sharp intake of breath. Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for." [...] Final approval for the storyline was sought from BBC Head of Fiction Jane Tranter on 2 June 2008. Tranter explained that: [...] "I thought it was a fantastically good idea. The big moments in EastEnders, those iconic pieces of television history, tend to be the things that are incredibly near the knuckle, and are actually quite difficult subjects to raise {{in the context of a}} family sitting room.

2500|$|Arbuthnot {{was one of}} the {{founding}} members of the Scriblerus Club, and was regarded by the other wits of the group as the funniest, but he left fewer literary remains than the other members. [...] His satires are written with an ease, a humanity, and an apparent sympathy. [...] Swift and Arbuthnot had similar styles in language (both preferred direct sentences and clear vocabulary) with a feigned frenzy of lists and taxonomies, and sometimes their works are attributed to each other. [...] The treatise on political lying, for example, has been attributed to Swift in the past, although it was definitely Arbuthnot's. [...] Generally, Arbuthnot's writings are not as vicious or nihilistic as Swift's, but they attack the same targets and both refuse to <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> set of positive norms for their readers.|$|E

The surface of the peninsula is generally level, broken by conical hills and glacial moraines usually not more than a few hundred feet tall. It is divided by a low water divide running north and south. The larger portion of the state is on the west of this and gradually slopes toward Lake Michigan.

Cruz gave a 21-hour Senate speech {{in an effort to}} <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> federal budget bill and therefore defund the Affordable Care Act. Cruz persuaded the House of Representatives and House Speaker John Boehner to include an ACA defunding provision in the bill. In the U.S. Senate, former Majority Leader Harry Reid Senate, blocked the filibuster attempt because only eighteen Republican Senators supported the filibuster. To supporters, the move [...] "signaled the depth of Cruz's commitment to rein in government". This move was extremely popular among Cruz supporters, with Rick Manning of Americans for Limited Government naming Cruz [...] "2013 Person of the Year" [...] in an op-ed in The Hill, for primarily his filibuster against the Affordable Care Act. Cruz was also named [...] "2013 Man of the Year" [...] by conservative publications TheBlaze, FrontPage Magazine and The American Spectator, [...] "2013 Conservative of the Year" [...] by Townhall.com, and [...] "2013 Statesman of the Year" [...] by the Republican Party of Sarasota County, Florida. He was a finalist for Time magazine's [...] "Person of the Year" [...] in 2013. To critics, including some Republican colleagues such as Senator Lindsey Graham, the move was ineffective.|$|E
