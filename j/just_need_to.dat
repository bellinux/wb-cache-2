He played in an FA Cup fourth round match against Championship team Derby County on 27 January 2007, in which he cleared an Arturo Lupoli header off the line, although Rovers lost 1–0. He played in both legs of Rovers' play-off semi-final victory over Lincoln City, which finished 7–4 on aggregate. He played in the 2007 League Two play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 26 May 2007, which Rovers won 3–1 against Shrewsbury Town, thus earning promotion to League One.

500|$|White was {{recalled}} to the Australian ODI and Twenty20 squads for the 2008 {{tour of the}} West Indies. He scored 10runs off 6balls in a rain-reduced 11-over Twenty20 contest, and in a 50-over tour {{match against}} University of West Indies Vice-Chancellor's XI, made 34 but remained wicket-less in his eight overs with the ball. By this stage in his career, White was generally considered a middle-order batsman who bowled a bit, but Australia captain Ponting saw {{his place in the}} team as that of the front-line spinner. [...] "White's obviously been picked as the spinner on this tour. We <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> keep exposing him to different situations and putting him under a bit more pressure. Hopefully he plays a big role for us during the series." [...] Despite Ponting's comments, he used White as the fourth-change bowler in the first ODI, bringing the slow left-arm spin of Michael Clarke on first. White conceded 32runs in his six overs without a breakthrough, and did not bowl at all in the second match, as Clarke claimed the man of the match award for his half-century and three wickets. [...] Although White scored 40* at quicker than a run a ball, the return of Andrew Symonds for the last three ODIs left White out of the team again.|$|E

Nomura stated in a 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly interview: [...] "Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... well, that's maybe too obvious." [...] While designing Final Fantasy VII, Nomura was frustrated with the [...] "perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love." [...] He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked [...] "Is it right to set such an example to people?" [...] Kitase concluded: [...] "In the real world things are very different. You <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> look around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, 'If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently.' These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith's death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not Hollywood." ...|$|E
