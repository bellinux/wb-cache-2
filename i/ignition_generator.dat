40|$|Experiment to {{determine}} {{exhaust gas emission}} and combustion characteristics of a compression <b>ignition</b> <b>generator</b> was carried out. The experiment used single cylinder four strokes direct injection engine which was fuelled with diesel and palm oil methyl ester of B 2 (blends 2 % palm oil methyl ester with 98 % diesel on a volume basis), B 5, B 7 and B 10. The experiment was conducted at a fixed engine speed of 3000 rpm and 50 % load with variety compression ratios of 16 : 1, 18 : 1, and 20 : 1 and 22 : 1. Optimum compression ratio, influence of compression ratio on specific fuel consumption and thermal efficiency were examined. Palm oil methyl ester produce better output when the engine operate with variable compression ratio. Specific fuel consumption decrease, NOx increase and thermal efficiency increase when optimum compression ratio of engine is operated...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages [102]- 104. In {{the field}} of {{elemental}} analysis, {{there is a great}} demand for versatile analytical systems. Recently, microwave-induced plasma (MIP) systems have been proven to produce useable atomic emission from aqueous halogens in the visible region. Because there is a trend of improved detection limits as the power applied to the plasma is increased, a logical step is to increase the applied power far beyond the 500 W limit of initial experiments. In this work, a modified TM₀₁₀ Beenakker cavity was used to maintain a helium kilowatt-plus MIP (KiP-MIP). Instrumental considerations of the microwave focusing device, power train, plasma torch design, microwave generator, sample introduction and optical system used in these studies are presented. Operational characteristics of plasma <b>ignition,</b> <b>generator</b> output, tuning procedures and data collection are thoroughly investigated. Results of plasma energy studies, including electron density and spectroscopic temperature, are discussed in comparison to previous systems. The analytical figures of merit for this system are determined. Detection limits and calibration curves for a number of metals and nonmetals are presented. Results of gas phase and aqueous sample introduction are investigated, conclusions drawn, and directions for further research suggested. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{pollutant}} emissions of a four-stroke spark <b>ignition</b> gas engine <b>generator</b> operating on biogas–LPG blends of varying excess air ratios and LPG concentrations were investigated in this paper. Experiments {{were carried out}} at a constant engine speed of 1400 rpm and a constant electric power output of 3. 5 kW. The experimental results showed that NOx emissions were elevated at an excess air ratio of around 1. 2 as the LPG concentration was increased. CO 2 emissions decreased as the excess air ratio and LPG concentration increased, due to lean-burn conditions and LPG combustion. These results demonstrated that the addition of LPG to biogas enabled the effective generation of electricity using a gas engine generator through lean-burn combustion. The adding of LPG of 0 %, 5 %, and 10 % in volume is interchangeable. Mixing inert gas such as N 2 and CO 2 in the end user side to increase the gas MN, thereby increasing its antiknock tendency, furthermore, the measures such as the installation of closed-loop control engine with oxygen sensor in the exhaust and adjust air-fuel ratio accurately and adjusting engine ignition timing, to adapt the changes in gas composition {{to ensure that the}} engine working conditions are not significantly affected, to meet the requirements of natural gas interchangeability...|$|R
50|$|Company {{executives}} {{quickly realized}} that great profit could be made supplying electrical gear for the growing automobile market. Vesta expanded into the production of <b>generators,</b> <b>ignition</b> batteries, headlights, lamps, and lighting. By 1902, the company needed a larger space to manufacture its products. Vesta relocated to 266 State Street, but only remained for three years until they decided to split office and manufacturing into separate facilities. In 1905, the company built a general office opened at 1336 Michigan Boulevard while they leased factory space at 1521 Wabash Avenue. These buildings {{were part of the}} emerging Motor Row District, a stretch of buildings from Wabash to Indiana Avenues from 12th Street to 26th Street.When the company again needed additional space, Vesta purchased the Mt. Sinai Temple on the southwest corner of 21st Street and Indiana Avenue. The temple was demolished, and in its place, Vesta built a four-story factory, the first built to the company's specifications. Chicago architect Carl M. Almquist was commissioned to design the building. All operations were again consolidated into the $80,000 building; offices were on the first floor while factory operations were in the basement and upper two stories. Vesta moved in in 1913. The rear of the building featured a service station where customers could bring their automobiles to have the batteries serviced. Vesta became a regional leader in battery production and produced the first battery-supplied electrical lighting for commercial trucks.|$|R
