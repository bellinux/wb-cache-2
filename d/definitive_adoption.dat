40|$|Using a new {{institutional}} economics perspective, {{this article}} analyses {{the economic and political}} context that led to accounting standardisation in Portugal from 1977 onwards and to the recent adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The process of accounting standardisation was related to the tax reform of 1963. Additionally, evidence was found that there were also political pressures related to the need to improve the national systems of accounts. The lack of development of the accounting profession and the emphasis on legality substantiated the need for enforcement in the law in 1977 of a standardised accounting plan that was similar to other plans in Europe, namely the French Plan. In a legalist country like Portugal, the modelling of national standards on the international ones and the <b>definitive</b> <b>adoption</b> of adapted IFRS in 2010 by unlisted companies had to be complemented by the enactment in law of the accounting regulations.

StithAdoption trends {{have shifted}} {{in the past}} two decades and as a result, could impact {{established}} assumptions about behavior problems among adopted children. A comprehensive meta-analysis was published in 2005 attempting to come to more <b>definitive</b> conclusions regarding <b>adoption</b> behavior and moderators of adoption behavior. However, the study used a sample from over a dozen countries over a 44 year span. This study is a meta-analysis that has replicated many of the questions investigated by the previous analysis with a much more recent 15 year sample of adoptees placed only within the United States. The results show that combined international and domestic adoptee samples, as well as separate international and domestic adoptee samples are more likely to have total, externalizing, and internalizing behavior problems than their non-adopted counterparts. In addition, age at time of assessment, gender of adoptees, and length of time spent with adoptive family may moderate some of the behavior problems experienced by adoptees. Pre-adoptive adversity, age at time of assessment, and study quality were not shown to have moderating influence on behavior of adoptees...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} the {{disclosure}} of confidential information regarding the origins of adoptees {{is one that has}} witnessed much discussion since the 1970 s. This discourse, however, failed to have an influence on Swiss Adoption Laws, which strictly adhered to the concept of confidential full adoption. It was only in 1992, stemming from debates on reproductive medicine, that the Constitution was amended to acknowledge the individual’s right to obtain information regarding his or her origins. This change in legislation concerning reproductive medicine and genetic engineering also had an effect on Adoption Laws. Without further distinguishment between these fields, this right to obtain information regarding origins should also now apply to adoptees. This article details how there first had to be a change in legislation relating to reproductive medicine before this right to information regarding an individual’s origins could finally be acknowledged and addressed in terms of adoption laws. How can it be explained that the relatively modern methods and laws concerning reproductive medicine have come to have such a <b>definitive</b> influence on <b>Adoption</b> Laws, even though the question concerning an adoptee’s right to obtain information regarding their origins is one that has plagued the ancient institution of adoption for a far longer period...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to verify the effect of {{conventional}} air chilling associated to intermittent spray-chilling treatment, on weight loss, physico-chemical and bacteriological quality of beef carcasses. Two plants of commercial beef slaughterhouse located in Goiânia and fiscalized by the Federal Inspection Service were used to develop the research. The spray-chilling treatment was accomplished in an intermittent way, commanded by a controlled logical program, with cycles of 90 seconds, in intervals of 30 minutes, during the first 4 hours of the chilling process. Physico-chemical and bacteriological analysis were made in spray-chilled water and carcasses samples, according to recommendation of the effective legislation. The average values of carcasses weight loss of treatment group were lower to the ones verified for the control group, in both plants, A and B, (P < 0, 001), showing a high economic potential. As a conclusion of physico-chemical and bacteriological analysis results of water and meat samples, it is clear that the technology of chilling beef carcasses in the conventional system associated to spraying did not interfere in the quality of meat, and it can become an analysis object on part of official organs for sanitary regulation and fiscalization, for its <b>definitive</b> <b>adoption...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the economic impact}} of the European Union Emission TradingScheme (EU ETS) for carbon on wholesale electricity prices in France and Germanyduring the Kyoto commitment period (2008 - 2012). We identify a structural breakoccurred on the carbon spot price series in October 2008, which is mainly resultingfrom the financial and economic crisis. We find that the price of carbon does not matterfor electricity prices in either countries before October 2008. Electricity producers inboth countries were facing uncertainties regarding the future of the EU ETS and thusadopted a wait and see attitude until the end of 2008. The communication of nationalallocation plans (NAPs) in late October 2008, and the <b>definitive</b> <b>adoption</b> of the EuropeanUnion climate and energy package by the European Parliament in December 2008 puts an end to these uncertainties. We find also that after October 2008, electricityproducers in both countries were constrained to include the carbon price in their costfunctions. During that period, French electricity producers were more constrained thantheir German counterparts, the elasticity of the electricity price relative to the price ofcarbon being higher in France than in Germany. By comparing the results with those inKirat and Ahamada [2011] concerning {{the first phase of the}} EU ETS we conclude thatthe changes in the EU ETS introduced in phase II (banking and lower allowances inNAPs) have rendered the carbon market more efficient. Finally, we find a higher conditionalcorrelation between wholesale electricity prices in France and Germany duringthe second phase of the EU ETS reflecting more integrated French and German electricitymarket...|$|E
