40|$|Thesis (MIng (Computer and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 The need to characterise a PEM {{electrolyser}} {{is motivated}} by a South African hydrogen company. One of two electrochemical characterisation methods, namely the current interrupt method or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, is investigated to characterise the PEM electrolyser. Various literature sources {{can be found on}} the electrochemical characterisation methods. In this study the current interrupt method is used for the electrochemical characterisation of a PEM electrolyser. The current interrupt method is an electrical test method that will be used to obtain an <b>equivalent</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuit</b> model of the PEM electrolyser. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuit</b> model relates to various electrochemical characteristics such as the activation losses, the ohmic losses and the concentration losses. Two variants of the current interrupt method, namely the natural voltage response method and the current switching method, are presented. These methods are used to obtain two different <b>equivalent</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuit</b> models of the PEM electrolyser. The parameters of the first <b>equivalent</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuit,</b> namely the Randles cell, will be estimated with the natural voltage response method. The parameters of the second <b>equivalent</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuit,</b> namely the Randles-Warburg cell, will be estimated with the current switching method. Simulation models of the equivalent electric circuits are developed and tested. The simulation models are used to verify and validate the natural voltage response method and the current switching method. The parameters of the Randles cell simulation model is accurately calculated with the natural voltage response method. The parameters of the Randles-Warburg cell simulation model is accurately calculated with the current switching method. The natural voltage response method and the current switching method are also practically implemented. The results is used to indicate the various electrochemical characteristics of the PEM electrolyser. A Nafion 117 type membrane was tested with the current interrupt method. The membrane resistance parameters of Randles cell were estimated with the natural voltage response method. These values are validated with conductivity measurements found in literature. The results of the Randles- Warburg cell is validated with a system identification validation model. Master...|$|E
40|$|National audienceNonlinear {{methods are}} now {{widespread}} in medical and industrial applications of ultrasound. The harmonic generation within piezoelectric transducers {{needs to be}} quantified. This is particularly the case in nonlinear NDT where the nonlinearity of the medium only has to be identified. High precision measurements are then required that would spoiled by nonlinearity coming from the transducer itself. In the present work, quadratic nonlinear equations of a piezoelectric element are derived by the perturbation theory in onedimensionnal case. It is demonstrated that the nonlinear response can be represented by controlled sources of voltage and current in <b>equivalent</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuits.</b> This analysis allows the nonlinear response of a loaded piezoelectric transducer to be efficiently predicted. It is shown that the influence of these acoustic loads on the nonlinear effects such as distortion depends phenomenologically {{on the type of}} non-linearity that dominates in the piezoelectric element, i. e. mechanical or electromechanical.

40|$|Potentiodynamic {{electrochemical}} impedance spectroscopy (PDEIS) is {{a technique}} for simultaneous ac and dc electrochemical response investigation on the potential scale. Analogous to the potentiodynamic voltammetry, PDEIS gives the variation of the dc current and, additionally, the variation of impedance spectra in the same potential scan.

The vast majority of the models describe the discharge behavior of the battery; so far, the estimation of charging time has been in fact only marginally studied because the charging phase is regarded as a relatively controlled process compared to discharge. In this paper, we present a compact macro-model for the estimation of charging time under the most widely used charge protocol, i. e., Constant Current-Constant Voltage (CC-CV).

40|$|Capacitance {{measurements}} from cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic chronopotentiometry and {{calculation of}} capacitance from imaginary part of impedance {{are widely used}} in investigations of supercapacitors. The methods assume the supercapacitor is a capacitor, while real objects correspond to different <b>equivalent</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuits</b> and show various contributions of non-capacitive currents to the current which is used for calculation of capacitance. Specific capacitances which are presented in F g- 1 units in publications not always refer to electric capacitance. The inadequateness of the capacitance characterization has already resulted in groundless attribution to supercapacitors of various systems with electrochemical responses of poorly reversible electrochemical reactions. The number of publications that present false capacitances is terrible and still increases. A widespread neglect of energy dissipation in calculations of specific capacitance leads to further confusion in the characterization of supercapacitors.

40|$|Abstract We present {{experimental}} and theoretical results of electroporation of small patches of planar lipid bilayers {{by means of}} linearly rising current. The experiments were conducted on * 120 -lm-diameter patches of planar phospholipid bilayers. The steadily increasing voltage across the bilayer imposed by linearly increasing current led to electroporation of the membrane for voltages above a few hundred millivolts. This method shows new molecular mechanisms of electroporation. We recorded small voltage drops preceding {{the breakdown of the}} bilayer due to irreversible electroporation. These voltage drops were often followed by a voltage re-rise within a fraction of a second. Modeling the observed phenomenon by <b>equivalent</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuits</b> showed that these events relate to opening and closing of conducting pores through the bilayer. Molecular dynamics simulations performed under similar conditions indicate that each event is likely to correspond to the opening and closing of a single pore of about 5 nm in diameter, the conductance of which ranges in the 100 -nS scale.

The <b>equivalent</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuit</b> impedance under consideration is the RandleseWarburg (RW) cell and the parameters are obtained through the current interrupt (CI) method. The CI method consists of two parts, 1) the natural voltage response (NVR) method to model the Ohmic losses, and 2) the current switching (CS) method to model the activation and concentration losses. A simulation model of the RW cell is used to verify and validate the CI method. Thereafter, the CI method is practically implemented and the results presented. Results show that the Ohmic losses correlates well with existing literature. The paper furthermore illustrates the capability of the CI method to visually illustrate the RW impedance through Nyquist diagrams. Nyquist diagrams are used to illustrate the concentration losses and indicate the degradation state of the PEM at specific operating conditions.

Rectennae have theoretical efficiency over 90 %, well above that of current photovoltaic devices. They {{could be built}} by arraying nano- antennae combined with a self-assembled monolayer for DC current rectification. Gold nanoarrays were built to absorb light by plasmonic resonance by depositing a gold layer on CdSe tetrapods or directly growing nanowires via template synthesis; various alkanethiolates were explored as rectifying units. The tunneling properties of alkanethiolates on gold nanoarrays were examined by electrochemical analysis. Preliminary photocurrent tests show that electric currents can be induced at different optical frequencies depending on the aspect ratios of the nanoarrays. However, gold contributes as an enhancement rather than an active material. Furthermore, by fitting the impedance spectroscopy data with <b>equivalent</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuits,</b> the calculated tunneling barrier of the self-assembled monolayer on gold nanoarrays is ten times lower than on gold film, suggesting that the monolayer formed on gold nanoarrays is defective and cannot serve as a practical rectifying barrier.
