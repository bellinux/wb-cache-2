There are many parameters that influence the fretting <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomenon</b> out of which relative displacement, δ, normal load, nF, and tangential load tF, {{are the most important}} and consequently the most studied ones.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{applications}} of active control on flexible structures is the mitigation of vibrations to reduce stresses and consequently increase lifetime. However, except for a few particular cases, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomenon</b> has never been taken into account {{in the design of the}} control algorithm. Moreover, since fatigue is mainly a local effect, in some cases active control could even worsen the structure's integrity (e. g. consider local damage close to the actuators caused by control strategies requiring high control forces). For this reason, control is not able to achieve the best performance in terms of damage reduction and lifetime maximisation. This paper proposes an optimal active control designed to minimise fatigue damage on the structure. A model of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is introduced and included in the definition of the control parameters. The solution is firstly described from a theoretical point of view and then tested both numerically and experimentally, showing a significant improvement over state-of-the-art techniques...|$|E

Two jet configurations related to thermal <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomena</b> are investigated: • T-junction of circular tubes where a heated jet discharges into a cold main flow and • Rectangular jet marked by a scalar discharging into a main flow in a rectangular channel. The T-junction configuration is a classical test case for thermal <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomena.</b> The Vattenfall T-junction experiment was already subject of an OECD/NEA benchmark. A LES modelling and calculation strategy is developed and validated on this data. The rectangular-jet configuration is important for basic physical understanding and modelling and has been analyzed experimentally at CEA. The experimental work was focused on turbulent mixing between a slightly heated rectangular jet which is injected perpendicularly into the cold main flow of a rectangular channel. These experiments are analyzed for the first time with LES. The overall results show a good agreement between the experimental data and the CFD calculation. Mean values of velocity and temperature are well captured by both RANS calculation and LES. The range of critical frequencies and their amplitudes, however, are only captured by LES...|$|R

First, a decoupled thermo-structural Finite Element analysis has been performed to investigate low-cycle <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomena</b> due to the thermal loadings applied to the exhaust manifold. High/low temperature cycles causes stress-strain hysteresis loops in the manifold material whose related dissipated energy can be directly correlated to low-cycle thermal fatigue. Afterwards, a dynamic harmonic analysis has been performed aiming at investigating the existence of high-cycle <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomena</b> due to vibrational loading applied to the exhaust manifold during the duty cycle.

An ad-hoc methodology has been developed to superimpose thermo-structural results to dynamic harmonic analysis results. In particular, quasi-static thermo-structural results have been employed to identify the mean stress values of vibration fatigue cycles, while alternate stress values have been derived from harmonic analysis.

Despite its large application as load-bearing construction material, several aspects related to safe and optimal design {{are still under}} investigation and exploration, towards the full implementation of standardized and conservative rules of practical use. One of the main concerns {{in the design of}} this typically tensile brittle material is given by the rational estimation of static <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomena,</b> under the effects of multiple design loads. In this paper, careful consideration is paid to the Ultimate Limit State (ULS) resistance verification of structural glass elements under a combination of variable loads with assigned duration. Taking advantage of past literature contributions and existing design standards for glass, an assessment of several available formulations to account for the cumulative stress effects of combined design loads is first carried out by means of selected case studies and extended parametric analytical calculations. Based on the obtained results, an alternative, simplified but practical and rather accurate - compared to the exact theoretical model - linear formulation is also finally proposed to account for static <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomena</b> in load-bearing glass elements...|$|R

40|$|Trunk {{pipelines}} {{work under}} a cyclic dynamical mechanical load because when oil or gas is pumped, the pressure constantly changes - pulsates. Therefore, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{is a common}} reason of accidents. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomenon</b> more often happens in the zone of non-metallic inclusions concentration. To know how the characteristics of nonmetallic inclusions influence the probability of an accident the most modern research methods should be used. It is determined {{with the help of}} the modern research methods that the accident rate of welded joints of pipelines is mostly influenced by their morphological type, composition and size of nonmetallic inclusions, this effect is more important than the common level of pollution by non-metallic inclusions. The article presents the results of the investigations of welded joints, obtained after the use of different common welding materials. We used the methods, described in the state standards: scanning electronic microscopy, spectral microprobe analysis and nano-indentation. We found out that non-metallic inclusions act like stress concentrators because they shrink, forming a blank space between metal and nonmetallic inclusions; it strengthens the differential properties on this boundary. Nonmetallic inclusion is not fixed, it can move. The data that we have received mean that during welded joints’ contamination (with non-metallic inclusions) monitoring process, more attention should be paid to the content of definite inclusions, but not to total contamination...|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of early <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomena</b> in a gas pipeline {{is crucial in}} order to avoid catastrophic consequences. Therefore, appropriate inspection is needed to assess <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomena</b> in a gas pipeline system. Acoustic emission (AE) technology is expected to be suitable in this regard. This paper presents the monitoring and assessment of AE signatures of the fatigue mechanism of gas pipeline material, API 5 L X 70 steel. The stress amplitude of 65 %, 60 %, 58 % and 53 % of the ultimate tensile strength were done in order to observe AE activity during the fatigue mechanism. Field measurements were also done by investigating AE signatures of an operational gas pipeline for comparison purposes. Based on the correlation of the AE signatures and fatigue mechanism, {{it was found that the}} AE activities generated during the fatigue mechanism were divided into three different stages. Analysis of the AE features and statistical parameters have shown that the kurtosis values of the time domain AE signatures from the third stage of the fatigue mechanism were different from the field measurements. This results show that the application of the kurtosis was expected to be able to detect the time domain AE signatures from the crack stage...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Purpose. Fatigue is a {{physiological}} phenomenon which is permanently present at students {{because of the}} scholar demands. Excessive demands can cause pathological <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> which should be avoided. Subjects and method. The study included a group of 203 students from Dimitrie Cantemir Highschool in Iaşi. The teenagers were questioned {{about the presence of}} the <b>fatigue</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> Results. Fatigue is rarely present at 62. 6 % of the questioned students. During the week, this phenomenon appears especially at the beginning (22. 2 %) or {{in the middle of the}} week (34. 5 %). In a few cases it appears at the end of the week, as it should. Night sleep is only of 6 - 7 hours (37. 4 %) or 7 - 8 hours (36. 9 %), which is not enough. The insufficient number of sleeping hours can be paid by day sleep, but most of the responses are “rarely ” (50. 7 %). Active rest is represented by sport or other activities of choice. Sport is the only less attractive option- in most cases children allocate only 15 - 30 minutes a day for it (33. 5 %). They stay in front of the TV between 0. 5 and 1 hour (42. 9 %) and of the computer between 2 - 3 hours (44. 3 %) daily. Conclusions.
