40|$|<b>Book</b> reviewCan {{mathematics}} <b>be</b> used {{to inform}} legal analysis? This {{is not a}} ridiculous question. Law has certain superficial resemblances to mathematics. One might view the Constitution and various statutes as providing "axioms" for a deductive legal system. From these axioms judges deduce "theorems" consisting of interpretation of these axioms in certain situations. Often these theorems are built on previously "proven" theorems, i. e. earlier decisions of the court. Of course some of the axioms might change, and occasionally a theorem that was once true becomes false; the former is a common feature of mathematics, the latter, though theoretically not possible in mathematics (since a theorem is by definition true) {{has been known to}} happen in mathematical practice as well. So maybe mathematics can help law scholars. That is certainly what Michael Meyerson believes. <b>His</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> "premised on the belief that there are many legal ideas that can be explained or clarified by mathematics. ...|$|R

5|$|Setting out {{to write}} {{something}} on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages {{in the very early}} stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>books</b> <b>were</b> longer and hence required more writing time.

However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software.
