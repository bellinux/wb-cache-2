5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Mid-County Expressway, in 1996 the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include {{the entire length of the}} existing Northeast Extension, replacing PA 9. The Northeast Extension was built between 1955 and 1957 and was originally projected to continue past Clarks Summit to the New York border; however, I-81 was built between these two points instead. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States (surpassing Interstate 495 in Massachusetts), but it may someday be surpassed in length by Interstate 369 <b>in</b> <b>Texas.</b> <b>In</b> fact, it is longer than some mainline interstates (such as Interstate 83 in Maryland and Pennsylvania, Interstate 99 in Pennsylvania, Interstate 12 in Louisiana, Interstate 19 in Arizona, Interstate 97 in Maryland, and Interstate 2 in Texas). Additionally, its numbering is unusual, since auxiliary interstates beginning in even numbers are typically bypasses or loops rather than spurs.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{dolphins}} (at {{the time}} still often incorrectly {{referred to as}} fish or porpoises), primarily using harpoons and firearms, was considered a form of recreational hunting along {{the shores of the}} Gulf of Mexico <b>in</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>in</b> the late 19th and early 20th century. Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in Corpus Christi in the 1920s, with a promise to tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made, the excursion would be free of charge. The brutality of the practice started to spark animal welfare concerns and there is no reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|In November 2007, {{the city}} of Laredo, Texas, issued an arrest warrant for Treviño in {{connection}} with a 2006 double homicide <b>in</b> <b>Texas.</b> <b>In</b> 2008, Treviño Morales and Lazcano Lazcano, the two leaders of Los Zetas, forged an alliance with the Beltrán Leyva Cartel. It had just gone to war with the Sinaloa Cartel, believing that El Chapo Guzmán, their leader, had betrayed them. Treviño Morales subsequently joined them to kill the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. Government sources said Los Zetas were fighting for control against La Federación (The Federation), an alliance of several drug trafficking groups led by Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán and Ismael El Mayo Zambada, two drug lords who used to work for the Beltrán Leyva Cartel.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Laffoon {{moved to}} San Antonio, Texas, where {{he opened a}} law {{practice}} and managed a citrus fruit business near Galveston. Though he had intended {{this to be a}} permanent relocation, while on a visit to family a few months later, friends urged him to return to Kentucky, and he obliged after only three months <b>in</b> <b>Texas.</b> <b>In</b> 1921, he sought election to the bench of the Fourth District Circuit Court. In the primary, he defeated Trice Bennett, a candidate from Princeton, and went on to face Republican incumbent Carl Henderson of Marion. In the general election on November 8, 1921, Laffoon defeated Henderson, carrying every county in the district. In his first term, only 7 percent of his decisions were reversed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was a record for the Fourth District at the time. He was re-elected for a second six-year term in 1927.|$|E

5|$|Monroe Edwards (1808– January 27, 1847) was an American slave trader, forger {{and convicted}} {{criminal}} {{who was the}} subject of a well-publicized trial and conviction in 1842. Originally from Kentucky, Edwards moved to New Orleans then settled in Texas. He smuggled slaves into Brazil in 1832, and used the proceeds to purchase land <b>in</b> <b>Texas.</b> <b>In</b> 1836 he was again smuggling slaves, this time into Texas. After attempting to swindle his partner out of the profits of the venture, partly with forged documents, Edwards was forced to flee the Republic of Texas to the United States. He then tried to scam money out of various abolitionists in the United States and the United Kingdom, partly with forged letters of introduction. He traveled to the United Kingdom, but his schemes were mainly unsuccessful and he returned to the United States in mid-1841.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly elected}} Texian {{delegates to the}} Convention of 1836 quickly signed a Declaration of Independence on March 2, forming the Republic of Texas.

5|$|The state's {{conservative}} {{white voters}} began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century. After this period, they supported Republicans for {{local and state}} offices as well, and most whites became Republican Party members. The party also attracted some minorities, but many have continued to vote for Democratic candidates. The shift to the Republican Party is much-attributed {{to the fact that}} the Democratic Party became increasingly liberal during the 20th century, and thus increasingly out-of-touch with the average Texas voter. As Texas was always a conservative state, voters switched to the GOP, which now more closely reflected their beliefs. Commentators have also attributed the shift to Republican political consultant Karl Rove, who managed numerous political campaigns <b>in</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s and 1990s. Other stated reasons included court-ordered redistricting and the demographic shift in relation to the Sun Belt that favored the Republican Party and conservatism.|$|E

5|$|In May 2009, Leaf {{was indicted}} on {{burglary}} and controlled-substance charges in Texas. He {{was in a}} drug-rehabilitation program in British Columbia {{at the time of}} the indictment, and was arrested by customs agents at the border on his return to the U.S as he was intending to fly to Texas to surrender on the indictment. However, his attorney Jeffrey A. Lustick successfully blocked the fugitive warrant extradition process, therefore legally allowing Leaf to go to Texas on his own. Lustick later successfully got the Washington fugitive action against Leaf dismissed with prejudice. On June 17, he posted a $45,000 bond in Washington state for the criminal charges <b>in</b> <b>Texas.</b> <b>In</b> April 2010, he pleaded guilty in Amarillo, Texas to seven counts of obtaining a controlled substance by fraud and one count of delivery of a simulated controlled substance, all felonies. State District Judge John B. Board sentenced him to ten years of probation and fined him $20,000.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{can cause}} {{opportunistic}} infections in weakened or immunocompromised humans. It is most {{commonly associated with}} bacteremic cellulitis, but {{has been known to}} cause endocarditis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. The first recognized cases of human infection occurred <b>in</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>in</b> 1991 and in Ottawa in 1994, but the sources of infection were not determined. Human infection with S.iniae was also identified in Toronto between 15 and 20 December 1995, when three Asian patients were admitted to a hospital with cellulitis of the hand after injuring themselves while handling raw fish. All three were found to have bacteremia, initially attributed to Streptococcus uberis, but later correctly identified as S.iniae. In February 1996, a Chinese man was admitted to the same hospital with sepsis one week after preparing a fresh whole tilapia, and was also diagnosed with S.iniae bacteremia. A subsequent epidemiological investigation found other cases in the Toronto area, for a total of nine patients; all were of Asian descent and all had handled raw fish (mostly tilapia) before developing infection. Other cases were later identified in the United States and elsewhere in Canada, and have since been reported in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore). Asian descent is a common trend in the majority of invasive human cases, but it is unknown whether this is due to inherent differences in immunity or because of cultural differences in the fish preparation which lend themselves to a higher incidence of infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins and}} {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between the}} three main groups of amphibians {{is a matter of}} debate. A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on rDNA analysis, suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs. It also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic (around 250 million years ago), before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fish. The briefness of this period, and the swiftness with which radiation took place, would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils. There are large gaps in the fossil record, but the discovery of a proto-frog from the Early Permian <b>in</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>in</b> 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs. Molecular analysis suggests that the frog–salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates. Newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all Lissamphibians lived about 315 million years ago, and that stereospondyls are the closest relatives to the caecilians.|$|E
