The light output was focused and detected by a photosensor module containing a metal package PMT and a high-voltage power supply circuit (Hamamatsu H 10721 - 210) operating directly on the surface of each LED. The same PMT voltages of the TREL measurement were applied for the two LEDs. The parasitic capacitance in the test circuit would introduce the same RC delay for the two LEDs.

40|$|Near-field optical {{microscopy}} has attracted remarkable attention, {{as it is}} the only technique that allows the investigation of local optical properties with a resolution far below the diffraction limit. Especially, the scattering-type near-field {{optical microscopy}} allows the nondestructive examination of surfaces without restrictions to the applicable wavelengths. However, its usability is limited by the availability of appropriate light sources. In the context of this work, this limit was overcome by the development of a scattering-type near-field microscope that uses a widely tunable free-electron laser as primary light source. In the theoretical part, it is shown that an optical near-field contrast can be expected when materials with different dielectric functions are combined. It is derived that these differences yield different scattering cross-sections for the coupled system of the probe and the sample. Those cross-sections define the strength of the near-field signal that can be measured for different materials. Hence, an optical contrast can be expected, when different scattering cross-sections are probed. This principle also applies to vertically stacked or even buried materials, as shown in this thesis experimentally for two sample systems. In the first example, the different dielectric functions were obtained by locally changing the carrier concentration in silicon by the implantation of boron. It is shown that the concentration of free charge-carriers can be deduced from the near-field contrast between implanted and pure silicon. For this purpose, two different experimental approaches were used, a non-interferometric one by using variable wavelengths and an interferometric one with a fixed wavelength. As those techniques yield complementary information, they can be used to quantitatively determine the effective carrier concentration. Both approaches yield consistent results for the carrier concentration, which excellently agrees with predictions from literature. While the structures of the first system were in the micrometer regime, the capability to probe buried nanostructures is demonstrated at a sample of <b>indium</b> arsenide quantum <b>dots.</b> Those dots are covered by a thick layer of gallium arsenide. For the first time ever, it is shown experimentally that transitions between electron states in single quantum dots can be investigated by near-field microscopy. By monitoring the near-field response of these quantum dots while scanning the wavelength of the incident light beam, it was possible to obtain characteristic near-field signatures of single dots. Near-field contrasts up to 30 % could be measured for resonant excitation of electrons in the conduction band of the <b>indium</b> arsenide <b>dots...</b>|$|R

This procedure allows for the recording of the quantum dot emission from carrier diffusion between sample positions separated by more than 6 μm. In the multiple-matched mode, the excitation spot overlaps the four-core emission area. This configuration permits the acquisition of the micro-photoluminescence spectra at different sample positions without scanning.

The comparison between GaN-capped and uncapped InN QDs kept at room conditions during 36 months indicates the structural changes that take place. While the capping layer seems to act in a protective way avoiding any change in the QDs, the uncapped structures suffer a series of phase transformations, where the original wurtzite structure is replaced by a layer of cubic phases. The main constituent of this layer is shown to be bcc-In 2 O 3 formed by the substitution of the nitrogen atoms by oxygen from the atmosphere. This supposes a transformation from a hexagonal to a cubic structure, explained by the existence of an oxygen-rich cubic InN acting as an intermediate phase.

The main {{difference is the}} product neither precipitates as a bulk solid nor remains dissolved. [...] Heating the solution at high temperature, the precursors decompose forming monomers which then nucleate and generate nanocrystals. Temperature is {{a critical factor in}} determining optimal conditions for the nanocrystal growth. It must be high enough to allow for rearrangement and annealing of atoms during the synthesis process while being low enough to promote crystal growth. The concentration of monomers is another critical factor that has to be stringently controlled during nanocrystal growth. The growth process of nanocrystals can occur in two different regimes, [...] "focusing" [...] and [...] "defocusing". At high monomer concentrations, the critical size (the size where nanocrystals neither grow nor shrink) is relatively small, resulting in growth of nearly all particles. In this regime, smaller particles grow faster than large ones (since larger crystals need more atoms to grow than small crystals) resulting in [...] "focusing" [...] of the size distribution to yield nearly monodisperse particles. The size focusing is optimal when the monomer concentration is kept such that the average nanocrystal size present is always slightly larger than the critical size. Over time, the monomer concentration diminishes, the critical size becomes larger than the average size present, and the distribution [...] "defocuses".There are colloidal methods to produce many different semiconductors.

A major obstacle for this scalability is the monolithic integration of quantum light sources with the photonic circuit on a single chip. This dissertation presents the experimental demonstration of different in-plane single photon sources that allow for this integration with planar light circuits.

To this end, the propagation of light in {{photonic crystal}}s, {{and the creation of}} cavities by making defects in the photonic crystal lattice, is discussed. By drawing an analogy with Fabry-Perot etalons, the mechanism of light confinement in these cavities is explained. It is shown that by engineering the immediate cavity neighborhood, the mirror reflectivities can be increased, resulting in a very high quality factor (Q) and low mode volume. Photonic crystal cavity designs used in this thesis are introduced, along with numerically computed data of their performance. Device fabrication in gallium arsenide wafers is described in detail, with special attention to address factors that lead to a lack of reproducibility. Over the course of this thesis effort, several thousand cavities were fabricated, and a wide range of Qs were recorded. Careful experiments were performed to determine the causes of low Qs, both at the wafer growth level, and at the fabrication level. Technological improvements in wafer growth are reported, as well as fabrication techniques to improve cavity Q. These cavities contain <b>indium</b> arsenide quantum <b>dots</b> (QDs) as internal light sources. Cavity-induced enhancement of QD light emission is discussed, along with interferometric measurements of photon correlations.

To conclude, a novel application of high-Q cavities is discussed, that of an electrically-pumped laser fabricated in a 1 D nanobeam cavity. The salient feature of such a geometry is that a high Q is retained even with the introduction of gold in the cavity vicinity.

Results on ultrathin layers of nominal GaAs on InGaAs show how an interplay between surface coarsening and chemical intermixing lead to a relaxation of strain from the nominal 3. 7 % tensile misfit strain. The strain is found to increase continuously from the interface, {{where most of the}} strain is relieved due to Indium incorporation into the GaAs film, to a maximum {{at the top of the}} film of 0. 7 %(Tdeposition(GaAs) = 480 C) and 1. 0 %(Tdeposition(GaAs) = 520 C). The structure of uncapped epitaxial InAs quantum dots grown using the Stranski-Krastanow method on GaAs(001) reveal that the dots contain significant amounts of Ga with the Ga concentration decreasing from 50 % at the base of the dots to 0 % at the top of the dots. A contraction of the out-of-plane lattice constant at the dot-substrate interface to about 3. 5 A is observed. The out-of-plane lattice spacing in the dot region is found to be GaAs-like.

To achieve early detection of cancer disease the discovery of specific, sensitive and reliable biomarkers is required. Telomerase is a ribonucleo-protein complex that has been identified as an important target for cancer diagnostics and cancer therapy, because 85 % of more than 950 primary tumours express telomerase activity. The standard method for the detection and quantification of telomerase activity is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based assay known as the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. TRAP and other methods developed for telomerase detection have limitations for example its time consuming, requires complicated machinery, expensive equipment and reagents thus {{there is a need for}} a more sensitive, reliable and high-throughput method. Electrochemical biosensors are quickly emerging as an alternative for early detection of cancer because they can be designed to detect developing cancer biomarkers and to allow improved monitoring of cancer growth and patient therapy. This research study reported for the first time the successful fabrication and implementation of highly sensitive 3 -mercaptopropionic acid <b>indium</b> telluride quantum <b>dots</b> (3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs) based genosensor for detection of telomerase biomarker. The colloidal poly-dispersed 3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs introduced into the genosensor system were successfully synthesized by a simple, inexpensive and reproducible aqueous method. The as prepared 3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs was characterized by Ultraviolet Visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy, Fluorescence (FL) spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and High Resolution Transmission/Scanning Electron Microscopy (HR TEM/SEM). Electro-analysis of 3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs was done by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). HR-TEM studies revealed formation of small sized QDs about 6 nm in diameter while UV-VIS studies showed presence of iv absorption peaks in the ultraviolet region (100 - 400 nm) which confirmed the formation of these small sized QDs. The good electrochemical, optical, physical and chemical properties of the 3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs allowed them to be used as a mediating platform between deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and gold electrode (AuE). The successful detection of telomerase was achieved by hybridization process between the probe single stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) drop coated on the 3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs/AuE surface and its complementary ssDNA in biological buffer solution (0. 10 M tris-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (TE) buffer solution, pH 8. 00). The response of the 3 MPA-In 2 Te 3 QDs based genosensor towards different concentration of complementary ssDNA was studied by CV, square wave voltammetry (SWV) and EIS. It was observed that all three analytical techniques exhibited good linearity since their linear correlation coefficients (R 2) corresponded to 0. 99. However, it was observed that EIS was the best technique for the detection of telomerase compared to both CV and SWV since it showed a higher sensitivity (2. 44 Ω/nM) towards detecting telomerase with a detection limit as low as 0. 00014 ng/mL. Control experiments were also carried out by monitoring the hybridization process in the presence and absence of complementary ssDNA and it was determined that the QDs based genosensor was highly selective towards complementary ssDNA. In view of the attractive analytical characteristics and advantages, the ultimate goal of the developed QDs based genosensor is to apply it in real clinical samples of cancer cells or bodily fluids of cancer patients for the detection of telomerase cancer biomarker...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this work is the {{fundamental}} growth, tailoring and characterization of self-organized <b>indium</b> arsenide quantum <b>dots</b> (QDs) and their exploitation as active region for diode lasers emitting in the 1. 55 µm range. This wavelength regime is especially interesting for long-haul telecommunications as optical fibers made from silica glass have the lowest optical absorption. Molecular Beam Epitaxy is utilized as fabrication technique for the quantum dots and laser structures. The results presented in this thesis depict the first experimental work for which this reactor was used at the University of Kassel. Most {{research in the field}} of self-organized quantum dots has been conducted in the InAs/GaAs material system. It {{can be seen as the}} model system of self-organized quantum dots, but is not suitable for the targeted emission wavelength. Light emission from this system at 1. 55 µm is hard to accomplish. To stay as close as possible to existing processing technology, the In(AlGa) As/InP (100) material system is deployed. Depending on the epitaxial growth technique and growth parameters this system has the drawback of producing a wide range of nano species besides quantum dots. Best known are the elongated quantum dashes (QDash). Such structures are preferentially formed, if InAs is deposited on InP. This is related to the low lattice-mismatch of 3. 2 %, which is less than half of the value in the InAs/GaAs system. The task of creating round-shaped and uniform QDs is rendered more complex considering exchange effects of arsenic and phosphorus as well as anisotropic effects on the surface that do not need to be dealt with in the InAs/GaAs case. While QDash structures haven been studied fundamentally as well as in laser structures, they do not represent the theoretical ideal case of a zero-dimensional material. Creating round-shaped quantum dots on the InP(100) substrate remains a challenging task. Details of the self-organization process are still unknown and the formation of the QDs is not fully understood yet. In the course of the experimental work a novel growth concept was discovered and analyzed that eases the fabrication of QDs. It is based on different crystal growth and ad-atom diffusion processes under supply of different modifications of the arsenic atmosphere in the MBE reactor. The reactor is equipped with special valved cracking effusion cells for arsenic and phosphorus. It represents an all-solid source configuration that does not rely on toxic gas supply. The cracking effusion cell are able to create different species of arsenic and phosphorus. This constitutes the basis of the growth concept. With this method round-shaped QD ensembles with superior optical properties and record-low photoluminescence linewidth were achieved. By systematically varying the growth parameters and working out a detailed analysis of the experimental data a range of parameter values, for which the formation of QDs is favored, was found. A qualitative explanation of the formation characteristics based on the surface migration of In ad-atoms is developed. Such tailored QDs are finally implemented as active region in a self-designed diode laser structure. A basic characterization of the static and temperature-dependent properties was carried out. The QD lasers exceed a reference quantum well laser in terms of inversion conditions and temperature-dependent characteristics. Pulsed output powers of several hundred milli watt were measured at room temperature. In particular, the lasers feature a high modal gain that even allowed cw-emission at room temperature of a processed ridge wave guide device as short as 340 µm with output powers of 17 mW. Modulation experiments performed at the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) showed a complex behavior of the QDs in the laser cavity. Despite the fact that the laser structure is not fully optimized for a high-speed device, data transmission capabilities of 15 Gb/s combined with low noise were achieved. To the best of the author`s knowledge, this renders the lasers the fastest QD devices operating at 1. 55 µm. The thesis starts with an introductory chapter that pronounces the advantages of optical fiber communication in general. Chapter 2 will introduce the fundamental knowledge that is necessary to understand the importance of the active region`s dimensions for the performance of a diode laser. The novel growth concept and its experimental analysis are presented in chapter 3. Chapter 4 finally contains the work on diode lasers...|$|R
