50|$|The mullets or <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> are {{a family}} (Mugilidae) of ray-finned fish found {{worldwide}} in coastal temperate and tropical waters, and some species in fresh water.

5000|$|The {{family name}} and the English common name [...] "mullet" [...] name are derived from Latin mullus, the red mullet; but other than the red mullet and the striped red mullet or surmullet, the English word mullet {{generally}} refers to a different family of fish, the Mugilidae or <b>grey</b> <b>mullets.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> are all morphologically very similar, making {{identification}} and classification problematic. With {{the advent of}} molecular biology the relationships within the wider family Mugilidae have been clarified and Liza {{has been found to}} be paraphyletic which has led to a new proposals being suggested, with the genus Planiliza being resurrected to include the Indo-Pacific species of Liza and Chelon and Paramugil parmatus while Liza falcipinnis is moved to the new genus Neochelon and the genus Gracilimugil is ressurrected for Liza argentea.|$|E

5000|$|The {{flathead}} <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> (Mugil cephalus) is {{an important}} food fish species in the mullet family Mugilidae. It is found in coastal tropical and subtropical waters worldwide. [...] Its length is typically 30 to 75 cm.

50|$|Virtually any {{fish can}} be {{prepared}} as daing. The species of fish used is usually identified by name when sold in markets. For example, in Cebu, the local specialty which uses rabbitfish (Siganus spp., locally known as danggit), is called buwad danggit. Other fish species used include threadfin breams (Nemipteridae, locally known as bisugo); <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> (Mugilidae, locally known as banak); and sardines (Sardinella spp. and Dussumieria acuta, locally known as tunsoy or tamban). Daing made from sardines are usually dried whole, though exported variants may be gutted to comply with food laws in other countries. Cuttlefish and squid may also be prepared this way (Tagalog: daing na pusit; Cebuano: bulad pusit).|$|E

Common fillings include ground beef, shiitake mushrooms, cucumber, crumbled tofu, chopped scallions, minced garlic and toasted and ground sesame seeds. The inner surface of each fish slice is dusted with mung bean starch, the filling is placed on it and it is then folded in half and sealed. The edges of the dumplings are trimmed with kitchen scissors to create the half-moon shapes. The dumplings are then coated with mung bean starch, and cooked either in boiling water or in the steamer lined with Boston ivy leaves. Cooked dumplings are commonly served with a dipping sauce such as mustard or choganjang (soy sauce mixed with vinegar).|$|E
50|$|The {{invasion}} of new Red Sea species into the Mediterranean has also facilitated the {{invasion of}} their associated parasites, for example the copepod Eudactylera aspera was found on a spinner shark Carcharhinus brevipinna taken off Tunisia, the copepod had originally been described from specimens taken from C. brevipinna off Madagascar and its finding in the Mediterranean has arguably confirmed the previously disputed status of C. brevipinna as a Lessepsian migrant. In addition the parasites originating in the Red Sea have shown an ability to use related native Mediterranean fish species as alternative hosts; e.g. the copepod Nipergasilus bora was known to parasitise the <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> Mugil cephalus and Planiliza carinata in the Red Sea, both taxa having been recorded as Lesepsian migrants, and was subsequently found parasitizing the native Mediterranean mullets Chelon aurata and Chelon labrosus.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 127 {{specimens}} of <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> (Teleostea: Mugilidae) from the Mistras Lagoon (Sardinia - western Mediterranean) were examined for metazoan parasites. Five species of <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> were found: Chelon labrosus, Liza aurata, L. ramada, L. saliens and Mugil cephalus. Forty-one species of parasites were identified: 14 monogeneans, 5 crustaceans, 18 digeneans, 3 nematodes and 1 acanthocephalan; 26 {{of them being}} reported from Sardinia for the first time. Findings of faunal interest are: Ergenstrema sp. (Monogenea) in L. saliens; Caligus pageti (Crustacea) in L. aurata and L. saliens; Saturnius sp.

40|$|Grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) {{can adapt}} to saline and freshwater. Although belonged to {{euryhaline}} species, but information regarding their stress response on low temperature. Environmental disturbance such as low water temperature may effect their physiological condition. These {{information can be}} useful for aquaculture development of this species in freshwater. Therefore, the purpose of study was to investigate the effects of low water temperature on the stress response of <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> Mugil cephalus acclimated in freshwater. The blood samples of experimental fish (TL: 28. 2 ± 1. 1 cm, BW: 198. 6 ± 25. 9 g) were collected during winter season when the water temperature of controlled rearing system was stable at 25 °C and uncontrolled rearing system slowly dropped until 12 °C. Their stress response on both rearing systems was observed. The results showed that low temperature affected to lower the behavior activity and increase the stress response of <b>grey</b> <b>mullets.</b> The breath frequency of grey mullet regarding their opercular movement at 12 °C was 74 - 97 breath/min., while at 25 °C it was 95 - 114 breath/min. Hematocrit (Ht) and hemoglobin (Hb) were shown higher values of 43. 5 % and 9. 5 g/dL, respectively at 25 °C than 12 °C (28. 0 % and 7. 1 g/dL, respectively). The tendencies of cortisol and glucose level increased with the lowering temperature, showing higher value of 264. 8 ng/mL and 35. 5 mg/dL in 12 °C than 5. 5 ng/mL and 32. 7 mg/dL in 25 °C. The chemical properties of blood in <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> showed same tendency comparing between 12 °C and 25 °C, there was no significant different between each temperature, except for chloride (P< 0. 05).

However, the results showed lower values at 12 °C in every blood components, except for chloride. In conclusion, lowering water temperature to 12 °C had impact as stressor to the behavior and stress response of <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> acclimated in freshwater...|$|E

Stable isotope signatures (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) of the fishes followed a pattern, with enrichments in 13 C and 15 N to increasing length: δ 13 C in fishes 30 mm δ 13 C ranged from - 15. 8 to - 12. 7 ‰, closer to the level in salt marsh food resources. Large differences between the δ 15 N values of mullets and those of food sources (6. 0 ‰ on average) showed that YoY are secondary consumers, like older individuals, when feeding in the salt marsh. YoY mullets shift from browsing on pelagic prey to grazing on benthic resources from the salt marsh before reaching 30 mm in length.
