According to journalist Seymour Hersh and NBC News, however, the U.S. was tipped off about bin Laden's location by a Pakistani intelligence officer who offered details of where the Pakistani <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Service</b> held him in detention {{in exchange for a}} bounty.|$|E

5|$|Early in most plots Bond {{is called}} in to see M, {{the head of the}} UK's Secret <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Service</b> (also known as MI6) in his or her office to receive his assignment.

M typically shows confidence in the service's best agent but feels a need to rein in Bond for his risky methods and often chides him for his indiscretions.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and {{continuing}} throughout the 1980s, {{the intensity of}} Bahrain's political situation sharply increased. Al-Jamri, who was then participating in several petitions, was questioned multiple times and put under strict surveillance by the Security and <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Service.</b> In 1984, the Islamic Enlightenment institution, with which al-Jamri was associated, was closed by the government. The government also closed other places of meeting and prohibited public seminars. Al-Jamry however opened his house for daily meetings, also offering a weekly space for public debates; he continued to do so despite several government attempts to stop him.|$|E

The British government supplied the Iranians with materials for chemical weapons {{in order to gain}} intelligence on Iran's military programme. Tomlinson's description of his Iranian activities are generally considered to be true, due to his personal involvement and knowledge of details that only an insider would know.|$|E
