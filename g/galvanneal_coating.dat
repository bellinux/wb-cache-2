40|$|Galvanneal {{steel is}} {{considered}} to be better for automotive applications than its counterpart, galvanized steel, mainly because of its superior coating and surface properties. Galvanneal steel is produced by hot dipping sheet steel in a bath of molten zinc with small, controlled, levels of aluminium, followed by annealing which creates a Fe-Zn intermetallic layer. This intermetallic layer of the coating improves spot weldability and improves subsequent paint appearance. However, if the microstructure of the coating is not properly controlled and forming parameters are not properly selected, wear of the coating could occur during stamping. Frictional sliding of the sheet between the tool surfaces results in considerable amount of coating loss. An Interstitial Free steel with a <b>Galvanneal</b> <b>coating</b> of nominally 60 g/m 2 was used for the laboratory experiments. Flat Face Friction (FFF) tests were performed with different forming conditions and lubricants to simulate the frictional sliding in stamping. Glow-Discharge Optical Emission Spectrometry (DG-OES) was used to measure the change in the coating thickness during sliding. Optical microscopy was considered for imaging the surfaces as well as an optical method to compare the changes in the coating thickness during the forming. The change to the <b>Galvanneal</b> <b>coating</b> thickness was found to be a function of forming parameters. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS) are being increasingly incorporated into automotive body structure to reduce vehicular weight without adversely affecting crashworthiness. Ultra-{{high strength}} steel (UHSS), a sub-set of AHSS, possess excellent anti-intrusion properties which make them very suitable for fabricating crash relevant automotive structures. The steel is usually coated {{as a necessary}} preparation for further processing. During resistance spot welding, the principal joining method for body-in-white automotive structures, the contact resistance, which is principally determined by {{the properties of the}} coating, play key role in defining welding parameters, thermal profiles, microstructure and eventually, sometimes, mechanical properties of the joint. 	In this work, the contact resistance associated with AlSi and galvannealed coatings on Usibor 1500 hot stamping steel were determined using their dynamic resistance profiles. The results showed significant differences in the contact resistance values associated with the different coatings, and the trend in these values represented trends in current requirements for attaining acceptable nuggets sizes during resistance spot welding. Although peak load for tensile shear loading in static mode was similar for the AlSi and <b>galvannealed</b> <b>coated</b> sheets, there were significant differences in failure mode transition characteristics and energy absorption capabilities associated with the different coatings. Moreover, it was found that joints formed from dissimilar combinations of AlSi and <b>galvannealed</b> <b>coated</b> sheets exhibited poorer mechanical properties than either of AlSi or <b>galvannealed</b> <b>coated</b> sheets...|$|R

40|$|Galvanneal {{is a form}} of {{zinc-coated}} sheet steel, where {{steel is}} dipped in molten zinc, and then heat treated in a furnace to produce a complex iron-zinc coating. Many industries, such as automotive, use galvanneal for components fabricated from sheet steel. The microstructural properties of galvanneal have a significant influence on how well the sheet metal changes shape on stamping. By means of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and glow-discharge optical emission spectrometry, we present a study of the microstructure of several galvanneal samples, both stamped and unformed, relating the phases and morphology of the coatings to performance in stamping operations. Samples of galvanneal were subjected to different heat-treatment temperatures. The frequency of defects in stamped components was found {{to be related to the}} average alloy content in the coatings, which varied with furnace temperature. An increased average iron content in the coatings was related to increased powdering defects in stamping operations that use <b>galvanneal</b> <b>coated</b> sheet steel. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of the exposure to humidity and UV radiation (UVCON test) of an organic coating (lacquer) containing chromating reagents applied on galvanised steel, galvanneal and galfan substrates. An attempt is made to establish possible relationships between the degradation of the lacquered surface during its exposure and {{the presence or absence of}} alloying elements on the original zinc-based substrate. With the galvanised steel and galfan coatings, 60 days of exposure to the UVCON test are necessary for a slight reduction in the lacquer content to be observed. Removal of the lacquer leaves the Cr(III) formed on the surface of the zinc-based substrate exposed. With the galfan coating, the chromate layer grows on the initial aluminium oxide film. With the <b>galvanneal</b> <b>coating,</b> in contrast to the lacquered galvanised steel and galfan, 15 days are sufficient for detachment of the lacquer to be observed. Longer exposure times lead to an appreciable increase in the percentage of lacquer removed. Surprisingly, the chromate layer remains on the surface of the <b>galvanneal</b> <b>coating,</b> preventing its corrosion, even after 60 days of exposure. XPS data suggest the presence of Cr-O-C type bonds at the interface, due to the oxidation of the lacquer surface associated with the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), which contribute significantly to the increase in lacquer adhesion. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{possibilities}} {{offered by}} the EIS technique for studying the progress of corrosion in several types of galvanised coatings were investigated. Corrosion tests were performed in a 3 wt. % NaCl aqueous solution, at approximately neutral pH, without stirring and {{in contact with the}} air. A tendency was seen towards an electrochemical overestimation of the corrosion values of essentially pure zinc and Zn- 5 %Al (Galfan) coatings compared with the gravimetric reference values. In contrast, the opposite tendence was revealed with the Zn- 10 %Fe (<b>Galvanneal)</b> <b>coating.</b> These deviations have made it necessary to use empirical values of the constant B of the Stern-Geary equation.

40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{establish}} possible relationships between the quantity of oxides and hydroxides of the alloying elements on the outer interstitial-free steel surface after the annealing process and {{the characteristics of the}} <b>galvanneal</b> <b>coating</b> formed. XPS measurements reflect a clear influence of the alloying element contents and the water vapour content or dew point (DP) of the atmosphere on the oxide and hydroxide coverage of the steel surface. In general, much less Fe–Zn intermetallic formation is seen on the Ti steel substrate than on the Ti–Nb steel. The reason for this may be related with the higher oxide/(Fe + Mn) atomic ratio on the external surface of the Ti steel substrate. With the Ti–Nb–P steel, an absence of Fe was observed in the coatings obtained on the surface of this steel annealed in atmospheres with a DP of − 45 or − 10 °C. A clear direct relationship has been found between the inhibition of growth of Fe–Zn intermetallic compounds and the fraction of the steel substrate surface covered by manganese oxides {{as a result of the}} annealing process. For the Ti–Nb–P steel the increase in the DP of the galvannealing atmosphere to 10 °C resulted in the incorporation of a significant Fe content in the coating. XPS analysis suggests a change in the surface film, and the formation of a phosphate enriched layer, instead of manganese oxide. A lower fraction of oxide coverage on the annealed steel substrate resulted in less of an impediment to the diffusion of iron atoms from the steel substrate to the zinc coating in the galvannealing processresearch was supported by ECSC project 7210 - PR 119 Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{strip steel}} surface {{condition}} after continuous annealing of strip {{is extremely important}} {{to the quality of}} <b>galvannealed</b> <b>coating</b> (GA). The presence of oxides or precipitated can affect the reactions at the coating/substrate interface and decrease the zinc wettability on the steel surface, leading to various defects in the final product. To avoid oxidation of the material during continuous annealing, a protective atmosphere is used in the furnaces. Despite this atmosphere, it is possible the selective oxidation or precipitation of second phase particles, being the dew point of atmosphere one of the leading factors to reduce this occurrence. This study aims to evaluate the effect of the dew point on the quality of GA coatings applied to a bake hardenable steel. The continuous annealing under dew points of – 60 °C, 30 °C and 0 °C, as well as hot dip galvanizing, were performed in a Hot Dip Process Simulator. It is found that the dew point has a decisive influence on the amount, distribution and type of oxides formed, and the condition of – 30 °C provided the coating with less failures and better adhesion...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} is an Executive Summary of individual submissions {{of work that}} the author has submitted towards the degree of Engineering Doctorate. The work comprises three main themes, which can be demonstrated in a broader sense as contributing towards improved productivity in fusion welding: i) The use of active fluxes for Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding. ii) An investigation into the reduction of porosity when Metal Active Gas (MAG) welding <b>galvanneal</b> <b>coated</b> steel sheet used in the automotive industry. iii) The use of high power Nd:YAG laser welding {{for the production of}} large diameter, long distance land pipelines. Active fluxes give improved productivity by increasing the penetration depth of the TIG welding process by the simple addition of a flux applied to the surface. Although the productivity benefits of the process had been proven through a joint TWIIindustry project, the mechanism by which the fluxes produced this improvement was not fully understood. The first theme investigated the mechanisms at work in providing increased penetration and concluded that the primary mechanism responsible for the action of the fluxes was not due to a change in the flow of the molten pool but, as others had suggested, due to arc constriction. This work contributed to a greater understanding of the welding process and, furthermore, a greater understanding of the potential opportunities and limitations of the process when designing new fluxes for other alloy systems. MAG welds in coated steel sheet used in the automotive industry are prone to porosity leading to high reject rates. The second phase of work reported here determined welding procedures capable of delivering low porosity welds developed through statistical experimental design. These procedures demonstrated how low porosity welds could be made using conventional MAG welding techniques on steels that had been <b>galvanneal</b> <b>coated</b> to provide corrosion resistance. The procedures developed could be easily implemented at high production rates in an industrial manufacturing environment to reduce defect levels, and thus costly repairs or high scrap rates. The third theme of the work demonstrated how Nd:YAG laser welding could potentially be used to replace conventional arc welding techniques for land lay of gas transmission pipelines. The application of a single laser fill pass, made at high production rates, could replace the use of multiple MAG welding stations greatly reducing the costs associated with pipeline fabrication. BP has claimed that half pipeline cost savings of up to 300 million dollars are achievable through the implementation of such a technique. The justification for the use of lasers in pipelines is discussed in terms of both technical and economic suitability. Preliminary experimental work showed that high power Nd:YAG laser welds could achieve productivity targets, although in order to reduce defects and achieve the necessary structural performance it would be necessary to combine laser welding with a MAG welding process...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of laser}} welding in the {{automotive}} industry {{in the past few}} decades has facilitated joining of hot-dip galvanized (HDG) steel sheets at high production rates and low cost. The recent development of tailor welded blanks (TWB) using laser welding allowed combinations of sheet grades and thicknesses to “tailor” the vehicle part for optimized design, structural integrity and crash performance but more importantly, reductions in weight. Welded blanks are further subjected to stamping or stretch forming prior to final assembly. Unfortunately, both welding and stretch forming cause the galvanized coating to deteriorate, and thereby, undermine the long term corrosion protection. Despite existing publications on zinc coated steel and advances in processing techniques, there is a lack of understanding on the influence of laser welding and stretch forming on the corrosion performance of HDG steel. Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine how welding speed and biaxial strain affect interstitial-free (IF) and high strength low allow (HSLA) steel coupons when they are subjected to continuous immersion and accelerated corrosion tests. The corrosion rates of the coupons were evaluated using electrochemical techniques and gravimetry. Changes in the galvanized coating were characterized using scanning electron metallography. It was observed that, the original zinc layer transformed into the delta and gamma Fe-Zn intermetallic phases locally in the heat affected zone (HAZ) after laser welding. The resulting microstructure was similar to that of a commercially <b>galvannealed</b> <b>coating</b> and exhibited superior corrosion resistance than that of pure zinc. Linear polarization resistance (LPR) measurements revealed that the zinc coating was able to protect a chemically exposed region of steel in 0. 1 M NaCl solution. While the Nd:YAG laser welded coupons with narrow HAZs performed equally well as the non-welded ones, diode laser welded coupons, with a wide locally annealed coating in the HAZ, exhibited a decrease in the peak corrosion rate of zinc. Moreover, minimal amounts of rust were observed on the surface of the HAZ after testing. With biaxial strain, welded and deformed coupons generally demonstrated higher peak corrosion rates than that of undeformed welded ones. When subjected to cyclic corrosion testing according to SAE J 2334, rust formed in the exposed region after one 24 hour test cycle due to wet-dry conditions. However, zinc corrosion products on the surface provided substantial corrosion resistance to the remaining zinc coating and to the steel substrate. Gravimetric measurements of welded coupons showed a linear increase in weight gain with increased exposed widths of the steel after 30 cycles but biaxial strain further increased the weight gain on deformed coupons. After 60 cycles, the trend became exponential for both welded and deformed coupons. There was a negligible difference between the corrosion performance of IF and HSLA steel. Using X-Ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, species of both iron and zinc corrosion products were identified. Without the application of paint coatings, zinc oxide (ZnO), zinc hydroxy chloride (ZnCl 2 [Zn(OH) 2] 4), and hydrozincite ([ZnCO 3] 2 [Zn(OH) 2] 3) were responsible for passivating the surface and reducing the overall corrosion rate of the galvanized coating...|$|R
40|$|Galvanised and {{galvannealed}} steels {{are widely}} used due to their good corrosion resistance in aqueous solutions. However, when additional protection is required, organic coatings, corrosion inhibitors or conversion coatings are used to improve their corrosion protection. In this work, sol-gel coating was used to improve the corrosion behaviour of these two materials. This paper analyses the final protective properties of a sol-gel coating prepared by basic catalysis and its dependence on the sintering temperature and time of treatment. The influence of the sintering conditions on the galvanised and galvannealed substrates is a decisive factor for the coating quality and for the barrier affect against the aggressive media. While heat treatment time is the controlling factor for the galvannealed steels, the temperature is determining {{in the case of}} the galvanised. Corrosion mechanisms for sol-gel galvanised steels did not changed with respect to the uncoated steel.
