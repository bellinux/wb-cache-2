40|$|The {{objectives}} of this review article are, firstly, {{to provide an}} overview of the literature on the main characteristics of what {{is referred to as the}} <b>international</b> <b>forest</b> <b>regime</b> and secondly, based on this, to review explanations for fragmentation as its core characteristic. A third aim of the article is to propose fields for future policy-oriented research on global forest governance, the <b>international</b> <b>forest</b> <b>regime</b> and its fragmentation. The article discusses different strands of literature and academic views on the existence and main characteristics of an <b>international</b> <b>forest</b> <b>regime.</b> It regards the recent notion of an <b>international</b> <b>forest</b> <b>regime</b> complex to be a fruitful topic for future research proposals and finds that fragmentation is its analytical core characteristic. In addition, the article reviews partial explanations for the great relevance of fragmentation in the case of the forest regime complex. It discriminates between domestic factors and causes as opposed to those resulting from the international system. Based on the review, the article suggests, lastly, fields for future research on global forest governance, the <b>international</b> <b>forest</b> <b>regime</b> complex and its fragmentation...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} aims at shedding {{light on}} international regime fragmentation, {{with a special}} focus on its relevance for international actors’ goal achievement. It provides conceptual and theoretical insights on international politics and international policy formation and implementation. Based on the creation and on the features of fragmented regimes, this contribution focuses on the way individual international actors 2 can use them strategically {{to achieve their goals}} on the international stage, hence exercising external action. The <b>international</b> <b>forest</b> <b>regime</b> is clearly fragmented. It will serve as a support to understand and exemplify my argument...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of many international and transnational attempts to address global problems is to influence domestic policymaking processes rather than simply constrain or modify the external behaviour of states. This chapter reviews the existing scholarship on the impacts that global forest governance arrangements have had on domestic policymaking processes and decisions. We apply a framework that distinguishes ‘economic globalisation’ – the phenomenon of increasing economic integration – from ‘internationalisation’, in which international and transnational pressures influence domestic policymaking (Bernstein and Cashore 2000). We review the effects of four distinct pathways of internationalisation in shaping domestic policies: international rules; international norms and discourse; markets; and direct access to domestic policy processes. This framework overcomes longstanding debates about whether globalisation forces a ‘ratcheting down’ of domestic standards in a ‘race to the bottom’, or whether increasing economic and political interdependence can create a ‘race to the top’. The application of the framework to cases in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe and North America reveals that economic globalisation is not determinative. Rather, it interacts with other factors (operating internationally, transnationally and/or domestically) that condition its effects. Key lessons emerge from this review on the conditions under which, and interventions through which, the <b>international</b> <b>forest</b> <b>regime</b> has affected domestic forest policies, {{as well as on}} the interventions that might be nurtured to influence and nurture future policy development...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} the <b>inter{{national}}</b> <b>forests</b> <b>regime</b> (IFR) in shaping national forest-related policies (FRPs) is often considered {{as one of the}} key indicators of its effectiveness. This study is based on a comparison of the evolution {{over the past three decades}} of FRPs and the IFR’s impact in Brazil and Indonesia – the two top-ranking countries in deforestation fi gures – and draws two conclusions. First, far from acting as a mere source of resistance to the IFR, the domestic policy context determines both the extent and type of {{impact of the}} IFR on FRPs. Secondly, FRPs also infl uence the IFR, which contradicts the top-down vision put forward by attempts to evaluate the IFR’s effectiveness. This suggests that instead of a hierarchical relationship, the link between the national and international spheres is a dynamic one where the IFR and FRPs mutually adjust to each other according to the specifi cities of policy networks at both levels...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the three rounds of intergovernmental negotiations {{that took place}} in the period 1990 – 2000. These are the UNCED forest negotiations (1990 – 1992), the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (1995 – 1997) and the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (1997 – 2000). During this period negotiations became less conflictual and more cooperative. The paper explains this shift with reference to bargaining theory. There are two broad approaches to bargaining theory (although the names used to describe these approaches vary between theorists). The first is the distributive/positional approach where actors view each other as adversaries, outcomes are decided according to the relative strength of the actors, and negotiation is seen as a zero-sum game. The second is the integrative/principled approach where actors view each other more as partners addressing a common problem, outcomes are decided according to principles and fair standards, and negotiation is seen as a positive-sum game. The UNCED forest negotiations were characterised almost entirely by distributive/positional bargaining, whereas the IPF/IFF process saw a movement towards the integrative/principled model made possible by an emphasis on less politically contentious issues. There were three results to this. First, a new body of soft <b>international</b> law on <b>forests,</b> the IPF/IFF Proposals for Action, was agreed. Second, an <b>international</b> <b>forests</b> <b>regime</b> emerged during the 1990 s (of which the IPF/IFF proposals are a significant part). Third, states have agreed to create a new forests body, the United Nations Forum on Forests...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> <b>forest</b> <b>regimes</b> {{have been}} {{influencing}} {{the development of}} Indonesia's forest policy, and have complemented its domestic policy initiatives. Indonesian political entities utilise the regimes to pursue bureaucratic benefits and national interests. Forest Management Units (FMUs) comprise our heuristic model. We identified international and domestic actors and institutions that underlie the concept of FMUs and how FMUs are implemented along with the actors' interests. We built our framework and propositions based on bureaucratic politics theory and the theorem on pathways of influence. We used observations, content analysis, and expert interviews to distinguish among actors and institutions, as well as various actors' interests in FMU development. We found that the German government, via the German company Deutsche Gesellschaft f??r Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ), {{is the most powerful}} actor behind FMUs. International actors have dual motivations for supporting FMUs: (i) formally, they want to find the clearest, most efficient way to invest their international cooperation funds in tropical countries and to counter global deforestation; and (ii) informally, they want to counter the influence of Indonesian palm oil plantations. In addition, international interests could be contrary to domestic interests in terms of utilising FMUs. There is a strong, converging concern shared by international and domestic actors, whereby domestic actors use the formal goals of international regimes to pursue domestic interests. Domestic bureaucracies use FMU programmes to relocate power back to the central bureaucracies by preparing instruments that are formally in line with international regimes, but informal in that these instruments are dominated by domestic bureaucracies. For example, the instruments include reinforcing state forest areas, promoting forest benefits, centralising the budget, capacity building, and centralising information...|$|R
40|$|Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) {{has become}} a central {{dimension}} of the contemporary <b>international</b> <b>forest</b> <b>regime.</b> The mechanism seeks to reward actors for keeping or restoring forests {{as a means to}} reduce carbon emissions. Carbon rights, here understood as title to carbon credits, have an odd status in the REDD+ debate. They are closely associated with the belief that REDD+ will generate (economic) ''rents'' - i. e. revenues exceeding the full cost of the corresponding effort - which means framing the discussion in terms of entitlement to revenues beyond mere financial compensations. We suggest that, in an ''ideal'' REDD+ scheme, the possibility of obtaining rents in REDD+ would be very limited. In the real world, rent could be created by strategic behaviours by setting a reference emission level (what would occur under a business-asusual scenario) and by possible acceptance, for political reasons, of inappropriate rules such as being remunerated for the full stock of carbon. The carbon rights rhetoric leads to rent- seeking since remunerations could be disconnected from the active contribution to the production of emission reductions, which is a public good by nature. Another interpretation of carbon rights is the right to benefit from the sale of carbon credits, a framework within which what is at stake is sharing the benefits deriving from the human production and the sale of these benefits, a traditional social issue. In this case, we argue, the concept of carbon rights is useless and even misleading. Compensating for easements would be a more appropriate framework for designing incentive schemes such as payments for environmental services (PES). Reforming land tenure codes to allow individuals, families and communities to claim property or collective tenure rights on the land and the trees is the issue that matters in order to start tackling fairness in REDD+ and PES initiatives.

40|$|Illegal {{logging and}} its {{associated}} trade {{are one of the}} main causes of degradation of the Amazonian Rainforest in Brazil. They spring from several deficiencies in the regulatory and monitoring systems. The purpose of this work is to recommend mechanisms to overcome these deficiencies to eliminate illegal logging {{and its associated}} trade in the long-term and to enhance the appreciation of the standing forests and the sustainable use of their natural resources. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the Brazilian tropical timber market’s trends, and briefly describes the main stages of timber supply chain to build familiarity with the activities surrounding it. Chapter 2 presents the aspects of the Brazilian federal environmental regulatory system of timber supply chain that are essential for further analysis of illegal undertakings. Chapter 3 provides information on the factual aspects of illegal logging and associated trade in the Amazon. It analyzes the sector’s features and deficiencies and examines how effective the enforcement of the Brazilian environmental law has been to date. Chapter 4 describes the international mechanisms of timber trade control in use worldwide. It focuses on those systems that are the most effective and have beneficial impact – or potential beneficial impact if better promoted – on the Brazilian timber industry. Finally, chapter 5 recommends a multi-faceted approach to be implemented by the Brazilian Government with the cooperation of the international community, non-profit organizations, and the private sector. It suggests strategies to promote effective international timber trade control mechanisms within the Brazilian Amazon timber industry, and to adapt effective tools provided by those mechanisms to the Brazilian environmental regulatory system. These strategies include instruments from the United States Lacey Act and the European Union Forest Law Enforcement, Governance, and Trade Action Plan, forest certification schemes, and the <b>International</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Regime.</b> This work also provides recommendations to improve the efficiency of control mechanisms that are currently but poorly implemented in Brazil...|$|E

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} Malawi’s forestry regulatory regime towards achieving sustainable forest management (SFM). The main purpose {{was to examine the}} policy contexts and institutional conditions within Malawi that aim to generate effective SFM. The study involved a comprehensive literature review of policies, legislations, journals and government reports. The study has revealed that Malawi has several forest regulatory frameworks that enshrine SFM concept. However, implementation of these frameworks has been a big issue due to poor coordination; and inadequate financial and human resources. Effectiveness of the <b>forest</b> <b>regime</b> to achieve SFM is associated with increased forest cover. In Malawi, the outcome indicators of the <b>forest</b> <b>regime</b> like increased <b>forest</b> cover and incomes have been declining instead of increasing. Therefore, Malawi’s <b>forest</b> <b>regime</b> has not been effective to achieve SFM. It is therefore, recommended to strengthen the capacity of forest administration institutions at central, regional and local levels...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} and implementing the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism is gaining grounds in many tropical forest countries. There are concerns on the potentials {{of the existing}} <b>forest</b> management <b>regimes</b> to provide the necessary conditions for a successful REDD+ mechanism. This paper narrows this debate to Cameroon and examines past research on two <b>forest</b> <b>regimes</b> – community <b>forests</b> and state <b>forests</b> <b>regimes.</b> It examines findings on equity in benefit sharing {{and the effectiveness of}} regimes to maintain or increase forest cover, and assess their compatibility with REDD+ exigencies. The paper argues that: (1) {{it is too early to}} draw conclusions on a suitable regime for REDD+ in Cameroon. 13, out of 14 research papers published up to 2011 accentuate on equity in benefit sharing, and the two regimes show proof of limited guarantee for the much expected REDD+ safeguards, this includes failures in vertical and horizontal distribution of benefits; (2) there is deficiency in studies on effectiveness of the <b>forest</b> <b>regimes</b> in managing <b>forest</b> cover as indicated by only 3 of the 14 studies. Despite the shortcomings in practice, certain elements of the forest legislation in Cameroon offer better opportunities for REDD+. This paper recommends more in-depth research based on rigorous methodologies to provide better bases for practitioners and policy makers to draw lessons from the management outcomes of the different regimes, which is relevant for the design of the national REDD+ policy strategy in Cameroon. </p...|$|R

Community {{forests in}} {{principle}} provide {{an alternative to}} the existing tenure <b>regime</b> in Ontario’s <b>forests.</b> The dominant model has clearly failed in several important ways, but existing community forest experiments are, at best, very preliminary prototypes. Basic economic theory suggests that a properly structured community <b>forest</b> <b>regime</b> would be superior to the existing regime. There are no community forests that can be rigor-ously compared to the mature corporate and administrative structures, however, and many decision-makers continue to assume that a move to a community <b>forest</b> <b>regime</b> would be risky. In the absence of empirical evidence decisions must be {{made on the basis of}} sound theory. Theory comes down on the side of the community forest approach. In fact it is impossible to show scientifically that the current system of corporate tenure can even be reformed to make it as productive as a system of community forests could be...|$|R
40|$|This article investigates whether forest {{certification}} (eco-labeling) {{is likely to}} rectify certain omissions in the current global <b>forest</b> <b>regime.</b> Following {{an examination of the}} achievements and shortcomings of the <b>forest</b> <b>regime</b> to date, I argue that gaps could be filled by including a broad range of stakeholders in certification standards development; promoting strong environmental and social performance standards in forestry; providing effective control mechanisms; securing producer participation; and penetrating markets. Although the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) was considered initially to have the greatest potential to fill these gaps, the emergence and widespread proliferation of industry-dominated schemes have marginalized the FSC in many countries. The study shows that while {{forest certification}} would probably promote more sustainable forestry in the temperate and boreal zones than it would in the tropical zone, the ability of this tool to actually do so remains to be seen.
