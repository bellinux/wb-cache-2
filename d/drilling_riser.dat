The collected gas was flared and oil stored on board the drillship Discoverer Enterprise. Before the tube was removed, it collected 924000 gal of oil. On 3 June 2010, BP removed the damaged <b>drilling</b> <b>riser</b> from the top of the blowout preventer and covered the pipe by the cap which connected it to another riser. On 16 June a second containment system connected directly to the blowout preventer began carrying oil and gas to service vessels, where it was consumed in a clean-burning system. The United States government's estimates suggested the cap and other equipment were capturing less than half of the leaking oil. On 10 July the containment cap was removed to replace it with a better-fitting cap ("Top Hat Number 10"). Mud and cement were later pumped in through the top of the well to reduce the pressure inside it which didn't work either. A final device was created to attach a chamber of larger diameter than the flowing pipe with a flange that bolted to the top of the blowout preventer and a manual valve set to close off the flow once attached.

This paper presents a study of the influence of platform displacements on the riser behavior. The dynamics of a semi-submersible platform coupled with a <b>drilling</b> <b>riser</b> in ultra deep water is featured. A nonlinear system equation is used to represent the platform dynamics.

40|$|When {{offshore}} drilling {{needs to be}} conducted in deepwater and ultra-deepwater area, a significant increase of weight to be accommodated by the drilling rig due to more riser joints and larger drilling mud volume becomes a challenge {{that has to be}} carefully looked after. However, with the growing technology of semisubmersible drilling rigs, drilling systems and methods, subsea and downhole systems, and so on, the deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling operation has been more enabled than ever. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} world record for drilling depth has exceeded 10000 ft (3048 m) today.

At Site C 0009, new methods were tested, including analysis of drill mud cuttings and gas, and in situ measurements of stress, pore pressure, and permeability.

40|$|New {{drilling}} {{technology is}} primarily developed when limitations of existing technology {{makes it difficult}} or impossible to reach new targets. Drilling in deep waters and in depleted reservoirs is less profitable or too risky using conventional drilling methods. A better and safer alternative is to use specific managed pressure drilling (MPD) systems such as dual gradient systems. Dual gradient systems are designed for deep water operations. Drilling in hostile environments necessitates technologies and operational procedures that are thoroughly thought through. A small margin between the pore and fracture pressures implies increased need for pressure control. In this dissertation, well control of new drilling technologies has been discussed with focus on selected MPD systems. Extensive hydraulic modeling has been necessary to calculate flow and pressure variations for a drilling system using a partly evacuated marine <b>drilling</b> <b>riser,</b> i. e. where the mud level in the riser annulus is not fixed and is free to move up and down. The focus has been to simulate well dynamics when gas is flowing into the wellbore and is being circulated out. Drilling in narrow pressure margin reservoirs will {{increase the risk of}} losses and gain, and stringent well control is important. Well-control procedures have been discussed and proposed based on simulation results of different well scenarios using the Low Riser Return System (LRRS). Five papers are attached, where four of them present the main results of the research work. The results are related to the dynamic behavior of the mud level in a partly evacuated marine <b>drilling</b> <b>riser.</b> It is shown that the marine <b>drilling</b> <b>riser</b> {{can be used as a}} separator during a gas-kick circulation, and that the mud level in the marine <b>drilling</b> <b>riser</b> annulus can self-regulate as long as it is located a sufficient distance below surface. A new U-tubing model for managed pressure drilling systems like the LRRS has been developed and successfully tested in a small scale facility. It is important to take into account that the inner cross-section area of the drillstring is different from the cross-section area of the annulus. This has not been included in the existing model. The results also show that the LRRS can adjust the wellbore pressure by controlling the pumps used in the circulation system. ECD control during drillpipe connection has been studied for the LRRS, and it is shown that time is an important parameter, especially in small open-hole sections where the pressure margins are small. Simulations show that the total time needed for making a drillpipe connection is typically in the order of 5 - 45 minutes depending on the magnitude of the ECD.

40|$|This thesis {{encompasses}} on <b>drilling</b> <b>riser</b> technology, modeled and simulated the <b>drilling</b> <b>riser</b> {{with more}} emphasize on heave compensation system. More particularly the heave compensation properties {{and its effect}} to the riser response. The models have been modeled in some scenarios with various water depth,various environmental conditions, and varying heave compensation properties. Since the analysis for deep water <b>drilling</b> <b>riser</b> is quite complex, it is required to address operational limitation, tension requirements, manage deflection angle on flexible joint and material capacities. The model was carried out usingRIFLEX in static linear, static nonlinear and dynamic linear analysis. And some post processing program was used such as Matrix Plot and MATLAB. The initial condition of the riser can be determined by simulated the model in the quasi-static analysis. The initial configuration that required small deflection angle {{at the bottom of}} the riser can be set up by adjusting some parameters such as vessel offset, top tension of the riser and buoyancy configuration. Oneof the methods to model the buoyancy here is by applying small density material at the buoyancyelement. Higher top tensions will require increased wall thickness and vessel capability. The effective tension of the riser shall remain in tension condition in order to protect the well head. Sufficient buoyancy element and top tension are required to establish tension condition along the riser, hence the collapse due to buckling also can be avoided. Structural nonlinearities response is determined by dynamic time domain analysis. Heave compensation system properties here is represented by damping c and spring k coefficient and its modeled followingThe Kevin-Voigt Model by putting spring and dashpot in set in parallel. Spring and damping effect give compensation to heave relative motion between the vessel and riser. By increasing the spring and damping effect, the tension variation is increased as well. The stroke of the riser is influenced by some factors such as, heave compensation properties, water depth, environmental load, riser system, type of vessel and mooring method. By assuming the heave compensation properties we studied the sensitivity of dynamic tension variation with varying heave compensation system properties under several environment conditions. During severe environment condition, the total stress will be very high. Design limitation for material strength is shall be following NORSOK-N 001. In case for <b>drilling</b> <b>riser</b> during severe environment condition the operation will be stopped, and riser will be hang off. By riser response from constant tension and varying tension analyses such the effective tension from constant tension is expected value effective tension from varying tension analyses.
