500|$|The {{ships were}} found to have <b>insufficient</b> <b>stability</b> when {{converted}} into aircraft carriers. This was to have been remedied by the addition of side bulges and fixed ballast. The ballast was to have consisted of [...] "concrete armor," [...] a layer of concrete fitted to the sides of the hulls below the waterline. Conversion work on Gneisenau, which was to be renamed Jade, never began. The project was abandoned on 25 November 1942. The design for Potsdam, which was assigned the name Elbe, was reworked to correct the stability problems. The bulges and concrete armor were discarded and a second outer skin was substituted. Work began on the ship in December 1942; only the ship's passenger fittings were removed by the time work was halted on 2 February 1943. This was due to the resignation of Admiral Erich Raeder, the {{commander in chief of the}} Kriegsmarine, the previous month. Raeder had resigned in protest of Adolf Hitler's order that all surface ships be decommissioned and scrapped in the aftermath of the Battle of the Barents Sea.|$|E

50|$|On July 25, 2006, {{the final}} report for the Ethan Allen boating {{accident}} was released by The National Transportation Safety Board. It established that Ethan Allen had capsized {{as a result of}} <b>insufficient</b> <b>stability.</b> The US Coast Guard was responsible for the original certification of the vessel, then called the Double Dolphin. It was thought that the original certification of 48 was allowed due to different test standards applied in 1966; passenger weight difference was not responsible for those differences.|$|E
50|$|When {{the owner}} of the Double Dolphin fitted the boat with an {{elaborate}} pipe structure and canvas top, the center of gravity was raised and, more importantly, the projected side area vastly increased. The boat continued to be inspected and certified by the USCG for 48 persons, although they should have performed another test. According to the NTSB Naval Architect, Rob Henry, if that test had been performed, the boat would not have been certified to carry any passengers due to <b>insufficient</b> <b>stability</b> to the load of the wind heel.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{documentation}} of the ship, tallship sailor Daniel Parrott suggested that <b>insufficient</b> <b>stability</b> (resistance of a ship to capsizing) could have added to or caused the knock-down. The rigging of the Marques had been changed and the sail surface likely increased over the years, which naturally led to decreased (but not necessarily dangerous) stability. The last owner had repeatedly avoided a routine safety check of the ship that had been requested by British authorities; as the outcome of such a check remains unknown, it is unclear if the ship's stability was problematic and, if so, if the check would have detected it.|$|E
50|$|PVF has low {{permeability}} for vapors, burns very slowly, and has excellent {{resistance to weathering}} and staining. It is also resistant to most chemicals, except ketones and esters.

50|$|Inorganic fluxes contain {{components}} {{playing the}} same role as in organic fluxes. They are more often used in brazing and other high-temperature applications, where organic fluxes have <b>insufficient</b> thermal <b>stability.</b> The chemicals used often simultaneously act as both vehicles and activators; typical examples are borax, borates, fluoroborates, fluorides and chlorides. Halogenides are active at lower temperatures than borates, and are therefore used for brazing of aluminium and magnesium alloys; they are however highly corrosive.|$|R
50|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that core stability {{is essential for}} the maintenance of an upright posture and especially for movements and lifts that require extra effort such as lifting a heavy weight from the ground to a table. Without core stability the lower back is not supported from inside and can be injured by strain caused by the exercise. It is also believed that <b>insufficient</b> core <b>stability</b> can result in lower back pain and lower limb injuries..|$|R
5000|$|In other {{engineering}} design, {{a successful}} design or implementation of one, is one which 'works'. Thus, an aircraft which actually flies without crashing due to some aerodynamic design {{is a successful}} design. How successful is important, of course, and depends on how well it meets intended performance criteria. Continuing with the aircraft example, several World War I fighter aircraft designs only barely flew, while others flew well (at least one design flew well, but its wings broke off with some regularity) though with insufficient agility (turning, climbing, ..., rates) or <b>insufficient</b> <b>stability</b> (too frequent inescapable spins and so on) to be useful or survivable. To a considerable extent, good agility in aircraft is inversely related to inadequate stability, so fighter aircraft designs are, in this respect, inevitable compromises. The same considerations have continued in more recent times, as for instance the necessity for computer 'fly-by-wire' control in some fighters with great agility.|$|E

5000|$|The I-16 was a {{difficult}} fighter to fly.

The immobilization of laccase onto the produced microemulsions benefitiated its stability under ultrasonic conditions. The half life time of immobilized laccase was 2. 4 -fold higher (from 23 to 56 minutes) than laccase in the free form.

30|$|Complex {{ammonium}} nitrate-based NP and NPK fertilizers are multicomponent salt systems {{prone to}} high hygroscopicity, caking and explosive thermal decomposition. The slurries that {{used in the}} production of these fertilizers can also exhibit <b>insufficient</b> thermal <b>stability.</b> One of the most important issues for such slurries is their viscosity, which determines the energy costs for transportation and processing into the final product. Increasing the degree of phosphoric acid ammoniation helps to reduce the ammonium nitrate’s content in the product, but the main question remains about the properties of such fertilizers.
