25|$|The video {{featured}} Houston {{entering a}} dry cleaners and {{making her way}} through a kitchen wearing a fur coat. On exiting the kitchen, the music begins, and she walks into a night club with her then removing <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> singing on a small stage. Throughout the video, Houston is seen in several different outfits, including a metallic dress and knee high boots, and, as the video progresses, a pink dress and a full-length silver dress. The video concludes as Houston is walking away in the silver dress, with dollar bills blowing around.|$|E
2500|$|Coward {{wrote the}} {{following}} to Hector Bolitho, her biographer: [...] "she wastes no time on personal inhibitions or inferiority complexes. In fact, she takes off <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> {{gets down to}} {{the job of the}} moment with less shi-shi than any actress I have ever met.... Despite the fact that for fifty years she has performed a multitude of plays to multitudes of people, she has always contrived to remain the mistress of her tradition rather than allow any tradition to become the mistress of her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Laura's cake is {{complete}} {{but she is}} not happy. It is less than she had hoped it would be. She had invested great and desperate hopes in the cake, like an artist working on a great piece of art, and in her mind, she failed. Laura catalogues what she will do to keep busy {{for the rest of the}} day: prepare for Dan's party. She knows Dan will be happy with whatever she prepares. This slightly annoys her. She realises her husband's happiness [...] "depends only on the fact of her, here in the house, living her life, thinking of him". She tries to tell herself this is a good thing and that she is being difficult but is suddenly hit by the image of Virginia Woolf putting a stone into the pocket of <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> walking into a river. This psychic connection to another ‘desperate housewife’ is interrupted by a tap on the back door.|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} morning after breakfast, at the hour when she had hitherto gone house-hunting with Mr. Mariner, the child Tibby, of whom up till now she had seen little except at meals, presented himself to <b>her,</b> <b>coated</b> <b>and</b> shod for the open and regarding her with a dull and phlegmatic gaze.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{said some}} afternoon," [...] she remarked, {{throwing}} open <b>her</b> warm <b>coat,</b> <b>and</b> taking off <b>her</b> gloves, [...] "but I {{certainly did not}} mean to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I left Lady Cynthia in the car," [...] Sir Timothy explained. [...] "She most {{improperly}} bribed my chauffeur to lend <b>her</b> his <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> hat, {{and followed}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the evening}} of the dance, when he had come home to dress, Mrs. Morel put on <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> bonnet.|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{ran to her}} {{saddle and}} got the {{biscuits}} out of the pockets of <b>her</b> <b>coat,</b> <b>and</b> she {{ran back to the}} rider.|$|E
60|$|She ran upstairs for <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> hat {{and at once}} {{left the}} hotel. She knew the way to Peter Conant's office and walked rapidly toward it.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Flanders rose, slapped <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> {{this side}} <b>and</b> {{that to get}} the sand off, and picked up her black parasol.|$|R
5000|$|..... she's the antistarlet ... She tiptoes {{in looking}} like a graceful version of boho-chic 29-year-olds found {{everywhere}} from Brooklyn to Silver Lake, with an Obama Presidential candidate button on <b>her</b> vintage <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> the New Yorker rolled up in her pocket...|$|R
60|$|She did not answer.... He {{watched her}} in silence {{as she put}} on <b>her</b> hat <b>and</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> left the room.|$|R
60|$|He {{laid the}} {{receiver}} {{down and the}} reflection on the mirror faded away. Lenora started up and hastily put on <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> hat, which were still lying on the chair.|$|E
60|$|After Elsie {{had told}} the {{confectioner}} that she had changed her mind about the cashiership she put on <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> followed the lady to the sidewalk, where awaited an elegant victoria.|$|E
6000|$|... "I really {{wonder that}} you never took the office upon yourself," [...] said Charlotte, busied in {{throwing}} aside <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> gloves; [...] "you appear {{to have so much}} interest in the gentleman." ...|$|E
50|$|After handing clients their prescription, Perkesh begins her Bollywood chant, as {{the stock}} shelves behind her pull out {{revealing}} a colorful dance stage, filled with Indian decor. Padma rips off <b>her</b> white <b>coat,</b> <b>and</b> dances with <b>her</b> fellow stock workers, (and sometimes customers).|$|R
60|$|She ran {{and put on}} <b>her</b> long grey <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> red tam-o-shanter. As we {{went down}} the yard, George called to me.|$|R
50|$|Petra fights {{the troll}} {{off with a}} branch, {{releasing}} the Doctor. He tries to grab the creature with a parka, but underfoot, the ground forms tentacles which attempt to drag them under.Petra helps the Doctor trap the troll with <b>her</b> own <b>coat,</b> <b>and</b> the limbs disintegrate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you can't {{be stuck}} {{in the house for}} ever," [...] Annie agreed. She was quite amiable. Beatrice pulled on <b>her</b> <b>coat,</b> <b>and</b> went out with Leonard and Annie. She would meet her own boy.|$|E
60|$|She {{slipped off}} <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> skirt and blouse, and stood doing her hair before the glass, a massive homely figure, her {{petticoat}} being so short that {{she stood on}} a pair of thick slate-grey legs.|$|E
60|$|Lettie {{took off}} <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> furs, and flung {{them on the}} couch. She went to the mirror, lifted her hair, all curled by the fog, and stared haughtily at herself. Then she swung round, looked at the bare table, and rang the bell.|$|E
6000|$|She murmured, [...] "I'll {{just talk}} {{to him for a}} quarter of an hour and come home." [...] She put an <b>her</b> tweed <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> rubber overshoes, {{considering}} how honest and hopeless are rubbers, how clearly their chaperonage proved that she wasn't going to a lovers' tryst.|$|R
60|$|There, on the sordid little station {{under the}} furnaces, she stood, tall and distinguished, in <b>her</b> well-made <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> skirt <b>and</b> <b>her</b> broad grey velour hat. She held her umbrella, her bead chatelaine, {{and a little}} leather case in her grey-gloved hands, while Harry {{staggered}} out of the ugly little train with her bags.|$|R
60|$|Philippa {{exchanged}} a general salutation with her guests. She {{was still wearing}} <b>her</b> travelling <b>coat,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> air of fatigue was unmistakable. Griffiths, who had not taken his eyes off her since her entrance, wheeled an easy-chair towards the hearth-rug, into which she sank with a murmured word of thanks.|$|R
60|$|The farther she {{got from}} home the shabbier her gown seemed {{and the more}} {{impossible}} <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> hat. At last, as we were leaving Minneapolis {{on our way to}} Osage she leaned her tired head against me and sobbed out a wild wish to go home.|$|E
60|$|Hannah would not. They {{finished}} the dishes together in silence while {{the light of}} the new day stole in through the windows. Janet went into her room, set it in order, made up the bed, put on <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> hat and rubbers. Then she returned to Hannah, who seized her.|$|E
60|$|Sanford Quest {{was smoking}} his after breakfast cigar with a relish {{somewhat}} {{affected by the}} measure of his perplexities. Early though it was, Lenora was already in her place, bending over her desk, and Laura, who had just arrived, was busy divesting herself of <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> hat. Quest watched the latter impatiently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a bit. I {{had a nice}} time coming, and no trouble, {{except the}} tipsy coachman; but Tom got out and kept him in order, so I was n't much frightened," [...] {{answered}} innocent Polly, taking off <b>her</b> rough-and-ready <b>coat,</b> <b>and</b> the plain hat without {{a bit of a}} feather.|$|R
60|$|The {{proprietor}} of the confectionery was a benevolent {{old man with a}} peppermint flavor, who decided, after questioning Elsie pretty closely, that she was the very girl he wanted. Her services were needed at once, so Elsie, with a thankful heart, drew off <b>her</b> tan <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> prepared to mount the cashier's stool.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, sir," [...] {{the girl}} said, {{and went into}} the little closet at the rear for <b>her</b> hat <b>and</b> <b>coat.</b> Did she {{contrive}} to get a copy of that book under <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> as she passed the shelf where it lay? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked away}} from the sea towards the woman by his side. The wind was blowing in her face, blowing back little strands of her tightly coiled hair, blowing back <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> skirt, {{outlining}} her figure with soft and graceful distinction. She was young, healthy and splendid, full of all the enthusiasm of her age. He sighed a little bitterly.|$|E
60|$|She {{came and}} was shaken into <b>her</b> <b>coat,</b> <b>and</b> the two set off. She sat very close {{beside him in}} the gig, tucked tightly, feeling his big body sway, against her, very splendid. She loved the rocking of the gig, when his big, live body swayed upon her, against her. She laughed, a poignant little shrill laugh, and her black eyes glowed.|$|E
60|$|The {{silence of}} the flat was no longer to be endured. And Janet, putting on <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> hat, descended the stairs. Not once that morning had her mother {{mentioned}} Lise; nor had she asked about her own plans--about Ditmar. This at least was a relief; it was the question she had feared most. In the street she met the postman.|$|E
5000|$|Tomm Moore, {{director}} of The Secret of Kells, created the animated movie Song of the Sea. The film features {{a young girl}} named Saoirse who discovers she is a selkie, and along with her human brother Ben, must recover <b>her</b> seal <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> find <b>her</b> voice, to save herself and all the Faerie folk of Ireland.|$|R
60|$|Her trunks {{had been}} taken down already. She chose the little hat that he liked her best in, and over it {{fastened}} her thickest veil. Then, putting on <b>her</b> travelling <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> gloves, {{she looked in the}} long mirror, and seeing that there was nothing more to keep her, lifted her dressing bag, and went down.|$|R
50|$|Before Bruyère {{opened her}} haute couture house in 1928, she learned her trade from Callot Soeurs and Jeanne Lanvin. Her {{establishment}} was {{located on the}} Place Vendôme in Paris. An early collection in 1930 established Bruyère as comparable to Schiaparelli, Alix, Rochas <b>and</b> Mainbocher, with <b>her</b> <b>coats</b> <b>and</b> tailored suits proving a particular strength. Her suits were particularly noted for their subtle and unusual design elements. In August 1932 Fortune noted that her designs were rather more successful with Americans than with the French, who did not visit Bruyère's shop on the Rue de Mondovi. Bruyère's designs were imported to the United States, and in 1932, Fortune noted that a survey of copies of Paris couture gowns in the stores of Manhattan showed that Bruyère was the third most popular name, behind Vionnet and Lanvin.|$|R
