5|$|By 1883, most coins on {{the islands}} were American, due to the close {{economic}} <b>integration</b> <b>between</b> islands and mainland. The laws of Hawaii reflected this, making gold American coins legal tender for an unlimited amount and American silver coins legal tender to $50.

40|$|The {{countries}} of the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) have set on course processes to become a currency union. Among other conditions, the optimal currency theory proposes high trade <b>integrations</b> <b>between</b> the candidate {{countries of}} a currency union because it facilitates the synchronization of the business cycles of the countries which is needed for an effective currency union. To assess the levels of trade <b>integrations</b> <b>between</b> the {{countries of the}} WAMZ, this study constructs an export frontier for each of {{the countries of the}} WAMZ using each country’s aggregated export data for at least 45 countries over the period 2000 - 2014. The study applies the Battese and Coelli (1992) model as well as the Kumbhakar (1990) model. The trade efficiency estimates between the countries of the WAMZ indicate various degrees of trade integrations. Overall, the results suggest a poorly integrated region from a trade standpoint...|$|R

5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} were reworked for this sequel. Some changes were made due to user feedback and others {{were meant to be}} included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. The camera was switched to the right analog stick of the DualShock controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes included more <b>integration</b> <b>between</b> exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live-action pictures.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} C {{extension}} {{had been completed}} in 1926, possibilities for the northward extension of the Piccadilly tube began to reappear. From 1922, a series of press campaigns called {{for the improvement of}} services at the GNR's Finsbury Park station where interchanges between tube lines, mainline trains, buses and trams were notoriously bad. In June 1923, a petition from 30,000 local residents was submitted to parliament, and, in 1925, the government called a public inquiry to review options. Pick presented plans to relieve the congestion at Finsbury Park by extending the Piccadilly tube north to Southgate. Opposition from the London and North Eastern Railway (successor to the GNR following the 1923 grouping of railway companies) was again considerable and based on claims that the new Underground line would take passengers from the mainline services. Using data from the Bakerloo tube, Hampstead tube and C extensions, Pick demonstrated that the route planned for the new line would stimulate new residential development and increase passenger numbers for all rail operators in the area, increasing those on the Piccadilly tube by 50 million per year. Parliamentary approval was granted in 1930 to extend the Piccadilly tube north beyond Southgate to a terminus at Cockfosters. The approval also included complementary extensions of the Piccadilly tube from its western terminus at Hammersmith to supplement District Railway services to Hounslow and South Harrow. The development was again financed with government backed loans, this time through the 1929 Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act. To ensure the most efficient <b>integration</b> <b>between</b> the new tube line and the UERL's bus and tram operations, the stations were located further apart than in central areas and where road transport services could be arranged to deliver and collect the most passengers. At Manor House, the station was designed with subway exits directly on to pedestrian islands in the road served by the local trams.|$|E

40|$|Abstract   The {{purpose of}} this essay is to compare the <b>integration</b> policy <b>between</b> Socialdemokraterna, Moderaterna and Sverigedemokraterna with focus on labor-market integration, housing {{segregation}} and language knowledge. The international immigration has in recent years increased significantly and this has also enriched the receiving countries and still the numbers of extreme right parties have increased. In Sweden a racist populist party, Sverigedemokraterna, {{are only a few}} steps away from entering the parliament.   The question in focus is: What differences or similarities are there <b>between</b> the <b>integration</b> politics <b>between</b> Moderaterna, Socialdemokraterna and Sverigedemokraterna with focus on the areas housing, work and language?   By applying the theoretical framework to the data, I have been able to present answers and build up an analysis. The study concludes that there are more similarities than differences in the <b>integration</b> policy <b>between</b> Moderaterna and Socialdemokraterna.
