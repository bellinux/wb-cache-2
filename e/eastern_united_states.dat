5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by American botanist William Chambers Coker in 1917, in his monograph of Amanitas of the <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Coker's description {{was based on}} several specimens he had collected from various locations in North Carolina in September and October 1914. The specific name honors George Atkinson, a Cornell University mycologist who collected and described mushrooms in the southern and <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in the late 19th century. In 1952, Marcel Locquin chose to place it in the genus Armillaria as Armillaria atkinsoniana, but this change was not adopted by later authors.|$|E

5|$|Frances {{then passed}} over the central {{sections}} of Florida, in the United States, three weeks after Hurricane Charley, causing significant damage to the state's citrus crop, closing major airports and schools, and forcing the cancellation of a collegiate football game. The storm then moved briefly offshore from Florida, into the northeast Gulf of Mexico, and made a second U.S. landfall, at the Florida Panhandle, before accelerating northeast through the <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> near the Appalachians and into Atlantic Canada while weakening. A significant tornado outbreak accompanied the storm across the <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> nearly equaling the outbreak from Hurricane Beulah. Very heavy rains fell in association with this slow-moving and relatively large hurricane, which caused floods in Florida and North Carolina. Some 49 people died from the cyclone. Damages totaled US$12billion (2004 dollars).|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Beryl caused {{flooding}} {{in several states}} in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in August1994. The second named storm and third tropical cyclone of the season, Beryl developed from an upper-level low pressure area over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on August14. Initially a tropical depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm about 24hours after forming. Beryl then moved slowly northeastward and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) before making landfall near Panama City, Florida, early on August16. Within 12hours of moving inland, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, but persisted as a tropical cyclone {{for a few days}} while traversing the <b>Eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Beryl was absorbed by a frontal system while situated over Connecticut early on August19.|$|E
5|$|Although Josephine {{remained}} well offshore of the <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> the {{effects from the}} storm and an area of high pressure produced strong winds and high seas along the coast.

In addition, one fatality occurred when a man drowned after falling off his boat while sailing a river in Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|During the season, three hurricanes {{developed}} from five named storms. This was below {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939. Four of the five storms {{developed from}} the intertropical convergence zone. The decreased activity is partially due to the westerlies extending further south than usual, {{as well as a}} persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> were cooler than usual. Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E
5|$|Hygrocybe appalachianensis, {{commonly}} known as the Appalachian waxy cap, is a gilled fungus of the waxcap family. It is found in the <b>eastern</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> where it fruits singly, in groups, or clusters on the ground in deciduous and mixed forests. The species, described in 1963 from collections made in the Appalachian Mountains, was originally classified in the related genus Hygrophorus. It was transferred to Hygrocybe in 1998, in which it has been proposed as the type species of section Pseudofirmae.|$|E

Other canal projects were started, but all were abandoned before completion due to the state's foundering credit after the devaluation of the bonds.|$|E
