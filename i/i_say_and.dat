500|$|Josh Harrison of {{entertainment}} website Ology rated the episode 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] " [...] was one to remember". Harrison {{noted that the}} writers appear to explore the characters' backgrounds during the second season, like how Leonard's background was in focus in [...] "Wet Hot Demonic Summer". Harrison concluded his review while commenting on [...] "Callie and Her Sister": [...] "This sort of episode {{is still in its}} early stages, but I don't begrudge Ugly Americans the training wheels if it means we get to better know the people and creatures of the fascinating animated world. Good stuff, <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>and</b> I'd like to see more of it." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1892 campaign, Tillman {{called for}} the defeat in the Democratic primary for the {{legislature}} {{of most of the}} men elected as his supporters, urging the selection of more loyal men. Tillman urged the voters, [...] "turn out this cattle, these driftwood legislators, and send me a legislature that will do what <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>and</b> I'll show you reform." [...] South Carolinians dutifully voted out their representatives as Tillman requested. Although no primary for governor was permitted, the delegates to the nominating convention were elected by the Democratic voters, and Tillman won an overwhelming victory over Sheppard, who took only four of thirty-five counties. The convention was mostly Tillmanite, and gave the governor an easy triumph. The Conservatives had agreed not to bolt the party, and Tillman won uncontested re-election.|$|E
500|$|I Am... (January 2002) marked several {{milestones}} for Hamasaki. Hamasaki increased {{her control}} over her music by composing {{all of the}} songs on the album under the pseudonym [...] "Crea", of which the 2000 single [...] "M" [...] was the first. [...] "Connected" [...] (November 2002) and [...] "A Song Is Born" [...] (December 2001) were the exceptions. I Am... also showed evolution in Hamasaki's lyrical style: it was a retreat from the themes of [...] "loneliness and confusion" [...] of some of her earlier songs. Moved by the September 11 attacks, Hamasaki revised her vision of I Am..., focusing {{on issues such as}} faith and world peace. [...] "A Song Is Born", in particular, was directly influenced by the events. The single, a duet with Keiko Yamada, was released as part of Avex's non-profit Song Nation project, which raised money for charity."まず、浜崎あゆみとKEIKOがデュエットした『a song is born』が2001年12月12日にリリースされた。" [...] She also dropped the planned cover and opted instead to be portrayed as a [...] "peace muse", explaining, I had a completely different idea for the cover at first. We'd already reserved the space, decided the hair and makeup and everything. But after the incident, as is typical of me, I suddenly changed my mind. I knew it wasn't the time for gaudiness, for elaborate sets and costumes. It sounds odd coming from me, but I realize what <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>and</b> how I look has a great impact.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Here's the {{difference}} it makes,' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> just to devil him. 'How {{do you know}} I like YOUR looks?' Maybe he didn't look sore! 'Nope,' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> thinking it all over, 'I don't like your application for a loan. Take it to another bank, only there ain't any,' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> walks off on him.|$|R
500|$|American {{recording}} artist Kanye West {{also contributed to}} three tracks on the album; Madonna called him [...] "the black Madonna" [...] and said, [...] "We're comrades in the envelope-pushing genre". Madonna said, [...] "It's {{a little bit of}} a bullfight, but we take turns. He knows that he's walking into a room with a person with a strong point of view, and I do, too. I listen to what he has to say, take it in, and he listens to what <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>and</b> takes it in. We didn't agree on everything, but he has good ideas." [...] She told Rolling Stone that of the songs she played him, West connected the most with [...] "Illuminati" [...] and that, [...] "e loved the melody, and he was actually jumping up and down on the soundboard. He literally stood on top of the mixing board—we were worried he was going to hit his head on the ceiling, but he didn't. He ended up being very excited about that track, and then he added his spin to it, musically, and I love it. To me, he elevated the lyrics with the music. It's like a siren, alerting people." [...] In December 2014, thirteen demos of tracks for the album, including [...] "Illuminati", were leaked to the Internet. To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks, including the final version of [...] "Illuminati" [...] with the addition of West's writing and production, with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an [...] "early Christmas gift".|$|E
500|$|What {{became known}} as the [...] "Norway debate" [...] opened on 7 May, and lasted for two days. The initial speeches, {{including}} Chamberlain's, were nondescript, but Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes, member for Portsmouth North, in full uniform, delivered a withering attack on the conduct of the Norway campaign, though he excluded Churchill from criticism. Leo Amery then delivered a speech which he concluded by echoing Oliver Cromwell's words on dissolving the Long Parliament: [...] "You have sat here too long for any good you are doing. Depart, <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>and</b> let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!" [...] When Labour announced that they would call for a division of the House of Commons, Chamberlain called upon his [...] "friends—and I still have some friends in this House—to support the Government tonight". Though {{the use of the word}} [...] "friends" [...] was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues, and, according to biographer Robert Self, many MPs took it that way, it was an [...] "error of judgment" [...] for Chamberlain to refer to party loyalty [...] "when the gravity of the war situation required national unity". Lloyd George joined the attackers and Churchill concluded the debate with a vigorous speech in support of the government. When the division took place, the government, which had a normal majority of over 200, prevailed by only 81, with 38MPs in receipt of the government whip voting against it, with between 20 and 25 abstaining.|$|E

6000|$|... "O man, man, man!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> went on {{my knees}} beside the bed; [...] "if your heart is rent asunder and you are truly {{penitent}} for what you did, Our Saviour will have mercy on you yet!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, Mr. Case,” said I, “you’ve {{frightened me}} once, but I defy you to frighten me again,” <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> <b>and</b> slipped down the tree, {{and set out}} again to find my enemy’s head office, which I guessed would not be far away.|$|R

2500|$|In 2009, {{after serving}} {{six months in}} jail on {{residential}} burglary charges, YG signed a deal to Def Jam Recordings. While he was still in jail, his music had been getting some buzz off of his Myspace account and when he was released from jail, he began going into meetings from Atlantic Records to Def Jam, where they just chose him to sign with the latter due to brand recognition. The majority of label attention had come from his collaboration with Ty Dolla Sign on his song [...] "Toot It and Boot It", which ended up peaking on the US Billboard Hot 100, after being re-released by Def Jam. After he revealed that his debut album would be named I'm From Bompton. He explained that title saying, [...] "I changed the C to a B because it's where I'm from and it's also bringing something new. It's drawing more attention, you feel me? And it's, like, I'm not doing it to draw attention. I'm doing it to because that's really what <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>and</b> that's really where I'm from. I'm from Bompton...You gonna feel like you're from Bompton too when you're done listening to the album." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{partly the}} curse as that heathen woman, as Sir Edgar brought home as his wife, {{laid on the}} place," [...] the old clerk said, positively; [...] "and it will go on working as long as Carne's Hold stands.
