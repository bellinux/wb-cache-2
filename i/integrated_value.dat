Methods-A Irrespective study was performed in 51 patients with early RA {{during the first three}} years of the disease, with monthly clinical and laboratory assessments and biannual radiographs of the hands and feet. IL- 6 was measured by immunosorbent assay sectional (n = 51) and longitudinal (n = 20) correlations between plasma IL- 6 concentrations and values of C reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A protein (SAA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), haemoglobin (Hb), platelets, and joint scores were calculated, and correlations made between time <b>integrated</b> <b>values</b> of IL- 6, CRP and ESR, and radiological progression over three years (n = 20).

50|$|In reality, {{it would}} have been {{difficult}} to prove conclusively that a new lamp design would perform in a superior manner to a competitive lamp that had a different filament configuration. The reason for making such a statement here is that while power input into a lamp could be easily measured, the light output had to have been measured in a spherical photometer. In the 1880s and 1890s, light output measurements were usually measured with a horizontal photometer. A horizontal measurement determines light output in only one direction rather than a total <b>integrated</b> <b>value.</b> Thus, while the Chaillet design might have been a better one relative to the competitive lamps {{it is not easy to}} conclude that now.|$|E
50|$|The {{geometric}} {{accuracy of}} the projection of 3D-scenes {{is the most important}} indicator of MotionParallax3D display quality. It is influenced by the {{accuracy of the}} head-tracking and the interval between the moment when the tracking starts and the moment when the image is displayed. Tracking accuracy affects the accuracy of the projection. The architecture and geometry of the tracking devices, quality of calibration, and the <b>integrated</b> <b>value</b> of inaccuracy, which is affected by noise, can all contribute to a reduction in projection correctness. The interval between when the user’s head-tracking starts, and when the image is displayed, is the primary cause of geometric incorrectness of 3D-scenes projection in MotionParallax3D systems. Latency occurs because operations such as head-tracking, rendering and displaying the projection require time.|$|E

His theory of CSR 2.0 characterises CSR maturity into five stages, from defensive, charitable, promotional and strategic CSR (all labelled CSR 1.0) to systemic or transformative CSR (called CSR 2.0). He identifies three failures of CSR 1.0 (incremental, peripheral and uneconomic), five principles of CSR 2.0 (creativity, scalability, responsiveness, glocality and circularity) and four DNA elements of CSR 2.0 (value creation, good governance, societal contribution and environmental integrity). The CSR 2.0 theory is summarised in his books, The Age of Responsibility and CSR 2.0.|$|E

50|$|A major {{subset of}} value chain {{development}} work {{is concerned with}} ways of linking producers to companies, and hence into the value chains. While there are examples of fully <b>integrated</b> <b>value</b> chains that do not involve smallholders (e.g. Unilever operates tea estates and tea processing facilities in Kenya and then blends and packs the tea in Europe before selling it as Lipton, Brooke Bond or PG Tips brands), the great bulk of agricultural value chains involve sales to companies from independent farmers. Such arrangements frequently involve contract farming in which the farmer undertakes to supply agreed quantities of a crop or livestock product, based on the quality standards and delivery requirements of the purchaser, often at a price that is established in advance. Companies often also agree to support the farmer through input supply, land preparation, extension advice and transporting produce to their premises.|$|E

50|$|Under Mills, Ghana’s stable economy {{experienced}} sustained reduced inflation {{leading to}} the attainment of single digit inflation of about 8.4% (one of the lowest inflation rates Ghana had attained in 42 years i.e. period between 1970 and 2012 {{as well as the}} lowest since June 1992 just before the start of Ghana's Fourth Republic) from a high of 18.1% in December 2008. This is indicative of prudent fiscal, monetary and other austerity policy measures that characterised his presidency to put the economy in healthy shape. The Ghanaian currency, the Cedi also stabilised {{as a result of these}} policies. In 2011, Ghana was the fastest growing economy in the world at 20.15% for the first half of the year and 14.4% at the end of the financial year according to the International Monetary Fund and EconomyWatch.com. Moreover, Ghana's budget deficit was reduced to 2% of the Gross Domestic Product during his tenure compared to 14.5% of GDP in 2008, just before he was elected as the President of Ghana. There was also a huge improvement in Ghana's gross international reserves and foreign direct investments (FDI) highlighting exceptional macroeconomic performance. The Mills government also implemented the Single Spine Salary system which increased compensation levels of all public sector workers. In a bid to improve the efficiency in revenue collection, Mills established the Ghana Revenue Authority which <b>integrated</b> <b>Value</b> Added Tax (VAT), Customs Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Under his governance, Ghana met three out of the four primary convergence criteria for the proposed common currency, Eco of the West African Monetary Zone. These accomplishments led to renewed domestic and foreign investor confidence in Ghana's economy. During Mills’ time in office, Ghana was adjudged the best place for doing business in West Africa and best West African performer in access to credit according to the 2011 World Bank Doing Business global rankings.|$|E

Average values of A and E from all genotypes were correlated with PPFD (r 2 = 0. 711, p < 0. 001) but not with Gs (r 2 = 0. 301) in the wet season. Conversely, A and E were strongly correlated with Gs (r 2 = 0. 776, p < 0. 001) but not with PPFD (r 2 = 0. 169) in the dry season. Five genotypes showed strong reduction (between 46 – 86 %) of the <b>integrated</b> <b>values</b> of A, E and Gs in the dry season. Contrastingly, the Brazilian tall genotype (BRT) reduced only between 12 – 29 % of the <b>integrated</b> <b>values</b> of leaf gas exchange in the dry season, tolerating lower values of leaf water potential and showing drought tolerance behavior more clearly. The integrated intrinsic water use efficiency increased up to 126 % in the dry season in five genotypes but in BRT only 12 %. Hence, the dry season imposed serious restrictions to water and carbon balances during the daily course. Such balances were sharply conditioned by an ambient variable (PPFD) in the wet season but by a biological controlled variable (Gs) in the dry season...|$|R

It acts as a catalyst and accelerator for all other industries. These changes are undermining the foundations of the present analysis of the competitive strategy, its logic and practice. The basic analytical tool of competitive advantage - i. e. the vertically <b>integrated</b> <b>value</b> chain is coming under attack. Its effectiveness had been supported by the information asymmetries that held the value chain’s layers together. Not anymore, though. The rapid development of information technologies enables an open and virtually cost-free exchange of information of all kinds, and it is now melting this asymmetry. Its immediate consequence is an unprecedented separation of popular layers of the vertically <b>integrated</b> <b>value</b> chain into stand-alone, narrowly defined businesses. Therefore, competitive advantage across the entire value change no longer matters, as it is advantage in each layer that counts. As a result, the new unit of strategic analysis is the layer. The above deconstruction of the traditional vertically <b>integrated</b> <b>value</b> chain motivates an emergence of new types of competitive strategies: the orchestration, seizure, creation and integration of the links...|$|E
