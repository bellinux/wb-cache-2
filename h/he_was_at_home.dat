5|$|Kirchner died on 27 October 2010, {{at the age}} of 60. The day was a {{national}} holiday for the INDEC to run {{a national}} census, so <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in El Calafate. After a cardiac arrest, Kirchner was rushed to a local hospital and was pronounced dead at 9:15a.m. He had undergone two medical procedures that year: surgery on his right carotid artery in February and an angioplasty in September. His death was a surprise for the Argentinian population, to whom he had always represented his heart problems as not very serious.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> on the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999, Stone was aboard an {{airplane}} which skidded off a snowy runway at O'Hare Airport in Chicago; {{there were no}} injuries. Stone began piloting ultra-light airplanes as a hobby in 1999 and 2000. In March 2000, he suffered a broken left ankle, cracked rib, concussion, and bruised kidney after crashing his plane in Robertson County, Tennessee, and was briefly hospitalized before he resumed touring. Stone later said that the accident made him decide to quit flying planes. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, rumors circulated that Stone had been {{on one of the}} hijacked planes; a spokeswoman for the singer confirmed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> with his family that day.|$|E

25|$|On June 26, 1949, Kim {{was assassinated}} by Lieutenant Ahn Doo-hee (안두희; 安斗熙). Ahn burst in {{and shot him}} four times while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> reading poetry. Ahn stated that he killed Kim because he saw him {{as an agent of}} the Soviet Union. On April 13, 1992, a {{confession}} by Ahn was published by Korean newspaper Dongah Ilbo. In the confession, Ahn claimed that the assassination had been ordered by Kim Chang-ryong (김창룡; 金昌龍), who served as the head of national security under the Rhee administration. Ahn was murdered by Park Gi-sheo (박기서; 朴琦緖), a follower of Kim's, in 1996. According to Bruce Cumings in his 1981 books, another possible motive for the assassination was Kim's alleged connection to the assassination of Song Jin-woo (송진우; 宋鎭禹), a leader of the Korean Democratic Party (KDP) who had chosen to work closely with the American military government. In 2001, declassified documents revealed that Ahn had been working for the U.S. Counter-Intelligence Corps, leading to suggestions of US involvement in the assassination. However, some have questioned the evidence for these accusations.|$|E

500|$|Tillman {{reveals that}} a new murder has {{occurred}} where a woman had the word [...] "Sister" [...] slashed on her chest.

Searching old mugshot photos, B.J. recognizes the man from her dream as Harry Cokely, who was arrested in 1945 for raping a woman named Linda Thibedeaux and slashing [...] "Sister" [...] on her chest. Scully believes that B.J. unconsciously recalled the case since her father was a cop and may have discussed it.

500|$|Marie and her siblings, Prince Alfred (b. 1874), and Princesses Victoria Melita (b. 1876, {{known as}} [...] "Ducky"), Alexandra (b. 1878, known as [...] "Sandra") and Beatrice (b. 1884, known as [...] "Baby Bee"), {{spent much of}} their early life at Eastwell Park, which their mother {{preferred}} instead of Clarence House, their official residence. In her memoirs, Marie would remember Eastwell fondly. The Duke of Edinburgh was largely absent from his children's lives, due to his position in the British Royal Navy, and their life was governed by their mother. Marie would later state {{that she did not}} even know the colour of her father's hair until she looked at later portraits of him, believing it to be much darker than it actually was. When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> the Duke would often play with his children, inventing many games for them. Of all her siblings, Marie was closest to her sister Victoria Melita, who was one year younger, but whom everyone believed to be the older girl because of her stature, much to the princesses' dismay. The Edinburgh children were all baptised and raised in the Anglican faith; this upset their Russian Orthodox mother.|$|E
500|$|Having succeeded Anderson at Louisville, Sherman now had {{principal}} military {{responsibility for}} Kentucky, a border {{state in which}} Confederate troops held Columbus and Bowling Green and were present near the Cumberland Gap. [...] He became exceedingly pessimistic about the outlook for his command and he complained frequently to Washington, D.C. about shortages while providing exaggerated estimates {{of the strength of}} the rebel forces. [...] Critical press reports appeared about him after an October visit to Louisville by the secretary of war, Simon Cameron, and in early November 1861 Sherman insisted that he be relieved. [...] He was promptly replaced by Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell and transferred to St. Louis, Missouri. [...] In December, he was put on leave by Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, commander of the Department of the Missouri, who considered him unfit for duty. [...] Sherman went to Lancaster, Ohio, to recuperate. [...] While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> his wife Ellen wrote to his brother, Senator John Sherman, seeking advice.

500|$|Costa's overall style {{allowed him}} {{to play in a}} great variety of settings. According to critic Alun Morgan, [...] "his mind was never {{cluttered}} up with thoughts of stylistic divisions. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> with any jazz group, provided it swung and generated a feeling of happiness". On piano, his [...] "trademark sound", remarked Ken Dryden, [...] "was the emphasis of the middle and lower registers while nearly ignoring the top two octaves". Some of Costa's more linear, right-hand playing was influenced by his listening to Bud Powell records while in the army. Costa's playing was more than just one-handed lines: during a period when the typical approach to jazz piano was to concentrate on right-hand solos while adding only basic left-hand support, Costa used both hands in creating his own vigorous sound. His piano playing on the informally recorded album Fuerst Set is typical of his style; it was later described by critic Whitney Balliett: Each improvisation resembled an excellent drum solo in its rhythmic intensity, pattern of beats, and elements of surprise. Costa liked to use octave chords in the left hand and single-note lines in the right, and he liked to thunder endlessly down in the lower registers of the piano. At such times, he played chords in both hands and with stunning effect. He would let loose a staccato passage and then an impossible two-handed arpeggio, or he would deliver on-the-beat or offbeat chords – seesawing them, making them into sixty-fourth notes, somehow slurring them, and developing great drive and momentum.|$|E
500|$|On 13 December, {{after his}} good run of {{form in the}} first half of the Bundesliga season, Müller pledged his {{allegiance}} claiming <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in Munich and that, [...] "There is no club to step up from when you leave FC Bayern... there almost is no better club." [...] Six days later, he signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the Allianz Arena until 2017. At the winter break in the Bundesliga, he had nine goals and seven assists in 16 league appearances and a further three goals in the Champions League; this gave him a total of 13 goals halfway through the season, including his strike against Borussia Dortmund in Bayern's win in the 2012 DFL-Supercup. Müller scored his first goal in Bayern's second game back from the break in a 2–0 away win over VfB Stuttgart. Müller tapped in his fifth goal of the Champions League campaign on 2 April, completing a 2–0 first leg defeat of Juventus in the quarter-finals, ending the Italian club's 18-match unbeaten record in Europe. On 23 April 2013, Müller scored two goals and gave one assist in 4–0 win against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final in the Allianz Arena. On the return fixture, Müller scored a header as Bayern won 3–0 and gave Barcelona their biggest defeat ever in the Champions League, with a 7–0 aggregate score. Müller then went on to play an important role in Bayern's 2–1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the final. On 1 June, Müller scored a penalty in the final of the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal. Bayern won the cup 3–2 to complete an historic treble. Müller scored 23 goals overall in the season (including all competitions), netting 13 in the Bundesliga, one in the Pokal, and an impressive eight in the Champions League, he also added one in the 2012 DFL-Supercup which Bayern won 2–1. This topped off Müller's highest scoring season to date.|$|E
