40|$|In the {{treatment}} planning of conformal radiotherapy, field shapes are often designed {{in such a}} way that a high-value <b>isodose</b> surface fully encompasses the target volume. Therefore, knowledge about the accuracy with which {{the treatment}} planning system calculates the position of that <b>isodose</b> surface is essential to prevent field shapes which are either too large or too small. To determine this accuracy for a conformal multi-field technique, the dose in the high-dose region must be measured with a high spatial resolution. A method is presented to reconstruct and evaluate the experimental high-dose region from a set of water phantom scans. This method, which assesses combined dose profiles for multi-field irradiation techniques, can be used for the commissioning and/or quality assurance of a 3 -D treatment planning system. For a specific conformal technique, the measured and calculated 95 % <b>isodose</b> positions along lines in several directions have been compared. It is shown that different dose values of single beam profiles determine the resulting 95 % <b>isodose</b> position, which is important to recognize for quality assurance of treatment planning calculations. It is further found that the uncertainty in the calculated 95 % <b>isodose</b> surface can be described by a standard deviation in dose value, which relates to a positional uncertainty through the local dose gradient. Thus the confidence region of the calculated 95 % <b>isodose</b> can be indicated in the treatment plan by plotting isodoses at the 95 % level plus and minus its standard deviation. Such a procedure is recommended instead of plotting the 95 % <b>isodose</b> with a constant width.

40|$|Introduction: Radiation therapy {{following}} breast conserving {{surgery is}} one of the most common procedures performed in any radiation oncology department. A tangential parallel-opposed pair is almost always the technique of choice for this purpose. This technique is often performed based on 3 D treatment planning. The aim of this study was to compare 3 D treatment planning for two different energies (Cobalt 60 versus 6 MV photon beams) in tangential irradiation of breast conserving radiotherapy. In this comparison, homogeneity of <b>isodoses</b> within the breast volume and dose received by lungs were considered. Materials and Methods: In this study, twenty patients with breast cancer treated with conservative surgery were included. A CT scan was performed on selected patients.

Methods and Materials: Three types of inhomogeneous dose distributions {{were applied to}} compare the radiosensitivity of the lateral and central parts of the rat cervical spinal cord.

40|$|Purpose: Confirmation of {{treatment}} delivery accuracy in stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of lung tumors suggests the possibility {{of treatment}} margin, or aperture reduction. In this investigation, the dose delivery to lung tumors using SBRT techniques was verified, and the feasibility of normal tissue sparing via aperture reduction or altered prescription <b>isodose</b> line was assessed. Methods: Planned and delivered doses to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and planning target volume (PTV) were compared for 10 patients using planning CT and conebeam CT image. Potential for reduction in normal tissue dose were assessed using 2 alternate treatment plans – reduced PTVs and alternate prescription techniques. Plans were assessed using conformity index, homogeneity index and the ratio of 50 % / 100 % <b>isodose</b> volumes (R 50 %). Results: The planned and delivered mean doses were consistent to within 4 %. However, the mean dose delivered to the GTV exceeded the prescription dose (Rx) by 19 % and is consistent with our planning technique of prescribing to the 80 % <b>isodose</b> line. When reducing treatment margins and retaining a constant dose-volume constraint, block margins had to be increased which produced a constant effective field aperture outside of the GTV. Prescription to a lower <b>isodose</b> line using stereotactic-like planning techniques yielded the only method by which {{the volume of the}} prescription <b>isodose</b> could be affected, although this yielded increases in normal tissue dose due to the increased monitor units required. Conversely, conventional prescription techniques using wider field apertures were effective in reducing absolute values of normal tissue dose. Although dose conformity was similar across different prescription <b>isodose</b> lines, homogeneity index and R 50 % values were significantly different in the 60 %- 70 % prescription <b>isodose</b> line plans than the 80 %, 90 % prescription plans. Conclusion: Traditional margin reduction techniques did not affect a reduction in the volume of normal tissue irradiated to the prescribed dose. Prescribing to low <b>isodose</b> lines yields reduced volumes of the prescribed dose, but at the expense of normal tissue dose.  </p...|$|E

40|$|Nasopharyngeal {{carcinoma}} (NPC) is a {{rare disease}} in Sweden. The purpose of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} clinicopathological manifestations of the disease and its treatment outcomes in a cohort of Swedish NPC patients to identify key features for future improvements in patient care. From 1991 to 2002, 50 NPC patients were treated with radical three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3 DCRT) +/- intracavitary brachytherapy (IBT) +/- chemotherapy at Jubileumskliniken, Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Retrospective analysis of the data showed 5 -year local, regional, and distant relapse-free survival rates of 70 %, 92 %, and 77 % for 49 nondisseminated patients. Patients with locoregionally advanced disease fared worse with respect to local and distant tumor control rates. Furthermore, the long-term side effects of irradiation were adverse and frequent in the whole cohort of patients. A comparative treatment planning study between intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and 3 DCRT + IBT was performed for eight NPC patients. The prescription physical dose for planning target volume of the primary tumor was 72. 6 Gy in IMRT and 72 Gy in the combined plans. The comparison of the plans using quantitative parameters revealed that IMRT plans provided more conformal plans with possibility of dose escalation in primary tumor and simultaneous sparing of several normal structures. These were translated into improved tumor control probability of the primary tumor and reduction of normal tissue complication probability for several organs. However IMRT plans resulted in significant increase of the mean volumes of low to intermediate <b>isodoses</b> (0. 66 Gy to 19. 8 Gy) by 30 % to 44 %. A comparative treatment planning study between IMRT and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) with equivalent dose prescriptions for primary tumour (72. 6 GyE) in the same cohort of patients showed that conformity of treatment plans and tumor coverage especially for locally advanced tumors were improved further by IMPT plans. Moreover, the integral dose (mean dose) was significantly reduced by a factor of 2 to 3 in several organs. The mean volume of low to intermediate <b>isodoses</b> (0. 66 Gy to 19. 8 Gy) were 2 to 2. 7 -fold larger in IMRT plans than in IMPT plans. Expression of EBV-encoded LMP 1, Ki- 67, cyclin-B 1, and EGFR were analyzed by immunohistochemical assays for 44 (45 for LMP 1) NPC patients. LMP 1 was expressed in 33 % of the patients and its presence was significantly correlated with advanced nodal and tumour stage. Statistically, expression of Ki- 67 and cyclin-B 1 showed no significant clinical relevance.

Results: A high similarity was found by overlapping of <b>isodoses</b> of the dose distribution measured with the gel and expected by the treatment planning system (TPS). Another analysis was done by comparing the relative absorbed dose profiles in the measured and in the expected dose distributions extracted along indicated lines of the volume and the results were also in agreement. The gamma index analysis was also applied to the data and a high pass rate was achieved (88. 4 % for analysis using 3 %/ 3 mm and of 96. 5 % using 4 %/ 4 mm).

40|$|BACKGROUND : Intensity {{modulated}} radiotherapy (IMRT) produces {{highly complex}} and conformal radiation dose distribution {{at the cost}} of exposing more normal tissue to low <b>isodoses</b> and greater monitor unit (MU) requirements. Hence concerns have been raised regarding its increased carcinogenic potential. AIMS : Over four experiments, this thesis examines the effect of IMRT on radio-carcinogenic risk through its alteration of radiation dose distribution within the treatment portals as well as its effect on scattered dose to tissues beyond the beam edge. The thesis examines the implications of such altered dose distribution for carcinogenic risk using a range of credible dose-response relationships. Dose distribution from IMRT and resultant carcinogenic risks are compared to those of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3 DCRT) for beam energies and disease sites relevant to clinical radiotherapy. The thesis also investigates the influence of beam energy on individual components of out-of-field scatter for both modalities. METHODS : The first experiment analyses in-field dose distribution through dose volume histogram (DVH) analysis and measures out-of-field scatter in an anthropomorphic phantom using thermo-luminescent dosimeters, for various clinical scenarios. Carcinogenic risks are calculated using several credible dose-response relationships by dividing normal tissues into smaller volumes of homogenous dose and summating their proportional carcinogenic contributions. Its findings questioned previous assertions about IMRT’s effect on out-of-field scatter and prompted two further experiments investigating out-of-field scatter in detail. These experiments were performed for both IMRT and 3 DCRT in a specially constructed water phantom using both low- and high-energy photon beams. They provide detailed information on the individual contributions of the constituent components of out-of-field dose, namely head leakage, collimator scatter and internally scattered radiation. They analyse the implications for carcinogenesis including the influence of photoneutrons. The fourth experiment described in the thesis is an extension of the first, and examines the effect of high energy pelvic IMRT on in-field dose distribution together with previously measured peripheral doses, so as to generate carcinogenic estimates for the entire body. This experiment also provides information regarding the clinically relevant area of gynaecologic IMRT which was not covered in the first experiment. OUTCOMES : IMRT is demonstrated to constrict high <b>isodoses</b> while spreading out lower ones. Thus the effect of IMRT on in-field risk is variably advantageous or disadvantageous depending on dose-response model used. IMRT is consistently demonstrated to increase overall out-of-field scatter because of excess collimator scatter, despite a reduction in internally scattered radiation. Head leakage contributes very little. IMRT thus invariably increases out-of-field carcinogenic risks but these increases are small in absolute terms. High-energy beams increase machine scatter, for both modalities but reduce internal scatter; the net effect on out-of-field photon dose approximates zero. Photoneutron production however is significant - especially for high-energy IMRT which produces roughly twice as many photoneutrons as 3 DCRT. These carry a high radio-carcinogenic risk. Carcinogenic risks are almost always increased by IMRT although relative risks appear lower than initially feared, and small in absolute terms. The increase in risk varies with dose-response model used, MU demand relative to 3 DCRT, anatomical site, beam arrangement and beam energy. Dose-response models reflecting ever-increasing risk with increasing dose (no plateau); and less inter-modality MU disparity favour IMRT. High-energy IMRT carries the highest carcinogenic risk...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{demonstrate}} the incidence, time course, predisposing factor and reversibility of neurotoxicity {{in children with}} brain tumors treated with high dose busulfan-thiotepa with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and radiation therapy in our institutional experience. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Between May 1988 and May 2007, 110 patients, median age 3. 6 years (range, 1 months- 15. 3 years), with brain tumors were treated with surgical intervention and conventional chemotherapy. All patients received one course of high-dose busulfan-thiotepa with stem cell rescue, followed or preceded by radiotherapy. Results: Twenty-three patients (21 %) developed neuroradiological abnormalities on follow-up imaging studies at a median time of 9. 2 months (range, 5. 6 - 17. 3 months) after day 0 of ASCT. All MRI-lesions appeared in patients receiving radiotherapy after ASCT and were localized inside the 50 - 55 Gy <b>isodoses.</b> They disappeared in 14 of 23 patients with a median time of 8 months (range, 3 - 17 months). The presence of MRI-abnormalities was a favorable prognostic factor for overall survival on univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 0. 12, 95 % confidence interval [0. 04, 0. 33]), with a 5 -year overall survival in patients with MRI-abnormalities of 84 % (95 % CI, 62 - 94), comparedto 27 % (95 % CI, 19 - 37) in those without lesions. On multivariate analysis, the presence of MRI-abnormalities was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Conclusion: MRI-detectable brain abnormalities are common early findings in children treated with high-dose busulfan-thiotepa followed by radiation therapy, and may mimic early tumor recurrence. They are correlated with a better outcome...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the ability of MRI normoxic polymer gel {{dosimetry}} for evaluating the dose distribution in HDR brachytherapy of esophagial cancer at Imam Reza brachytherapy center (Mashhad, Iran). Materials and Methods: Initially, 2 liters of normoxic gel (MAGIC) was fabricated and then poured into 12 calibration test tubes {{and placed in a}} perspex walled phantom. The gel phantom was irradiated with a brachytherapy remote-afterloader unit using a cobalt- 60 brachytherapy source and the test tubes were irradiated with a range of known doses with a cobalt- 60 teletherapy unit. Imaging was performed with a multi-spin-echo protocol and a T 2 quantitative technique using a Siemens 1. 5 T MRI machine. The MRI images were transferred to a computer and then image processing was performed in the MATLAB environment to extract R 2 maps of the irradiated area. Results: In this study and at the reference point, the dose deviation between the gel dosimetry and the calculated data was 4. 5 %. The distance to agreement (DTA) for dose profiles was 2. 7 mm. Also, dose sensitivity of the MAGIC gel dosimeter was 0. 693 S- 1 Gy- 1 (R 2 = 0. 9376). Conclusion: In this work, the data obtained from TPS calculations were found in very good agreement with the measured results provided by gel dosimetry. It was evaluated using a comparison of <b>isodoses</b> and dose at the reference point, and dose profile verification. It is also concluded that the gel dosimetry systems have proven to be a useful tool for dosimetry in clinical radiotherapy applications...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} brachytherapy {{model has}} been developed to study acute and late normal tissue reactions {{as a tool to}} examine the effects of clinically relevant multifractionation schedules. Pig skin was used as a model since its morphology, structure, cell kinetics and radiation-induced responses are similar to human skin. Brachytherapy was performed using a microSelectron high dose rate (HDR) afterloading machine with a single stepping source and a custom-made template. In this study the acute epidermal reactions of erythema and moist desquamation and the late dermal reactions of dusky mauve erythema and necrosis were evaluated after single doses of irradiation over a follow-up period of 16 weeks. The major aims of this work were: (a) to compare the effects of iridium- 192 (192 Ir) irradiation with effects after X-irradiation; (b) to compare the skin reactions in Yorkshire and Large White pigs; and (c) to standardize the methodology. For 192 Ir irradiation with 100 % <b>isodose</b> at the skin surface, the 95 % <b>isodose</b> was estimated at the basal membrane, while the 80 % <b>isodose</b> covered the dermal fat layers. After HDR 192 Ir irradiation of Yorkshire pig skin the ED 50 values (95 % <b>isodose)</b> for moderate/severe erythema and moist desquamation were 24. 8 Gy and 31. 9 Gy, respectively. The associated mean latent period (+/- SD) was 39 +/- 7 days for both skin reactions. Late skin responses of dusky mauve erythema and dermal necrosis were characterized by ED 50 values (80 % <b>isodose)</b> of 16. 3 Gy and 19. 5 Gy, with latent periods of 58 +/- 7 days and 76 +/- 12 days, respectively. After X-irradiation, the incidence of the various skin reactions and their latent periods were similar. Acute and late reactions were well separated in time. The occurrence of skin reactions and the incidence of effects were comparable in Yorkshire and Large White pigs for both X-irradiation and HDR 192 Ir brachytherapy. This pig skin model is feasible for future studies on clinically relevant multifractionation schedules in a brachytherapy setting...|$|E

AimIn this study the dosimetric properties of Varian Enhanced Dynamic Wedge (EDW) and physical wedges (PW) were analyzed and compared. Materials and methodsIonometric measurements of open field output factor, physical wedge output factor, physical wedge factor and EDW factor for photon beams were carried out. A 3 D scanning water phantom was used to scan depth dose and profiles for open and PW fields. The 2 D ionization matrix was used to measure profiles of physical and EDW wedges. The <b>isodose</b> curves of physical and EDW angles were obtained using a therapy verification film. Results and discussionThe PW output factors of photons were compared with the open field output factors. The physical and EDW factors were compared. The difference in percentage depth dose for open and PW fields was observed for both photon beams. The measured <b>isodose</b> plots for physical and EDW were compared. ConclusionThe wedge field output factor increases with field size and wedge angle compared to that of the open field output factor. The number of MU to deliver a particular dose with the EDW field is less than that of the PW field due to a change in wedge factor. The dosimetric characteristics, like profile and <b>isodose</b> of EDW, closely match with that of the PW...|$|E
40|$|Radiation therapy {{increasingly}} means Intensity Modulated Radiation Ther-apy (IMRT) {{and with}} it a trend towards inverse treatment planning. The met-rics of a treatment consist of important conformality indices such as the Ian Paddick Conformality Index (IPCI), Dose Volume Histograms (DVH), {{as well as the}} conformance <b>isodose</b> lines. This final metric, which offers spatial infor-mation of radiation dose that the others do not, shows the results of simulating the treatment plan on the CAT scan images. A physician is able to examine this image and ascertain which portions of the anatomy are the recipients of different levels of radiation dose. Computing <b>isodose</b> curves is no simple task, especially when the set of CAT scan images becomes large. Our approach is to first interpolate a surface over a finite mesh of scalar data representing the dose distribution in that plane, then find the set of points which constitute that <b>isodose</b> level by using a variation on a an approach called the Hit-and-Run algorithm. We examine the behavior of our algorithm in dealing with sample radiotherapy plans as well as constructed examples to determine the effectiveness of this approach...|$|E
40|$|Prediction of dose {{distributions}} {{in close}} proximity to interfaces is difficult. In the context of radiotherapy of lung tumors, this may affect the minimum dose received by lesions and is particularly important when prescribing dose to covering <b>isodoses.</b> The objective of this work is to quantify underdosage in key regions around a hypothetical target using Monte Carlo dose calculation methods, and to develop a factor for clinical estimation of such underdosage. A systematic set of calculations are undertaken using 2 Monte Carlo radiation transport codes (EGSnrc and GEANT 4). Discrepancies in dose are determined for a number of parameters, including beam energy, tumor size, field size, and distance from chest wall. Calculations were performed for 1 -mm(3) regions at proximal, distal, and lateral aspects of a spherical tumor, determined for a 6 -MV and a 15 -MV photon beam. The simulations indicate regions of tumor underdose at the tumor-lung interface. Results are presented as ratios of the dose at key peripheral regions to the dose {{at the center of the}} tumor, a point at which the treatment planning system (TPS) predicts the dose more reliably. Comparison with TPS data (pencil-beam convolution) indicates such underdosage would not have been predicted accurately in the clinic. We define a dose reduction factor (DRF) as the average of the dose in the periphery in the 6 cardinal directions divided by the central dose in the target, the mean of which is 0. 97 and 0. 95 for a 6 -MV and 15 -MV beam, respectively. The DRF can assist clinicians in the estimation of the magnitude of potential discrepancies between prescribed and delivered dose distributions as a function of tumor size and location. Calculation for a systematic set of "generic" tumors allows application to many classes of patient case, and is particularly useful for interpreting clinical trial dat...|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{therapy with}} {{electron}} beams {{is a technique}} that continues {{to be used by}} many clinics. The characteristic depth dose with a dose build up and rapid dose drop off beyond the peak dose permits a lesion to be treated with a relatively uniform dose whilst sparing deeper normal tissue. There are three general methods employed to modulate electron beams; a) Intensity Modulated Electron Therapy b) Segmented-field Electron Conformal Therapy, c) Bolus Electron Conformal Therapy, which can be used to achieve one or a combination of three aims; 1) level an irregular surface and improve dose distributions (missing tissue compensator), 2) reduce the penetration of the electron beam in certain areas (shaping <b>isodoses</b> closer to the distal edge of the target volume), 3) increase the surface dose at energies below 10 MeV. The most commonly employed method in a general radiotherapy practice to modify an electron beam is the application of a tissue like material (bolus) to the skin surface, in the strictest sense this is not Bolus Electron Conformal Therapy (BolusECT) but rather an element of the method as the bolus applied usually lacks sophisticated contouring. The first two methods mentioned are both technically and resource challenging for a general radiotherapy clinic. Unfortunately the application of bolus does have some limitations; it is not usually sterile and the daily application in areas where there may be ulcerated, necrotic or haemorrhaging tissue can lead to an unhygienic situation. In addition there are times when it is difficult to mould or reproducibly position the bolus to the particular surface irregularities leading to suboptimal treatment delivery. Moving the bolus to the applicator level alleviates the contact and positional reproducibility difficulties however it does introduce new challenges in understanding how this will affect the electron beam dosimetry for the clinical treatment. This thesis provides the reader with some of the information necessary to understand the new challenges...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Parameter {{optimization}} in {{the process}} of inverse treatment planning for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is mainly conducted by human planners {{in order to create a}} plan with the desired dose distribution. To automate this tedious process, an artificial intelligence (AI) guided system was developed and examined. Methods The AI system can automatically accomplish the optimization process based on prior knowledge operated by several fuzzy inference systems (FIS). Prior knowledge, which was collected from human planners during their routine trial-and-error process of inverse planning, has first to be "translated" to a set of "if-then rules" for driving the FISs. To minimize subjective error which could be costly during this knowledge acquisition process, it is necessary to find a quantitative method to automatically accomplish this task. A well-developed machine learning technique, based on an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), was introduced in this study. Based on this approach, prior knowledge of a fuzzy inference system can be quickly collected from observation data (clinically used constraints). The learning capability and the accuracy of such a system were analyzed by generating multiple FIS from data collected from an AI system with known settings and rules. Results Multiple analyses showed good agreements of FIS and ANFIS according to rules (error of the output values of ANFIS based on the training data from FIS of 7. 77 ± 0. 02 %) and membership functions (3. 9 %), thus suggesting that the "behavior" of an FIS can be propagated to another, based on this process. The initial experimental results on a clinical case showed that ANFIS is an effective way to build FIS from practical data, and analysis of ANFIS and FIS with clinical cases showed good planning results provided by ANFIS. OAR volumes encompassed by characteristic percentages of <b>isodoses</b> were reduced by a mean of between 0 and 28 %. Conclusion The study demonstrated a feasible way to automatically perform parameter optimization of inverse treatment planning under guidance of prior knowledge without human intervention other than providing a set of constraints that have proven clinically useful in a given setting. </p...|$|R
