5|$|The main gun {{tower is}} flanked by two mid-16th century gun platforms, altered in the 18th century to house newer forms of artillery. <b>Just</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> gun tower is Saint Petrox Church, a three-aisled {{building}} which dates {{in its current form}} to 1641, with some alterations resulting from its restoration in 1833.|$|E

5|$|Around 1900, {{there were}} six {{stopping}} trains an hour between Willesden Green and Baker Street. One of these came from Rickmansworth and another from Harrow, the rest started at Willesden Green. There was also a train every two hours from Verney Junction, which stopped at all stations to Harrow, then Willesden Green and Baker Street. The timetable was arranged so that the fast train would leave Willesden Green just before a stopping service and arrived at Baker Street <b>just</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> previous service.|$|E

5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based on the {{standard}} arthropod model of a pair of nerve cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia <b>just</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only one pair of pre-oral ganglia instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.|$|E

5|$|The Chicago Union Stock Yards Fire {{started on}} December 22, 1910, {{destroying}} $400,000 {{of property and}} killing twenty-one firemen, including the Fire Marshal James J. Horan. Fifty engine companies and seven hook and ladder companies fought the fire until it was declared extinguished by Chief Seyferlich on December 23.

Only one medieval manor house survives: the 15th century Manor Farmhouse in Loughton. There are sites of other manor houses in Great Woolstone, Milton Keynes village and Woughton on the Green. The oldest surviving domestic building is Number22, Milton Keynes (village), the house of the bailiff of the manor of Bradwell.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, Banksia serrata {{is found}} on well-drained sandy soils that {{are low in}} nutrients, and is often found on stabilised soil near the coast but <b>just</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> main dune system. In the Sydney region it is found with other typical {{woodland}} species, including yellow bloodwood (Corymbia eximia), red bloodwood (C. gummifera), silvertop ash (Eucalyptus sieberi), blue-leaved stringybark (E. agglomerata) and Sydney peppermint (E. piperita).|$|E
5|$|Choding Khang is the hermitage located <b>just</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Great Assembly Hall (on {{the hill}} slope of Sera Utse). This is where Je Tsongkhapa meditated.

A new building has been constructed {{in place of}} the old hermitage, which was destroyed during the Revolution. Below the hermitage are the Upper Tantric College (Gyuto) and Lower Tantric College (Gyu-me) of Lhasa). A further climb up the hill leads to caves where Tsongkhapa meditated.|$|E

5|$|Dorothy died in 1586 and Robert married Dorothy Dymock, {{with whom}} he had seven {{children}} at Plas Mawr. When Robert died in 1598 he left a complex will that led to legal disputes between the family and the executor, Sir Roger Mostyn. The legal case effectively halted any further development of the house, by now the most prominent in Conwy, until its resolution in 1630. The property passed to Robert's grandson, another Robert Wynn, in 1637, and onto his daughter, Elin in 1683. By 1665, the house was equipped to a quality and style that would have put it only <b>just</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> houses of the major gentry families in Caernarfonshire. Elin then married into the Wynne family, and made little use of the house, and it ultimately passed by marriage into the Mostyn family.|$|E
5|$|Duke of Marmalade {{was then}} moved {{directly}} into Group Two class; {{he was sent}} to England for the Vintage Stakes at Goodwood in July, where his opponents included the July Stakes winner Strategic Prince. Ridden by Michael Kinane he raced <b>just</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> leaders before being moved forward to challenge the leaders in the straight. He made ground steadily, but was unable to reach the front and finished second, beaten by a neck by Strategic Prince. Before his run at Goodwood, Duke of Marmalade had been supported in the betting for the following year's 2000 Guineas, but shortly after the race he suffered a pastern injury which required surgery; as a result, he did not race again in 2006.|$|E
5|$|<b>Just</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Greyfriars turret is the islet of Helgeandsholmen, {{where the}} {{northern}} city gate and defensive wall were located. Today occupied by the Swedish Parliament, this islet was named after the charitable institution, Helige andens holme ("Islet of the Holy Spirit"), located there from around 1300 and discernible in the painting as a building with stepped gables facing an open space perhaps indicating {{the location of the}} demolished Johannite monastery. King Gustav Vasa had all the charitable institutions in the city merged into a single one housed in the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen, so the monasteries in the painting were all the possession of the crown when the painting was produced.|$|E

5|$|Massive {{resources}} {{were required to}} construct Castle Rising, which included three baileys with large earthwork defences and a stone keep, with an adjacent deer park <b>just</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> castle. As part of the project, the existing settlement was moved away to the north, where it became a planned settlement adjacent to the new castle. A pre-existing Norman chapel on the site, built around 1100, was encircled by the castle defences, and the new parish church of St Lawrence {{was built in the}} town instead, although it is possible that this church also pre-dates the castle. William received permission from King Stephen to open a mint at the castle in 1145 and, probably linked to this development, settled a community of Jews in the town.|$|E
5|$|Originating {{below the}} fourth pair of gill slits, the {{pectoral}} fins are short, broad, and falcate (sickle-shaped) with pointed tips. The first dorsal fin {{is tall and}} falcate with a distinctively long free rear tip, and is positioned <b>just</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> pectoral fin bases. The second dorsal fin is large and tall without a notably elongated free rear tip, and is positioned over or slightly behind the anal fin. Usually there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins, and when present the ridge is slight. The caudal peduncle has a deep crescent-shaped notch at the upper caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
5|$|The Waterloo {{position}} {{was a strong}} one. It consisted of a long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along {{the crest of the}} ridge ran the Ohain road, a deep sunken lane. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was a large elm tree that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line <b>just</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.|$|E
