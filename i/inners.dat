5|$|The plumage is {{generally}} light gray-brown and lighter and pinkish below. The wings have black spotting, {{and the outer}} tail feathers are white, contrasting with the black <b>inners.</b> Below the eye is a distinctive crescent-shaped area of dark feathers. The eyes are dark, with light skin surrounding them. The adult male has bright purple-pink patches on the neck sides, with light pink coloring reaching the breast. The crown of the adult male is a distinctly bluish-grey color. Females are similar in appearance, but with more brown coloring overall and a little smaller than the male. The iridescent feather patches on the neck above the shoulders are nearly absent, but can be quite vivid on males. Juvenile birds have a scaly appearance, and are generally darker.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{was careful}} with his fitness, {{following}} an ankle injury in 1964 {{kept him from}} the first seven games of the season. Taylor wore two pairs of thin Chamois <b>inners</b> and Mitre wicket-keeping gloves from which he cut away all the padding from inside the palms and removed the webbing. His reasoning for this was that he liked to feel the ball in his palm and if taking the ball correctly {{most of the time}} the bruising wasn't too troublesome. This can be contrasted with Knott who preferred plenty of padding on his palms.|$|E
25|$|Knott {{was known}} for his {{idiosyncratic}} behaviour on the field. His trademarks included always keeping his shirt collar turned up to protect him from the sun; his sleeves rolled down to safeguard his elbows when diving; and, after a tip from former Northamptonshire and England wicket-keeper Keith Andrew, warming his hands with hot water before going on the field. According to Bob Taylor, Knott preferred strong-backed gloves with full webbing and plenty of padding in the palms, wearing two pairs of Chamois <b>inners</b> with strips of plasticine across the palms.|$|E

2500|$|Eschewing {{the usual}} {{gatefold}} design {{in favour of}} a special die-cut cover, the original album jacket included four covers made up of two <b>inners</b> (for each disc), a middle insert cover and an outer cover. The middle insert cover is white and details all the album track listings and recording information. The outer cover has die-cut windows on the building, so when the middle cover is wrapped around the inner covers and slid into the outer cover, {{the title of the}} album is shown on the front cover, spelling out the name [...] "Physical Graffiti". Images in the windows touched upon a set of American icons and a range of Hollywood ephemera. Pictures of W.C. Fields and Buzz Aldrin alternated with the snapshots of Led Zeppelin. Photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald and Marcel Duchamp are also featured.|$|E

During Bunyan's {{lifetime}} England {{was in a}} {{state of}} religious [...] ferment or revival, and his experience of it is vividly portrayed [...] in a remarkable autobiography called Grace Abounding to the [...] Chief of <b>inners.</b> In reading this book we find that his life is [...] naturally separated into two periods. His youth was a time of [...] struggle with doubts and temptations; his later years were [...] characterized by inward peace and tireless labor. His peace meant [...] that he was saved, his labor that he must save others. Here, in a [...] word, is the secret of all his works.|$|E

40|$|Questionnaires {{are often}} used as {{measures}} of <b>inner</b> experience. This study questions the adequacy of such measures, using <b>inner</b> speech as an example. We compared two questionnaire measures of <b>inner</b> speaking {{to each other and}} to <b>inner</b> experience as apprehended by Descriptive Experience Sampling (DES, a naturalistic, high fidelity method of exploring <b>inner</b> experience). Undergraduate volunteers (N = 260) took two questionnaires designed to measure <b>inner</b> speaking: the Self-Talk Scale (STS) and the Nevada <b>Inner</b> Experience Questionnaire (NIEQ). A subset of these (N = 16) participated in DES to investigate their <b>inner</b> speaking with fidelity. Scores on the NIEQ and STS were strongly correlated. However, the correlations between either questionnaire and DES-apprehended <b>inner</b> speaking were near zero—questionnaire ratings of <b>inner</b> speaking grossly overestimated the frequency of <b>inner</b> speaking as found by DES. These results suggest that questionnaire responses may be based more on presuppositions about experience than on actually occurring experience, and suggest caution in using questionnaires to study <b>inner</b> experience...|$|R

6000|$|There {{is nothing}} in Mr. Stevenson's {{sometimes}} writing essays, sometimes romances, and anon poems to mark him versatile beyond other authors. One dreads his continuing to do so, with so many books at his back, lest it means weakness rather than strength. He experiments too long; {{he is still a}} boy wondering what he is going to be. With Cowley's candor he tells us that he wants to write something by which he may be forever known. His attempts in this direction have been in the nature of trying different ways, and he always starts off whistling. Having gone so far without losing himself, he turns back to try another road. Does his heart fail him, despite his jaunty bearing, or is it because there is no hurry? Though all his books are obviously by the same hand, no living writer has come so near fame from so many different sides. Where is the man among us who could write another [...] "Virginibus Puerisque," [...] the most delightful volume for the hammock ever sung in prose? The poems are as exquisite as they are artificial. [...] "Jekyll and Hyde" [...] is the greatest triumph extant in Christmas literature of the morbid kind. The donkey on the Cevennes (how Mr. Stevenson belabored him!) only stands second to the [...] "Inland Voyage." [...] "Kidnapped" [...] is the outstanding boy's book of its generation. [...] "The Black Arrow" [...] alone, to my thinking, is second class. We shall all be doleful if a marksman who can pepper his target with <b>inners</b> does not reach the bull's-eye. But it is quite time the great work was begun. The sun sinks while the climber walks round his mountain, looking for the best way up.|$|E
