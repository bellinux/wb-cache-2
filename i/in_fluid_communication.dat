The creation of therapeutic agent deliverydevices that are capable of delivering therapeutic agents incontrolled ways is still a challenge. One of the majorrequirements for an implantable drug delivery device iscontrolled release of therapeutic agents, ranging from smalldrug molecules to larger biological molecules. It is particularlydesirable to achieve a continuous passive drug releaseprofile consistent with zero order kinetics whereby theconcentration of drug in the bloodstream remains constantthroughout an extended delivery period.
