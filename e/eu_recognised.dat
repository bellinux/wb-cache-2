40|$|The European Commission in {{the past}} has updated the {{regulations}} regarding marine operations in order to enhance safety and protection of the environment. In that respect and with the scope to enhance safety onboard ships, Regulation No 391 / 2009 and in particular Article 10 on certification of ships suggested that <b>EU</b> <b>Recognised</b> Organisations (EU ROs) should harmonise their rules and procedures related to certification of materials, equipment and components based on equivalent standards issued by them. As a result the EU ROs Mutual Recognition (MR) scheme was initiated. This article investigates the current implementation of the requirements of Article 10 through the developed questionnaire and case studies. The results have shown that while safety is considered at the highest level, the current implementation needs further improvement and harmonisation of individual rules which can be delivered as the process matures. Additional information and dissemination of the overall MR process is also required engaging all marine industry. The current implementation is regarded as acceptable; however, the expansion of the scheme is a cause for concern.

(Morecambe North, Morecambe South and Heysham) were analysed for thermophilic campylobacters, salmonellae, faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci over a 12 -month period. Campylobacters show a strong seasonality. They are generally absent {{in the summer}} months but are consistently present in the winter. The main Campylobacter species isolated were C. lari and urease-positive thermophilic campylobacters (UPTC), {{both of which are}} associated with avian hosts. C. jejuni and C. coli and Salmonella were not isolated from the sediments. Faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci were isolated throughout the year with no obvious seasonal trends in their numbers. Higher numbers were found at Morecambe North and South than at Heysham. There was no discernible relationship between the numbers of campylobacters and faecal indicators. Faecal indicators were found predominantly in the surface layers of the sediments and declined in number with depth. Campylobacters were restricted to the surface layer. Experimental results for the in situ deposition of bacteria onto clean, sterile surfaces from the water column during tidal cover showed deposition rates equivalent to approximately 0. 1 % of the total population of faecal coliforms, 0. 01 % of the faecal streptococci and 1 % of the campylobacters in the sediments. These rates of accretion were not high enough to be detected during routine sampling carried out before and after high water, using standard methods. The results show that the sediments act as a reservoir for bacteria, especially the faecal indicators. In rough weather resuspension can contribute significantly to bacterial numbers in the surface waters...|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we argue, with regret, that the {{prospects}} for criminal legal aid in England and Wales are bleak. We begin by tracing {{the development of the}} modern system of criminal legal aid, from its inception as an essential element of the welfare state following the Second World War, to its peak in the 1990 s. We then describe and analyse its decline, arguing that whilst the need for economy and efficiency, especially following the global financial crisis of 2007 - 08, has been used to rationalise government policy in the first decade and a half of the twenty-first century, the roots of that decline are deeper, and reflect an antipathy not only to state welfare provision but also to procedural justice and fair trial. This is followed by an examination of the likely impact of both budget cuts and changes to the arrangements for managing and delivering criminal legal aid. Whilst there are grounds for optimism at the international level, with both the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (<b>EU)</b> <b>recognising</b> the fundamental importance of legal aid in underpinning justice and fair trial, successive British governments have lacked a commitment to developing and sustaining a high quality criminal legal aid system...|$|R
40|$|We {{write you}} {{today as a}} group of 226 {{non-governmental}} organisations- representing millions of members throughout Europe and around the world- to urge a permanent end to the importation of wild birds into the European Union. Each year, hundreds of thousands of wild-caught birds are imported into the EU. These imports pose serious and substantial risks to the species traded, to the health and livelihoods of European citizens, and to our identities as responsible and humane global citizens. The <b>EU</b> <b>recognised</b> these risks when it imposed a precautionary moratorium on imports of wild caught birds earlier this year and extended the moratorium again this summer. In our collective view, the most responsible, humane, and science-based course of action is for the EU to make that ban permanent, and join the growing number of nations around the world that have withdrawn from the risky and unacceptable commercial trade in wild birds 1. For this reason, we respectfully call upon the European Union to immediately and permanently halt the commercial importation of wild birds. Wild Bird Imports Threaten Human Lives and Livelihoods International movements of wildlife amplify disease risks to humans, livestock, and local wildlife. Despite our best efforts to quarantine, control, and screen for infectious diseases, history has repeatedly demonstrated that importing wild birds poses recurrent and serious disease risks for both human and animal populations, that outbreaks of such diseases are difficult to prevent and costly to control, and that their impacts are felt throughout the economy. Two recent avian disease outbreaks exemplify our concerns and give credence to the scale and immediacy of the problem at hand. Avian Influenza The current epidemic of avian influenza in Asia {{is only one of many}} ongoing outbreaks of this deadly and virulent disease. Outbreaks of various avian flu strains have also crippled or are now devastating the poultry industry in Europe (Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium in 2002) and North America (Britis...|$|E
40|$|The {{first report}} of the disease (“pine wilt disease”) {{associated}} with the pinewood nematode, goes back to 1905, when Yano reported an unusual decline of pines from Nagasaki. For a long time thereafter, the cause of he disease was sought, but without success. Because of {{the large number of}} insect species that were usually seen around and on infected trees, it had always been assumed that the causal agent would prove to be one of these. However, in 1971, Kiyohara and Tokushike found a nematode of the genus Bursaphelenchus in infected trees. The nematode found was multiplied on fungal culture, inoculated into healthy trees and then re-isolated from the resulting wilted trees. The subsequent published reports were impressive: this Bursaphelenchus species could kill fully-grown trees within a few months in the warmer areas of Japan, and could destroy complete forests of susceptible pine species within a few years. Pinus densiflora, P. thunbergii und P. luchuensis were particularly affected. In 1972, Mamiya and Kiyohara described the new species of nematode extracted from the wood of diseased pines; it was a named Bursaphelenchus lignicolus. Since 1975, the species has spread to the north of Japan, {{with the exception of the}} most northerly prefectures. In 1977, the loss of wood in the west of the country reached 80 %. Probably as a result of unusually high summer temperatures and reduced rainfall in the years 1978 and 1979, the losses were more than 2 million m 3 per year. From the beginning, B. lignicolus was always considered by Japanese scientists to be an exotic pest. But where did it come from? That this nematode could also cause damage in the USA became clear in 1979 when B. lignicolus was isolated in great numbers from wood of a 39 year-old pine tree (Pinus nigra) in Missouri which had suddenly died after the colour of its needles changed to a reddish-brown colour (Dropkin und Foudin, 2 1979). In 1981, B. lignicolus was synonymised by Nickle et al. with B. xylophilus which had been found for the first time in the USA as far back as 1929, and reported by Steiner and Buhrer in 1934. It had originally been named Aphelenchoides xylophilus, the wood-inhabiting Aphelenchoides but was recognised by Nickle, in 1970,to belong in the genus Bursaphelenchus. Its common name in the USA was the "pine wood nematode" (PWN. After its detection in Missouri, it became known that B. xylophilus was widespread throughout the USA and Canada. It occurred there on native species of conifers where, as a rule, it did not show the symptoms of pine wilt disease unless susceptible species were stressed eg., by high temperature. This fact was an illuminating piece of evidence that North America could be the homeland of PWN. Dwinell (1993) later reported the presence of B. xylophilus in Mexico. The main vector of the PWN in Japan was shown to be the long-horned beetle Monochamus alternatus, belonging to the family Cerambycidae. This beetle lays its eggs in dead or dying trees where the developing larvae then feed in the cambium layer. It was already known in Japan in the 19 th century but in the 1930 s, it was said to be present in most areas of Japan, but was generally uncommon. However, with the spread of the pine wilt disease, and the resulting increase of weakened trees that could act as breeding sites for beetles, the populations of Monochamus spp. increased significantly In North America, other Monochamus species transmit PWN, and the main vector is M. carolinensis. In Japan, there are also other, less efficient vectors in the genus Monochamus. Possibly, all Monochamus species that breed in conifers can transmit the PWN. The occasional transmission by less efficient species of Monochamus or by some of the many other beetle genera in the bark or wood is of little significance. In Europe, M. galloprovincialis and M. sutor transmits the closely related species B. mucronatus. Some speculate that these two insect species are “standing by” and waiting for the arrival of B. xylophilus. In 1982, the nematode was detected and China. It was first found in dead pines near the Zhongshan Monument of Nanjing (CHENG et. al. 1983); 265 trees were then killed by pine wilt disease. Despite great efforts at eradication in China, the nematode spread further and pine wilt disease has been 3 reported from parts of the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, Shandong, Zhejiang and Hubei (YANG, 2003). In 1986, the spread of the PWN to Taiwan was discovered and in 1989, the nematode was reported to be present in the Republic of Korea where it had first been detected in Pinus thunbergii and P. densiflora. It was though to have been introduced with packing material from Japan. PWN was advancing. In 1984, B. xylophilus was found in wood chips imported into Finland from the USA and Canada, and this was the impetus to establish phytosanitary measures to prevent any possible spread into Europe. Finland prohibited the import of coniferous wood chips from these sources, and the other Nordic countries soon followed suit. EPPO (the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization) made a recommendation to its member countries in 1986 to refuse wood imports from infested countries. With its Directive of 1989 (77 / 93 EEC), the European Community (later called the European Union or <b>EU)</b> <b>recognised</b> the potential danger of B. xylophilus for European forests and imposed restrictions on imports into the Europe. PWN was placed on the quarantine list of the EU and also of other European countries. Later, in 1991, a dispensation was allowed by the Commission of the EU(92 / 13 EEC) for coniferous wood from North America provided that certain specified requirements were fulfilled that would prevent introduction...|$|E
