5|$|Citing {{the limited}} {{size of the}} market as the main {{impediment}} in economic growth, Nurkse reasons that an increase in productivity can create a virtuous circle of growth. Thus, a large scale investment programme in {{a wide array of}} industries simultaneously is the answer. The increase <b>in</b> <b>demand</b> for one industry will lead to an increase <b>in</b> <b>demand</b> for another industry due to complementarity of demands. As Say's Law states, supply creates its own demand.|$|E

5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase <b>in</b> <b>demand</b> is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop <b>in</b> <b>demand</b> from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E
