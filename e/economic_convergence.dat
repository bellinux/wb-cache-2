25|$|After a {{short period}} of {{economic}} divergence before 1914, the Portuguese economy recovered slightly until 1950, entering thereafter on a path of strong <b>economic</b> <b>convergence.</b> Economically, most of the Salazar years (1933–1968) were marked by a period of modest growth and the country remained largely underdeveloped and its population relatively poor and with low education levels well into until the 1960s. Portuguese economic growth in the period 1960–1973 created an opportunity for real integration with the developed economies of Western Europe. Through emigration, trade, tourism and foreign investment, individuals and firms changed their patterns of production and consumption, bringing about a structural transformation. Simultaneously, the increasing complexity of a growing economy raised new technical and organizational challenges, stimulating the formation of modern professional and management teams.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{benefits}} of NAFTA have been quantified by several economists, whose {{findings have been}} reported in several publications like the World Bank's Lessons from NAFTA for LA and the Caribbean, NAFTA's Impact on North America, and NAFTA revisited by the Institute for International Economics. They assess that NAFTA has been positive for Mexico, whose poverty rates have fallen, and real income salaries have risen even after accounting for the 1994–1995 Economic Crisis. Nonetheless, they also state that it has not been enough, or fast enough, to produce an <b>economic</b> <b>convergence</b> nor to reduce the poverty rates substantially or to promote higher rates of growth. Beside this the textile industry gain hype with this agreement and the textile industry in Mexico gained open access to the American market, promoting exports to the United States. The value of Mexican cotton and apparel exports to the U.S. grew from $3billion in 1995 to $8.4billion in 2002, a record high of $9.4billion in 2000. At the same time, the share of Mexico’s cotton textile market the U.S. has increased from 8 percent in 1995 to 13 percent in 2002.

In 1995, a random anonymous survey of 178 members of the Economic History Association found {{that out of the}} 40 propositions about American economic history that were surveyed, the propositions most disputed by economic historians and economists were those surrounding the postbellum economy of the American South.

[...] 62 percent of economists (24 percent with and 38 percent without provisos) and 73 percent of historians (23 percent with and 50 percent without provisos) agreed with this statement. Wright has also argued that the private investment of monetary resources in the cotton industry, among others, delayed development in the South of commercial and industrial institutions. There was little public investment in railroads or other infrastructure. Wright argues that agricultural technology was far more developed in the South, representing an economic advantage of the South over the North of the United States.|$|E

Moreover, the results indicate that there was an income per capita convergence within Visegrad countries. Switching to a panel data approach, and controlling for macroeconomic stability, financial development, human and physical capital accumulations and other policy variables, the results seem to suggest that there was a conditional convergence across EU 15 and transitive economies in the 1990 s. transitive economies, panel data, <b>economic</b> growth, <b>convergence...</b>|$|R

40|$|Globalization {{process has}} entailed trade openness, greater {{emphasis}} on foreign direct investment, stabilization policies, redefining {{the role of the}} state, among others. Given that another major global trend observed is one of regional trade integration, the paper explores whether due to this trend there has been any concrete relationship with the growth convergence/divergence outcomes. Tests of Beta-convergence under different model specifications suggest that over time developed and developing countries have not converged in terms of their real per capita GDP though they have converged within their own groups of developed and developing countries. Thus, it is concluded that regional trade integration leads to growth convergence regionally and both openness to global trade and regional trade openness are important. However, the results of the paper need to be interpreted with caution due to the presence of non-stationarity, though the problem is not uniform across variables, tests and regional groupings. A policy inference that can be drawn is that at the global level economic cooperation for <b>economic</b> growth <b>convergence</b> needs to be flagged and appropriate institutional mechanisms created to intensify the processes of trade and FDI integration. Broadly, the results are in consonance with the predictions of the New Growth Theories. globalization, FDI, regional trade integration, economic cooperation for <b>economic</b> growth <b>convergence...</b>|$|R
