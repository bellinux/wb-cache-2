He says, 'I even now must be very reticent.'

Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} {{for the first}} Old Firm match of the season on 18 September 2011, but was substituted {{towards the end of}} the match after suffering a further recurrence of the injury. Neil Lennon said after the match that Brown had been one of Celtic's best players, as he had been involved in both of their goals during the 4–2 defeat. Celtic announced after the match that Brown would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> see a specialist and would be out of action for several months. Brown made his return on 30 November, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 loss against Atlético Madrid. The next day, he was able to talk with other clubs about signing a pre-contract agreement. However, Brown signed a new three-year deal on 3 December, with Celtic having the option of extending his contract for a further season. The deal had been delayed for so long because Celtic were not willing to pay the fee demanded by Brown's advisors. Brown continued his comeback by scoring in a 2–0 away win against St Mirren on 21 January 2012. He then scored a penalty against Falkirk, in a 3–1 League Cup semi-final win, on 30 January. [...] He followed this up with another penalty in Celtic's 2–0 win over Inverness five days later. Brown was then named Player of the Month for January 2012. On 25 March 2012, Brown scored a penalty in Celtic's 3–2 loss to Rangers.|$|E

[...] Banks-Smith also called the story [...] "slightly unexpected" [...] and stated, [...] "Spooks appears to plume itself on its authenticity, and there are moments, well one moment, so stupid {{it has to be}} true." [...] Fellow Guardian {{reviewer}} Gareth McLean stated that Spooks is [...] "so good it makes {{you want to be a}} spy." [...] Dennis Landmann of MovieFreak rated the series eight out of ten, calling it [...] "thrilling, dramatic, and fast", while [...] "much more concise" [...] than many American series. Landmann added; [...] "Each story is complex and convincing, plus the scripts are very well written. A lot goes on in each episode, and it's detrimental for a show like this to keep the action and tension going as fast as possible." [...] The reviewer also noted that having only six episodes worked as an advantage over American television, stating [...] "while this seems incredibly short, the idea is actually very good. This ensures that each episode is strong in content and execution. American shows tend to run for 20–25 episodes a season, and while developments occur, there are always the filler episodes. With [...] there is nothing like it, no filler material at all. In fact, the first season sees a lot of development." ...|$|E

It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> pump gas for twelve hours a day.

And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I've had so many fucking bullshit jobs for the half of my life - you know, working in furniture warehouses and planting trees, painting houses - and it's a lot more fun to play music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ronaldo was {{the last}} Brazilian player {{out of the tunnel}} as the teams entered the field. During the playing of the Brazil {{national}} anthem the camera focused on him throughout, with Ronaldo showing little emotion. Steinberg states that Ronaldo [...] "sleepwalked" [...] through the final in what was a below par performance for the striker, which also saw him injured in a collision with French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Zagallo admitted the fears over Ronaldo affected his team psychologically, and stated [...] "for the whole of the first half I was wondering whether to take him off", but feared a public outcry in Brazil had he done so. Brazil lost the match to hosts France 3–0. Ronaldo later reflected: [...] "We lost the World Cup but I won another cup - my life." [...] An inquest was launched in Brazil, with team doctor Lídio Toledo telling the commission [...] "imagine if I stopped Ronaldo playing and Brazil lost. At that moment I'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> live on the North Pole." [...] Adrian Williams, professor of clinical neurology at Birmingham University, said that Ronaldo should not have played, saying that he would have been feeling the after effects of the seizure and that [...] "there is no way that he {{would have been able to}} perform to the best of his ability within 24 hours of his first fit – if it was his first fit." [...] Despite his sub-par performance in the final due to his seizure hours earlier, Ronaldo was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament for his performances leading up to the final, and finished the tournament as the joint-third highest scorer.|$|E
