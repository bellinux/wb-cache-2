25|$|Activities {{that involve}} <b>interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> are {{permitted}} under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000; {{this kind of}} interception can only be carried out after a warrant has been issued by a Secretary of State. The Human Rights Act 1998 requires the intelligence agencies, including GCHQ, to respect citizens' rights {{as described in the}} European Convention on Human Rights.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the IPT {{ruled that}} the {{legislative}} framework in the United Kingdom does not permit mass surveillance and that while GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, it does not practice mass surveillance. This complements independent reports by the <b>Interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communications</b> Commissioner, and a special report made by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament; although several shortcomings and potential improvements to both oversight and the legislative framework were highlighted.|$|E

25|$|The {{formation}} of the international UKUSA surveillance agreement of 1946 evolved into the ECHELON collaboration by 1955 of five English-speaking nations, {{also known as the}} Five Eyes, and focused on <b>interception</b> <b>of</b> electronic <b>communications,</b> with substantial increases in domestic surveillance capabilities.|$|R
25|$|The law {{enforcement}} agencies have since been heavily criticised by the Honourable Mr Justice Woo V-P, the Commissioner on <b>Interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communications</b> and Surveillance. He remarked that some {{law enforcement}} officers were dishonest and unwilling to cooperate, behaved in an arrogant and presumptuous manner that was bordering on recalcitrance, and disobeyed orders by deleting relevant recordings of covert surveillance. It was also revealed that the government relied on a Canadian precedent to question the Commissioner's power to access covert surveillance recordings, and that a legislative amendment {{may be required to}} clarify the situation. An outrage was caused when it was revealed ICAC officers spent four days tapping a man's phone line although their target was a supposed to be female. Also revealed were four cases of unauthorised ICAC tapping of phone conversations between lawyers and their clients in 2007.|$|E
25|$|During the transition, then-C Sir Colin McColl {{embraced a}} new, albeit limited, policy of {{openness}} towards the press and public, with 'public affairs' falling into the brief of Director, Counter-Intelligence and Security (renamed Director, Security and Public Affairs). McColl's policies were part and parcel with a wider 'open government initiative' developed from 1993 {{by the government of}} John Major. As part of this, SIS operations, and those of the national signals intelligence agency, GCHQ, were placed on a statutory footing through the 1994 Intelligence Services Act. Although the Act provided procedures for authorisations and warrants, this essentially enshrined mechanisms that had been in place at least since 1953 (for authorisations) and 1985 (under the <b>Interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communications</b> Act, for warrants). Under this Act, since 1994, SIS and GCHQ activities have been subject to scrutiny by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee.|$|E
25|$|Manning {{was sent}} to the Privileges Committee {{following}} statements he made in Parliament on 19 November 2010, during a debate on the <b>Interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communications</b> Bill. Manning had made certain allegations about the private residence of Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar on the San Fernando/Siparia/Erin Road. On 24 November 2010, Speaker of the House Wade Mark ruled that a prima facie case of contempt or breach of privilege had been made out against Manning and referred the matter to the Committee for consideration. Manning was accordingly suspended from the service of the House of Representatives with immediate effect on 16 May 2011, as declared by House Speaker Wade Mark. During this period, Manning wouldn't be able to represent his San Fernando East constituency in Parliament. Manning is the second Prime Minister to be suspended from the House of Representatives in Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E

50|$|The United Kingdom has now {{admitted}} that Mr Graley's Article 8 Rights were breached {{by the actions}} of the Chief Minister of the Isle of Man on the advice of the Isle of Man Attorney General. The <b>Interceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communications</b> Tribunal on the Isle of Man found in favour of a second applicant,Toby Neale, a serving police officer, that a warrant to intercept his communications was unlawful, and the United Kingdom also admitted a similar breach there. Another retired police officer, Roger Thomson, applied to the Strasbourg Court in respect of his telephone calls being intercepted. All three, Mr Graley, Mr Neale and Mr Thompson have received cash settlements from the Isle of Man Government in respect of damages.|$|R
25|$|However, {{the powers}} of law {{enforcement}} officers to conduct covert surveillance had been largely unchecked before 2005. The legal basis for covert surveillance first came under scrutiny in two criminal cases in the District Court in 2005. To plug the loophole, the Chief Executive promulgated the Law Enforcement (Covert Surveillance Procedure) Order in August 2005. Leung Kwok-hung and Koo Sze Yiu, two political activists who claimed they had probably been targets of covert surveillance, brought an action to challenge {{the constitutionality of the}} practice of covert surveillance. They succeeded at the Court of First Instance, which held that section 33 of the Telecommunication Ordinance and the Order were both unconstitutional. The former created the power to intercept communications without adequate safeguards against abuse. The later failed to comply with the procedural requirement in the Basic Law. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal. The Court of Final Appeal suspended for six months the declaration of invalidity of the unconstitutional provisions, so that new legislation can be introduced to regulate covert surveillance. The <b>Interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communications</b> and Surveillance Ordinance (Cap. 589) was passed by the Legislative Council on 6 August 2006 after a 58-hour debate.|$|E
2500|$|It {{amended the}} {{definition}} of [...] "electronic surveillance" [...] to exclude the <b>interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> done through or from a protected computer where the owner allows the interception, or is lawfully involved in an investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Lawful {{interception}} (LI) {{refers to}} the facilities in telecommunications and telephone networks that allow law enforcement agencies with court order or other legal authorization to selectively wiretap individual subscribers. Most countries require licensed telecommunications operators to provide their networks with Legal Interception gateways and nodes for the <b>interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications.</b> The interfaces of these gateways have been standardized by telecommunication standardization organizations.|$|E
50|$|Equipment {{designed}} for <b>communications</b> and the <b>interception</b> <b>of</b> those <b>communications</b> became critical.

50|$|In 1990 Diez Canseco {{participated in}} an inquiry into a {{government}} campaign of illegal wiretapping and <b>interception</b> <b>of</b> cellphone <b>communications.</b> In 2002, he led a congressional inquiry into the privatization program undertaken in the 1990s by Fujimori. The committee calculated that of the USD9 billion raised during the privatization process, {{only a small fraction}} ended up benefiting the state.|$|R
50|$|Most {{reports on}} ECHELON focus on {{satellite}} interception. Testimony before the European Parliament indicated that separate but similar UK-U.S. systems {{are in place}} to monitor communication through undersea cables, microwave transmissions, and other lines. The report to the European Parliament points out that <b>interception</b> <b>of</b> private <b>communications</b> by foreign intelligence services is not necessarily limited to the U.S. or British foreign intelligence services.|$|R
2500|$|The {{court found}} that section 632 (which prohibits the {{eavesdropping}} or recording of a [...] "confidential communication by means of any electronic amplifying or recording device"), does not apply in this case. The reason behind this decision is that: (1) the plain words of the statute simply do not permit a finding that Nissan's conduct violated the law, as no amplifying or recording device was used to retrieve and read plaintiffs' E-mail messages. (2) section 632 proscribes only “the <b>interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> {{by the use of}} equipment which is not connected to any transmission line” (People v. Ratekin, 212 Cal.App.3d 1165, 1168 (Cal. Ct. App. 1989) [...] ), a circumstance not present in this case.|$|E
2500|$|Title II of the Patriot Act made {{a number}} of {{significant}} changes to the laws relating to foreign intelligence surveillance, of which the main two Acts that were affected were FISA and the ECPA. FISA came about after the Watergate scandal and subsequent investigations by the Church Committee, which discovered and criticized abuses of domestic spying by the National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This led to widespread congressional and public outcry, resulting in Congress passing FISA in 1978. FISA governs the way in which U.S. intelligence agencies may conduct wiretaps and the <b>interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> in order to gather foreign intelligence. FISA established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and a FISC Court of Review which administer foreign intelligence related applications for access to business records, wiretaps, microphone [...] "bugging," [...] physical searches and the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices. The Act does not apply to U.S. citizens, but is limited to dealings with foreign powers and nationals.|$|E
2500|$|The ECPA was an {{amendment}} to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, which is sometimes known as the [...] "Wiretap Statute." [...] The Wiretap Statute was mainly the result of two Supreme Court cases [...] Katz v. United States and Berger v. New York [...] and from criticism by the Church Committee {{of the actions of}} COINTELPRO (Counter Intelligence Program). The Supreme Court found in both Katz v. U.S. and Berger v. New York that Fourth Amendment search and seizure protections prohibited warrantless wiretaps. COINTELPRO was a program of the FBI that was aimed at investigating and disrupting dissident political organizations within the United States. COINTELPRO's operations during 1956 to 1971 were broadly targeted against organizations that were (at the time) considered to have politically radical elements. These included those whose stated goal was the violent overthrow of the U.S. government (such as the Weathermen), non-violent civil rights groups such as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and violent groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party. The Church Committee found that most of the surveillance was illegal. Consequently, Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, though noting that wiretaps and <b>interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> are {{a vital part of the}} law enforcement, found that wiretapping had been undertaken without legal sanction and were being used to overhear the private conversations of U.S. citizens without their consent. These conversations were then often being used as evidence in court proceedings. Therefore, in order to protect the integrity of the courts while also ensuring the privacy of citizens was not violated, the Act provided a legal framework within which wiretaps and interceptions of communications could be used. The Act requires a court order authorizing the use of such measures against U.S. citizens, with penalties for those who do not get such authorization. The notable exception to these orders is in section , which makes an exception to the restrictions of wiretaps in cases where the President must take measures to protect the U.S. from actual or potential hostile actions from a foreign power.|$|E
