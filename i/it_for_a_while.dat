5|$|Hiroshi tells Hsing {{that he and}} {{a handful}} of allies, who believe that the people on the ship should stop at Hsin Ti Chiu, have been keeping news of the {{acceleration}} secret. They believe that hiding the knowledge of the schedule provides them a weapon against the angels, who do not wish the ship to stop at all. Hsing becomes a reluctant party to the conspiracy, but is distressed by its secrecy and what she considers to be dishonesty, and persuades Hiroshi and his allies to go public with the information. Meanwhile, Luis thoroughly investigates the education program for the sixth generation aboard the ship (the generation supposed to land on Hsin Ti Chiu) and finds that large parts of it have been erased or replaced with propaganda by the angels. Luis succeeds in making the ruling council of the ship launch an investigation into religious manipulation of the education program. Persuaded by Hsing, Hiroshi makes a public statement about the ship's new schedule, while concealing {{the fact that he had}} known about <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E

25|$|Internally, {{the sexes}} of most marine animals can be {{determined}} {{by looking at the}} gonads. For example, male testes of spawning fish are smooth and white and account for up to 12% of the mass of the fish, while female ovaries are granular and orange or yellow, accounting for up to 70% of the fish's mass. Male lampreys, hagfish and salmon discharge their sperm into the body cavity where it is expelled through pores in the abdomen. Male sharks and rays can pass sperm along a duct into a seminal vesicle, where they store <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> before it is expelled, while teleosts usually employ separate sperm ducts.|$|E

The main battle begun some time later, before the noon of 7 August, with a charge of the Swedish cavalry, which pushed the Polish forces back. Koniecpolski responded with a counterattack, and the Swedes retreated to the camp; Koniecpolsko however was too cautious to attack <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> both armies were at a stalemate, with neither willing to advance and engage the opponent; eventually Koniecpolski begun to pull his forces back through the levee to his own camp. The Swedes charged the withdrawing Poles, and were able to disorganize the Polish cavalry, inflicting painful casualties (about 200-300) before being stopped by Polish infantry. Komiecpolski's horse was wounded and captured by the Swedes, which led them to suspect the Polish commander died. Thus Gustav II Adolf prepared a major assault for the following day.|$|E

Paul Simon suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: [...] " [...] early songs were very rich... with strong melodies. 'Blowin' in the Wind' has a really strong melody. He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> He defined the genre for a while." ...|$|E

Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up doing most of the work himself. [...] "I showed him how", Gerry Kulwicki said. [...] "And he said: 'Why don't you do it?

The album featured a remixed version of Jackson's successful [...] "Centipede". Initially, the singer had not wanted to feature the track, believing that {{it was part of}} the past. After thinking about <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> Jackson felt that the inclusion of the remix which features a rap by son Austin would be a good way to return to the music scene. In addition, her two other children, Stacee and Yashi, contributed backing vocals for the album. Other tracks from the album included [...] "Fly Away", which was written and produced by brother Michael, who also served as co-executive producer for Yours Faithfully. Fellow producers included Keith Thomas and Eliot Kennedy. The album also featured a duet with Men of Vizion's Spanky Williams on The Spinners' [...] "I Don't Want to Lose You", which Jet described as being a [...] "sizzling" [...] rendition. Yours Faithfullys title track was released as a single and peaked at number 76 on the R chart. Vibe magazine's Quohnos Mitchell expressed disappointment in the album, labelling its content a [...] "mix of dated R grooves dressed up with a few cleverly placed samples".|$|E
500|$|The concept behind {{having the}} episode based around an alien planet {{occurred}} to Moffat, Skinner, and producer Marcus Wilson when realising {{they had done}} big location pieces {{in the first half}} of the series with [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] and [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", but had none for the second half. They decided to do a story set in [...] "a world created in our studios to make you really feel you're out there", rather than having the Doctor [...] "promise unearthly wonders to his companions, and then get them trapped in an underground tunnel". As such, the episode was designed to allow the Doctor to actually show his new companion the wonders he had promised. The production team aimed to show [...] "the best alien planet" [...] on Doctor Who. The episode originally had a different pre-credits sequence, which consisted of a long scene in the kitchen in which Clara informs the Doctor she cannot come and travel with the Doctor because she has responsibilities to her job, and the boy she takes care of asks if the Doctor is her boyfriend. Cross's intent was to juxtapose this [...] "mundane" [...] scene with the vast scale of the planet. However, Moffat thought that at the time in the series the Doctor should be investigating Clara through her parents and Cross revised to include the leaf, an idea Moffat approved of. Originally the resolution was to be the Doctor defeating the planet with his speech, which Cross likened to [...] "facing down one of Lovecraft's Old Gods: an alien so alien that it's practically a supernatural being." [...] Moffat pointed out that the Doctor had given similar speeches before and was more interested in Clara saving the day. After thinking about <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> Cross realised he could incorporate the leaf into the solution.|$|E

500|$|Davies had {{suspected}} that Renwick {{would one day}} revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Graves Victor Meldrew, {{who was killed in}} a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: [...] "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve." [...] He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: [...] "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when you work on a Jonathan Creek episode." [...] He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: [...] "Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really been doing <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having [...] "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not want to play a [...] "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: [...] "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: [...] "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: [...] "After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [...] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years." ...|$|E
