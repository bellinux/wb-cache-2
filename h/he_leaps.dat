25|$|The {{language}} of Hopkins’s poems is often striking. His imagery can be simple, as in Heaven-Haven, where {{the comparison is}} between a nun entering a convent and a ship entering a harbour out of a storm. It can be splendidly metaphysical and intricate, {{as it is in}} As Kingfishers Catch Fire, where <b>he</b> <b>leaps</b> from one image to another to show how each thing expresses its own uniqueness, and how divinity reflects itself through all of them.|$|E
500|$|Jeter has {{won five}} Gold Glove Awards, {{trailing}} only Vizquel, Ozzie Smith, Luis Aparicio, Dave Concepción, and Mark Belanger for most by a shortstop. He {{is credited with}} positioning himself well and for a quick release when he throws the ball. One of his signature defensive plays is the [...] "jump-throw", by which <b>he</b> <b>leaps</b> and throws to first base while moving towards third base.|$|E
500|$|However, SpongeBob convinces {{the other}} band members {{to go through}} with the {{performance}} for Squidward's sake, and he takes command of their training. On the day of the concert, when Squilliam shows up in order to see Squidward fail, Squidward claims that his band died in a marching accident. However, Squidward's band shows up and he is forced {{to go through with}} the performance. [...] They enter a large glass dome complete with human fans. Squidward turns his head away from the band before they begin, assuming that the performance will be a disaster, but the band is tremendously successful, playing a rock ballad titled [...] "Sweet Victory". Squilliam enters a state of shock and faints, leaving Squidward to celebrate as <b>he</b> <b>leaps</b> into the air.|$|E

500|$|Squires {{drops his}} cup, as Nina {{continues}} {{to fill in}} the crossword, including SOWERBERRY and KNOWITALL. Squires is apparently paralysed in his chair, watching. Nina reveals herself as a marine biologist, and has acquired tetrodotoxin from a pufferfish, which causes paralysis and asphyxiation. Simon was actually Nina's brother, and is visible on the photo of Squires and his wife. Simon had reached a crosswording final only to be beaten by Squires after the latter challenged that a u looked more like a v. Depressed by the trivial defeat, Simon had killed himself. Squires, to Nina's shock, is unharmed. <b>He</b> <b>leaps</b> up to fill out NEUN and ASPS, revealing the nina ISWAPPEDCUPS within the crossword. As Nina induces vomiting, Squires makes a phone call. He had been warned by Dr Jacob Tyler, an old friend and Nina's supervisor. Squires places Nina—for whom paralysis is setting in—on a chair, and goes back to the crossword, filling out UNDERSLIP.|$|E
500|$|Belt {{begins to}} act irrationally then collapses {{screaming}} as he hears {{mention of the}} ghostlike entity from the astronauts. Paramedics are called to attend to him, and find him cowering under his desk whimpering and begging for help. Before Belt is taken away, he tells the agents that the shuttle will not survive reentry due to sabotage by 'the face', which had lived inside his body and possessed him since his time in orbit. At his urging, they alert the shuttle to change its trajectory and are just able to land it successfully. In the hospital, Belt continues to wrestle with the presence, telling Mulder he wasn't responsible but also couldn't stop it, as [...] "it came to me, it lives in me". Eventually, in a last wrestle with the re-possessing entity, he shouts [...] "no more" [...] as <b>he</b> <b>leaps</b> from the window to his death - experiencing a lengthy flashback to his last space mission as he falls. Mulder theorizes that, while Belt was compelled to sabotage the launches by the entity possessing him, {{he was also the}} one who sent Generoo the evidence of what was taking place. He lauds Belt's final sacrifice, stating that in the end he gave his life for the mission, as befits a true astronaut.|$|E

[...] It wouldn't have made any difference if they hadn't eaten it...Because if you're dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly well they won't give up. They'll get you in the end.|$|E
