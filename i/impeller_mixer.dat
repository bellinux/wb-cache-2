In this paper, impeller speed and clearance parameters are examined. The hybrid <b>impeller</b> <b>mixer</b> consists of a single Rushton turbine mounted above a single pitched blade turbine (PBT). Four impeller speeds, 50, 100, 150, and 200 rpm, and four impeller clearances, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mm, were the operation variables used in this study. CFD was utilized to initially screen the parameter ranges {{to reduce the number}} of actual experiments needed. Afterward, the residence time distribution (RTD) was determined using the respective parameters. Finally, the Fluent-predicted RTD and the experimentally measured RTD were compared. The CFD investigations revealed that an impeller speed of 50 rpm and an impeller clearance of 25 mm were not viable for experimental investigations and were thus eliminated from further analyses. The determination of RTD using a k-ε turbulence model was performed using CFD techniques.

30|$|When light {{passes through}} a fluid, any phase {{transition}} (i.e., formation of solids or gas phase) influences {{the power of the}} transmitted light (PTL). The light absorbance is inversely related to PTL. For the case of dark oil samples, near infrared (NIR) light can be used. This is because of absorbance of visible range wavelength in the dark oil medium. Based on these principles, the light scattering technique was developed to detect onset of asphaltene precipitation pressure for live oil samples. For the live oil systems, this methodology was developed in the form of designing a HPHT visual PVT cell equipped with an NIR source and detector. The general scheme of this setup is the same as a typical PVT cell with an <b>impeller</b> <b>mixer</b> for bringing the fluid to equilibrium conditions at target pressure and temperature along with sight glasses for visual capability, with an added element of an NIR emitter and detector. The intensity of the NIR light, passing through the live fluid at operating pressure and temperature, is measured at the detector based on which presence of solid particles in the fluid is determined. A schematic of this setup is shown in Fig.  26.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{equipment is}} commonly used to mix fluids: mechanical agitators, jets (pumps), shrouded axial <b>impeller</b> <b>mixers</b> (Flygt mixers), spargers, pulsed jet mixers, boiling, static mixers, falling films, liquid sprays, and thermal convection. This discussion will focus on mechanical agitators, jets, shrouded axial <b>impeller</b> <b>mixers,</b> spargers, and pulsed jet mixers, as these devices {{are most likely to}} be employed in Savannah River Site (SRS) Closure Business applications. In addressing mixing problems in the SRS Tank Farm, one must distinguish between different mixing objectives. These objectives include sludge mixing (e. g., Extended Sludge Processing), sludge retrieval (e. g., sludge transfers between tanks), heel retrieval (e. g., Tanks 18 F and 19 F), chemical reactions (e. g., oxalic acid neutralization) and salt dissolution. For example, one should not apply sludge mixing guidelines to heel removal applications. Mixing effectiveness is a function of both the mixing device (e. g., slurry pump, agitator, air sparger) and the properties of the material to be mixed (e. g., yield stress, viscosity, density, and particle size). The objective of this document is to provide background mixing knowledge for the SRS Closure Business Unit personnel and to provide general recommendations for mixing in SRS applications...|$|R

The flow {{formulation}} {{was founded}} as console formulation, {{and with the}} body-fitted coordinate system and standard k- ε turbulent model, the numerical analysis of the internal 3 -D incompressible turbulent flow of the agitated flow field {{was carried out by}} CFD software Fluent. The results showed that: the <b>mixer</b> <b>impeller</b> produced vortex jet flow, the constant velocity lines advanced as ellipse, the velocity along the centerline are larger than others, and utilized volume flow to transport the liquid. And, by changing some design parameters of <b>mixer</b> <b>impeller,</b> we can compare and analyze the numerical analysis results and find that: for the same <b>impeller</b> diameter, the <b>mixer</b> <b>impeller</b> whose hub/tip radius ratio is smaller has larger advancing speed in the agitated flow field, and the advancing speed is more evenly distributed, so the overall effect is better. Therefore, we should select the hub diameter of the submersible mixer properly...|$|R
40|$|Viscous and non-Newtonian fluid {{mechanics}} {{plays an important}} role in a large number of processes in the oil, mineral and chemical industries. In most situations of practical interest, the flow is in the laminar or in the transition regime due to the high viscosity of the products at hand. The use of CFD to tackle such problems is gaining in popularity, a good example of which is in mechanical mixing and reactor design. In CFD applied to mixing, the objectives are to select the best set of vessel configuration, impeller geometry, and operating conditions that provide an “optimal ” performance for the wide range of rheological behaviors that may occur during processing. This presentation focuses on the development of advanced finite element CFD methods and their use for the design of viscous, Newtonian and non-Newtonian mixing processes in stirred tanks. It is illustrated with the performance of two modern mixing technologies namely, the multiple shaft mixer and the single-shaft multipurpose <b>impeller</b> <b>mixer.</b> It is shown that CFD can provide a lot of insight on the {{fluid mechanics}} in the reactor, and give access to mixer design parameters like the power consumption and the mixing time.

40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) is in {{the process}} of {{removing}} waste (sludge and salt cake) from million gallon waste tanks. The current practice for removing waste from the tanks is adding water, agitating the tanks with long shaft vertical centrifugal pumps, and pumping the sludge/salt solution from the tank to downstream treatment processes. This practice has left sludge heels ({tilde} 30, 000 gallons) in the bottom of the tanks. SRS is evaluating shrouded axial <b>impeller</b> <b>mixers</b> for removing the sludge heels in the waste tanks. The authors conducted a test program to determine mixer requirements for suspending sludge heels using the shrouded axial <b>impeller</b> <b>mixers.</b> The tests were performed with zeolite in scaled tanks which have diameters of 1. 5, 6. 0, and 18. 75 feet. The mixer speeds required to suspend zeolite particles were measured at each scale. The data were analyzed with various scaling methods to compare their ability to describe the suspension of insoluble solids with the mixers and to apply the data to a full-scale waste tank. The impact of changes in particle properties and operating parameters was also evaluated. The conclusions of the work are: Scaling of the suspension of fast settling zeolite particles was best described by the constant power per unit volume method. Increasing the zeolite particle concentration increased the required mixer power needed to suspend the particles. Decreasing the zeolite particle size from 0. 7 mm � 0. 3 mm decreased the required mixer power needed to suspend the particles. Increasing the number of mixers in the tank decreased the required mixer power needed to suspend the particles. A velocity of 1. 6 ft/sec two inches above the tank bottom is needed to suspend zeolite particles...|$|R
40|$|Understanding of {{particle}} flow behaviour {{as a function}} of strain rate is of great interest in many items of equipment of industrial processes, such as screw conveyors, <b>impeller</b> <b>mixers,</b> and feeders, etc. The traditional commercial instruments for bulk powder flow characterisation, such as shear cells, operate at low shear strain rates, and are not representative of unit operations under dynamic conditions. In recent years, the FT 4 powder rheometer of Freeman Technology has emerged as a widely used technique for characterising particle flow under dynamic conditions of shear strain rate; yet little is known about its underlying powder mechanics. We analyse the effect of gas flow on the flow behaviour of cohesionless particles in FT 4 both experimentally and by numerical simulations using the combined discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results show that the effect of gas flow on the flow energy could be described by the resultant fluid-induced drag on the particles above the blade position as the impeller penetrates the bed. The strain rate in front of the blade is mainly determined by the impeller tip speed, and is not sensitive to the gas flow and particle size. The flow energy correlates well with the shear stress in front of the blade. They both increase with the strain rate and are significantly reduced by the upward gas flow...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic digesters {{continue}} to be a focus for processing wastewater solids to produce a renewable fuel source, digester gas. Effective mixing of the digester contents is important for process stability, maximizing gas production, minimizing scum and foam formation, and preventing solids deposition in the digester. Mixing requires electrical power which is often generated by coal-fired power plants. With the concern regarding electrical power cost and the interest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, there is a renewed focus on reducing the power required for digester mixing. This paper reports the test results of a new mixing system called the Vertical Linear Motion Mixer (VLMM) manufactured by Enersave Fluid Mixer, Inc which was shown to have comparable performance to other more conventional mixing systems (<b>impeller</b> draft tube <b>mixers)</b> with substantially less electrical power needed. The test results represent testing conducted at the Ina Road Wastewater Reclamation Facility (WRF), located in Tucson, Arizona. One new mixer was retrofitted to a conventional “pancake ” digester and compared to an identical digester using five <b>impeller</b> draft tube <b>mixers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of particles}} to bubbles {{is essential to}} separating the minerals from the slurry, but the minerals must be purified from the additives used in separation, such as the collectors, frothers, and modifiers. The product of the cleaning, or desorption process, {{is known as the}} cleaner concentrate. The detachment of a particle and bubble requires adsorption bond cleavage driven by shear forces. Depending on the flotation cell type, shear forces are applied by a variety of mechanical systems. Among the most common are <b>impellers</b> and <b>mixers.</b> Some systems combine the functionalities of these components by placing them at key locations where they can take part in multiple froth flotation mechanisms. Cleaning cells also take advantage of gravitational forces to improve separation efficiency.|$|R

The first utilized a predominantly shear mixer (Ross), the second utilized a predominantly flow mixer (Heller), {{and the third}} utilized {{a combination of the}} two. It was discovered that the most effective system was the combination of the two mixers. A wide range of solutions was examined, with CMC concentrations ranging from 5 to 21 grams/liter. Salt concentrations were also varied from solutions with no salt to 2. 5 M NaCl solutions. Based on this data, CMC was found to behave as predicted by the Einstein viscosity equation.

By utilizing this technology, designers can quickly create a customized product specifically for their performance needs. But the timescale and expense from the engineering design workflows used to develop these customized products have not been adapted from the workflows used in mass production. In many cases these customized designs build upon already successful mass-produced products that were developed using conventional engineering design workflows. Many times {{as part of this}} conventional design process significant time is spent creating and validating high fidelity models that accurately predict the performance of the final design. These existing validated high fidelity models used for the mass-produced design can be reused for analysis and design of unknown products. This thesis explores the integration of reduced order modeling and detailed analysis into the engineering design workflow developing a customized design using digital manufacturing. Specifically, detailed analysis is coupled with proper orthogonal decomposition to enable the exploration of the design space while simultaneously shaping the model representing the design. This revised workflow is examined using the design of a laboratory scale overhead <b>mixer</b> <b>impeller.</b> The case study presented here is compared with the design of the Kar Dynamic <b>Mixer</b> <b>impeller</b> developed by The Dow Chemical Company. The result of which is a customized design for a refined set of operating conditions with improved performance...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at a {{comparison}} of the effectiveness of a new axial-flow type of <b>mixer</b> <b>impeller</b> (the Prochem design) with the traditional inclined-blade turbine. The intended application of the mixers was in carbon-in-pulp plants for the extraction of gold from cyanide-leached pulps. The first part of the project involved water and ion-exchange resin, and measurement of the power drawn by the various sizes of impeller to fully suspend the resin. The rate of reaction between the resin and the solution was measured {{as a function of the}} power input to the mixer. In the second part of the project, use was made of activated carbon, silver cyanide solutions, and ore pulps. The rate of absorption of silver from the solutions and pulps was determined, as well as the rate of attrition of the activated carbon caused by the various impellers in clear water. The Prochem design of axial-flow impeller was shown to fully suspend solids at only one-quarter of the power required by an inclined-blade turbine of similar size. These measurements verified the observations of other researchers that the rate of reaction is not affected by the design of impeller provided that all the solids are fully suspended. The Prochem design of impeller therefore achieved the same reaction rate as the conventional turbine at a quarter of the power input. The attrition rates of activated carbon could be correlated, in terms of the energy absorbed, by the same equation for all the impellers. Higher concentrations of activated carbon increased the amount of carbon fines produced. Articl...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} River Protection Project at Hanford, Washington, Bechtel National, Inc. {{has been}} {{contracted}} by the United States Department of Energy to design a Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant to stabilize liquid radioactive waste. Because of its experience with radioactive waste stabilization, the Savannah River Technology Center of the Westinghouse Savannah River Company is working with Bechtel National and Washington Group International, to help design and test {{certain parts of the}} Waste Treatment Plant. One part of the process is the separation of radioactive isotopes from the liquid waste by a precipitation reaction and cross-flow ultrafiltration. To better understand those combined processes an experiment was performed using a simulated radioactive waste, made to prototypically represent the chemical and physical characteristics of a Hanford waste in tank 241 -AN- 102 and precipitated under prototypic conditions. The resultant slurry was then filtered using a cross-flow filter prototypic in porosity, length, and diameter to the plant design. An important aspect of filtration for waste treatment is the rate at which permeate is produced. There are many factors that affect filtration rate {{and one of the most}} difficult to obtain is the effect of particles in the waste streams. The Waste Treatment Plant will filter many waste streams, with varying concentrations and types of dissolved and undissolved solids. An added complication is the need to precipitate organic complexants so they can be efficiently separated from the supernatant. Depending on how precipitation is performed, the newly created solids will add to the complicating factors that determine permeate flux rate. To investigate the effect of precipitated solids on filter flux a pilot-scale test was performed and two different mixing mechanisms were used for the precipitation reaction. A standard <b>impeller</b> type <b>mixer,</b> which created a homogeneous mixture, and a pulse jet mixer, which created a ''less than'' homogeneous precipitation environment. Pulse jet mixers are included in the design of the Waste Treatment Plant because they have no moving parts, which is advantageous for radioactive operations as no maintenance is required. A pulse jet mixer uses alternate pulses of pressurized air and vacuum to mix tank contents. This pulse jet mixer was not expected to establish a homogeneous mixture throughout the test tank, therefore, it was important to know its effect on filtration after a waste is precipitated. This paper discusses the experimental results of cross-flow filter flux after a simulated waste is precipitated under each of the two mixing methods. The main conclusion reached is that while the ''less than well mixed'' jet-pulsed waste gave a lower average filter flux it may still be sufficiently large enough to meet plant requirements...|$|R
