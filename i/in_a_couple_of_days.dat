5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 2012, Edge (with {{his usual}} long hair cut short) was {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame by Christian, during WrestleMania XXVIII weekend. Edge made a surprise appearance on the April 23, 2012 episode of Raw, confronting his long-time rival John Cena about Brock Lesnar. He mentioned that despite sharing the biggest rivalry of their careers, they always shared mutual admiration for professional wrestling. In an act of motivation, he told Cena to 'wake up' and beat Brock Lesnar. He also mentioned beforehand that he was not supposed to be on the show that night, also declaring that he would no longer be under contract with WWE <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days.</b> After this, his contract with the WWE had legitimately expired. On the September 21, 2012 episode of SmackDown, Edge made an appearance addressing Team Hell No.|$|E

Jagadish captures the bomber again, and also forces the police officer who helped the bomber's escape, to commit suicide. Jagadish soon learns that the bomber is a mere executor, a sleeper agent, whose only role was to plant the bomb. He also discovers that the Islamic terrorist group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, which the bomber belongs to, has planned various such attacks in the city <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days.</b> Enlisting the help of his fellow army men and Balaji, Jagadish manages to thwart these attacks and kill the sleeper cell leader's brother and eleven other terrorists, including the previously captured sleeper agent.|$|E

25|$|The Swedish {{military}} had {{a unique position}} in Northern Europe {{at the time of}} the new system, being the only army that did not rely only on enlisted soldiers, mercenaries or conscripted soldiers. In relation to population size, the Swedish army was also the largest in Europe. Because of the allotment system, mobilization was quick. It took time, weeks and months, to enlist, equip, train and organize a unit of mercenaries, while the Swedish croft soldiers gathered at the company meeting place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> and then at the regimental meeting place in around a week. The soldiers were already trained and equipped, and knew their precise spot in the formation.

500|$|The {{intensely}} peppery {{taste of}} the raw mushroom can blister the tongue if sampled in excess. Some authors have reported the species as outright poisonous, or causing [...] "mild to fatal gastroenteritis". In a 1930 publication, Hans Steidle reported that although the mushroom was not toxic to [...] "unicellular and cold-blooded organisms" [...] when ingested, the liquid extract and the pressed juice of the fruit bodies, when injected under {{the skin of a}} frog, resulted in disturbed breathing, paralysis, and eventually death. Symptoms that are typically experienced after consuming raw mushrooms include nausea, vomiting, and severe diarrhea that starts about one hour after ingestion. This combination can lead to dehydration, muscle spasms, and circulatory collapse.

500|$|Reviewers {{had mixed}} {{opinions}} on the control scheme {{and use of the}} Saturn 3D controller. Nutter noted that the controls were a mix of those featured in Tomb Raider and Nights into Dreams..., praising the use of the analogue stick to perform complex manoeuvres. A reviewer from the Japanese Sega Saturn Magazine felt the game was more comfortable with an analogue pad as opposed to the default Saturn controller, and Williamson similarly thought the control scheme was [...] "great" [...] when used with an analogue pad. In contrast, Weigand criticised the lack of a custom configuration and described the controls as [...] "squirrelly", even with the analogue controller. A couple of reviewers criticised the game's short length and lack of difficulty. Nutter suggested that accomplished players would have it [...] "clocked" [...] <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> and felt it did not take much effort to complete the four levels, whilst Buchanan said it was [...] "too short for its own good", a problem made worse by its enjoyable gameplay.|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{which was}} {{originally}} titled [...] "Fat Man and Little Boy" [...] (which {{went on to}} be used for the name of a Season 16 episode), was directed by Jim Reardon and written by Donick Cary and Dan Greaney. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 16, 1999. [...] "Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo" [...] {{was one of the last}} episodes produced for the series' tenth season. Staff writers Cary and Greaney wrote the draft <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> and it was then rewritten [...] "extensively" [...] with The Simpsons writing staff. Originally, there would be a long scene about how Homer had bought a [...] "pre-Columbian vase" [...] on the Internet, however the scene was ultimately cut from the episode. The episode's title is a reference to the 1944 war film 30 Seconds Over Tokyo. Originally, the staff wanted the title to be [...] "Twenty-two Minutes Over Tokyo", since an episode of The Simpsons is approximately twenty-two minutes long, but they eventually changed it to its current rendition because it “sounds closer to” the title of the film it references. According to Cary, the writers did a lot of research in order to accurately depict the Japanese language for the episode. For example, the three categories in The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show are written in Japanese.|$|E
