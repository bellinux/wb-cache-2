25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an <b>hour.</b> <b>I</b> used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

Equipped with Sopwith Camels, the unit was sent to France in December.

When he did see combat against the German Luftstreitkräfte for the first time, he had only twelve hours solo flying experience.|$|E
500|$|Early {{practice}} speeds approached [...] NASCAR had mandated {{before the}} qualifier that {{the holes in}} the cars' restrictor plates be reduced by , later conceding that the rule may have affected some teams more than others. According to Gilliland, [...] "They threw a curveball at us this morning with the restrictor plate and (engine builder) Doug Yates wasn't worried at all. He put the super-tune on it and the thing ran great." [...] Earnhardt called the reduction in speed unnecessary: [...] "The track is safe... I don't feel (the late change in plate size) is a very fair situation for everybody. Once you're up around the 190s, what's two miles an <b>hour?</b> <b>I</b> don't see what the big deal is. The speed average is up because the corner speed remains better with the new asphalt. As far as running in a straight line, we're no faster than we've always run here." [...] Despite the mandated change, NASCAR did not schedule an additional practice session.|$|E

500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest <b>hour.</b> <b>I</b> hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E

In her recap, she gave the performances high marks: [...] "Y’know, when I get so frustrated with OUAT, it’s because it sets a high bar up against itself. Like this episode, for example. It takes a classic myth, perfectly twists it into the show’s own purposes, and manages to be jaw-dropping in a single <b>hour.</b> <b>I</b> didn’t realize {{we were about to}} get so much out of “Nimue,” but I should have guessed once we found out that it was penned by Jane Espenson, who writes most of OUAT’s best episodes." ...|$|E

Pottinger became the second Administrator of Hong Kong (1841–1843) and the first Governor of Hong Kong (1843–1844). When he forwarded the treaty to Aberdeen, Pottinger remarked, [...] "the retention of Hong Kong is the only point in which I have intentionally exceeded my modified instructions, but every single <b>hour</b> <b>I</b> have passed in this superb country has convinced me of the necessity and desirability of our possessing such a settlement as an emporium for our trade and a place from which Her Majesty's subjects in China may be alike protected and controlled." ...|$|E

2500|$|This employment, {{like his}} earlier {{appointment}} to the custom house in Boston, was vulnerable {{to the politics of}} the spoils system. Hawthorne was a Democrat and lost this job due to the change of administration in Washington after the presidential election of 1848. He wrote a letter of protest to the Boston Daily Advertiser which was attacked by the Whigs and supported by the Democrats, making Hawthorne's dismissal a much-talked about event in New England. He was deeply affected by the death of his mother in late July, calling it [...] "the darkest <b>hour</b> <b>I</b> ever lived". He was appointed the corresponding secretary of the Salem Lyceum in 1848. Guests who came to speak that season included Emerson, Thoreau, Louis Agassiz, and Theodore Parker.|$|E

It's sort of like I'm taken over or someone's trying to contact me; I really believe very much that I'm in some ways channeling this thing. Because when I write a song it's always done very quickly, completed in 20minutes or maybe half an <b>hour.</b> <b>I</b> never labour anything, or very rarely. The only labouring I've ever done in songwriting might be when I've completed a work, a song, and {{there might be a}} couple of lyrics I don't like, so sometimes I might sit with those and really put some brain power in how to fix up the lines. But for the most part it comes to me, it comes in and I can hear the whole thing finished with harmonies and everything." [...] Graeham Goble (2001) ...|$|E
2500|$|The music {{came from}} Brian Wilson's first {{psychedelic}} experience. He was quoted saying in 1986, [...] " [...] something I'm {{very proud of}} in a sense because it represents the Beach Boys really greatest record production we’ve ever made. It goes back to 1965 when I was sitting in my apartment, wondering {{how to write a}} song about girls, because I love girls. I mean, everybody loves girls." [...] He added in 2007, [...] "I was thinking about the music from cowboy movies. And I sat down and started playing it, bum-buhdeeda, bum-buhdeeda. I did that for about an <b>hour.</b> <b>I</b> got these chords going. Then I got this melody, it came pretty fast after that." [...] Inspiration came from the rhythm of [...] "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring". In 2015, he explained: [...] "'California Girls' had that beat — it's called a shuffle beat — and that's definitely a Bach influence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fox hired Terry Erdmann (Blue Blaze {{code name}} [...] "Silver Fox") {{and a team}} of publicists {{including}} Blake Mitchell and Jim Ferguson to promote the film at Star Trek conventions with a few film clips and free Banzai headbands, which have since become highly sought-after collector's items by fans of the film. The studio made no attempts to sell the film to a mainstream audience with traditional promotion, although there was some magazine advertising (primarily in Marvel Comics) and related licensing which served as viral advertising in limited venues. Studio publicist Rosemary LaSalmandra said, [...] "Nobody knew what to do with Buckaroo Banzai. There was no simple way to tell anyone what it was about—I'm not sure anybody knew". Lithgow said, [...] "I've tried to explain the story line to people and it takes about an <b>hour.</b> <b>I</b> mean it; it's that complicated. But it's terrific. Every time I tell people about it, I get so excited that I end it by saying, Buckaroo Banzai, remember where you heard it first!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Reiss {{has contributed}} to {{numerous}} film screenplays. He wrote several jokes for the film Ice Age after The Simpsons colleague David Silverman asked him and Jon Vitti to help out with the film's story issues. He later wrote a number of screenplays including [...] and Horton Hears a Who!. The first live-action film he wrote was 2009's My Life in Ruins, starring Nia Vardalos. Reiss initially wrote the film, {{which was based on}} his experience on holiday bus tours of Mexico and Greece, as a short story. After it was rejected by 37 publishers he rewrote it as a screenplay and sent it to Vardalos who [...] "snatched it right up". The film garnered a negative critical response with Roger Ebert, for example, stating [...] "there is, in short, nothing I liked about My Life in Ruins, except some of the ruins" [...] and calling Reiss' script [...] "lousy". Reiss defended the film: [...] "My Life in Ruins really makes people happy. It's a relentlessly sweet movie about the basic decency of humanity. It's happy ending kicks in around the 30-minute mark and continues for the next <b>hour.</b> <b>I</b> know those [...] were sitting there in that audience. They were sitting there going, 'These 1,498 people were wrong and the two of us are correct.' It makes me a little nuts." ...|$|E
2500|$|From George Wilkins Kendall's {{account of}} the Texan Santa Fe Expedition: [...] "In their habits, they are clannish, social, and {{extremely}} convivial, never living alone like other animals, but, on the contrary, always found in villages or large settlements. They are a wild, frolicsome, madcap set of fellows when undisturbed, uneasy and ever on the move, and appear to take especial delight in chattering away the time, and visiting from hole to hole to gossip and talk over each other's affairs—at least so their actions would indicate. On several occasions I crept close to their villages, without being observed, to watch their movements. Directly in the centre {{of one of them}} I particularly noticed a very large dog, {{sitting in front of the}} door or entrance to his burrow, and by his own actions and those of his neighbors it really seemed as though he was the president, mayor, or chief—at all events, he was the 'big dog' of the place. For at least an <b>hour</b> <b>I</b> secretly watched the operations in this community. During that time the large dog I have mentioned received at least a dozen visits from his fellow-dogs, which would stop and chat with him a few moments, and then run off to their domiciles. All this while he never left his post for a moment, and I thought I could discover a gravity in his deportment not discernible in those by which he was surrounded. Far is it from me to say that the visits he received were upon business, or had anything to do with the local government of the village; but it certainly appeared so. If any animal has a system of laws regulating the body politic, it is certainly the prairie dog." ...|$|E
