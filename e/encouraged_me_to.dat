According to Maria Muldaur, {{she and her husband}} were frequent dinner guests, which usually involved sitting around a piano and singing songs. She doubted her abilities, but [...] "it was Butter that first <b>encouraged</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> let loose and just sing the blues [...] not to worry about singing pretty or hitting all the right notes... He loosened all the levels of self-consciousness and doubt out of me... And he'll forever live in my heart for that and for respecting me as a fellow musician." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hill collaboratively {{wrote an}} autobiography, , with mountaineer and writer Greg Child, {{published}} by W.W. Norton & Company. As {{she describes the}} process, [...] "He would take my writings and organize them, and he <b>encouraged</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was." [...] Hill explained {{in an interview that}} writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to [...] "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: [...] "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point , because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there." [...] Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.|$|E
500|$|The {{acquisition}} of Nova Publications by Maclaren in 1954 gave New Worlds the stability to establish {{itself as a}} leading magazine.

[...] Much of Ballard's work appeared in New Worlds and Science Fantasy, and Ballard later recalled that Carnell [...] "recognized what I was on about from a very early stage and he <b>encouraged</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go on writing in my own way." [...] Carnell also published much of Brian Aldiss's early work in Science Fantasy and New Worlds. [...] John Brunner, later to become one of the most successful British science fiction writers, appeared regularly in the Nova magazines, starting with [...] "Visitors' Book" [...] in the April 1955 New Worlds. [...] James White began publishing with [...] "Assisted Passage" [...] in the January 1953 New Worlds, and in 1957 began his popular Sector General series, about a hospital for aliens, with [...] "Sector General" [...] in the November 1957 issue.
