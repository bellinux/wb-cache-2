Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense catacombs and columbaria have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.|$|E
25|$|Endogenous/natural AAS like {{testosterone}} and DHT {{and synthetic}} AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR. On {{the basis of}} animal bioassays, {{the effects of these}} agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic. Dissociation between the ratios of these two types of effects is observed in rat bioassays with various AAS relative to the ratio observed with testosterone. Explanations for the dissociation include differences in intracellular metabolism, functional selectivity (recruitment of coactivators), and non-genomic mechanisms (i.e., signaling through non-AR membrane androgen receptors, or mARs). Support for the latter two explanations is limited and more hypothetical, but there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of support for the intracellular metabolism explanation.|$|E

25|$|The {{school now}} has six day houses – Holden, Rigaud, Sherrington, School, Broke and Felaw – into which all pupils are {{filtered}} from year 9/Upper 6th Form onwards, {{and a single}} large boarding house - Westwood. Those with relatives who attended the school are generally expected {{to be placed in}} the same house. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of competition between the houses and every year, the houses compete for the Ganzoni Cup (house cup), which is won by gaining points from winning inter-house events. These include most sports as well as others such as debating and art. The final and most important event is Sports Day, in the Summer Term, on which the athletics competitions take place. Felaw has won more times than any other house, with Rigaud in second place; it is believed that School has not won {{since the days of the}} reign of Queen Victoria. However, School is the oldest house and dates from the days when the boys lived and were taught in one house (called School House). It later became the boarding house which occupied a part of the main building on Henley Road.|$|E

[...] Middlesbrough intended to sign David Platt, but a move never came to fruition, as talks broke down between both parties.

[...] McKinley, {{on the other}} hand, convinced that his [...] "sound money" [...] campaign had worked, began to promote his tariff issue, stating to the crowds on his front lawn, [...] "I {{do not know what}} you think about it, but I believe it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> better to open the mills of the United States to the labor of America than to open the mints of the United States to the silver of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Of Wolfgang's music {{composed}} {{during the}} tour, around thirty pieces survive. A number of [...] works are lost, including the Zürich cello pieces and several symphonies. The surviving works include the keyboard sonatas written in Paris, London and The Hague, four symphonies, various arias, the assorted music {{written for the}} Prince of Orange, a Kyrie, and other minor pieces. Mozart's career as a symphonist began in London where, {{in addition to the}} direct influences of Abel and J.C. Bach, he would have heard symphonies from leading London composers including Thomas Arne, William Boyce and Giuseppe Sammartini"a nearly ideal introduction to the genre", according to Zaslaw. The earliest symphonies, Zaslaw points out, while not in the same class as the later Mozart masterpieces, are comparable in length, complexity and originality to those written at the same time by the acknowledged symphonic masters of the day. Indeed, Abel's Symphony No. 6 in E Flat was similar enough in style and technique to be mistaken as Mozart's, and is listed as such (Symphony No. 3, K. 18) in the original Köchel catalogue. Sadie observes that the K. 22 symphony composed in The Hague <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> more sophisticated than the earlier ones which were written in London.|$|E

500|$|Versus {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 65, based on 6 reviews. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave it an [...] "A–" [...] {{and said that}} [...] "'Love 'Em All' describes an egalitarian sexual appetite, while 'Lingerie' offers prime faux-Prince boudoir funk. The Max Martin-produced 'DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love' shows 'OMG' didn't satisfy Usher's dance-pop Jones, but he's hardly gone soft: 'Hot Tottie,' with Jay-Z, is nasty {{in all the right}} ways." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe complimented its [...] "compact running time" [...] and stated [...] "Instead of ho-hum filler, Versus offers the strongest arrows in Usher’s quiver". About.com's Mark Edward Nero gave the EP three-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote that Usher has [...] "regained his mojo", while recommending it to fans of his music: [...] "nine songs - seven of them new - clocking in at 38 minutes <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> for this solid package of music." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today gave Versus three out of four stars and called it [...] "an abbreviated batch of fresh songs that can stand alone or as part of a deluxe original". Billboards Gail Mitchell commended the album's guest artists and wrote that it [...] "alternately bumps and throbs as a reinvigorated Usher further paves his comeback path" ...|$|E
500|$|Ian Winwood {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five [...] "Ks" [...] for the British {{magazine}} Kerrang!, an [...] "excellent" [...] review. He called the music far more upbeat than Enter Shikari's serious message: [...] "This 11-song set <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of fun to listen to, even if its lyrics' subject matters are the exact opposite." [...] Winwood also reviewed the album favourably for BBC Music, comparing its lyrics to The King Blues' Punk & Poetry and calling Enter Shikari [...] "the only other mainstream-breaching British rock band concerning itself with the news of the world". Johnny Firecloud gave the album an eight-out-of-ten rating on CraveOnline: [...] "Enter Shikari have found a balance while honing a voice of rebellion – at a time where tearing down boundaries and microanalyzing the current structure is more vital and valuable than ever before in our lives." [...] Iain Moffat of The Fly said of the album that 'Disenchantment should always be this spellbinding.' In NME, Dan Martin gave the album an eight-out-of-ten rating: [...] "All of that surface tension lands Enter Shikari in a pretty powerful position for their third – and, as the title promises fabulously, they respond to the challenge in explosive style to deliver something like their defining statement." [...] Rocksound writer Ryan Bird gave the album a nine-out-of-ten score, praising the band for their emotional cultural and sonic development and noting the importance of their message: [...] "In a world edging ever closer to complete and utter destruction, Enter Shikari remain fearless and uncompromising leaders in a field of one." ...|$|E
500|$|H. J. R. Murray {{wrote that}} Staunton's {{response}} to Morphy's initial challenge and his {{article about the}} same in The Illustrated London News should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, {{and one of the}} main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton. Murray also commented on the whole affair, [...] "In all this there is but little in which we can reproach Staunton, beyond the fact that he kept open the possibility of a match for so long, and even here there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> that could be urged in justification of the course followed by Staunton" [...] but also noted that both sides were playing tactical games with each other in front of the public, and that comments made by both players or their respective supporters were acrimonious. In response to Morphy's complaints Lord Lyttelton, then president of the British Chess Association, said that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match. von der Lasa later wrote, although not specifically about this affair, that he thought there was no chance of Staunton's health being good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards. William Norwood Potter wrote in his obituary of Staunton in the City of London Chess Magazine, [...] "...nor were his innuendoes concerning Morphy otherwise than an utterly unworthy means of getting out of an engagement, which he could have either declined with a good grace at first, or afterwards have honourably asked to be released from. Nevertheless, all said and done, Staunton was, as we have often heard a distinguished enemy of his say, emphatically a MAN. There was nothing weak about him, and he had a backbone that never curved with fear of any one." ...|$|E

Joseph Kerman states that [...] "Nobody would deny that dramatic potential {{can be found in}} this tale. Puccini, however, did not find it; his music does nothing to rationalize the legend or illuminate the characters." [...] Kerman also wrote that while Turandot is more [...] "suave" [...] musically than Puccini's earlier opera, Tosca, [...] "dramatically it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> more depraved."
