The worm can use cues from the amphipod caused by the presence of the predatory definitive host to interrupt its growth cycle in wait to be eaten. However, under low amounts of stress cues from the amphipod, the worm responds by adopting the progenetic lifecycle (Lagrue & Poulin, 2007).Another factor involved in the choice of progenesis is the competition with other interspecies and <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition.</b> In the case of interspecies coinfection, competition with Microphallus sp. (avian definitive host) favors progenesis in order to ensure C. parvum egg production.

50|$|As {{with many}} other insects, both intraspecies and interspecies {{competition}} occurs in M. scutellatus over resources. Hughes and Hughes performed experiments to test the results of asymmetric contests of M. scutellatus and M. notatus, the eastern pine sawyer. They found that in M. scutellatus, females laid eggs that were fertilized by the male with whom they were currently sharing a pair-bond with, and the certainty of paternity decreases once the pair-bond is over. Consequently, females are the most valuable resource that males compete over. As for the females, {{the majority of their}} inter- and <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition</b> was over oviposition holes. Female M. scutellatus individuals often spend over 20 minutes using their mandibles to chew oviposition holes in the bark of trees, which makes a very loud noise and incurs substantial risk of detection by predators. Therefore, it is greatly advantageous for females to steal holes chewed by other females to save time and risk. The study found that both within and between species, contests between larger resource holders and smaller challengers usually do not escalate and the resource holder retains their territory, but contests between smaller resource holders and larger challengers are more likely to escalate to fighting with the pro- and mesolegs and biting of the legs and antennae. This is likely because Monochamus species have large, strong mandibles which are capable of biting off limbs or antennae, and escalated competitions are usually not worth the risk. M. scutellatus displays resource-defence polygyny, a mating system in which males defend necessary resources that females require for reproduction. Resources in this case refer to the quality of tree trunk that the male has won; females prefer basal trunk regions with a large diameter. Females then choose mates mainly {{on the basis of their}} resources, but when resources are equal, Hughes and Hughes observed that they choose larger males preferentially. Although it has not been proven that large body size is inherited by offspring, it still may be an indicator of fitness and quality.|$|E

This observation implies that <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition</b> between pneumococci occurs during nasopharyngeal colonization, allowing one strain or set of strains to predominate over others. We investigated the contribution of the blp locus, encoding putative bacteriocins and cognate immunity peptides, to <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition.</b> We sequenced the relevant regions of the blp locus of a type 6 A strain able to inhibit the growth of the type 4 strain, TIGR 4, in vitro.

Comparison of the TIGR 4 BlpM and -N amino acid sequences demonstrated that only five amino acid differences were sufficient to target the heterologous strain. Analysis of a number of clinical isolates suggested that the BlpMN bacteriocins divide into two families. A mutant in the blpMN operon created in the clinically relevant type 19 A background was deficient in both bacteriocin activity and immunity. This strain was unable to compete with both its parent strain and a serotype 4 isolate during cocolonization in the mouse nasopharynx, suggesting that the locus is functional in vivo and confirming its role in promoting <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition...</b>|$|E

Additionally, pyocins are stable in the lung, poorly immunogenic at high concentrations and efficacy is maintained in the presence of pyocin specific antibodies after repeated pyocin administration.

We can examine {{habitats}} on three different scales: microhabitat, mesohabitat and macrohabitat. Habitat preferences were among the fields of interest of Antonín Frič {{as he tried to}} describe the changing gradient of fish assemblages from source to the river's mouth on the macrohabitat scale. Habitat preferences are examined from a spatial point of view (substrate, depth, shelter), temporal point of view (season, day/night), biotic point of view (interspecies and <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition)</b> and abiotic point of view (dissolved chemicals, velocity). For obtaining data of good quality, it is necessary to choose the right location and select the opti- mal strategy of examining fish assemblages (e. g. electrofishing, radiotelemetry, cameras). All variables which can affect habitat preferences in fish are measured. Multivariate statistical methods (e. g. PCA, RDA, CCA, CA) are used for evaluation of obtained datasets.

40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the underlying mechanism which drives fish to evolve into the schooling behaviour under predation. Previous works used to explain this formation by group benefits, individual differences or evolutionary trade-offs. However, conflicts from these explanations to the natural fish are considerable. Based on agent-based simulations and game-theoretic analyses, this thesis demonstrated that the <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition</b> in a relatively homogeneous population is sufficient to cause the evolution of fish schools. It {{has been shown that}} when predators exhibit the ‘marginal predation’, that is, only catching prey on the margin of a group, prey fish must evolve to form a selfish herd, which will be increasingly crowded until no outer fish can enter it. In this case, fish should evolve to leave the group margin together, as the originally reported ‘collective departure strategy’, to expose the inner fish and share the risk. This adaptation then leads to the emergence of fish schools. The thesis further showed that the ‘marginal predation’ of predators and the ‘collective departure’ of prey is able to form an evolutionarily stable state in a coevolutionary system, which completed the explanation of the evolution of fish schools in nature...|$|E

A significant interaction was found for Aethaloperca rogaa and Cephalopholis nigripinnis, indicating that {{protected areas}} held greater numbers of smaller and median sized fish of these species than unprotected areas. Similar but nonsignificant trends were found for Cephalopholis miniata and Cephalopholis argus. For Anyperodon leucogrammicus, MPAs held significantly more fish than unprotected sites, but as the increase was equal between size categories there was no interaction.

Here we show that IscR {{is not involved in}} the regulation of nuclease colicins, but that the AsnC protein is. We report that AsnC, in concert with LexA, is the key controller of the temporal induction of the DNA degrading colicin E 8 gene (cea 8), after DNA damage. We demonstrate that a large AsnC nucleosome-like structure, in conjunction with two LexA molecules, prevent cea 8 transcription initiation and that AsnC binding activity is directly modulated by L asparagine. We show that L-asparagine is an environmental factor that has a marked impact on cea 8 promoter regulation. Our results show that AsnC also modulates the expression of several other DNase and RNase colicin genes but does not substantially affect pore-forming colicin K gene expression.

They represent the smallest cluster size determining the fate of the entire system. Checking simple growth criteria allows us to decide whether the cluster-individuals, e. g. some mutant family, are capable of surviving and invading a resident population. In biology, spatial 2 x 2 games have a broad spectrum of applications ranging from the evolution of cooperation and <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition</b> to disease spread. This methodological study allows simple classifications and long-term predictions in various biological and social models to be made. For minimal neighbourhood types, we show that the intuitive candidate, a 3 x 3 cluster, turns out to be fundamental with certain weak limitations for the Moore neighbourhood but not for the Von Neumann neighbourhood. However, in the latter case, 2 x 2 clusters generally serve as reliable indicators to whether a strategy survives. Stochasticity is added to investigate the effects of varying fractions of one strategy present at initialization time and to discuss the rich dynamic properties in greater detail.

Two strains of S. cerevisiae, one dominant and one non-dominant, were labelled and mixed, and individual fermentations were set up to study the transcriptomes of the strains by means of RNA-seq. The results obtained suggest that cell-to-cell contact and aggregation, which are driven by the expression of genes that are associated with the cell surface, are indispensable conditions for the achievement of dominance. Observations on mixed aggregates, made up of cells of both strains, which were detected by means of flow cytometry, have confirmed the transcriptomic data. Furthermore, overexpression of the SSU 1 gene, which encodes for a transporter that confers resistance to sulphites, provides an ecological advantage to the dominant strain. A mechanistic model is proposed that sheds light on the dominance phenomenon between different strains of the S. cerevisiae species. The collected data suggest that cell-to-cell contact, together with differential sulphite production and resistance is important in determining the dominance of one strain over another.

This locus is {{regulated}} by a quorum-sensing mechanism consisting of a dedicated two-component regulatory system and a peptide pheromone. Like most clinical isolates, this type 6 A strain can be separated into opaque and transparent colony variants, each playing a different role during pneumococcal infection. In this study, we show that the blp locus is differentially regulated at the posttranscriptional level in pneumococcal opacity variants. Transparent and opaque variants produce equivalent amounts of blpMNPO transcript when stimulated with a synthetic pheromone, but transparent variants have no pneumocin MN-mediated inhibitory activity while opaque variants produce large zones of inhibitory activity. The differential regulation in opacity variants {{is driven by the}} two-component regulatory system CiaRH via its regulation of the serine protease HtrA. Transparent mutants deficient in CiaH or HtrA show increased pneumocin MN-mediated inhibition. In addition, these mutants demonstrate alterations in their dose response to a synthetic peptide pheromone, suggesting that HtrA activity impacts pneumocin MN production at the level of signaling. This, in addition to its known effects on competence, suggests that HtrA is a pleiotropic regulator whose protease activity affects several important bacterial pathways. The complex regulation of pneumocins may allow the pneumococcus to reserve the secretion of active peptides for situations where the benefit of their inhibitory activity outweighs the cost of their production...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{antibiotics}} (bacteriocins) are a {{large and}} diverse family of multidomain toxins that kill specific Gram-negative bacteria during <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition</b> for resources. Our understanding of the mechanism of import of such potent toxins has increased significantly in recent years especially with the reporting of several structures of bacteriocin domains. Less well understood is the structural biochemistry of intact bacteriocins and how these compare cross bacterial species. Here we focus on endonuclease (DNase) bacteriocins that target the genomes of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, known as E-type colicins and S-type pyocins, respectively, bound to their specific immunity (Im) proteins. First, we report the 3. 2 Å structure of the DNase colicin ColE 9 in complex with its ultra-high affinity immunity protein, Im 9. In contrast to Im 3, which when bound to the ribonuclease (rRNase) domain of the homologous colicin ColE 3 makes contact with the translocation (T-) domain of the toxin, we find that Im 9 makes no such contact and only interactions with the ColE 9 cytotoxic domain are observed. Second, we report small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data for two S-type DNase pyocins, S 2 and AP 41, into which are fitted recently determined X-ray structures for isolated domains. We find that DNase pyocins and colicins are both highly elongated molecules even though the order of their constituent domains differs.

Pyocins, produced by P. aeruginosa for <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition,</b> are highly potent protein antibiotics known to actively translocate across the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa. Understanding and exploiting the {{mechanisms by which}} pyocins target, penetrate and kill P. aeruginosa is a promising approach to antibiotic development. In this work we show the therapeutic potential of a newly identified tRNase pyocin, pyocin SD 2, by demonstrating its activity in vivo in a murine model of P. aeruginosa lung infection. In addition, we propose a mechanism of cell targeting and translocation for pyocin SD 2 across the P. aeruginosa outer membrane. Pyocin SD 2 is concentrated at the cell surface, via binding to the common polysaccharide antigen (CPA) of P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS), from where it can efficiently locate its outer membrane receptor FpvAI. This strategy of utilizing both the CPA and a protein receptor for cell targeting is common among pyocins as we show that pyocins S 2, S 5 and SD 3 also bind to the CPA. Additional data indicate a key role for an unstructured N-terminal region of pyocin SD 2 in the subsequent translocation of the pyocin into the cell. These results greatly improve {{our understanding of how}} pyocins target and translocate across the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa. This knowledge could be useful for the development of novel anti-pseudomonal therapeutics and will also support the development of pyocin SD 2 as a therapeutic in its own right...|$|E

Recent work shows that {{a better understanding of the}} composition and diversity of the microbial community across a variety of soils in different climates and under different land use, as well as plant–microbe interactions in the rhizosphere, may provide a key to better understand the variability of N 2 O fluxes at the soil–atmosphere interface. Moreover, recent insights into the regulation of the reduction of N 2 O to dinitrogen (N 2) have increased our understanding of N 2 O exchange. This improved process understanding, building on the increased use of isotope tracing techniques and metagenomics, needs to go along with improvements in measurement techniques for N 2 O (and N 2) emission in order to obtain robust field and laboratory datasets for different ecosystem types. Advances in both fields are currently used to improve process descriptions in biogeochemical models, which may eventually be used not only to test our current process understanding from the microsite to the field level, but also used as tools for up-scaling emissions to landscapes and regions and to explore feedbacks of soil N 2 O emissions to changes in environmental conditions, land management and land use...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{vegetation}} fragmentation and mixed grazing (ie mono- or multi-species animal group) on the diet composition of sheep and red deer grazing mosaics of grassland and heather moorland was studied, using faecal cuticle analysis, in two experimental sites in Scotland {{during the summer}} of 1992 and 1993. On Site A, the influence of grassland fragmentation on diet composition was estimated for sheep and deer grazing together in plots where the grassland (20 % of the area) was artificially distributed as one large, four medium or twelve small patches within a homogeneous moorland matrix (80 % of the area). On Site B, differences in diet composition between animals grazing within mono-species (sheep or deer) and multi-species groups (sheep and deer together) were examined for each animal species. In this site all plots used contained a similar natural mosaic pattern of grass and heather (ie similar mixtures of patch sizes, with about 20 % grass and 80 % heather cover). On Site A, the proportions of grass in the diet of sheep (73 %) and deer (27 %) were found to be similar across all levels of grass fragmentation. A significant interaction was found between the pattern of fragmentation and the three periods in which the experiment was carried out. On Site B in 1992, sheep had more grass in their diet than did deer (52 % vs 46 %), and the diets of both sheep and deer responded in the same fashion when the species were grazing in mono- or multi-species groups. The consumption of grass decreased in both species throughout the period studied, Deer showed no change in the proportion of grass in their diet in {{the presence or absence of}} sheep in 1992 (deer 48 % vs sheep 50 %). But on Site B in 1993, the diet of sheep contained a significantly higher proportion of grasses when they were grazing with red deer (52 %) than when they were grazing alone (38 %). These results suggest that on grassland/heather moorland mosaics sheep may suffer <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition</b> to a greater extent than do red deer, particularly where grass is in relatively low supply...|$|E
30|$|Understanding {{the impact}} of {{multiple}} environmental and chemical stressors on ecosystems {{is one of the}} greatest challenges in ecotoxicology. Matthias Liess (UFZ, Leipzig, Germany) presented lessons learned from several studies. Extrapolation from the laboratory to the field situation and from acute to chronic toxicity is challenged by a lack of system context in short-term laboratory toxicity tests. Important factors are (1) recovery and thus the long-term manifestation of toxic effects on populations and (2) the effect culmination following re-occurring stressor exposure. Both are a function of inter- and <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition</b> and must be taken into account for model predictions of multiple stressor effects in the environment—Multiple stressor effects often play a role in population declines. Helmut Segner (University of Berne, Switzerland) presented information on the decline of brown trout populations in Swiss rivers over the last few decades. The decline is most pronounced in Swiss midland rivers, which are characterized by a high prevalence of trout infected with Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, which causes proliferative kidney disease (PKD). These rivers also experienced the greatest increase in water temperature and contain relatively high concentrations of micropollutants. Studies showed that PKD-associated mortality of trout is positively correlated with temperature, possibly due to downregulation of immune pathways. Moreover, data from a pilot study, in which brown trout were exposed to 30  % wastewater, indicate that PKD-associated mortality is enhanced by chemical pollution. Complex interactions of environmental factors (nutrients, warming, parasites) also affected the food web of freshwater lakes. Piet Spaak (Eawag, Dübendorf, Switzerland) and colleagues examined the diverse ways in which cyanobacteria affect other species in lake communities. They showed that harmful cyanobacteria blooms were caused by a combination of lake warming and re-oligotrophication (N:P ratio). The greater abundance of toxin-producing cyanobacteria reduced food quality for Daphnia sp, which, in turn, increased Daphnia susceptibility to the parasite Caullerya mesnili. Finally, Lars Straub (University of Berne, Switzerland) presented a study on honey bees exposed to both the ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor, and the neonicotinoid insecticides, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, via pollen in late spring (6  weeks). Results showed the seasonality of effects: significant delayed effects of combined stressors on bee longevity manifested only in autumn. Similarly, bees exposed to combined stressors showed the greatest losses in general body weight in autumn. As a consequence, honey bee colonies exposed to both V. destructor and insecticides may encounter increased winter losses. The study highlighted the importance of considering time-lag effects when examining multiple stressors.|$|E
40|$|Entero{{bacteria}}ceae are {{a family}} of Gram-negative bacteria that cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. Infections with these organisms may cause foodborne diarrheal illnesses, urinary tract infections, and sepsis. These pathogens pose a serious global public health threat that is exacerbated by the increase of antibiotic resistance, the dearth of new antibiotics in the drug pipeline, and the limited availability of vaccines. To slow the emergence of antibiotic resistance and {{reduce the incidence of}} secondary infections, narrow-spectrum therapeutic strategies that limit the disruption of the host microbiota, which comprises beneficial microbes that provide colonization resistance to pathogens, are needed. Iron is an essential nutrient for almost all organisms, and bioavailable iron is limiting in the vertebrate host. Thus, scavenging iron from the host environment using small molecule iron chelators called siderophores is an essential process for the pathogenesis of infection. Therefore, bacterial iron acquisition represents an appealing target for the development of new therapeutic approaches that are needed in the wake of antibiotic resistance. In this work, we have developed two new possible strategies to target pathogens belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family that are siderophore-producers. In particular, we provide the first evidence that antimicrobial proteins termed microcins are important for inter- and <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition</b> among enterobacteria during intestinal inflammation. Indeed, we demonstrate that E. coli Nissle 1917, a prominent probiotic organism originally isolated from the human gut, utilizes microcins to inhibit a variety of competitors: commensal E. coli, the pathobiont (a commensal strain that can become pathogenic in certain conditions) adherent invasive E. coli, and the pathogen Salmonella. Microcins produced by E. coli Nissle 1917 are post-translationally modified at the C-terminus with a siderophore moiety. Therefore, these microcins can target competing bacteria through siderophore receptors, a mechanism described as a “Trojan horse” mode of action. In this work I show {{for the first time that}} this mechanism plays a role in vivo, as these microcins coupled to siderophores promote competition among enterobacteria in the inflamed gut, where iron is limited. As a second way to target pathogens that utilize siderophore to acquire iron, we employed a novel immunization strategy to target siderophores with antibodies. Specifically, in collaboration with Dr. Elisabeth Nolan and Dr. Phoom Chariatana at MIT, we synthesized the enterobactin siderophore to be then linked to an immunogenic carrier protein. We found that our immunization strategy induced the development of specific anti-siderophore antibodies and successfully reduced Salmoenlla gut colonization. Moreover, we found that this siderophore-capture mechanism mediated by the adaptive immune system provided narrow-spectrum growth inhibitory activity, as other member of the microbiota were unaffected by our immunization. Altogether, we demonstrated that microcins are a source of narrow-spectrum antimicrobials that target siderophore-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the inflamed gut. In addition, we provide first evidence of a successful immunization against bacterial siderophores in order to reduce pathogens’ growth...|$|E

It has been proposed that if alleles do not contribute multiplicatively to fitness, but instead display a negative epistatic fitness curve, then the population will be {{in such a state}} following selection, and sex will be advantageous. However, there is no a priori reason to believe that fitness values should generally be negatively epistatic, as opposed to positive or zero. In this study, we explore the relationship between contest competition and the maintenance of sexual reproduction. In Chapter 2, we develop a two-locus bi-allelic haploid model {{to examine the relationship between}} phenotype, competitive selection, and realized fitness. We assume that competitive ability is directly proportional to the phenotypic value and that the outcome of pairwise competition is dependent on the ratio of competitive abilities of the competing individuals. The stronger competitor does not always win, but it wins more frequently than the weaker competitor does. Using this very simple model, we find that <b>intraspecies</b> <b>competition</b> can lead to frequency dependent changes in genotypic fitness. In addition, competition can result in negative epistasis at the level of realized fitness. This leads to the build-up of negative linkage disequilibrium among the alleles that affect fitness following selection. In Chapter 3, we explore the effects of competition when the selection is repeated over several generations. We find that the amount of negative linkage disequilibrium builds up continuously in the absence of recombination, and this hinders the progress of selection. This accumulation of negative linkage disequilibrium is alleviated when recombination is present. We show, using both a numerical modeling approach and through individual-based simulations, that sexual individuals will increase in frequency in a mixed population of sexual and asexual individuals. The selective advantage of recombination is strongest when there is a large difference in competitive ability between genotypes, and when the selected alleles are initially rare. Finally in Chapter 4, we consider a different mapping of phenotype onto fitness to ensure that our findings are robust. In this case, the outcome of pairwise competition is not determined by the ratio of competitive abilities; instead the stronger competitor always wins. In this case, as expected, there is even stronger negative epistasis at the fitness level. As a result, we find that advantageous alleles go to fixation at a faster rate when recombining, and sexual individuals increase in frequency when competing against asexual individuals in a mixed population. Our results indicate that competition can play a significant role in the maintenance of sexual reproduction, and that the advantage of sexual reproduction may not lie in fertility selection, but in viability selection. In a competitive situation, it is better to produce one winner rather than two losers...|$|E
