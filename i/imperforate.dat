25|$|Postage stamps {{issued in}} sheets with no {{perforations}} between the rows and columns of individual stamps {{are referred to}} as <b>imperforate.</b> The Washington-Franklin issue contains several series of <b>imperforate</b> stamps that occur on a small range of denominations from 1 through 5-cents. These stamps were issued in <b>imperforate</b> form to accommodate several major vending machine companies of that period who used this stock for coil stamps in their machines which were in wide use about the country. Many of these companies applied their own form of perforations, such as the , Mail-O-Meter, and Brinkerhoff vending machine companies. There were at least seven such firms, each having its own patented machines. <b>Imperforate</b> stamps were issued in full uncut sheets of 400 subjects or in coil rolls of 500 or 1000 stamps. The <b>imperforate</b> issues were printed from a flat plate with 400 subjects until 1918 when they were produced on the rotary press from continuous rolls of paper. <b>Imperforate</b> coils from this stock are much rarer than examples cut from full sheets.|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: <b>Imperforated</b> anus is {{a disease}} that {{requires}} surgery {{in the first days}} of life therefore, association with other diseases or anomalies is of great importance. This study aims to determine the prevalence of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) in patients with <b>imperforated</b> anus. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive study on patients with <b>imperforated</b> anus referring to Booali hospital of Sari, IRAN from 1996 to 2003. Previous patients medical records was reviewed and physical examination and concurrently echocardiography were done for new patients. The data were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis using SPSS software. Results: Ninty patients with <b>imperforated</b> anus were entered into the survey. Echocardiography revealed that 26 patients including 14 Female (57. 2 %) and 12 Male (42. 8 %) had CHD. 22 of CHD patients (84. 6 %) had <b>imperforated</b> anus(IA) of high type and 4 (15. 3 %) had IA of low type. CHD types consisted of : 7 patients (26. 9 %) ASD+PDA, 6 patients (23 %) ASD+PDA+TR, 4 patients (15. 3 %) PDA, 4 patients (15. 3 %) MR, 1 patient (3. 8 %) TF, 2 patients (7. 6 %) VSD and 2 patients (7. 6 %) ASD. Conclusion: Considering the high prevalence of CHD in IA, it seems that echocardiography is necessary in all those with IA particularly to predict outcome of surgery and prevent probable complications...|$|R

25|$|Two {{years later}} on May 19, 1925, the Post Office issued a similar Harding stamp, using the 1923 {{memorial}} issue die, and whose color {{this time was}} brown and whose denomination was now at 1½ cents.

25|$|The first {{postage stamp}} {{issued by the}} Confederate States (1861) was a 5¢ green {{depicting}} Jefferson Davis. It was printed by the lithograph process by Hoyer and Ludwig of Richmond, Virginia.

25|$|During the {{production}} of the 1916–17 series, it was observed that on one 2-cent plate, No. 7942, three of the 400 images had become noticeably worn. Two of these images were a vertical pair, appearing {{near the bottom of the}} top-left pane of 100; the remaining image appeared near the top of the bottom-right pane. When replacing these three images, the technician responsible (conceivably confused by the problems of working with mirror-image material, which can makes a 5 look like a 2) inadvertently transferred 5-cent images onto the three problem positions of the plate. This error was not noticed for several weeks, and eventually three different carmine-colored 5-cent stamps were distributed by the Post Office: the perforated 10 issue of 1916–17 (Scott #467), the <b>imperforate</b> issue of the same years (Scott #485), and the perforated 11 issue of 1917–20 (Scott #505). The <b>imperforate</b> version is by far the rarest of these, and few collectors have ever seen one.|$|E

25|$|Beginning on January 3, 1911 the Bureau of Engraving and Printing {{issued the}} 1-cent and 2-cent {{denominations}} in <b>imperforate</b> form on single-line watermarked paper specifically {{for use by}} at least seven different private coil-stamp vending machine companies. Each company used its own distinctive types of perforations, and most firms continued to experiment with them. Thus on the 1-cent issues, these five companies employed a total of 18 different types of private perforations, while 19 types exist on the 2-cent denomination. These private perforations, designed to fit the specific mechanisms of the various vending machines, were applied to <b>imperforate</b> sheets of 400 stamps after those sheets had been cut into either vertical or horizontal strips (the first such sheets had been issued in 1906 {{at the request of}} various vending machine companies). Joseph Schermack is generally credited with producing the first coil stamp vending machine. Privately applied perforations continued to be used well into the 1920s, and comprise a distinctive segment of U.S. postal history.|$|E
25|$|The first postage stamp, the Penny Black, {{was issued}} by Britain in May 1840 and pictured a young Queen Victoria.

While unused examples of the Penny Black are quite scarce, used examples are quite common, and may be purchased for $20 to $200, depending upon condition.|$|E
25|$|In 1917, the New York Post office {{returned}} {{a batch of}} <b>imperforate</b> 2-cent stamps from the 1908-09 issue (double line watermark, two spelled out) to Washington for credit. Rather than remitting cash, however, the Federal Post Office in effect transformed these stamps into a new issue by perforating them with the then-current gauge—perforated 11—and returned them to New York.

25|$|Three {{denominations}} of 1, 2 and 3-cents {{were printed}} by the offset printing process. There {{are two types}} of the 1-cent denomination, five different types of the 2-cent variety, and two types of the 3-cent variety. These types possess differences in the lines on the toga rope in Washington's profile and usually require the aid of magnification to positively identify their different characteristics. Stamps produced by the offset process were issued with a perforation gauge of 11 with the one exception of the 1919 1-cent issue with gauge 12½. The first Washington-Franklin stamp printed by the offset process was a 3-cent Washington-head, issued on March 22, 1918. The 1-cent green followed and was issued on December 24, 1918. The five types of the 2-cent denomination were issued sometime later on March 15, 1920. Beginning in 1919 an <b>imperforate</b> variety (no perforations between stamps) was also issued. All three denominations were printed and possess the same variations in type that are found on the perforated issues, as the <b>imperforate</b> issues were produced from the same plates. There were no Franklin-heads printed with the Offset printing press.|$|E
25|$|The Directorate General of Chinese Soviet Posts {{was founded}} in Ruijin on May 1, 1932.

They were <b>imperforate,</b> and denominated in the Chinese Soviet silver-dollar currency. They are fairly rare, and sought after by collectors. There are also many forgeries and bogus issues imitating early stamps from the communist areas.|$|E
25|$|In 1862, a 2¢ {{stamp of}} Andrew Jackson appeared, in green, and was issued <b>imperforate.</b> This issue was again lithographed by Hoyer & Ludwig of Richmond, Virginia.

40|$|Numerical {{studies were}} {{performed}} on natural convection heat transfer from radial heat sinks with perforated ring. The effects of perforation number (0 - 6), perforation diameter (0 - 3 mm), and perforation length (1. 5 - 6 mm), and orientations angle (0 - 180 degrees) on the thermal performance were investigated. The results show that radial heat sinks with a perforated ring obviously have better thermal performance than that with <b>imperforated</b> ring. Upwardly oriented radial heat sinks have the best thermal performance while sideward oriented radial heat sinks yield worst thermal performance. The geometric parameters of perforation is shown to affect the thermal performance of heat sink significantly at relatively higher heat transfer rate, especially for upward and sideward orientations. The thermal resistance of the radial heat sink with optimized perforated ring was shown {{to be less than}} that of <b>imperforated</b> ring by 17 %, while reducing the mass of ring by up to 37 %. This {{can be attributed to the}} unhindered natural convective flow through the perforation. ope...|$|R

25|$|In March 1856 the Post Office {{issued the}} first postage stamp to feature Thomas Jefferson. The exact {{date of issue}} is not clear. Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers {{establishes}} the release date with the first known use of this issue, March 24, 1856. The first issue of this stamp was in <b>imperforate</b> form, engraved and printed by Toppan, Carpenter, Casilear & Co. The Jefferson issue saw postal duty from the spring of 1856 to the summer of 1857. The engraving of Jefferson was modeled after {{a portrait of the}} President by Gilbert Stuart. By mid-1857 the stamps were issued with the top and bottom design projections omitted and with perforations. This printing was issued in at least six major color variations.|$|E
25|$|On 21 September 1964, {{the island}} was granted {{independence}} as the State of Malta, a member in the Commonwealth of Nations and a Commonwealth realm. A set of 6 values was issued for this event, also designed by Emvin Cremona, who designed virtually every set up to 1971. These sets are all very cheap but highly collectible. Christmas stamps started in 1964 and have focused mostly on Nativity scenes. The 1965 definitives showed various episodes from the History of Malta and are considered {{some of the finest}} ever issued. Many varieties exist on this issue, from misplaced or omitted colours to <b>imperforate</b> stamps. The Malta Philatelic Society has been established on 7 March 1966. Malta joined CEPT in 1971 and has issued Europa stamps annually since then.|$|E
25|$|President Don Ignacio Comonfort, {{authorized}} the {{prepayment of postage}} using adhesive stamps by decree of February 21, 1856. New regulations were drawn up and {{were supposed to be}} published on July 15, but problems with the engraving delayed this until July 31. On August 1, 1856 Mexico issued its first postage stamps. The design, a portrait of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, the parish priest who led an unsuccessful bid for Mexican independence in 1810, reflected the reform politics of the Comonfort government. The stamps were somewhat crudely engraved and <b>imperforate.</b> Five values were issued from 1856-1859; ½ real, 1r, 2r, 4r, and 8r. The stamps usually, but not always, had district overprints with the name of the district post office.|$|E
