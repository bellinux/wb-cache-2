25|$|Hobbing is a {{machining}} process for gear cutting, cutting splines, and cutting sprockets on a <b>hobbing</b> <b>machine,</b> {{which is a}} special type of milling machine. The teeth or splines are progressively cut into the workpiece {{by a series of}} cuts made by a cutting tool called a hob. Compared to other gear forming processes it is relatively inexpensive but still quite accurate, thus it is used for a broad range of parts and quantities.|$|E
25|$|Hobbing uses a <b>hobbing</b> <b>machine</b> {{with two}} skew spindles, one mounted {{with a blank}} {{workpiece}} {{and the other with}} the hob. The angle between the hob's spindle (axis) and the workpiece's spindle varies, {{depending on the type of}} product being produced. For example, if a spur gear is being produced, then the hob is angled equal to the helix angle of the hob; if a helical gear is being produced then the angle must be increased by the same amount as the helix angle of the helical gear. The two shafts are rotated at a proportional ratio, which determines the number of teeth on the blank; for example, for a single-threaded hob if the gear ratio is 40:1 the hob rotates 40 times to each turn of the blank, which produces 40 teeth in the blank. If the hob has multiple threads the speed ratio must be multiplied by the number of threads on the hob. The hob is then fed up into the workpiece until the correct tooth depth is obtained. Finally the hob is fed through the workpiece parallel to the blank's axis of rotation.|$|E

50|$|Gear <b>hobbing</b> is a <b>machining</b> {{process in}} which gear teeth are {{progressively}} generated {{by a series of}} cuts with a helical cutting tool. All motions in hobbing are rotary, and the hob and gear blank rotate continuously as in two gears meshing until all teeth are cut.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the herringbone gear {{is that it}} cannot be cut by simple gear <b>hobbing</b> <b>machines,</b> as the cutter would run into {{the other half of}} the gear. Solutions to this have included assembling small gears by stacking two helical gears together, cutting the gears with a central groove to provide clearance, and (particularly in the early days) by casting the gears to an accurate pattern and without further machining. With the older method of fabrication, herringbone gears had a central channel separating the two oppositely-angled courses of teeth. This was necessary to permit the shaving tool to run out of the groove. The development of the Sykes gear shaper made it possible to have continuous teeth with no central gap. Sunderland, also in England, also produced a herringbone cutting machine. The Sykes uses cylindrical guides and round cutters; the Sunderland uses straight guides and rack-type cutters. The W. E. Sykes Co. dissolved in 1983-84. Since then it has been common practice to obtain an older machine and rebuild it if necessary to create this unique type of gear. Recently, the Bourn and Koch company has developed a CNC-controlled derivation of the W. E. Sykes design called the HDS1600-300. This machine, like the Sykes gear shaper, has the ability to generate a true apex without the need for a clearance groove cut around the gear. This allows the gears to be used in positive displacement pumping applications, as well as power transmission. Helical gears with low weight, accuracy and strength may be 3D printed.|$|R
5000|$|Five new {{buildings}} were constructed on the complex by 1907. The following year, Barber-Colman diversified to produce Milling Cutters. These {{were used by}} large mills for cutting metal. Their Gear <b>Hobbing</b> <b>Machine</b> came out in two sizes in 1910 and could precisely cut teeth in gears. In 1919, the company purchased {{the rights to the}} Warp Drawing Machine from the American Warp Drawing Machine Company. This machine eased the transition of switching warping patterns. In 1921, Barber-Colman introduced a High Speed Warper & Creel and Automatic Spoolers. By 1931, the company also had production facilities in Framingham, Massachusetts; Greenville, South Carolina; Munich, Germany; Chicago; Cincinnati, Ohio; Rochester, New York; and Manchester, England.Howard Colman died in a car accident in 1942. Harry Severson, one of the three original directors, took over leadership of the company. In 1953, the [...] "Park Plant" [...] was built, a one-story, 125000 sq ft building in nearby Loves Park. In 1954, the company purchased the Hendey Machine Company. By 1965, three other additions were complete on the Loves Park facility. In 1968, a 200000 sq ft facility was built just north of the original plant. By 1975, Barber-Colman employed 4000 workers among its 150 locations. The company was family-owned until the death of Walter Colman (Howard's son) in 1983. Following Colman's death, the company was sold off to various companies. Reed-Chatwood purchased the textile operations and continued to manufacture from the original factory until 2001. The machine tool division was sold to fellow Rockford company Bourn & Koch, Inc. Bourn & Koch provides parts, service and support for their machines to this day. Barber-Colman henceforth focused on cutting tools and process controls. The remaining divisions were eventually sold off. The Barber-Colman trademark is held by Eurotherm Controls, Inc. The historic complex has been vacated since Reed-Chatwood relocated in 2001. The City of Rockford currently owns the property, purchasing it for $750,000 in 2002. On August 8, 2006, it was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGear hobbing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} manufacturing processes for cylindrical gears. The quality of the gears is a result of the tool quality, the precision of the workpiece, tool clamping and kinematics of the machine. The dry gear <b>hobbing</b> process allows <b>machining</b> of gears with a quality according to the DIN standard of up to IT 5. To evaluate which gear quality is possible to machine with a given clamping and hob it is useful to simulate the process in advance. This is also an opportunity to order the required quality of the hob according to its application. The objective presented in this paper is to simulate non-ideal gear hobbing processes and to calculate the geometry and topography of the workpiece. To achieve this goal, a simulation for continuous gear hobbing was developed. By calculating planar intersections of transverse sections of both gear and tool, the resulting gear geometry is determined. Beside it is possible to calculate different characteristic values for the hobbing process such as chip thickness and cutting volume. By an evaluation of tool and clamping tolerances these deviations can be used to modify the simulation model. Afterwards a non-ideal hobbing simulation can be performed and the resulting gear geometry can be analyzed using a virtual measurement machine. An advantage of this non-ideal simulation is also the possibility of calculating the tool load taking these deviations into account and to use the results for further process designs to reduce the risk of tool failure. The virtual measurement machine analyses the geometry according to VDI/VDE  2612 / 2607 and DIN  3961. The resulting measurements of the flank and lead lines can be used for a classification of the gear quality. By using this simulation program it is possible to reduce the costs and time effort of setting up a new hobbing process...|$|R

Research on {{the effect}} of main spindle {{deformation}} which is caused by hobbing force of gear <b>hobbing</b> <b>machine</b> is an important way to diminish or control the machining tolerance of gear.

And we can reach a conclusion that we should increase hob rotative velocity and feed in a small hobbing depth in several times, it will diminish cutting force, deformation of hob and workpiece spindle, which will improve the machining precision, efficiency and diminish product scrap ratio.
