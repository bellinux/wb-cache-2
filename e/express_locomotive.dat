25|$|After the {{formation}} of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923, and after comparative trials against locomotives of the constituent companies, the Midland compound was deemed the best and adopted in a slightly modified version, the LMS Compound 4-4-0, from 1925 to 1932 as the LMS standard class 4 <b>express</b> <b>locomotive</b> reaching a final total of 245 locomotives. The LMS locomotives were not universally appreciated especially on the old LNWR section where they went hand in hand with operating methods imposed by the Midland Railway constituent but in Scotland they were received as the solution to serious endemic <b>express</b> <b>locomotive</b> problems and were generally well liked.|$|E
25|$|Consideration of {{the boiler}} began in late 1998. No {{standard}} gauge boiler {{had been built}} in Britain since the 1960s for such a large <b>express</b> <b>locomotive.</b> It was required {{to be based on}} the original LNER Diagram 118 design, but had to meet modern safety standards. Design changes included the cheaper modern-day fabrication method of a welded, rather than riveted, firebox and boiler tube; the use of steel, rather than copper, for the firebox; and the aforementioned height reduction for OLE regulations.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} in 1949 of thirty-five Pm and Pmr {{class was}} {{originally intended to}} oust the Pr locomotives from express services the later designs proved unstable at speed and were transferred instead to fast goods workings, leaving the Pr class as the only <b>express</b> <b>locomotive</b> on the WAGR. The introduction of X class diesels in 1954, however, ended their long tenure in this position and both P and Pr class locomotives were gradually relegated to goods and shunting duties. Their adequate tractive effort and economy, however, ensured their survival {{until the very end}} of steam.|$|E

25|$|During the 1940s both P and Pr class {{locomotives}} {{were used}} extensively on troop trains, while civilian patronage also increased during this time. The increased war traffic {{was so great}} that it necessitated the conversion of eight P class locomotives to Pr standard at a time when lack of available resources and labour had stalled the production of new locomotives, such as the S class until 1943. Both during and following the war the Pr class remained the premier <b>express</b> <b>locomotive,</b> while the P class continued on secondary passenger services, concentrated in the states' South West around Albany, particularly on the Great Southern Railway.|$|E
500|$|A {{collision}} occurred near Lawrence hill on 8 January 1930, approximately [...] {{north of}} the station. At 5:41am, an express train from [...] to [...] ran {{into the back of}} a minerals train which had stopped to pick up the brakes after descending Filton Bank. The <b>express</b> <b>locomotive,</b> GWR 4000 Class number 4063 [...] "Bath Abbey", was derailed and badly damaged, with several coaches also being damaged. The incident was blamed on signalman A. H. Toop of the Lawrence Hill signal box, with contributing factors including lax working standards and the driver of the goods train, W. G. Atkins, failing to pull up to the signal box as required.|$|E

25|$|During the 1930s, {{there was}} a fashion for <b>express</b> {{passenger}} <b>locomotives</b> to be streamlined by enclosed bodyshells. As <b>express</b> <b>locomotives,</b> these were nearly all tender locomotives. A few examples of fast tank engines were streamlined though. These were used on high-speed, but shorter, services where turn-around time was important and the tank engine's independence from turntables was useful. Examples included the German Class 61 and the Hungarian Class 242.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I won't. It'll {{be as much}} as I can do to {{get through}} this story, without going over any of it again. Well, the thing that the little Pony Engine wanted to be, the most in this world, was the {{locomotive}} of the Pacific Express, that starts out every afternoon at three, you know. It intended to apply for the place as soon as its cow-catcher was grown, and it was always trying to attract the locomotive's attention, backing and filling on the track alongside of the train; and once it raced it a little piece, and beat it, before the <b>Express</b> <b>locomotive</b> was under way, and almost got in front of it on a switch. My, but its mother was scared! She just yelled to it with her whistle; and that night she sent it to sleep without a particle of coal or water in its tender.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the morning}} in question, Mrs Roby, lying placidly in her neat white little bed, and gazing with a sweet {{contented}} face through one of her cabin windows at the bright blue sky, heard a sound as though a compound animal--hog and whale--had aroused itself and rolled over on its other side. A low whistling followed. Mrs Roby knew that the Captain was pleasantly engaged with his thoughts--planning out {{the proceedings of the}} day. Suddenly the whistling ceased and was followed by a sonorous [...] "how-ho!" [...] terminating in a gasp worthy of an <b>express</b> <b>locomotive.</b> The Captain had stretched himself and Mrs Roby smiled at her own thoughts, as well she might for they embraced the idea that a twentieth part of the force employed in that stretch would have rent in twain every tendon, muscle, sinew, and filament in her, Mrs Roby's, body. Next, there descended on the floor overhead a sixteen-stone cannon ball, which caused--not the neighbours, but the boards and rafters to complain. The Captain was up! and succeeding sounds proved that he had had another stretch, for there was a bump {{in the middle of it}} which showed that, forgetting his stature, the careless man had hit the ceiling with his head. That was evidently a matter of no consequence.|$|E

Of course the <b>Express</b> <b>locomotive</b> was drawing a heavy train of cars, and it had to make a stop or two--at Charlestown, and at Concord Junction, and at Ayer--so the Pony Engine did really gain on it a little; and when it began to be scared it gained a good deal. But the first place where it began to feel sorry, and to want its mother, was in Hoosac Tunnel. It never was in a tunnel before, and it seemed as if it would never get out. It kept thinking, What if the Pacific Express was to run over it there in the dark, and its mother off there at the Fitchburg Depot, in Boston, looking for it among the side-tracks? It gave a perfect shriek; and just then it shot out of the tunnel. There were a lot of {{locomotives}} loafing around there at North Adams, and one of them shouted out to it as it flew by, 'What's your hurry, little one?' and it just screamed back, 'Pacific Express!' and never stopped to explain. They talked in locomotive language--" ...|$|E
