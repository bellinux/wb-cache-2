5|$|The {{notion that}} the ship would have nailed her flag and never surrendered, as Barère claimed, is never {{accounted}} {{in any of the}} reports. Though Jean François Renaudin never explicitly states that he surrendered, he does mention that he had his flag flown half-mast in distress when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> British ships, indicating that he was requesting assistance from the enemy. Griffiths observes that Vengeur was dismasted to the point that there would have been nothing on which to nail a flag anyway, and James makes mentions of Vengeur hoisting the Union Jack in submission.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev rarely {{appeared}} in public during 1982. The Soviet government claimed that Brezhnev was not seriously ill, but admitted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> doctors. He suffered a severe stroke in May 1982, {{but refused to}} relinquish office. On 7 November 1982, despite his failing health, Brezhnev was present standing on Lenin's Mausoleum during the annual military parade and demonstration of workers commemorating {{the anniversary of the}} October Revolution. The event would also mark Brezhnev's final public appearance before dying three days later after suffering a heart attack. He was honoured with a state funeral, which was followed with a five-day period of nationwide mourning. He was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Red Square. National and international statesmen from around the globe attended his funeral. His wife and family attended; his daughter Galina Brezhneva outraged spectators by not showing up in sombre garb. Brezhnev on the other hand was dressed for burial in his Marshal's uniform, along with all his medals.|$|E
5|$|Antonio Ezequiel {{was killed}} by the Mexican Navy at around 6:00p.m. in {{downtown}} Matamoros on 5 November 2010, but the roadblocks set by organized crime continued {{throughout the rest of}} the day. The drug lord had reportedly called for backup when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> the Navy, but when he was killed, his reinforcements from Reynosa, Tamaulipas (which consisted of over 80 SUVs filled with gunmen) dispersed. The international bridges in Matamoros were reopened by 7:00p.m. after crowds of people had waited all afternoon. In Reynosa at around 9:15p.m., a grenade exploded inside a vehicle parked outside Plaza Real, the busiest shopping center in the city and just four miles away from the Hidalgo–Reynosa International Bridge. Reynosa also reported several shootings between the Mexican Army and organized crime on the highway that connects the city with the border town of Matamoros. In the municipalities of San Fernando, Río Bravo, Jaumave, Díaz Ordaz, Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Mier, Guerrero, Miguel Alemán, Valle Hermoso, and Ciudad Victoria, most of the daily city activities were cancelled throughout the whole day. Organized crime gunmen and risk situations were reported in these areas, too.|$|E

5|$|Josquin likely {{learned his}} craft {{in his home}} region in the North, in France, and then in Italy {{when he went to}} Milan and Rome. His early sacred works emulate the contrapuntal {{complexity}} and ornamented, melismatic lines of Ockeghem and his contemporaries, {{but at the same time}} he was learning his contrapuntal technique he was acquiring an Italianate idiom for his secular music: after all, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> Italian popular music in Milan. By the end of his long creative career, which spanned approximately 50 productive years, he had developed a simplified style in which each voice of a polyphonic composition exhibited free and smooth motion, and close attention was paid to clear setting of text as well as clear alignment of text with musical motifs. While other composers were influential on the development of Josquin's style, especially in the late 15th century, he himself became the most influential composer in Europe, especially after the development of music printing, which was concurrent with the years of his maturity and peak output. This event made his influence even more decisive than it might otherwise have been.|$|E

Continuing into Graz, the 84th bumped into an Austrian strongpoint at the Saint Leonhard Church and its nearby cemetery. The French bagged another 125 captives by attacking the place from both front and rear.

25|$|Pierre-Paul Riquet had no {{technical}} training and learnt on the job. He regularly practised experiments and field observations. His technique remained highly empirical {{because at that}} time applied science and hydraulic techniques through laws or concepts had not been mastered. Even so, Riquet had a scientific approach as he systematically took measurements of flow and made calculations of volumes. In addition, to overcome his technical shortcomings, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> many technicians such as Hector Boutheroüe, François Andreossy surveyor and cartographer, and Pierre Campmas an expert in water flows.|$|E
25|$|Milligan blamed his {{breakdown}} and {{the collapse}} of his first marriage on the sheer volume of writing the show required. His then ground-breaking use of sound effects also contributed to the pressure. All this exacerbated his mental instability that included bipolar disorder, especially during the third series. The BBC however made sure <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> accomplished radio comedy writers—Sykes, Stephens, Antrobus, Wiltshire, and Grafton—so many of the problems caused by his ill health were skilfully covered over by composite scripts written in a very convincing Milliganesque style.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} seven years of his {{residence}} at Leiden his reputation was at its highest point. His literary judgement was unquestioned.

He encouraged Grotius when only a youth of sixteen to edit Capella. At the early death of the younger Douza he wept as at that of a beloved son.

Shortly after Manu's birth, the Chao family moved {{to the outskirts of}} Paris, and Manu spent most of his childhood in Boulogne-Billancourt and Sèvres. As he grew up <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> many artists and intellectuals, most of whom were acquaintances of his father. Chao cites much of his childhood experience as inspiration for some songs. As a child, he was a big fan of Cuban singer-pianist Bola de Nieve.|$|E
25|$|One of Ted Williams' final, {{and most}} memorable, public {{appearances}} {{was at the}} 1999 All-Star Game in Boston. Able to walk only a short distance, Williams {{was brought to the}} pitcher's mound in a golf cart. He proudly waved his cap to the crowd—a gesture he had never done as a player. Fans responded with a standing ovation that lasted several minutes. At the pitcher's mound <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> players from both teams, including fellow Red Sox player Nomar Garciaparra. Later in the year, he was among the members of the Major League Baseball All-Century Team introduced to the crowd at Turner Field in Atlanta prior to Game two of the World Series.|$|E

25|$|The {{conflict}} continued {{throughout the}} siege of Acre, although it did not deter Guy from gallantly saving Conrad's life when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> the enemy. A temporary settlement was then reached by which Guy was to remain king in his lifetime, but to be succeeded by Conrad and Isabella or their heirs. However, in April 1192 Richard finally realised {{that he could not}} return home without a final resolution to the matter, definitely relinquishing the crown in May 1192. The kingship was put to a vote among the barons of the kingdom: Conrad was elected unanimously, and Guy accepted defeat. Only days later, Conrad was assassinated by Hashashin, and Isabella married Richard's nephew Henry II of Champagne; when he died in 1197, Isabella married Guy's brother Amalric.|$|E
25|$|At 4:00 AM on 28 October, Hohenlohe's {{exhausted}} Prussians {{stumbled into}} Schönermark-Nordwestuckermark eight kilometers west of Prenzlau. At a council of war {{it was determined}} to continue on into Prenzlau. At this time orders were sent to Hagen to make for Pasewalk. The Battle of Prenzlau occurred that day. Murat with Lasalle, Milhaud, Grouchy, Beaumont, and 3,000 of Lannes' infantry intercepted Hohenlohe's column as it marched into the city. Lasalle attacked in front, followed by the two dragoon divisions. On the outskirts, one of Grouchy's brigades hewed {{a path through the}} Prussian column, capturing many prisoners and isolating the rear guard. Beaumont's dragoons drove the rear guard against the Uecker River north of the city and forced Prince Augustus of Prussia to surrender. Though Hohenlohe still had a clear road to Stettin, Murat bluffed him into surrendering 10,000 troops by claiming <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> 100,000 Frenchmen.|$|E
25|$|Finally, however, {{there came}} a point in July 1461 when the king's {{physicians}} concluded that Charles would not live past August. Ill and weary, the king became delirious, convinced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> traitors loyal only to his son. Under the pressure of sickness and fever, he went mad. By now another infection in his jaw had caused a tumor or abscess in his mouth. The swelling caused by this became so large that, for {{the last week of}} his life, Charles was unable to swallow food or water. Although he asked the Dauphin to come to his deathbed, Louis refused, instead waiting at Avesnes, in Burgundy, for his father to die. At Mehun-sur-Yèvre, attended by his younger son, Charles, and aware of his elder son's final betrayal, the King starved to death. He died on 22 July 1461, and was buried, at his request, beside his parents in Saint-Denis.|$|E
