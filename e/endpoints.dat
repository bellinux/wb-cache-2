5|$|In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes {{are complex}} submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau {{together}} with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the <b>endpoints</b> of strings.

In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects is known as the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds. This means among other things that they have half the dimension of the space in which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.|$|E

Optimal performance and high yields in CMP require process monitoring, particularly <b>endpoint</b> detection, which aims to determine the exact polish time needed to avoid defects created by overpolishing. This paper shows that <b>endpoint</b> detection using acoustic emission (AE) measurements determines the <b>endpoint</b> of a simulated shallow trench isolation (STI) CMP process ∼ 10 s faster than a traditional friction force approach, which prevents a 5 % overpolish. A so-called <b>endpoint</b> frequency method based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis is also described for CMP <b>endpoint</b> detection. This method predicts the <b>endpoint</b> a priori and is more accurate than the traditional box method found in industry.
