500|$|After divorcing Ike in 1978, Tina abstained {{from serious}} {{relationships}} {{for a long}} time, as she set on bringing her career back on track. In 1986 she said, [...] "People {{have to realize that}} I just got out of a very difficult marriage. I'm not the type of woman who needs to jump back into another. I liked my freedom when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that one. I've had a few love affairs, but nothing important." ...|$|E
500|$|Afework Hagos, a {{computer}} programmer, {{was on his}} way to work and stuck in a traffic jam near the Pentagon when the airplane flew over. [...] "There was a huge screaming noise and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the car as the plane came over. Everybody was running away in different directions. It was tilting its wings up and down like it was trying to balance. It hit some lampposts on the way in." [...] Daryl Donley witnessed the crash and took some of the first photographs of the site.|$|E

500|$|Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was {{the soul}} music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). He {{considered}} it the least satisfactory {{of the three}} he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] {{in many of the}} album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: [...] "He wasn't up for it... It was a terrible time because I think {{there was a lot of}} cocaine going around, and that's when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the picture... I didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: [...] "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.|$|E
500|$|Kate Capshaw {{called her}} {{character}} [...] "not {{much more than}} a dumb screaming blonde." [...] Steven Spielberg said in 1989, [...] "I wasn't happy with Temple of Doom at all. It was too dark, too subterranean, and much too horrific. I thought it out-poltered Poltergeist. There's not an ounce of my own personal feeling in Temple of Doom." [...] He later added during the Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom documentary, [...] "Temple of Doom is my least favorite of the trilogy. I look back and I say, 'Well the greatest thing that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that was I met Kate Capshaw.' We married years later and that to me was the reason I was fated to make Temple of Doom." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, cancer {{survivor}} Cathy Bossi, an on-duty flight attendant for U.S. Airways, was passing through security screening at Charlotte Douglas International Airport {{on the way}} to her next flight. Due to the radiation involved, she reluctantly passed through a full-body scanner. [...] "The T.S.A. Agent told me to put my I.D. on my back," [...] she said. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> there the agent said because my I.D. was on my back, I had to go to a personal screening area." [...] During what she described as an [...] "aggressive" [...] pat-down search, security screening personnel forced her to remove and show her prosthetic breast. Their action violated TSA guidelines, which state that agents do not need to touch or inspect a mastectomy prosthetic.|$|E

500|$|Only a {{month after}} Lunney graduated, President Eisenhower signed into {{existence}} the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), into which NACA was subsumed. His timing was perfect, for as Lunney later said, [...] "there {{was no such thing}} as space flight until the month <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> college". Lunney was soon transferred to Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, where in September 1959 he became a member of the Space Task Group, which was the body given responsibility for the creation of NASA's manned space program. Aged twenty-one, he was the youngest of the forty-five members of the group. His first assignment was with the Control Center Simulation Group, which planned the simulations used to train both flight controllers and astronauts for the as-yet unknown experience of manned spaceflight.|$|E
500|$|Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less {{than a month}} later, on 20 June 1837, William IV {{died at the age}} of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. In {{her diary}} she wrote, [...] "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my {{dressing}} gown) and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I am Queen." [...] Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.|$|E
500|$|Joan Ganz {{was born}} on November 30, 1929 in Phoenix, Arizona, to Sylvan Ganz, a banker, and Pauline (née Reddon), a homemaker. Her father was a native Phoenician {{who was born in}} the U.S. so that his mother could receive medical care after his birth. [...] Her {{grandfather}} Emil Ganz was a tailor from Walldorf, Thuringia [...] in Germany, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1858 and was president of the First National Bank of Arizona and mayor of Phoenix for three terms. [...] Joan Ganz was the youngest of three siblings. [...] She described her childhood as [...] "upper middle class, country club atmosphere" [...] and stated, [...] "I was raised in the most conventional way, raised to be a housewife and a mother, to work an interesting job when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> college, and to marry at the appropriate age, which would have been twenty-five". Her father was Jewish and her mother was Catholic.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1954, Doll {{was traded}} to the Los Angeles Rams in a three-team, multi-player deal that also sent Night Train Lane to the Chicago Cardinals. [...] At the time of the trade, Doll, who lived at the time in San Gabriel, California, told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "This is good news. [...] I've wanted to play for the Rams since <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> school." [...] Doll {{concluded}} his playing career with the Rams and had five interceptions in 1954.

2500|$|The lyrics on Tormented are {{influenced}} by Staind frontman Aaron Lewis' life. Lewis spoke about it, saying: [...] "My life, {{up to a point}} was shit. But I've come a long way. I grew up in a trailer park in Vermont. That was the shit <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me in Tormented and Dysfunction, and tailing into Break the Cycle. But the title, Break the Cycle, says it all." [...] AllMusic described Tormented as [...] "grittier and more raw than" [...] Staind's [...] "subsequent releases". The album's music has been compared to that of heavy metal band Pantera, featuring singing and screaming. Despite being an intense heavy metal record, Tormented features a rather soft song, [...] "Four Walls".|$|E

2500|$|Roach {{was part}} of the West Indies squad which toured Sri Lanka in November and December 2010. Senior bowlers Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards were absent, leaving Roach {{as the head of the}} attack. In the lead up, he {{attempted}} to develop his use of swing to cope with Sri Lankan pitches traditionally unhelpful to fast bowlers. Roach remarked [...] "I still have a little bit of work to do on my lengths, but I'm satisfied with what <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the camp". Roach's performance in the Tests, finishing as the West Indies lead wicket-taker with 10wickets at an average of 24.50 for which he was named Man of the Series, was highlighted by Sammy, the team's captain, as one of the best performances of the drawn series.|$|E
2500|$|Heston {{turned down}} the lead {{opposite}} Marilyn Monroe in Let's Make Love to appear in Benn W. Levy's play The Tumbler, directed by Laurence Olivier. Called a [...] "harrowingly pretentious verse drama" [...] by Time, the production went through a troubled out-of-town tryout period in Boston and closed after five performances on Broadway in February 1960. Heston, a great admirer of Olivier the actor, took on the play {{to work with him}} as a director. After the play flopped, Heston told columnist Joe Hyams, [...] "I feel I am the only one who came out with a profit.... <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it precisely what I went in for – a chance to work with Olivier. I learned from him in six weeks things I never would have learned otherwise. I think I've ended up a better actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just {{before the}} derailment, {{witnesses}} recalled observing the train {{passing through the}} crossing at an excessive speed with no locomotive lights, [...] "infernal" [...] noise and sparks being emitted from the wheels. Gilles Fluet, a Musi-Café patron who was leaving the site just before the derailment, said the wheels were smoking lots of white smoke. The runaway train passed [...] behind him moving at highway speed. Travelling with no signals, the train jumped the track, sending a river of burning oil into the lake. [...] "It was moving at a hellish speed ... no lights, no signals, nothing at all. There was no warning. It was a black blob {{that came out of}} nowhere. I realized they were oil tankers {{and they were going to}} blow up, so I yelled that to my friends and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> there. If we had stayed where we were, we would have been roasted." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Chicago GoPride, Lockhart {{said he had}} consented to doing bareback as he was falsely informed he was being 'protected' by the producer by the method of pairing boys. He went on to say, then age 21, [...] "Fortunately, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that alive and HIV negative! I am still negative today." [...] In the interview he also warned other young gay men against unprotected sex. He stated, [...] "there are no guarantees, even with testing" [...] and reiterated that barebacking was risky and stated [...] "the message it sends is not one I {{want to be a}} part of anymore!" [...] During the interview he stated [...] "I would like to stand up for young men who are/were put in similar, compromising positions as I was at Cobra Video. I want to take a stand for HIV awareness." [...] He has been a vocal advocate of safe sex and has remained critical of the pornographic industry for its continued release of bareback pornography, which he says sends out the wrong message to young gay men.|$|E
2500|$|Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe fame played drums on [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore". Due {{to various}} {{personal}} and legal struggles, Lee {{was living in}} the studio for a time during the recording of the album. Humphrey was a good friend of Lee's, and had previously worked with his band prior to the production of Hellbilly Deluxe. Zombie later asked Lee to appear on the album, with Lee agreeing to do so. On the collaboration, Lee stated [...] "I went to his house after <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> jail to stay for a while, and I think I was there about a day or two and they were working on the record downstairs and Scott and Rob were like, 'Dude, Tommy’s upstairs, we should ask him to play.' And they asked me to play and I was like, 'I would love to play right now. I could really use ... you know, just kind of check out, really do some music' and I ended up playing like four tracks or so on the record." [...] Lee is credited as the drummer for [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore". [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] was originally referred to as [...] "Creature Core" [...] prior to the release of the album.
