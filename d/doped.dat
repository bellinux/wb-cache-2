40|$|Objectives: This {{preliminary}} study examined whether implicit <b>doping</b> attitude, explicit <b>doping</b> attitude, or both, predicted athletes’ vigilance towards unintentional <b>doping.</b> Design: A cross-sectional correlational design. Methods: Australian athletes (N = 143; Mage = 18. 13, SD = 4. 63) completed measures of implicit <b>doping</b> attitude (brief single-category implicit association test), explicit <b>doping</b> attitude (Performance Enhancement Attitude Scale), avoidance of unintentional <b>doping</b> (Self-Reported Treatment Adherence Scale), and behavioural vigilance task of unintentional <b>doping</b> (reading {{the ingredients of}} an unfamiliar food product). Results: Positive implicit <b>doping</b> attitude and explicit <b>doping</b> attitude were negatively related to athletes’ likelihood of reading the ingredients table of an unfamiliar food product, and positively related to athletes’ vigilance toward unintentional <b>doping.</b> Neither attitude measures predicted avoidance of unintentional <b>doping.</b> Overall, the magnitude of associations by implicit <b>doping</b> attitude appeared to be stronger than that of explicit <b>doping</b> attitude. Conclusions: Athletes with positive implicit and explicit <b>doping</b> attitudes {{were less likely to}} read the ingredients table of an unknown food product, but {{were more likely to be}} aware of the possible presence of banned substances in a certain food product. Implicit <b>doping</b> attitude appeared to explain athletes’ behavioural response to the avoidance of unintentional <b>doping</b> beyond variance explained by explicit <b>doping</b> attitude...|$|R

40|$|Evidence associating <b>doping</b> {{behavior}} with moral disengagement (MD) has accumulated over recent years. However, to date, research examining links between MD and <b>doping</b> has not considered key theoretically grounded influences and outcomes of MD. As such, {{there is a}} need for quantitative research in relevant populations that purposefully examines the explanatory pathways through which MD is thought to operate. Toward this end, the current study examined a conceptually grounded model of <b>doping</b> behavior that incorporated empathy, <b>doping</b> self-regulatory efficacy (SRE), <b>doping</b> MD, anticipated guilt and self-reported doping/doping susceptibility. Participants were specifically recruited to represent four key physical-activity contexts and consisted of team- (n = 195) and individual- (n = 169) sport athletes and hardcore- (n = 125) and corporate- (n = 121) gym exercisers representing both genders (nmale = 371; nfemale = 239); self-reported lifetime prevalence of <b>doping</b> across the sample was 13. 6 %. Each participant completed questionnaires assessing the aforementioned variables. Structural equation modeling indicated strong support for all study hypotheses. Specifically, we established: (a) empathy and <b>doping</b> SRE negatively predicted reported doping; (b) the predictive effects of empathy and <b>doping</b> SRE on reported <b>doping</b> were mediated by <b>doping</b> MD and anticipated guilt; (c) <b>doping</b> MD positively predicted reported doping; (d) the predictive effects of <b>doping</b> MD on reported <b>doping</b> were partially mediated by anticipated guilt. Substituting self-reported <b>doping</b> for <b>doping</b> susceptibility, multisample analyses then demonstrated these predictive effects were largely invariant between males and females and across the four physical-activity contexts represented. These findings extend current knowledge on a number of levels, and in doing so aid our understanding of key psychosocial processes that may govern <b>doping</b> behavior across key physical-activity contexts...|$|R

30|$|Carrier <b>doping</b> is {{a common}} {{approach}} to tailoring the electronic properties of semiconductor materials. Carrier <b>doping</b> can also dramatically alter the electrical properties of graphene. Although several techniques aimed at the carrier <b>doping</b> of graphene have been demonstrated, including boron- or nitrogen-substitutional <b>doping</b> [15, 16], the deposition of alkali metal atoms [17], and the adsorption of gaseous NO 2 [18], these <b>doping</b> methods have never achieved significant <b>doping</b> effects due to defect formation, inhomogeneous deposition, and the instability of gaseous species, respectively. Molecular <b>doping,</b> such as halide [19, 20] or polymer [21, 22], is a promising technique for pristine graphene films. However, effective <b>doping</b> method for chemically derived graphene has never been demonstrated. Tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) is well known as a powerful electron acceptor, {{and is expected to}} favor electron transfer from graphene into TCNQ molecules, thereby leading to p-type <b>doping</b> of graphene [23, 24].

25|$|A {{laser diode}} is {{electrically}} a PIN diode. The active {{region of the}} laser diode is in the intrinsic (I) region, and the carriers (electrons and holes) are pumped into that region from the N and P regions respectively. While initial diode laser research was conducted on simple P-N diodes, all modern lasers use the double-hetero-structure implementation, where the carriers and the photons are confined {{in order to maximize}} their chances for recombination and light generation. Unlike a regular diode, the goal for a laser diode is to recombine all carriers in the I region, and produce light. Thus, laser diodes are fabricated using direct band-gap semiconductors. The laser diode epitaxial structure is grown using one of the crystal growth techniques, usually starting from an N <b>doped</b> substrate, and growing the I <b>doped</b> active layer, followed by the P <b>doped</b> cladding, and a contact layer.

Previously validated self-administered questionnaires aimed at evidencing sport factors, doping-related factors, knowledge on sport nutrition and <b>doping,</b> and attitudes to performance enhancement were used. The results indicated a higher <b>doping</b> likelihood in male athletes, with a significant gender difference for basketball and handball. In males, a higher <b>doping</b> likelihood is found for athletes who had achieved better results at junior-age level, those who regularly consume dietary supplements, and who perceive their sport as being contaminated by <b>doping.</b> A higher sport achievement at senior-age level is protective against potential <b>doping</b> behaviour in males.
