5|$|The new tracks from King's Cross to Farringdon {{were first}} {{used by a}} GNR freight train on 27 January 1868. The Midland Railway {{junction}} opened on 13 July 1868 when services ran into Moorgate Street before its St Pancras terminus had opened. The line left the main line at St Paul's Road Junction, entering a <b>double-track</b> tunnel and joining the Widened Lines at Midland Junction.|$|E
5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new <b>double-track</b> light rail tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna. This would allow the light rail line to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to the city center for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E
5|$|Bull's station {{building}} {{burned down}} in 1914 {{and was replaced}} two year later by a new. By then {{it was decided that}} the line past Lysaker would be upgraded and Lysaker became the first of many stations on the line to be designed as an elevated station. The tracks were thereby placed elevated with an island platform with the station on the side, as the first station in Norway designed for <b>double-track</b> operation. The new station was designed in Baroque Revival by Adalbert Kielland at NSB Arkitektkontor. One year later the wooden bridge over Lysakerelven was replaced by a stone bridge.|$|E
50|$|<b>Double-tracking</b> of {{the line}} {{commenced}} in 1924, reaching Kawachinagano in 1938. The line voltage was increased to 1,500 V DC in 1973, and the following year, <b>double-tracking</b> reached Mikkaichicho, and Hashimoto in 1995.|$|R
50|$|The main {{trunk of}} the West Coast Railway Line is double-tracked and {{electrified}} from Padang Besar to Gemas. This followed the completion of both the Ipoh-Padang Besar <b>Double-Tracking</b> and Electrification Project, and the Seremban-Gemas <b>Double-Tracking</b> and Electrification Project in 2014.|$|R

Following the completion of <b>double-tracking</b> work on the Sanin Main Line (Sagano Line) between Kyoto and Sonobe in March 2010, JR West and Kyoto Prefecture began conferring with regards to <b>double-tracking</b> of the Nara Line.|$|R
5|$|Construction {{began in}} early 1847, but {{relationships}} between the LB and SER broke down quickly. The SER were unhappy about the proposed line from Rye to Hastings via , which they viewed as too expensive compared to the alternative route via Whatlington. The LB objected to this route as it was longer, and consequently the SER dropped their proposals in November 1847. The land over Romney Marsh was unstable, and test trains were seen to tip over in heavy winds. The line was originally proposed to be single-track, though this was changed to <b>double-track</b> in June 1850.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on August 9, 1st Cavalry Division {{learned of}} the North Korean crossing. North Korean {{infantry}} had gathered on Hill 268, also known as Triangulation Hill, which was 3 miles (4.8km) southeast of Waegwan and 10 miles (16km) northwest of Taegu. The hill was important for its proximity to lines of communication, as the main Korean north-south highway and the main <b>double-track</b> Seoul-Pusan railroad skirted its base. 1st Cavalry Division counterattacked the North Korean gathering to force them back across the river, but their initial assault was repelled. The next morning, August 10, air strikes and artillery barrages rocked Hill 268, devastating the North Koreans, who withdrew back behind the river.|$|E
5|$|Lysaker {{was one of}} two {{original}} Drammen Line {{station in}} Bærum, opening on 7 October 1872. The original station building, designed by Georg Andreas Bull, burned down in 1914 and was replaced by a new station Adalbert Kielland. In the following years the elevated and <b>double-track</b> layout was introduced. This station arrangement was demolished in 1987 {{to make way for a}} station designed by Arne Henriksen. Traditionally only served by commuter trains, the station was branded as Lysaker/Fornebu from 1990 to 2000 because of its vicinity to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The station was rebuilt again from 2006 to 2009 in which it was expanded from two to four tracks. It became connected to the Asker Line in 2011.|$|E

5|$|In 1967 {{construction}} again commenced on {{yet another}} variation on Bradfield's design. This involved the earlier route used towards Bondi Junction through Woolloomooloo, then an extension towards Kingsford with five extra stations at Charing Cross, Frenchmans Road, Randwick, University and Kingsford. The New South Wales Government awarded the contract for the civil and structural design to the successful Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. An official Legislative Assembly inquiry in 1976, however, recommended that costs on the project be cut, and the extension to Kingsford, a proposed station at Woollahra, {{and the expansion of}} concourse areas at Bondi Junction and Martin Place stations did not proceed. Nonetheless, it was resolved to fully integrate the railway with the Illawarra line. The Eastern Suburbs Railway opened between Central station and Bondi Junction on 23 June 1979. Initially trains ran as shuttle services between Central and Bondi Junction; it was not until a year later that work was finished to integrate the lines. A <b>double-track</b> junction with the Illawarra Line at Erskineville south of Illawarra Junction, twin single track tunnels connecting to the Eastern Suburbs Railway platforms at Central, a set of underground platforms at Redfern and a turnback tunnel at Martin Place opened to complete the project on 20 July 1980.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{severe damage}} to shipping in Halifax Harbour. A visiting recreational schooner named Larinda was sunk at the wharf beside the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic and a harbour tour ketch Mar was driven ashore in Eastern Passage {{on the opposite}} side of Halifax Harbour. Another harbour tour vessel, the tern schooner Silva, broke from her moorings and caused extensive damage to the Cable Wharf on the Halifax Waterfront. Dozens of smaller yachts were also driven ashore; extensive damage occurred to yacht clubs in the Bedford Basin and Northwest Arm. Dozens of containers were knocked off two container ships at the South End Container Terminal. Wharves on the Halifax and Dartmouth waterfront suffered large amounts of damage and several railcars were washed into the harbour at the Dartmouth railway yard; one of the tracks for the <b>double-track</b> main line was washed out in several places along the Bedford Basin near Millview. Coastal flooding was also reported around Halifax Harbour as a result of the storm surge, although inland flooding was minor as rainfall was not heavy due to Juan's fast forward movement.|$|E

50|$|Being a {{relatively}} new transit service, future development plans for the Sprinter are currently focused on increasing {{the frequency of the}} service to 20 minutes per train departure, from the Sprinter's current 30-minute schedule. An increased schedule will require more <b>double-tracking</b> of the Sprinter rail line as currently only 9.6 miles (44%) of the Sprinter's rail line is double-tracked. The preferred alternative project for more <b>double-tracking</b> on the rail line involves increased <b>double-tracking</b> around Crouch St. station through College Blvd. station, and around Palomar College station through Nordahl Rd. station. It is projected that this project will require six years to reach completion.|$|R

25|$|Most {{crossing}} loops are not {{regarded as}} <b>double-track</b> {{even though they}} consist of multiple tracks. If the crossing loop is long enough to hold several trains, and to allow opposing trains to cross without slowing down or stopping, then that may be regarded as <b>double-track.</b> A more modern British term for such a layout is an extended loop.|$|E
25|$|Until December 1956, trams {{provided}} {{public transport}} along Queen Street, {{and it was}} the only street in New Zealand with grand unions, <b>double-track</b> to <b>double-track</b> junctions, where trams could go to all directions from all directions. These junctions were at the intersections with Customs Street and Wellesley Street. Since the closure of Auckland's tram network, Balaclava Junction on Melbourne's tram network has been the sole grand union left in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E

The {{first phase of the}} rehabilitation was funded via overseas aid from South Korea and that was also the plan for the second phase. Rehabilitation of the stations is being done but the <b>double-tracking</b> is not due to lack of funds.|$|R
