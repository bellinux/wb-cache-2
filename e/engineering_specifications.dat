In many industrial instances product quality depends on a multitude of dependent characteristics and as a consequence, attention on capability indices shifts from univariate domain to multivariate domain. In this paper five different multivariate methodologies are used for measuring and comparing capability of a ceramic table-ware manufacturing process. Based on their multivariate process capability index values and expected rejection rate, the result shows that Castagliola’s index is the best and followed by Chen, Taam, Shahriari and Braun respectively in this case...|$|R
