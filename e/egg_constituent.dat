40|$|As is {{generally}} known, custards have been frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisonings and are regarded {{by some as}} an ideal culture medium. Previous studies showed that high carbohydrate concentrations repressed the growth of competing saprophytic species, allowing the growth of staphylococci in a mixture rather than stimulating {{the growth of the}} staphylococci. In an extension of those studies, the influence of the <b>egg</b> <b>constituent</b> of custard was investigated to determine its role in affecting the growth of pathogenic staphylococci in a competing mixture of psychrotrophic saprophytes. The normal competitive effect of the saprophytes on the growth of staphylococci was very slightly affected by the addition of 25 % whole egg to the growth media. Approximately 9 % egg yolk alone added to the medium resulted in a slight increase in the length of the lag period of the psychrotrophs and a slight {{increase in the number of}} staphylococci which grew. Addition of 25 % whole egg plus 14. 5 % sucrose resulted in repression of saprophyte growth similar to that seen in high sucrose concentrations. Staphylococcal growth was more extensive in the presence of both whole egg and sucrose than in the presence of either ingredient alone. Incorporation of 4 % corn oil in media was effective in repressing growth of the saprophytes at 37 C only. This allowed the staphylococci to dominate the population. At lower temperatures, staphylococci were unable to compete effectively. Buffering media of high carbohydrate content resulted in lengthened lag periods for the psychrotrophs and the appearance of very large staphylococcal populations...|$|E
40|$|Egg yolk {{constitutes}} {{a major source}} of proteins, mine-rals, vitamins and lipids for the developing embryo. The major egg yolk proteins, with the exception of immuno-globulins, are synthesized by the liver of laying hens. Protein synthesis and lipogenesis are highly stimulated in the liver at sexual maturity in hens (15 to 20 fold) to support the incorporation of 0. 75 kg proteins and 1. 5 kg of triglycerides into the yolk over a year of commercial production. The production of estrogen and at a lower magnitude testosterone by the theca of the growing follicle increases 2 to 3 weeks before the production of the first egg and contributes to the development of reproductive organs and the synthesis of <b>egg</b> <b>constituents</b> [1 - 6].

40|$|The {{determination}} of nitrite in homogenised egg {{was taken as}} particularly relevant for highlighting the beneficial aspects of sonoelectrochemical analysis in difficult matrices. The presence of high concentrations of protein and fat serve to foul the electrode and have traditionally prevented direct electrochemical probing of such matrices without recourse to substantial sample pre-treatment. To this end, power ultrasound (20 kHz) in combination with linear sweep techniques has been evaluated {{as a means of}} removing the need for sample manipulation beyond simple homogenisation. The electrochemical detection of nitrite was based on a nitroso-derivatisation reaction with reduction of the latter providing the analytical signal. The application of ultrasound is shown to significantly enhance the electrode response towards nitroso reduction with ultrasonically induced electrode cleaning providing a degree of signal resolution unattainable under silent conditions. The influence of electroactive <b>egg</b> <b>constituents</b> is detailed and a dual mode standard addition technique for negating such interferences is assessed. The reproducibility of the procedure is assessed with detected nitrite levels in egg found to be within MAFF limits. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of supplementation of diets for laying Japanese quail with amylase, phytase and protease alone or in combination. Three-hundred quail were assigned to a completely randomized design consisting of five treatments and six repetitions, with 10 animals per experimental unit. The treatments were: a control diet and diets supplemented with 300 ppm amylase, 300 ppm protease and 500 phytase units (FTU) /kg and the combination of these enzymes. In the diets containing the enzymes, the nutritional requirements of one or more of the following components were reduced: protein, digestible amino acids, energy, calcium and phosphorus, giving priority to the use of enzymes. The evaluations were performed over four periods of 21 days each. Performance (mean egg production, feed intake, mean egg weight, and feed conversion), egg quality (proportion of <b>egg</b> <b>constituents</b> and specific <b>egg</b> weight), and dietary nutrient digestibility (apparent digestibility coefficient of dry matter and crude protein) were evaluated. There was no significant effect of the treatments on the variables analyzed (P> 0. 05), indicating that the enzymes, alone or in combination, have beneficial effects, maintaining performance and egg quality of Japanese quail. </span...|$|R
40|$|Females are {{expected}} to partition resources between offspring in a context-dependent way to maximise total fitness returns from a reproductive attempt. Female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) vary the allocation of yolk androgens and antioxidants among offspring. Importantly, the balance between androgens and antioxidants in yolks {{may be more important}} than their independent absolute amounts in terms of fitness consequences for developing young. Therefore, we tested whether the relative allocation of these two resources in yolks varies according to either the Trivers-Willard, positive or compensatory maternal investment hypothesis. We manipulated male attractiveness using coloured leg bands (red-banded males appear attractive; green-banded males, unattractive) and measured yolk androgens and antioxidants in each egg, egg sex, clutch sex ratio and female condition. While female zebra finches manipulated the balance of androgens and antioxidants within and between clutches in response to mate attractiveness, offspring sex and their own condition, they did not do so in a way that consistently followed any of the hypotheses. Mothers paired with unattractive males allocated a larger antioxidant/androgen ratio to daughters than sons. This pattern was reversed when paired to an attractive male; sons received a larger antioxidant/androgen ratio than daughters. We also found offspring sex ratio decreased with increasing female condition for unattractive males, but not for attractive males. However, without knowing the fitness consequences of the balance of different <b>egg</b> <b>constituents,</b> it is difficult to interpret the patterns consistently in terms of the Trivers-Willard, compensatory and positive investment hypothese...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study the effect of ultra-violet (UV) {{treatment}} alone and in combination with 100 % CO 2 modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) was evaluated both on the survival of naturally occurring bacteria, {{as well as on}} quality parameters of table eggs during 28 days of storage at 21 °C. Table eggs were collected from the conveyor belt after the UV module, and placed on carton trays. A representative number of carton trays were packed in a high barrier multilayer pouch filled with 100 % CO 2. All eggs were stored at 21 °C and analysed at 0, 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of storage. Eggs not treated with UV and not packed were also included. On the eggshells total colony count, total coliforms and faecal coliforms counts, as well as the detection of Salmonella spp. were investigated. Moreover, chemical-functional parameters such as weight loss, albumen pH and Haugh Unit (HU) were evaluated. The total colony count on UV treated table eggs was approximately 1 log 10 CFU/g lower than untreated eggs (2. 27 vs 3. 29 log 10 CFU/g). During storage, CO 2 packed eggs maintained the initial values of HU, whereas the albumen pH decreased up to 1. 5 - 2 points in comparison to unpacked eggs. The UV treatment was effective in reducing the total colony count on the surface of table eggs. MAP showed a great potential in maintaining/enhance the technological properties of <b>egg</b> <b>constituents</b> (higher foam stability of the albumen for meringue preparation) without significantly impacting on the microbial load of table eggs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{strategy}} of relying extensively on stored resources for reproduction has been termed capital breeding {{and is in}} contrast to income breeding, where needs of repro-duction are satisWed by exogenous (dietary) resources. Most species likely fall somewhere between these two extremes, and the position of an organism along this gradi-ent can inXuence several key life-history traits. Common eiders (Somateria mollissima) are the only Xying birds that are still typically considered pure capital breeders, suggest-ing that they depend exclusively on endogenous reserves to form their eggs and incubate. We investigated the annual and seasonal variation in contributions of endogenous and exogenous resources to egg formation in eiders breeding at the East Bay colony in the Canadian Arctic. We collected prey items along with females and their eggs during various stages of breeding and used two complementary analytical approaches: body reserve dynamics and stable isotope [13 C, 15 N] mixing models. Indices of protein reserves remained stable from pre-laying to post-laying stages, while lipid reserves declined signiWcantly during laying. Similarly, stable isotope analyses indicated that (1) exoge-nous nutrients derived from marine invertebrates strongly contributed to the formation of lipid-free <b>egg</b> <b>constituents,</b> and (2) yolk lipids were constituted mostly from endoge-nous lipids. We also found evidence of seasonal variation in the use of body reserves, with early breeders using pro-portionally more exogenous proteins to form each egg than late breeders. Based on these results, we reject the hypothe-sis that eiders are pure capital layers. In these Xying birds, the Wtness costs of a strict capital breeding strategy, such as temporary loss of Xight capability and limitation of clutch and egg size, may outweigh beneWts such as a reduction in egg predation rate...|$|R

40|$|In practice, many {{hatchability}} and chick quality {{problems have}} been related to the control of embryo temperature (ET) during incubation. Within an incubator, set at a constant machine temperature (MT), ET can vary substantially. Embryo temperature {{is the result of}} the balance between heat transfer to and from the embryo and heat production (HP) of the embryo. We investigated which factors theoretically could account for the variation in ET within an incubator. First, the effects egg weight, MT, and oxygen availability on HP of embryos were quantified. Differences in HP could be due only to differences in the amount of energy utilized from the egg or to differences in the efficiency of the conversion of energy in the egg to energy in the chicken, indicated as EYFB. Results of these analyses showed that differences in HP attributable to egg weight or oxygen availability were mainly a result of the amount of energy used from the <b>egg</b> <b>constituents</b> and not of a change in EYFB. However, at a given MT, this variation in HP could account for a maximum increase in ET of only 1. 21 °C, suggesting that other factors played a role because in practice within an incubator, larger differences in ET have been found. The most important factor was probably the difference in air velocity within an incubator, resulting in differences in heat transfer. Because of this variation, ET varied within an incubator and with increasing ET, EYFB decreased, resulting in an even higher HP and consequently ET. We concluded that this theoretical approach could explain the wide variation in ET, and consequently could explain the negative effects of high ET on hatchability and chick quality found in the literature. This indicates that, in both practice and in incubation experiments, it is of great importance to realize that any factor affecting HP or heat transfer influences ET. We strongly suggest that ET (or eggshell temperature) be controlled in any incubation experiment involving hatchability or energy utilization...|$|R
40|$|A {{kinetic study}} was {{conducted}} on the effect of heating in the temperature range of 75 - 110 degreesC on the trypsin inhibition activity of ovomucoid. Heat treatment of isolated ovomucoid resulted in a time-dependent decrease in trypsin inhibition activity that could accurately be described by a first-order kinetic model. The magnitude and the temperature dependence of the rate constants was affected by the pH during heat treatment. The heat stability of ovomucoid was the lowest at pH 7. 6. Heat treatments intended to decrease the trypsin inhibition activity should therefore be carried out as soon as possible after laying, because the ovomucoid was inactivated faster at the pH of fresh egg white (pH 7. 6). The presence of the other <b>egg</b> white <b>constituents</b> decreased the heat stability of ovomucoid compared to that of the model system of ovomucoid in buffer, presumably by the formation of ovomucoid-lysozyme complexes in the former. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{concerning}} {{effects of}} egg size on offspring survival {{is difficult to}} interpret because most studies have not controlled confounding influences such as maternal quality which may mask effects of egg size. Thus, I first estimated variation in egg size and then investigated effects of egg size variation on duckling survival in wild Ruddy Ducks (Oxyura jamaicensis). Over two years, I switched 40 complete broods consisting of 244 individually color-marked ducklings of known egg size, body size, and body condition to nests of unrealted foster mothers, and evaluated survival to 31 days of age. Most mortality occurred within {{the first two weeks}} after hatching. In 1998, survival probability of experimental ducklings declined with advancing hatch date. In 1999, the body condition index of individuals at hatching was positively related to egg size, and ducklings in better condition had enhanced survival probabilities. In addition, survival increased if ducklings were associated with larger broods. These experimental findings suggested that selective mortality of small egg phenotypes in some years could be related to smaller offspring size and possibly reduced energy reserves upon hatching. Therefore, to determine why ducklings from larger eggs could have enhanced survival probabilities, I examined relationships between size, composition, and quality (indexed by lipid and energy content) of eggs and ducklings. Allometric regressions showed that most <b>egg</b> <b>constituents</b> increased in direct proportion (bs = 1. 0) to fresh egg weight, but larger eggs contained proportionately more energy than smaller eggs (b > 1. 0). In addition, dry yolk-free duckling weight increased proportionately less (b < 1. 0) with fresh egg weight, but larger eggs produced ducklings with greater yolk reserves. Yolk sac weight also increased proportionately more with increasing dry yolk-free duckling weight. Although proportional composition of eggs was similar among large and small eggs, larger eggs contained more total energy than did smaller eggs, and therefore produced ducklings with larger yolk stores. Overall, larger ducklings may be better able to survive adverse conditions because they are in better condition, have larger energy reserves that buffer them against starvation, and likely have better thermoregulatory capabilities than smaller individuals...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Endemic {{populations of}} pandora moths (Co/oradia pandora Blake), a {{defoliator}} of western pine forests, proliferated to epidemic levels in central Oregon in 1986 and increased dramatically through 1 994. Golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis Say) consume adult pandora moths, but reject nutritionally valuable eggs from gravid females. Feeding trials with captive S. lateralis {{were conducted to}} identify the mode of <b>egg</b> protection. Chemical <b>constituents</b> of fertilized <b>eggs</b> were separated through a polarity gradient of solvent extractions. Consumption of the resulting hexane, dichloromethane, and water egg fractions, and the extracted egg tissue residue, was evaluated by randomized 2 -choice feeding tests. Consumption of four physically distinct egg fractions (whole eggs, "whole" egg shells, ground egg shells, and egg contents) also was evaluated. These bioassays indicated that C. pandora eggs are not protected chemically, however, the egg shell does inhibit S. lateralis consumption. Egg protection is one mechanism that enables C. pandora to persist within the forest food web. Spermophilus lateralis, a common and often abundant rodent of central Oregon pine forests, is a natural enemy of C. pandora moths and pupae, but not eggs...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} barley and oat β-glucans on {{rheological}} and creaming behaviour of concentrated egg-yolk-stabilized model emulsions were investigated. Four polysaccharide preparations were used, two from each cereal; one sample with high {{and one with}} low molecular weight, i. e. the molecular weights were alike in pairs (110 × 103 and 40 × 103, respectively). In order to elucidate the mechanism of action of β-glucans in emulsions, Tween 20 -stabilized emulsions were also examined. Tween 20 enhances neither the continuous phase viscosity nor the interactions between the droplets, so the changes could be easily attributed to β-glucans. It appeared that the low Mw β-glucan samples stabilize emulsions against creaming by means of network formation in the continuous phase while their high molecular weight counterparts enhance the viscosity of the continuous phase. Comparison of dynamic rheological tests between a reference emulsion without β-glucans and emulsions containing β-glucans showed that the polysaccharides largely affects the viscoelastic behaviour of the emulsion. Ageing of β-glucan-containing emulsions did not affect significantly the viscoelastic properties except for the emulsions containing low Mw β-glucans extracted from oat. Interestingly, all emulsions containing β-glucans creamed approximately the same after 30 days of storage regardless which preparation was used. The <b>egg</b> yolk <b>constituents</b> seemed to play a dominant role on the viscoelastic and the creaming behaviour of the emulsions, i. e. the viscoelastic behaviour was further enhanced and this could not only {{be attributed to the}} presence of the β-glucans but also to the stronger interactions between the oil droplets. Ageing did not affect the viscoelastic properties of β-glucan-containing emulsions while the reference emulsion, prepared only with egg yolk, showed a decrease in the value of storage modulus. The former could be interpreted as a steady consistency of the product during storage independent of the creaming behaviour. The creaming behaviour varied among the samples with the high molecular weight β-glucans from oat showing the highest stabilit...|$|R
40|$|Hen {{eggs are}} an {{important}} and inexpensive source of high-quality proteins in the human diet. Egg, either as a whole or its <b>constituents</b> (<b>egg</b> yolk and white), is a key ingredient in many food products {{by virtue of its}} nutritional value and unique functional properties, such as emulsifying, foaming, and gelling. Nevertheless, egg is also known because of its allergenic potential and, in fact, it is the second most frequent source of allergic reactions, particularly in children. This review deals with the structural or functional properties of egg proteins that make them strong allergens. Their ability to sensitize and/or elicit allergic reactions is linked to their resistance to gastroduodenal digestion, which ultimately allows them to interact with the intestinal mucosa where absorption occurs. The factors that affect protein digestibility, whether increasing it, decreasing it, or inducing a different proteolysis pattern, and their influence on their capacity to induce or trigger an allergic reaction are discussed. Special attention is paid to the effect of the food matrix and the processing practices on the capacity of egg proteins to modulate the immune response.

40|$|Embryonic {{development}} {{rates are}} {{reflected by the}} length of incubation period in birds, and these vary substantially among species within and among geographical regions. The incubation periods are consistently shorter in North America (Arizona study site) than in tropical (Venezuela) and subtropical (Argentina) South America based {{on the study of}} 83 passerine species in 17 clades. Parents, mothers in particular, may influence incubation periods and resulting offspring quality through proximate pathways, while variation in maternal strategies among species can result from selection by adult and offspring mortality. Parents of long-lived species, as is common in the tropics and subtropics, may be under selection to minimize costs to themselves during incubation. Indeed, time spent incubating is often lower in the tropical and subtropical species than the related north temperate species, causing cooler average egg temperatures in the southern regions. Decreased egg temperatures result in longer incubation periods and reflect a cost imposed on offspring by parents because energy cost to the embryo and risk of offspring predation are both increased. Mothers may adjust <b>egg</b> size and <b>constituents</b> as a means to partially offset such costs. For example, reduced androgen concentrations in egg yolks may slow development rates, but may enhance offspring quality through physiological trade-offs that may be particularly beneficial in longer-lived species, as in the tropics and subtropics. We provide initial data to show that yolks of tropical birds contain substantially lower concentrations of growth-promoting androgens than north temperate relatives. Thus, maternal (and parental) effects on embryonic development rates may include contrasting and complementary proximate influences on offspring quality and deserve further field study among species...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} ambient {{temperature}} and the supplementation of methionine {{to a low}} protein diet on egg production, <b>egg</b> quality, blood <b>constituents</b> and nitrogen excretion of laying hens were studied. The objective was to derive an environmental friendly feed formulation for warm climate. Seventy-two 29 -week-old commercial White Leghorn hens of Babcock ISA white strain were used in this trial. The design is a completely randomized design with a 2 x 3 factors arrangement of treatments. Two constant ambient temperatures were 24 +/- 1 degrees C and 34 +/- 1 degrees C with 85 % relative humidity. The three dietary treatments were 170 g kg(- 1) crude protein, 140 g kg(- 1) crude protein and 140 g kg-l crude protein supplemented with methionine 1. 4 g k(- 1). Hens were allotted into six groups according to egg production and body weight. Birds were raised in individual wire cages for the experimental feeding period of five weeks. At {{the end of the}} feeding trial, one replicate of laying hens (four birds) from each treatment were selected for a four-day metabolic study for the daily collection of the excreta. The blood samples were withdrawn from the wing vein for analysis of hematocrit, blood glucose, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus and uric acid. Experimental results indicate that increases in ambient temperature significantly depress feed intake, egg production, egg weight and live weight of laying hens. High ambient temperature also caused inferior egg quality, including shell weight, shell thickness, shell breaking strength and specific gravity. Ambient temperature also changes the egg components with heavier egg albumin and yolk in the low-temperature group. Increasing ambient temperature also caused an increase in pH value in the plasma. This increase revealed a trend of depressed glucose (P< 0. 05) in the plasma of the laying hens. The dietary treatments, however, did not significantly influence feed intakes. Except egg weight, laying hens that were fed with the low protein (140 g kg(- 1)) with methionine supplemented diet produced similar numbers of egg and feed conversion as the layers fed with the high protein diet. The low protein with methionine supplemented diet produced significantly lighter eggs than the high dietary protein diet under the high ambient temperature, but produced heavier egg under the low ambient temperature. The concentration of uric acid in the plasma and nitrogen in the excreta of the high protein group was significantly higher than the other two low protein dietary groups (P< 0. 05).
