5|$|The sitter is unknown, {{although}} some art historians have speculated on her identity. On {{the grounds of}} similarity of facial features, writer Wilhelm Stein suggested in the early 20th century {{that she might be}} Marie de Valengin, the illegitimate daughter of Philip the Good of Burgundy. However, this is a contentious assertion and not widely held. Because <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> shown as resting on the painting's lower frame, art historians generally accept that this was an independent portrait, rather than a devotional work. It is possible that it was intended as a pendant to a picture of the woman's husband, however no other portrait has been suggested as a likely companion.|$|E
5|$|The video {{introduces}} a sober, contemplative side of Madonna, revealing a mature mysticism. It {{begins with the}} camera skimming along a cracked, desiccated desert floor, and within seconds Madonna appears, hovering just above {{the ground in the}} distance. <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> covered with mehndi and an enigmatic symbol on one palm. In the video she slowly gestures and sways her arms toward the sky in the video, desperately pleading to her cold lover cited in the song. At one point Madonna falls, and as she hits the ground, she transforms into a flock of large, dark birds. Later, she transforms into a black dog. Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amid the desert throughout the video. As the song progresses, the sky darkens, and Madonna levitates from the ground. Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid, which runs along the desert floor and appears to be absorbed by the tattooed hands of another Madonna, who is curled up on the crenellated ground. The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna.|$|E
25|$|El Wray is {{detained}} by Sheriff Hague based on past encounters between the two. As the patients mutate, El Wray leaves {{the station and}} arrives at the hospital, attaching a wooden table leg to Cherry's stump. As El Wray and Cherry fight {{their way out of}} the zombie-infested hospital, Dakota escapes in her car, despite accidentally breaking her left wrist as <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> still numb. Meanwhile, Block becomes infected along with others, while Cherry and El Wray take refuge at the Bone Shack.|$|E

60|$|Philippa's head drooped. <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> nervously intertwined.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> clasped {{about his}} neck. He {{disengaged}} himself gently.|$|R
25|$|The {{painting}} depicts complex {{personality and}} devotion to Mary. Her head is gently leaning to her right, {{her eyes are}} half closed, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> crossed in devotion; this reminds {{that she is a}} virgin, humble servant of the Lord, merciful mother and patron of the people. At the same time, her head is surrounded by an aureola with golden rays and her body is usually covered in elaborate gold and silver clothes and crowns; these are the symbols of her divine and majestic role as the Queen of Heaven. The painting also reminds of Tota pulchra es (You are all beautiful), an old Catholic prayer.|$|E
500|$|Precise {{detail is}} not spared in {{descriptions}} of decay and disease, two vivid {{elements in the}} novel. Marneffe, for example, represents [...] His decrepit body {{is a symbol of}} society's weakness at the time, worn away from years of indulgence. The poison which kills Valérie and Crevel is also described in ghastly detail. The doctor Bianchon explains: [...] "Ses dents et ses cheveux tombent, elle a l'aspect des lépreux, elle se fait horreur à elle-même; ses mains, épouvantables à voir, sont enflées et couvertes de pustules verdâtres; les ongles déchaussés restent dans les plaies qu'elle gratte; enfin, toutes les extrémités se détruisent dans la sanie qui les ronge." [...] ("She is losing her hair and teeth, her skin is like a leper's, she is a horror to herself; <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> horrible, covered with greenish pustules, her nails are loose, and the flesh is eaten away by the poisoned humors.") ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{two most}} common objects that Santa Muerte holds in <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> a globe and a scythe. The scythe can symbolize the cutting of {{negative}} energies or influences. As a harvesting tool, a scythe may also symbolize hope and prosperity. Her scythe reflects her origins as the Grim Reapress ("la Parca" [...] of medieval Spain), and can represent {{the moment of}} death, when {{it is said to}} cut a silver thread. The scythe has a long handle, indicating that it can reach anywhere. The globe represents Death's vast power and dominion over the earth, and may be seen as a kind of a tomb to which we all return.|$|E
60|$|She gave {{a little}} sobbing breath. <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> locked together.|$|R
60|$|Honora was {{trembling}} {{from head to}} foot, and <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> cold.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> {{still in}} his, {{and they went}} across the deck together.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Think how full <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are,</b> {{how much}} excited she is,' pleaded Phoebe, {{feeling that this}} was no fair moment for the crisis.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mamma is awake," [...] {{the girl}} said, [...] "but {{she does not}} always {{understand}} what I say; sometimes I cannot understand her, and <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> as hot as fire. I am glad Dinah is here." ...|$|E
6000|$|But <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> {{still the}} woman, the large, strong [...] hands Heavier than mine, yet like leverets caught in [...] steel When I hold them; my still soul understands Their dumb {{confession}} of what her sort must feel.|$|E
60|$|She {{stopped a}} minute. Stopped {{speaking}} only; <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> still in motion.|$|R
60|$|Cecilia murmured something. <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> moving nervously; {{she looked}} ill at ease.|$|R
60|$|This time, {{with the}} hoy, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> closed and his were open.|$|R
60|$|Oh! George Sand. How {{magnificent}} that eighteenth volume is; I {{mean the}} volume which concludes with the views upon the sexes! After all, and through all, if <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> ever so defiled, that {{woman has a}} clean soul.|$|E
6000|$|Our {{challenge}} was almost instantly caught up. While thus double-safeguarding the psychic, the cone, which was {{resting on the}} table a full yard away, rose with a sharp, metallic, scraping sound, and remained {{in the air for}} fully half a minute, during which I called out, sharply: [...] "We are absolutely controlling the psychic; <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> motionless; Mrs. Fowler, be sure you are holding both of Frank's hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|At th's ye Bachelor walked away, And {{talked to}} himself of th' Lass so gay-- [...] "Her hair is very decidedly red; And her eyes have {{somewhat}} of a cast in her head; And her feet are large, and <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> coarse; And, without I'm mistaken, her voice is hoarse. 'Tis a bargain of wh'ch I am very well rid; I am glad, on ye whole, I escaped as I did." ...|$|E
60|$|He paused, {{and looked}} at <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> {{beginning}} to tremble in his.|$|R
50|$|A relic, said to <b>be</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>is</b> {{housed in}} the Bar Convent in York.|$|R
60|$|She stood {{pale and}} rigid, but once more <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> lifted towards <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
60|$|He {{stands in}} the door of the carriage, which he holds wide open, and through a mist of tears which he no longer tries to {{suppress}} he sees Elsa standing there, quite still--a small image of beauty and of sorrow. The sun glints upon her hair, it shines and sparkles like living gold; <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> clasped tightly together, and with her full, many-hued petticoats round her slim waist and tiny red-shod feet she looks like a flower.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{always knew}} {{that you were a}} villain, Ruggiero Mocenigo," [...] Francis said quietly, [...] "although I hardly thought that a man who had once the honour of being a noble of Venice, would sink to become a pirate and renegade. You may carry Maria Polani off, but you will never succeed through her in obtaining a portion of her father's fortune, for I know that, the first moment <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> free, she will stab herself to the heart, rather than remain in the power of such a wretch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [On this WANDA is sitting, {{her knees}} drawn up under her, staring [...] at the embers. She has on only her nightgown and a wrapper over [...] it; {{her bare feet}} are thrust into slippers. <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> [...] crossed and pressed over her breast. She starts and looks up, [...] listening. Her eyes are candid and startled, her face {{alabaster}} [...] pale, and its pale brown hair, short and square-cut, curls [...] towards her bare neck. The startled dark eyes and the faint [...] rose of her lips are like colour-staining on a white mask.] ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> plashing in {{the little}} waterfall, {{and her eyes were}} bent the same way.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> already {{upon the}} curtains. She turned around, an {{impatient}} frown upon her face.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Seymour Fentolin {{seemed to}} be {{trembling}} a little. <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> crossed upon <b>her</b> bosom.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is not well," [...] {{his wife}} replied, [...] "I {{went to her}} room just now and found {{that she was still}} a-bed. She said that she had a bad headache, and I fear that she {{is going to have a}} fever, for her face is pale and her eyes red and swollen, just as if she had been well-nigh crying them out of her head; <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> hot and her pulse fast. Directly I have had breakfast I shall make her some {{camomile}} tea, and if that does not do her good I shall send for the doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{reader can}} see the picture in any drawing-room; it can be easily recognized: the Virgin (the only young and really {{beautiful}} Virgin that was ever painted {{by one of the}} old masters, some of us think,) stands in the crescent of the new moon, with a multitude of cherubs hovering about her, and more coming; <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> crossed upon her breast, and upon her uplifted countenance falls a glory out of the heavens. The reader may amuse himself, if he chooses, in trying to determine which of these gentlemen read the Virgin's [...] "expression" [...] aright, or if either of them did it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{lose your}} temper, my dear fellow," [...] rejoined Zack; [...] "you will never {{learn to use}} your fists prettily if you do. Here, Patty, the boxing lesson's put off till to-morrow. Take the gloves up-stairs into your master's dressing-room, {{and put them in}} the drawer where his clean shirts are, because they must be kept nice and dry. Shake hands, Mrs. Blyth: it does one good to see you laugh like that, you look so much the better for it. And how is Madonna? I'm afraid she's been sitting before the fire, and trying to spoil her pretty complexion. Why, what's the matter with her? Poor little darling, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> quite cold!" ...|$|E
60|$|With an {{impatient}} gesture she threw down {{the book and}} passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> across <b>her</b> eyes, then seemed astonished to find that <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> wet.|$|R
60|$|He sat quite still, {{although}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> {{tearing at}} his, {{her lips and}} eyes beseeching him.|$|R
60|$|Angela {{stood with}} her back to the fire, looking at him; <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> locked behind <b>her.</b>|$|R
