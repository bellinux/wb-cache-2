60|$|Gentlemen, {{to return}} and conclude, as I shall have {{occasion}} to trouble you again. For this time I have only once again to repeat what I have already said. As I begun with literature, I shall end with it. I would simply say that I believe no true man, with anything to tell, need have the least misgiving, either for himself or his message, before {{a large number of}} hearers--always supposing that he be not afflicted with the coxcombical idea of writing down to the popular intelligence, instead of writing the popular intelligence up to himself, if, perchance, he be above it;--and, provided always that he deliver himself plainly of what is in him, which seems to be no unreasonable stipulation, it being supposed that he has some <b>dim</b> <b>design</b> of making himself understood. On behalf of that literature to which you have done so much honour, I beg to thank you most cordially, and on my own behalf, for the most flattering reception you have given to one whose claim is, that he has the distinction of making it his profession.|$|E
40|$|Sensor {{networks}} are an emerging class of systems with significant potential. Recent work [14] {{has proposed a}} distributed data structure called DIM for efficient support of multi-dimensional range queries in sensor networks. The original <b>DIM</b> <b>design</b> works well with uniform data distributions. However, real world data distributions are often skewed. Skewed data distributions can result in storage and traffic hotspots in the original <b>DIM</b> <b>design.</b> In this paper, we present a novel distributed algorithm that alleviates hotspots in DIM caused by skewed data distributions. Our technique adjusts DIM’s locality-preserving hash functions as the overall data distribution changes significantly, a feature that is crucial to a distributed data structure like DIM. We describe a distributed algorithm for adjusting DIM’s locality-preserving hash functions that trade off some locality for a more even data distribution, and so a more even energy consumption, among nodes. We show, using extensive simulations, that hotspots can be reduced {{by a factor of}} 4 or more with our scheme, with little overhead incurred for data migration and no penalty placed on overall energy consumption and average query costs. Finally, we show preliminary results based on a real implementation of our mechanism on the Berkeley motes. 1...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of digital}} imagery is ever {{increasing}} for resource applications due to enabling technology to integrate digital imagery with other land related digital {{data in a}} digital mapping environment or in a Geographic Information System (GIS). To support increasing demand for digital imagery, the Base Mapping and Geomatic Services Branch (BMGS) of the British Columbia Ministry of Sustainable Resource Management (MSRM), Canada initiated the Digital Image Management (DIM) program. The purpose of this program is {{to establish and maintain}} a semi-automated interoperable computer-based system to support the acquisition, management, discovery and web-based distribution of geographic digital imagery for the province of British Columbia, Canada. DIM will address the data management issues related to the capture and operations of a very large volume of geo-referenced raster based imagery and digital mapping products including but not limited to scanned aerial photos, orthophotos, satellite imagery, canned stereo models and DEM. DIM will establish a corporate, universal data access facility, commonly known as the “image discovery system”, allowing all BC Government offices in Victoria, Regions and public users across Canada to access the orthophotos and land related digital products through Internet. The <b>DIM</b> <b>design</b> objective is to operate on the Internet using standard browser technology, is interoperable, utilizes standard computing hardware, is extensible, distributed, open and OGC and ISO compliant. The system provides access to the BC Government geo-referenced digital image data holdings from air-borne to space-borne data.

Aiming at the defects of the current traditional lighting system about manual operation, complex wiring and so on which can't {{meet the requirements of}} the environmental sampling, linear <b>dimming,</b> the <b>design</b> of lighting control system of LED based on ZigBee wireless sensor network technology was presented. CC 2530 chip was chosen and Mesh topology structure of ZigBee 2007 /PRO wireless sensor network was used by the system to acquire real- time environment parameters in lighting scene, such as illumination, moving target, temperature, LED state and so on. With the change of environmental parameters and the preset lighting mode, the system can automatically make quick response and realize PWM linear non-polar dimming. The LED lighting control system was real-timely monitored and managed by the PC host computer based on the platform to overcome the defects of traditional lighting inefficient management and staff wastage. The results indicate that the system achieves the design goal of the real-time acquisition of environment parameters by sensor nodes, precise control by ZigBee remote control and centralized management by PC and the experimental data is ideal.

40|$|Performed for the University of Michigan Industry Affiliation Program for Human Factors in Transportation SafetyIncludes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 12) "February 2003. "In {{a survey}} conducted over 34 years ago, Hare and Hemion (1968) found that United States drivers underuse their high beams in circumstances in which their use is recommended. High-beam use was also found to be inversely related to traffic density. Since that time, changes in beam pattern <b>design,</b> <b>dimming</b> controls, and perhaps driver awareness of the hazards of limited visibility may have sufficiently altered the situation to warrant a follow-up investigation. A survey of high-beam headlamp use was conducted on three unlit local roadways in the Ann Arbor area. Observers judged whether vehicles that were clear of both oncoming and preceding traffic had their high or low beams turned on. Illuminance measures at approximate beam pattern locations were also recorded to support beam judgments. In addition, traffic density was estimated over 15 -minute intervals so {{that the relationship between}} beam use and traffic density could be examined.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Industrial & Manufacturing Systems EngineeringMalgorzata J. RysBefore year 2012 the US States must {{implement}} {{and continue}} using an assessment or management method to maintain traffic signs’ retro-reflectivity {{at or above}} the minimum levels adopted by FHWA. Overhead guide signs are a particular problem because past research has shown that with available sheeting types, external illumination may still be necessary. Newer sheeting types and more energy efficient and cost-effective lighting systems are currently available. Over the next several years there is potential for savings {{of tens of thousands of}} dollars if the states don’t have to use external illumination for their overhead guide signs, or, if more energy efficient, low cost lighting systems are used when necessary. A detailed literature review was conducted on minimum retro-reflectivity values for overhead guide signs, the legibility distance under reduced sign luminance and the lighting systems available for external illumination. There is no agreement found in the previous research studies as to what is the optimum or minimum luminance of the guide signs. In addition, a survey was sent to all state DOTs. This survey was focused on finding states’ policies regarding the use of sheeting type and external illumination requirement, and methods and lighting systems for maintaining minimum values for overhead guide sign luminance. The total response rate was 56 % (28 out of 50 state DOTs responded). Out of 28 respondents 19 said that they have usage policy for the type of sheeting material used for overhead guide signs and 18 of them provided details about their policy. An equipment to control the illumination levels from vehicle headlamps was built and pilot tests were conducted in the laboratory. A pulse-with-modulation <b>dimming</b> circuit <b>designed</b> around the Atmel ARM-based microcontroller board and power MOSFETs was used to control the brightness of the headlights for the high- and low-beams. Field tests were conducted in the later stages during nighttime to evaluate three different types of sheeting materials using 10 human subjects from age group 18 - 34. The materials DG 3 and Type IV were found to perform better than Type I material for nighttime visibility but they were not significantly different from each other...|$|R

40|$|The {{stratum corneum}} SC is the {{outermost}} {{layer of the}} skin and is composed of a multilayered assembly of mostly ceramids Cer, free fatty acids, cholesterol Chol, and cholesterol sulfate Chol S. Because of the tight packing of these lipids, the SC features unique barrier properties defending the skin from environmental influences. Under pathological conditions, where the skin barrier function is compromised, topical application of molecules that rigidify the SC {{may lead to a}} restored barrier function. To this end, molecules are required that incorporate into the SC and bring back the original rigidity of the skin barrier. Here, we investigated the influence of a novel dimeric ceramide <b>dim</b> Cer molecule <b>designed</b> to feature a long, rigid hydrocarbon chain ideally suited to forming an orthorhombic lipid phase. The influence of this molecules on the thermotropic phase behavior of a SC mixture consisting of Cer[AP 18] 55 wt, cholesterol Chol, 25 wt, steric acid SA, 15 wt, and cholesterol sulfate Chol S, 5 wt was studied using a combination of neutron diffraction and 2 H NMR spectroscopy. These methods provide detailed insights into the packing properties of the lipids in the SC model mixture. Dim Cer remains in an all trans state of the membrane spanning lipid chain at all investigated temperatures, but the influence on the phase behavior of the other lipids in the mixture is marginal. Biophysical experiments are complemented by permeability measurements in model membranes and human skin. The latter, however, indicates that dim Cer only partially provides the desired effect on membrane permeability, necessitating further optimization of its structure for medical application...|$|R
6000|$|Of what, at {{the same}} time, in those years, were the great rooms of the Louvre almost equally, above and below, not the scene, {{from the moment they}} so wrought, stage by stage, upon our perceptions?--literally on almost all of these, in one way and another; quite in such a manner, I more and more see, as to have been educative, formative, fertilising, in a degree which no other [...] "intellectual experience" [...] our youth was to know could pretend, as a comprehensive, conducive thing, to rival. The sharp and strange, the quite heart-shaking little {{prevision}} had come to me, for myself, I make out, on the occasion of our very first visit of all, my brother's and mine, under conduct of the good Jean Nadali, before-mentioned, trustfully deputed by our parents, in the Rue de la Paix, on the morrow of our first arrival in Paris (July 1855) and while they were otherwise concerned. I hang again, appalled but uplifted, on brave Nadali's arm--his professional acquaintance with the splendours about us added for me on the spot to the charm of his [...] "European" [...] character: I cling to him while I gape at Géricault's Radeau de la Méduse, the sensation, for splendour and terror of interest, of that juncture to me, and ever afterwards to be associated, along with two or three other more or less contemporary products, Guérin's Burial of Atala, Prudhon's Cupid and Psyche, David's helmetted Romanisms, Madame Vigée-Lebrun's [...] "ravishing" [...] portrait of herself and her little girl, with how can I say what foretaste (as determined by that instant as if the hour had struck from a clock) of all the fun, confusedly speaking, that one was going to have, and the kind of life, always of the queer so-called inward sort, tremendously [...] "sporting" [...] in its way--though that description didn't then wait upon it, that one was going to lead. It came of itself, this almost awful apprehension in all the presences, under our courier's protection and in my brother's company--it came just there and so; there was alarm in it somehow as well as bliss. The bliss in fact I think scarce disengaged itself at all, but only the sense of a freedom of contact and appreciation really too big for one, and leaving such a mark on the very place, the pictures, the frames themselves, the figures within them, the particular parts and features of each, the look of the rich light, the smell of the massively enclosed air, that I have never since renewed the old exposure without renewing again the old emotion and taking up the small scared consciousness. That, with so many of the conditions repeated, is the charm--to feel afresh the beginning of so much that was to be. The beginning in short was with Géricault and David, but it went on and on and slowly spread; so that one's stretched, one's even strained, perceptions, one's discoveries and extensions piece by piece, come back, on the great premises, almost as so many explorations of the house of life, so many circlings and hoverings round the image of the world. I have dim reminiscences of permitted independent visits, uncorrectedly juvenile though I might still be, during which the house of life and the palace of art became so mixed and interchangeable--the Louvre being, under a general description, the most peopled of all scenes not less than the most hushed of all temples--that an excursion to look at pictures would have but half expressed my afternoon. I had looked at pictures, looked and looked again, at the vast Veronese, at Murillo's moon-borne Madonna, at Leonardo's almost unholy dame with the folded hands, treasures of the Salon Carré as that display was then composed; but I had also looked at France and looked at Europe, looked even at America as Europe itself might be conceived so to look, looked at history, as a still-felt past and a complacently personal future, at society, manners, types, characters, possibilities and prodigies and mysteries of fifty sorts; and all in the light of being splendidly [...] "on my own," [...] as I supposed it, though we hadn't then that perfection of slang, and of (in especial) going and coming along that interminable and incomparable Seine-side front of the Palace against which young sensibility felt itself almost rub, for endearment and consecration, as a cat invokes the friction of a protective piece of furniture. Such were at any rate some of the vague processes--I see for how utterly vague they must show--of picking up an education; and I was, in spite of the vagueness, so far from agreeing with my brother afterwards that we didn't pick one up and that that never is done, in any sense not negligible, and also that an education might, or should, in particular, have picked us up, and yet didn't--I was so far dissentient, I say, that I think I quite came to glorify such passages and see them as part of an order really fortunate. If we had been little asses, I seem to have reasoned, a higher intention driving us wouldn't have made us less so--to any point worth mentioning; and as we extracted such impressions, to put it at the worst, from redemptive accidents (to call Louvres and Luxembourgs nothing better) why we weren't little asses, but something wholly other: which appeared all I needed to contend for. Above all it would have been stupid and ignoble, an attested and lasting dishonour, not, with our chance, to have followed our straggling clues, as many as we could and disengaging as we happily did, I felt, the gold and the silver ones, whatever the others might have been--not to have followed them and not to have arrived by them, so far as we were to arrive. Instinctively, for any <b>dim</b> <b>designs</b> we might have nourished, we picked out the silver and the gold, attenuated threads though they must have been, and I positively feel that there were more of these, far more, casually interwoven, than will reward any present patience for my unravelling of the too fine tissue.|$|R
40|$|Dairy Research, 2006 {{is known}} as Dairy Day, 2006 A project to {{evaluate}} the degree of heat stress in individual dairies {{was carried out in}} the summer of 2005. The object of this project was to develop a method to evaluate or audit how effective an individual dairy is in manag-ing heat stress. Approximately 45 herds in 20 different states were audited for the degree of heat stress cows experienced during a 72 -hr period. Dairies were selected based on geog-raphy, climate, and facility design. Lactating cows 40 to 100 days in milk (DIM) and dry cows within 30 days of calving were evalu-ated. Vaginal temperatures of 8 cows located in the same group were collected every 5 min by using data loggers (HOBO U 12 ®) attached to a vaginally placed insert (blank CIDR®). Ambient climatic data were collected on the project dairies by using logging devices that collected temperature and relative humidity at 5 -min intervals. Census data were collected at each dairy, and included pen sizes, milking frequency, milking times, average milk pro-duction, <b>DIM,</b> parity, holding-pen <b>design,</b> and timing of cow movements. Data were im-ported into Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) as individual cow files aligned by time. The data for an individual cow were then averaged with all other cows in the pen in hourly incre-ments over a 24 -hr period. Each hour of the 24 -hr period is then a summary of that hour on 3 consecutive days, with 8 devices contribut-ing 12 points per hour per day to the sum-mary. So each hour is a summary of 12 data points × 8 cows × 3 days, or 288 data points per hour. Information was summarized graphically in PowerPoint (Microsoft, Red-mond, WA) and presented to the individual producers, along with recommendations on how to improve their heat-stress abatement practices. The project was not designed as a controlled experiment; therefore, caution is advised in over-interpreting the results. That being said, the project does demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of using intra-vaginal temperature recording to monitor how well a...|$|R
