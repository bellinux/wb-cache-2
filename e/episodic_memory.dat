5|$|<b>Episodic</b> <b>memory</b> is {{the ability}} to {{remember}} the details of specific events. This sort of memory can last for a lifetime. Much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a crucial role: people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia, that is, inability to form new long-lasting episodic memories.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (<b>episodic</b> <b>memory),</b> facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E
50|$|Traditional conceptions also {{assume that}} the self is a {{collection}} of <b>episodic</b> <b>memories,</b> since they are memories of the actions that sculpt our personalities, and therefore closely link personality and the self. According to Klein, in a study of patients who had lost their hippocampi (the part of the brain responsible for memories), patients were able to recollect their knowledge of personality {{even in the absence of}} <b>episodic</b> <b>memories.</b> This points to show that the trait summaries of their personality must have come around subconsciously, inferring that the self can exist even in the absence of <b>episodic</b> <b>memories.</b> Thus, the self cannot be a collection of <b>episodic</b> <b>memories.</b>|$|R
25|$|Researchers do {{not agree}} about how long <b>episodic</b> <b>memories</b> are stored in the hippocampus. Some {{researchers}} believe that <b>episodic</b> <b>memories</b> always rely on the hippocampus. Others believe the hippocampus only stores <b>episodic</b> <b>memories</b> for a short time, after which the memories are consolidated to the neocortex. The latter view is strengthened by recent evidence that neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus may ease the removal of old memories and increase the efficiency of forming new memories.|$|R
25|$|It {{is known}} that autobiographical {{memories}} initially are stored as <b>episodic</b> <b>memories,</b> but it is currently unknown if autobiographical memories {{are the same as}} <b>episodic</b> <b>memories</b> or if the autobiographical memories become converted to semantic memories with time.|$|R
5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal declarative memory, semantic processing, <b>episodic</b> <b>memory,</b> attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E
25|$|In healthy adults, longterm visual <b>episodic</b> <b>memory</b> can be {{enhanced}} specifically through administration of the Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor Donepezil, whereas verbal <b>episodic</b> <b>memory</b> can be improved in persons with the val/val genotype of the val158met polymorphism through administration of the CNS penetrant specific catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitor Tolcapone. Furthermore, <b>episodic</b> <b>memory</b> is enhanced through AZD3480, a selective agonist at the neuronal alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor, which is developed by the company Targacept. Currently, {{there are several other}} products developed by several companies—including new catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitors with fewer side effects—that aim for improving <b>episodic</b> <b>memory.</b> A recent placebo controlled study found that DHEA, which is a functional cortisol antagonist, improves <b>episodic</b> <b>memory</b> in healthy young men (Alhaj et al. 2006).|$|E
25|$|Tulving (1983) {{proposed}} that {{to meet the}} criteria of <b>episodic</b> <b>memory,</b> evidence of conscious recollection must be provided.

50|$|Alcohol impairs episodic encoding, {{specifically}} for cued recall, recognition of completed word fragments, and free recall. A blackout {{is an example}} of a difficulty in encoding <b>episodic</b> <b>memories</b> due to alcohol. Blackouts are caused by a rapid increase in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) which in turn distorts the neurons in the hippocampus. This distortion impairs a person's ability to form new <b>episodic</b> <b>memories.</b>|$|R

25|$|Various neural {{imaging and}} {{research}} points to semantic memory and <b>episodic</b> <b>memory</b> resulting from distinct {{areas in the}} brain. Still other research suggests that both semantic memory and <b>episodic</b> <b>memory</b> {{are part of a}} singular declarative memory system, yet represent different sectors and parts within the greater whole. Different areas within the brain are activated depending on whether semantic or <b>episodic</b> <b>memory</b> is accessed. Certain experts are still arguing whether or not the two types of memory are from distinct systems or whether the neural imaging makes it appear that way {{as a result of the}} activation of different mental processes during retrieval.|$|E
25|$|<b>Episodic</b> <b>memory</b> emerges at {{approximately}} 3- to 4-years-of-age. Activation of specific brain areas (mostly the hippocampus) {{seems to be}} different between younger (aged 23–39) and older people (aged 67–80) upon <b>episodic</b> <b>memory</b> retrieval. Older people tend to activate both their left and right hippocampus, while younger people activate only the left one.|$|E
40|$|Events {{that happen}} at a {{particular}} place and time come to define our <b>episodic</b> <b>memories.</b> Extensive experimental and clinical research illustrate that the hippocampus {{is central to the}} processing of <b>episodic</b> <b>memories,</b> and this is in large part due to its analysis of con-text information according to spatial and temporal references. In this way, hippocampus defines ones expectations for a given context as well as detects errors in predicted contex-tual features. The detection of context prediction errors is hypothesized to distinguished events into meaningful epochs that come to be recalled as separate <b>episodic</b> <b>memories.</b> The nature of the spatial and temporal context information processed by hippocampus is described, as is a hypothesis that the apparently self-regulatory nature of hippocampal context processing may ultimately be mediated by natural homeostatic operations and plasticity. Context prediction errors by hippocampus are suggested to be valued by the midbrain dopamine system, the output of which is ultimately fed back to hippocampus to update memory-driven context expectations for future events. Thus, multiple network functions (both within and outside hippocampus) combine to result in adaptive <b>episodic</b> <b>memories...</b>|$|R
50|$|Semanticizing <b>memories,</b> generalizing <b>episodic</b> <b>memories</b> by {{removing}} the specific temporal and spatial contexts, makes memories more persistent than age sensitive <b>episodic</b> <b>memories.</b> Recent memories (retention interval) are <b>episodic.</b> Older <b>memories</b> are semanticized, becoming more resilient (reminiscence bump). Semantic memories are less sensitive to age effects. With the passing of time, autobiographical memories may consist more of general information than specific details of a particular event or time. In one study where participants recalled events from five life periods, older adults concentrated more on semantic details which were not tied to a distinct temporal or spatial context. Younger participants reported more episodic details such as activities, locations, perceptions, and thoughts. Even when probed for contextual details, older adults still reported more semantic details compared with younger adults.|$|R

25|$|The memory {{impairment}} that is pathognomonic to Korsakoff's syndrome predominantly {{affects the}} declarative memory, leaving non-declarative memory {{that is often}} procedural in nature relatively intact. The disproportionate severity in anterograde <b>episodic</b> <b>memory</b> processes in contrast to other cognitive processes is what differentiates Korsakoff syndrome from other conditions such as alcohol-related dementia. Evidence {{for the preservation of}} certain memory processes in the presence of severe anterograde <b>episodic</b> <b>memory</b> serve as experimental paradigm to investigate the components of human memory.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above, {{patients with}} anterograde amnesia {{have a wide}} range of forgetfulness. Declarative memory can be further subdivided into episodic and semantic memory. <b>Episodic</b> <b>memory</b> is the recollection of autobiographical information with a temporal and/or spatial context, whereas semantic memory involves recall of factual information with no such association (language, history, geography, etc.). In a case study of a girl who developed anterograde amnesia during childhood, it was determined that the patient ("C.L.") retained semantic memory while suffering an extreme impairment of <b>episodic</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Episodic</b> <b>memory</b> is {{the memory}} of autobiographical events (times, places, {{associated}} emotions, and other contextual who, what, when, where, why knowledge) that can be explicitly stated or conjured. It is the collection of past personal experiences that occurred {{at a particular time}} and place. For example, if one remembers the party on his or her 6th birthday, this is an <b>episodic</b> <b>memory.</b> They allow an individual to figuratively travel back in time to remember the event that took place at that particular time and place.|$|E
40|$|Odors are {{powerful}} cues that trigger <b>episodic</b> <b>memories.</b> However, {{in light of}} the amount of behavioral data describing the characteristics of <b>episodic</b> odor <b>memory,</b> the paucity of information available on the neural substrates of this function is startling.

We conduct a systematic review of the literature depicting {{the current state of the}} neural correlates of <b>episodic</b> odor <b>memory</b> in healthy humans by placing a focus on the experimental approaches. Functional neuroimaging data are introduced by a brief characterization of the memory processes investigated. We present and discuss laboratory-based approaches, such as odor recognition and odor associative memory, and autobiographical approaches, such as the evaluation of odor familiarity and odor-evoked autobiographical memory. We then suggest the development of new laboratory-ecological approaches allowing for the controlled encoding and retrieval of specific multidimensional events that could open up new prospects for the comprehension of <b>episodic</b> odor <b>memory</b> and its neural underpinnings. While large conceptual differences distinguish experimental approaches, the overview of the functional neuroimaging findings suggests relatively stable neural correlates of <b>episodic</b> odor <b>memory...</b>|$|R
50|$|Temporal lobe {{epilepsy}} is {{a chronic}} neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures; symptoms include a variety of sensory (visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustation) hallucinations, {{as well as an}} inability to process semantic and <b>episodic</b> <b>memories.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Episodic</b> <b>memories</b> (memories {{of moments}} or events) {{is a type}} of memory that may not undergo {{complete}} systems consolidation; as a result, they remain entirely dependent on the hippocampus (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011). Therefore, they cannot exist independently of any brain structures, unlike semantic memories. Evidence shows that complete hippocampal damage results in flat retrograde amnesia for <b>episodic</b> <b>memories,</b> including older memories (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011). However, if the hippocampus is only partially damaged, then it is possible for the amnesia to have a temporal gradient (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011) similar to one seen with semantic memories: older memories {{are more likely to be}} retained and newer memories less.|$|R
25|$|Adda et al. (2008) {{assessed}} {{patients with}} <b>episodic</b> <b>memory</b> impairment due to epilepsy associated with mesial temporal sclerosis.

25|$|Normal {{aging is}} {{associated}} with a decline in various memory abilities in many cognitive tasks; the phenomenon is known as age-related memory impairment (AMI) or age-associated memory impairment (AAMI).

Studies comparing the effects of aging on <b>episodic</b> <b>memory,</b> semantic memory, short-term memory and priming find that <b>episodic</b> <b>memory</b> is especially impaired in normal aging; some types of short-term memory are also impaired.
