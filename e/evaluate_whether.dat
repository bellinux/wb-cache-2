5|$|Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) {{is being}} sent on an {{interstellar}} journey to <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> a decades old space station {{should continue to}} study the remote oceanic planet Solaris. He spends his last day on Earth with his elderly father (Nikolai Grinko) and retired pilot Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky). They watch filmed testimony of Berton describing a four-meter-tall child on Solaris, only to have this sighting dismissed as a hallucination {{by a panel of}} scientists. After burning his personal mementos, Kelvin departs Earth to meet the Solaris scientists who have made reports that are equally confusing.|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} for induction, nominees must meet certain prerequisites. Players must have been retired {{for at least five}} years before becoming eligible. Referees and coaches must have either been retired {{for at least five years}}, or, if they are still active, have coached or officiated for at least 25 years at high-school-level programs or higher. Those being considered for induction as contributors may be inducted at any time; the Hall of Fame and its committees <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> contributions are significant enough for the nominee to be inducted as a contributor. Teams are also inducted at the committees' discretion.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of {{less than six months}} to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the hospice benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice benefit through the first six months is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less than six months to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Cuba's concern over U.S. migration policy, the Cuban delegation assured the U.S. that normalization talks would not yield significant changes unless Cuba {{is removed from}} the U.S. State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism. Cuba was one of four countries on the list, the other three being Iran, Sudan, and Syria.

25|$|The moves {{allowed the}} 76ers to make Iguodala the unquestioned {{leader of the}} team, and <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> they saw him as a {{franchise}} player. The Sixers had started the year 3–0, then went 5–10 before Iverson left the team. They would stumble out to an eight-game losing streak with Iverson deactivated; however, {{they were able to}} finish the season on a high note, going 30–29 {{for the remainder of the}} season. They finished the year 35–47.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} argued by critics that the {{policies}} {{would make it}} unviable for smaller businesses to promote themselves using the Games, even in support of athletes, as {{they would need to}} <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> their marketing materials violate the restrictions on unauthorized associations. Additionally, the architecture community strongly criticised the marketing restrictions, citing LOCOG's refusal to allow architectural firms to publicise their work on Olympic venues, including preventing the firms from entering national and international award competitions. LOCOG retained rights to all Olympic marks even {{after the end of the}} games until they were transferred to the British Olympic Association in 2013.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{testing is}} needed to assess how much the cancer has spread (see Staging, below). Computed {{tomography}} (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> the cancer has spread to adjacent tissues or distant organs (especially liver and lymph nodes). The sensitivity of a CT scan is limited by its ability to detect masses (e.g. enlarged lymph nodes or involved organs) generally larger than 1cm. Positron emission tomography {{is also used to}} estimate the extent of the disease and is regarded as more precise than CT alone. Esophageal endoscopic ultrasound can provide staging information regarding the level of tumor invasion, and possible spread to regional lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|A {{survey of}} rescuers and veterinarians in the United States {{found that there}} was no widely {{accepted}} definition of a feral cat. Many facilities used waiting periods to <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> a cat was feral by observing whether the cat became less afraid and evasive over time. Other indicators included the cat's response to touch with an inanimate object, and observation of social behavior from the cat in varying environments (in response to human contact, with a human nearby, or when moved to a quieter environment). The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals defines community cats as either cats who were {{born and raised in the}} wild, or domestic cats who have been abandoned or lost and turned to wild ways in order to survive.|$|E
25|$|In March 2003 the New York Law School Law Review {{published}} {{an examination of}} the critical reviews of Skeptical Environmentalist from the Scientific American, Nature and Science magazines by Professor of Law David Shoenbrod and then Senior Law Student Christi Wilson of New York Law School. The authors take the perspective of a court faced with an argument against hearing an expert witness in order to <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> Lomborg was credible as an expert, and whether his testimony is valid to his expertise. They classify the types of criticisms leveled at Lomborg and his arguments, and proceed to evaluate each of the reasons given for disqualifying Lomborg. They conclude that a court should accept Lomborg as a credible expert in the field of statistics, and that his testimony was appropriately restricted to his area of expertise. Of course, Professor Shoenbrod and Wilson note, Mr. Lomborg's factual conclusions may not be correct, nor his policy proposals effective, but his criticisms should be addressed, not merely dismissed out of hand.|$|E

On 20 March 2015, Wilson joined Championship rivals Rotherham United on an emergency loan. Manager Steve Evans hinted that the loan move would allow him to <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> or not to sign Wilson permanently in the summer.

500|$|The {{ship was}} ordered on 9 January 1935 and laid down at DeSchiMAG, Bremen on 14 January 1936 as yard number W902. She was {{launched}} on 15 September 1936 and completed on 8 January 1937. Bruno Heinemann {{and her sister}} Z5 Paul Jakobi sailed to Norway in April 1938 to test the new [...] TbtsK C/36 gun planned for later classes of destroyers. Bruno Heinemann had been fitted with four of the new weapons and they were removed after gunnery trials off Ålesund were completed. The ship participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review {{as part of the}} 6th Destroyer Division and the following fleet exercise.

500|$|Yelp has a {{proprietary}} algorithm {{that attempts to}} <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> a review is authentic and filters out reviews that it believes are not based on a patron's actual personal experiences, {{as required by the}} site's Terms of Use. The review filter was first developed two weeks after the site was founded and the company saw their [...] "first obviously fake reviews." [...] Filtered reviews are moved into a special area and not counted towards the businesses' star-rating. The filter sometimes filters legitimate reviews, leading to complaints from business owners. New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said Yelp has [...] "the most aggressive" [...] astroturfing filter out of the crowd-sourced websites it looked into. Yelp has also been criticized for not disclosing how the filter works, which it says would reveal information on how to outsmart it.|$|E
500|$|A {{decade after}} Hovey, the Supreme Court {{announced}} its first rule {{for how the}} Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment would be applied. In Twining v. New Jersey (1908), the Court held that [...] "it {{is possible that some}} of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight amendments against National action may also be safeguarded against state action, because a denial of them would be a denial of due process of law". This understanding of the meaning of [...] "due process" [...] opened up the possibility that the Bill of Rights could be applied to the states. Specifically, the Court said in Twining that the test was whether the right was embedded in [...] "the very idea of free government". This test endorsed a [...] "selective incorporation" [...] approach, meaning one that would <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> to apply a right to the states on a case-by-case basis.|$|E
500|$|Analysis of Washington {{has focused}} on the {{decision}} in the broader context of procedural trial rights. A 2007 article in the Georgetown Law Review by Martin Hewett was critical of the decision. Hewett's main criticism was based on the Court's lack of a standard on which to <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> certain evidence was [...] "material" [...] to a defendant's case. Hewett noted that in a post-Washington decision in 1973, the Court applied a [...] "case-specific" [...] decision rather than a [...] "general constitutional standard". This line of decisions, Hewett argued, led to a standard which allows a trial judge the authority to determine the [...] "actual reliability of the evidence" [...] in cases where a witness is not present. The [...] "newly-seized power" [...] was limited to the cases at hand in a manner which suggested the ambiguous calculus the Court was using was flawed. This vagueness in the standard came from cases where the [...] "situations [...] the reliability of the excluded evidence [...] could factfinder". Hewett concluded by arguing that all of these cases had diminished the protections of the jury and of the defendant's right to have his own defense.|$|E
