5|$|<b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{central figure}} of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is {{possible}} to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Most Christians {{believe that}} Jesus was {{both human and}} the Son of God. While there has been {{theological}} debate over his nature, Some early Christians viewed Jesus as subordinate to the Father, and others considered him {{an aspect of the}} Father rather than a separate person. The Church resolved the issues in ancient councils, which established the Holy Trinity, with Jesus both fully human and fully God. Trinitarian Christians generally believe that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Logos, God's incarnation and God the Son, both fully divine and fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Protestant Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus' two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E
25|$|Jews for Jesus {{takes the}} {{mainstream}} Christian positions that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Messiah, that his coming was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible, and that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> son of God, {{the second person}} of the Trinity. Jews for Jesus believes that their views of the Messiah are entirely compatible with the view of God presented in Jewish scriptures, and that {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity, fundamental to the Christian faith, is not entirely alien to Judaism.|$|E

25|$|Messianic Judaism is {{a modern}} syncretic {{religious}} movement that combines Christianity—most importantly, the Christian belief that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Messiah—with elements of Judaism and Jewish tradition, its current form emerging in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Faith is {{a passive}} persuasion that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Messiah, and active works are not {{mandatory}} {{in terms of}} salvation. In other words, Jesus graciously provides eternal salvation as a free gift to {{those who believe in}} Him.|$|E

25|$|<b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Messiah, {{the second}} person of the Trinity, was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, died {{for the sins of}} all humanity, rose again, and is co-equal with God. Jesus will return to earth in the near future.|$|E
25|$|To Trinitarian Christians (which include Catholic Christians, Eastern Orthodox Christians, {{and most}} Protestant denominations), God the Father {{is not at}} all a {{separate}} god from the Son (of whom <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> incarnation) and the Holy Spirit, the other Hypostases of the Christian Godhead.|$|E
25|$|Free Grace Theology is {{distinguished}} by its soteriology or doctrine of salvation.

25|$|While Islam {{shares the}} Jewish {{tradition}} {{that the first}} prophet is Adem (Adam), it differs in that the last prophet is Muhammad, who in Islam is called Seal of the prophets or Khatam an-Nabiyyin. Muslims often refer to Muhammad as the prophet, {{in the form of}} a noun. Isa (<b>Jesus)</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> result of a virgin birth in Islam as in Christianity, and is regarded as a prophet.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{tenet of}} Christian faith (Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant) that God is {{the creator of}} all things from nothing, and has made human beings in the Image of God, who by direct {{inference}} is also {{the source of the}} human soul. In Chalcedonian Christology, <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Word of God, which was in the beginning and, thus, is uncreated, and hence is God, and consequently identical with the Creator of the world ex nihilo.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} {{movements}} that combine elements of Judaism {{with those of}} other religions. The most well-known of these is Messianic Judaism, a religious movement, which arose in the 1960s, that incorporates elements of Judaism with the tenets of Christianity. The movement generally states that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Jewish Messiah, that {{he is one of the}} Three Divine Persons, and that salvation is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior. Some members of the movement argue that Messianic Judaism is a sect of Judaism. Jewish organizations of every denomination reject this, stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect, because it teaches creeds which are identical to those of Pauline Christianity.|$|E
25|$|As of the 21st century, the Bnei Menashe {{have come}} to believe that the legendary Kuki-Mizo {{ancestor}} Manmasi was the Hebrew Menasseh, son of Joseph. This group of Chin-Kuki-Mizo people began a Messianic movement during the 1950s. While believing that Y'shua (<b>Jesus)</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> promised messiah for all Israelites, these pioneers in the early 1960s adopted observance of the Jewish Sabbath, holidays, dietary laws and other Jewish customs and traditions which they learned from books. They had no connections with other Jewish groups in the diaspora or in Israel. On May 31, 1972, some Messianic communities founded the Manipur Jewish Organization (later renamed United Jews Organization, NEI), the first Jewish organization in northeast India.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{residence of}} the Society of Jesus, this site was transformed to support pilgrims to the site, and {{is marked by a}} chapel delineated by Corinthian columns, supporting plinths surmounted by simple frieze and cornice. The interior was decorated in azulejo tile of polychromatic vegetal design, with triumphal arch dividing the sanctuary from the college, identifiable by the large granite rock in its interior, where legend says the image of the Virgin Mary was first discovered. In this space is the oratory of Senhora das Dores (Our Lady of Sorrows) with its nativity by António Ferreira (particularly visible in the juxtaposition of various representations). In the junction between presbytery and sacristy is the double-arched belfry.

2500|$|Adam {{was neither}} God nor the Only Begotten Son of God. He {{was a child}} of God in the spirit as we all are (see Acts 17:29). <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> firstborn in the spirit, {{and the only one}} born to God in the flesh. ...|$|R
5|$|Sanders {{says that}} <b>the</b> genealogies of <b>Jesus</b> <b>are</b> {{based not on}} {{historical}} information but on the authors' desire to show that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> universal Jewish savior. In any event, once {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph. Luke reports that <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a blood relation of John the Baptist, but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.|$|R
25|$|Luke's {{understanding}} of Jesus – his Christology – {{is central to}} his theology. One approach to this is through the titles Luke gives to Jesus: these include, {{but are not limited}} to, Christ (Messiah), Lord, Son of God, and Son of Man. Another is by reading Luke in the context of similar Greco-Roman divine saviour figures (Roman emperors are an example), references which would have made clear to Luke's readers that Jesus was the greatest of all saviours. A third is to approach Luke through his use of the Old Testament, those passages from Jewish scripture which he cites to establish that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> promised Messiah. While much of this is familiar, much also is missing: for example, Luke makes no clear reference to Christ's pre-existence or to the Christian's union with Christ, and makes relatively little reference to the concept of atonement: perhaps he felt no need to mention these ideas, or disagreed with them, or possibly he was simply unaware of them.|$|E
25|$|The Jewish {{conception}} of the messiah (משיח mashiach in Hebrew) holds certain similarities to that of Christians, yet there are substantial differences. According to Jews, the Hebrew Scriptures contain {{a small number of}} prophecies concerning a future descendant of King David, who will be anointed (Hebrew: moshiach) as the Jewish people's new leader and will establish the throne of David in Jerusalem forever. In the Jewish view, this fully human and mortal leader will rebuild the land of Israel and restore the Davidic Kingdom. This subject is covered in the section on Jewish eschatology. Some Christians have a different understanding of the term messiah, and believe that <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> messiah referred to in the Old Testament prophecies; that the kingdom in these prophecies was to be a heavenly kingdom, not an earthly one; and that Jesus' words and actions in the New Testament provide evidence of his identity as messiah and that the remainder of messianic prophecy will be fulfilled in the Second Coming. Other Christians acknowledge the Jewish definition of messiah, and hold that Jesus fulfills this, being 'fully man' (in addition to being 'fully God'), and believe that the Second Coming will establish the Kingdom of God on earth, where Jesus, as messiah and descendant from David, will reign from Jerusalem.|$|E

50|$|Christianity and Islam both {{consider}} <b>Jesus</b> to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Jewish Messiah of the Hebrew scripture. Christians generally consider <b>Jesus</b> to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Son of God, while Muslims consider <b>the</b> Trinity to <b>be</b> {{a division}} of God's Oneness and a grave sin (shirk). Muslims believe <b>Jesus</b> (Isa) to <b>be</b> a messenger of God, not the son of God.|$|R
