50|$|Nosocomial {{infections are}} {{estimated}} to make patients {{stay in the hospital}} four to five additional days. Around 2004-2005, about 9,000 people <b>died</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> with a nosocomial infection, of which about 4,200 would have survived without this infection.|$|R
5000|$|At least 200,000 people - {{and perhaps}} many {{thousands}} more - have <b>died</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> in conflict zones from non-violent causes (such as malnutrition, dysentery, or other easily preventable diseases) {{that resulted from}} the effects of war on populations.|$|R
25|$|Inhaling secondhand {{tobacco smoke}} can cause lung cancer in nonsmoking adults. In the United States, about 3,000 adults <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> due to lung cancer from secondhand smoke exposure. Heart disease caused by secondhand smoke kills around 46,000 nonsmokers every year.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that up to 5 million people <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> from preventable waterborne diseases, {{as a result of}} inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices. The effects of sanitation has impacted the society of people throughout history. Sanitation is a necessity for a healthy life.|$|E

50|$|Varicella, {{commonly}} known as chickenpox, is a highly contagious disease that is very uncomfortable and sometimes serious. It {{is caused by the}} Varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Before the vaccine, about 4 million people <b>each</b> <b>year</b> in the United States would get chicken pox. About 10,600 people were hospitalized and 100 to 150 <b>died</b> <b>each</b> <b>year.</b>|$|R
25|$|Although SARS {{has killed}} far fewer people than <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> from more common {{maladies}} such as pneumonia, influenza, malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, it generated significant attention {{and created a}} sense of urgency to respond because it was a mysterious new illness that seemed able to go anywhere and hit anyone.|$|E
25|$|Wildlife {{living near}} the Athabasca River have been greatly {{impacted}} due to pollutants entering the water system. An {{unknown number of}} birds <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year.</b> Particularly visible and hard hit are migrating birds that stop to rest at tailing ponds. There have been numerous reports of large flocks of ducks landing in tailing ponds and perishing soon after. Data has been recorded since the 1970s {{on the number of}} birds found on tailing ponds.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimate}} that vaccination averts 2-3 million deaths per year (in all age groups), {{and up to}} 1.5 million children <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> due to diseases {{which could have been}} prevented by vaccination. They {{estimate that}} 29% of deaths of children under five years old in 2013 were vaccine preventable. In other developing parts of the world, they are faced with the challenge of having a decreased availability of resources and vaccinations. Countries such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa cannot afford to provide the full range of childhood vaccinations.|$|E
25|$|Over 90% {{of deaths}} from diarrheal {{diseases}} {{in the developing}} world today occur in children under 5 years old. Malnutrition, especially protein-energy malnutrition, can decrease the children's resistance to infections, including water-related diarrheal diseases. From 2000 to 2003, 769,000 children under five years old in sub-Saharan Africa <b>died</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> from diarrheal diseases. As a result of only thirty-six percent of the population in the sub-Saharan region having access to proper means of sanitation, more than 2000 children's lives are lost every day. In South Asia, 683,000 children under five <b>years</b> old <b>died</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> from diarrheal disease from 2000 to 2003. During the same time period, in developed countries, 700 children under five years old died from diarrheal disease. Improved water supply reduces diarrhea morbidity by twenty-five percent and improvements in drinking water through proper storage in the home and chlorination reduces diarrhea episodes by thirty-nine percent.|$|R

Some entries have a [...] "memorial" [...] (sometimes of several pages) giving biographical detail and a strong religious message.|$|R
25|$|Because {{there is}} no {{reliable}} reporting system in place and because most victims never report their injury to health care facilities, these numbers are uncertain. One comprehensive study estimates that 91,000 to 420,000 snake envenomings occur in sub-Saharan Africa annually, resulting in anywhere from 4,000 to 30,000 deaths. The same study estimates that 3,000 to 80,000 envenomations occur in North Africa, although far fewer people, less than 100, <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year.</b> The variability of these estimates {{is indicative of the}} difficulty in accurately assessing snakebite morbidity and mortality.|$|E
25|$|There are {{approximately}} 120 million smokers in India. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), India {{is home to}} 12% of the world’s smokers. More than 1 million <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> due to tobacco in India. According to a 2002 WHO estimate, 30% of adult males in India smoke. Among adult females, the figure is much lower at between 3–5%. About 24% of {{children under the age}} of 16 years (10th class) have used some form of tobacco in the past, and 14% are still using tobacco products. Smokeless tobacco is more prevalent than cigarettes or bidis in India.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{challenges}} remain. Only about {{one half of}} the population is connected to sanitary sewers. Partly because of low sanitation coverage about 50,000 children <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> because of diarrhea. Another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world. This in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs, a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the Arab Spring. Poor operation of facilities, such as water and wastewater treatment plants, as well as limited government accountability and transparency, are also issues.|$|E
5|$|According to Madagascar {{historian}} Gwyn Campbell, {{the number}} of non-Merina who died in violent conflict during the military campaigns of Ranavalona and her predecessor Radama from 1816 to 1853 was estimated at about 60,000. Additionally, a considerable {{proportion of the population}} not killed in battle in the subjugated provinces eventually died from famine as a consequence of scorched earth policies. Deaths among the Merina soldiers engaged in military actions were also high, estimated at about 160,000 for the period 1820–1853. A further 25–50% of the queen's soldiers stationed in lowland areas were estimated to have <b>died</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> due to diseases such as malaria. Although prevalent in the coastal parts of the island, malaria was uncommon in the high-altitude zone around Antananarivo, and Merina soldiers possessed little natural resistance against it. An average of 4,500 soldiers <b>died</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> for the greater part of Ranavalona's reign, contributing to severe depopulation in Imerina.|$|R

5000|$|It {{remains the}} case that the {{majority}} of deaths from terrorism do not occur in the [...] "West". When the Al Qaeda attacks against the United States in 2001 are excluded, only 0.5% of all deaths from terrorism have occurred in Western countries [...] - [...] European nations, United States, Canada and Australia [...] - [...] in the past fifteen years. However, there have been recent increases in the number of high-fatality attacks. There had been a {{decrease in the number of}} overall fatalities from terrorist attacks between 1990 and 2015, compared to those between 1970 and 1990. Prior to 1990, on average 150 people <b>died</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> from terrorist attacks; this figure would be even higher if the large number of people who died in 1988 from the Pan Am 2013 bombing were included. From 1990, an average of a little under 50 people <b>died</b> <b>each</b> <b>year.</b> However, this figure has begun to increase again from 2011, with the attacks by far-right extremist Anders Breivik in Norway, and Islamist extremist attacks in France in 2015 and 2016.|$|R
25|$|Documented deaths {{resulting}} from snake bites are uncommon. Nonfatal bites from venomous snakes {{may result in}} the need for amputation of a limb or part thereof. Of the roughly 725 species of venomous snakes worldwide, only 250 are able to kill a human with one bite. Australia averages only one fatal snake bite per year. In India, 250,000 snakebites are recorded in a single year, {{with as many as}} 50,000 recorded initial deaths. The WHO estimates that on the order of 100 000 people <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> as a result of snake bites, and around three times as many amputations and other permanent disabilities are caused by snakebites annually.|$|E
25|$|Horseback riding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{dangerous}} sports, especially in relation to head injury. Statistics from the United States, for example, indicate that about 30 million people ride horses annually. On average, about 67,000 people are admitted to the hospital each year from injuries sustained while working with horses. 15,000 of those admittances are from traumatic brain injuries. Of those, about 60 <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> from their brain injuries. Studies have found horseback riding to be more dangerous than several sports, including skiing, auto racing and football. Horseback riding has a higher hospital admittance rate per hours of riding than motorcycle racing, at 0.49 per thousand hours of riding and 0.14 accidents per thousand hours, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Rheumatic fever {{occurs in}} about 325,000 {{children}} {{each year and}} about 33.4million people currently have rheumatic heart disease. Those who develop RF are most often {{between the ages of}} 5 and 14, with 20% of first-time attacks occurring in adults. The disease is most common in the developing world and among indigenous peoples in the developed world. In 2015 it resulted in 319,400 deaths down from 374,000 deaths in 1990. Most deaths occur in the developing world where as many as 12.5% of people affected may <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year.</b> Descriptions of the condition are believed to date back to at least the 5th century BCE in the writings of Hippocrates. The disease is so named because its symptoms {{are similar to those of}} some rheumatic disorders.|$|E

25|$|Today, all {{ridges and}} {{faces of the}} Matterhorn have been ascended in all seasons, and {{mountain}} guides take {{a large number of}} people up the northeast Hörnli route each summer. In total, up to 150 climbers attempt the Matterhorn each day during summer. By modern standards, the climb is fairly difficult (AD Difficulty rating), but not hard for skilled mountaineers according to French climbing grades. There are fixed ropes on parts of the route to help. Still, several climbers <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> due to a number of factors including the scale of the climb and its inherent dangers, inexperience, falling rocks, and overcrowded routes. The Matterhorn is thus amongst the deadliest mountains in the world. By the late 1980s, it was estimated that over 500 people have died whilst attempting its summit since the 1865 ascent, with an average of about 12 deaths each year.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{developing}} deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism is different than the total risk {{of the formation of}} blood clots. This is due to the observation that not all blood clots form in the lower legs. Most hospitalized medical patients have at least 1 risk factor for thrombosis that progresses to thromboembolism and this risk persists weeks after discharge. Those who remain undiagnosed and not treated prophylacticly have a 26% chance of suffering a fatal embolism. Another 26% develop another embolism. Between 5% and 10% of all in hospital deaths are due to pulmonary embolism (as a consequence of thrombosis). Estimates of the incidence of pulmonary embolism in the US is 0.1% persons/year. Hospital admissions in the US for pulmonary embolism are 200,000 to 300,000 yearly. Thrombosis that develops into DVT will affect 900,000 people and kill up to 100,000 in the US. On average 28,726 hospitalized adults aged 18 and older with a VTE blood clot diagnosis <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year.</b> Risk of thrombosis is related to hospitalization. In 2005 the UK the Parliamentary Health Select Committee determined the annual rate of death due to thrombosis was 25,000 with at least 50% being hospital-acquired.|$|E
25|$|Government {{expenditure}} on healthcare in Indonesia {{is about}} 3.1 {{percent of its}} total gross domestic product. Every citizen is protected under Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN), a scheme to implement universal {{health care in the}} country which launched by Ministry of Health of Indonesia. It is expected that spending on healthcare will increase by 12% a year and reach US$46 billion a year by 2019. Under JKN, all Indonesians will receive coverage for a range of treatments via health services from public providers as well as those private organisations that have opted to join the scheme. The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Indonesia is 240. The main health problems are air quality, disease, child malnutrition, alcohol and smoking. Health outcomes have significantly improved in Indonesia since the 1960s. Life expectancy at birth is 70.8 years. The child mortality rate has declined from 220 per 1,000 live births in 1960 to 45 per 1,000 live births in 2007. It has been suggested that over a third of the children under 5 have stunted growth. More than 28 million live below the poverty line of US$17 a month and about half the population have incomes not much above it. The malnutrition status has shown steady progress from 38 percent in 1990 to 25 percent in 2000. The rate of smoking is very high and about 400,000 <b>die</b> <b>each</b> <b>year</b> from smoking related illnesses.|$|E
