500|$|Jones became {{interested}} in programming in high school, and learned Applesoft BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer. When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer-aided design company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, [...] "and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac," [...] he said. [...] "The first thing <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. I was still finishing that when I came to college. By that time, I knew I wanted to write games." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Blink" [...] {{was written}} by Steven Moffat. Part of the story for [...] "Blink" [...] is based on Moffat's Ninth Doctor short story from the Doctor Who Annual 2006 called [...] "'What <b>I</b> <b>Did</b> <b>on</b> My Christmas Holidays' by Sally Sparrow". The short story is {{presented}} as a homework essay from Sally, though only 12 years old, who encounters evidence of the Doctor's presence from the past in her aunt's house while visiting. [...] "What I Did" [...] includes several elements that are reused in [...] "Blink", including messages under the wallpaper and an ontological paradox involving a conversation between Sally and the Doctor, prerecorded on a video cassette, based on a written transcript—the essay itself; however, instead of the Angels, [...] "What I Did" [...] features the Doctor and the TARDIS inadvertently separated twenty years in time by a fault in the time machine, and the Doctor is able to instruct Sally how to bring it back to him in the past.|$|E

500|$|Ken Keeler, Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein all {{defend the}} episode in its DVD commentary. Keeler asserts, [...] "I am very, {{very proud of}} the job <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> this episode. This is the best episode of {{television}} I feel I ever wrote." [...] He describes the episode as a commentary on [...] "people who like things just the way they are", and remarks, [...] "It never seems to have occurred to anyone that this episode is about the people who hate it." [...] However, Keeler says that some of the dialogue was changed from his original draft, making this point less obvious. Oakley and Weinstein explain that they wanted to push the boundaries of the series while working as show-runners, and advise viewers to treat [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] as an [...] "experiment". They surmise that the negative reception was partly {{due to the fact that}} it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, [...] "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"). They also describe the ending of the episode as an attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode as non-canonical, divorced from the larger series.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Nolan {{directed}} and produced Dunkirk, {{based on his}} own original screenplay. The story is set amid World War II and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France in 1940. During the year-long production of his first film, Following (1998), Nolan and Thomas hired a small sailing boat to take them across the English Channel and retrace the journey of the little ships of Dunkirk. [...] "We did {{it at the same}} time of year to get a sense of what it was like, and it turned out to be an incredibly dangerous experience. And that was with no bombs dropping on us." [...] For Dunkirk, Nolan said he was inspired by the work of Robert Bresson, silent films such as Intolerance (1916) and [...] (1927) as well as by The Wages of Fear (1953). Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, he wanted to make a [...] "sensory, almost experimental movie" [...] with minimal dialogue. Nolan said he waited to make Dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film, but with an American budget. Before filming, Nolan also sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with Variety, [...] "Knowing and respecting that Chris [...] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama." [...] Starring Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden, Aneurin Barnard, Harry Styles, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Kenneth Branagh, Dunkirk was released in theaters on 21 July 2017 to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results, grossing over $520 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing World War II film of all time. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in his review: [...] "It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies—they are rare—that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk is that kind of movie." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times lauded the film, calling it [...] "a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday's fights and today's." ...|$|E

Radke stated in an interview, [...] "They make a whole album called This War Is Ours, and then they try to say, 'We didn't name that album after you, dude.' Which in fact, they did. I could be wrong; they could be talking about the war on terrorism or something. I don't know. But I just have a feeling that record name was about me. They talk a lot of shit.

2500|$|In November 1941 Adorno {{followed}} Horkheimer to what Thomas Mann called [...] "German California", {{setting up}} {{house in a}} Pacific Palisades neighborhood of German émigrés which included Bertolt Brecht and Arnold Schoenberg. Adorno arrived with [...] a draft of his Philosophy of New Music, a dialectical critique of twelve-tone music, which Adorno himself felt, while writing, was already {{a departure from the}} theory of art he had spent the previous decades elaborating. Horkheimer's reaction to the manuscript was wholly positive: [...] "If I have ever in the whole of my life felt enthusiasm about anything, then <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> this occasion," [...] he wrote after reading the manuscript. The two set about completing their joint work, which transformed itself from a book on dialectical logic to a rewriting of the history of rationality and the Enlightenment. First published in a small mimeographed edition in May 1944 as Philosophical Fragments, the text would wait another three years before achieving book form when it was published with its definitive title, Dialectic of Enlightenment, by the Amsterdam publisher Querido Verlag. This [...] "reflection on the destructive aspect of progress" [...] proceeded through the chapters which treated rationality as both the liberation from and further domination of nature, interpretations of both Homer's Odyssey and the Marquis de Sade, as well as analyses of the culture industry and antisemitism.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2013, the Black Keys resumed {{recording}} with Burton at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, California. They {{traveled to}} accommodate Burton, {{who lived in}} Los Angeles and had traveled for previous recording sessions with the group. Working in Studio 2, the band recorded most of Turn Blue at Sunset Sound. During the recording of the album's nearly seven-minute opening song [...] "Weight of Love", Auerbach was urged by Carney and Burton to continue playing the track's concluding guitar solo, despite his reservations {{that it would be}} self-indulgent. He said that the song's completion {{set the tone for the}} rest of the album and that instead of focusing on radio-friendly singles, they would attempt to make a [...] "headphone record". Carney said the month-long sessions at Sunset Sound were more inspired: [...] "That's where the record unfolded. The record is L.A. At that point there were no rules. It's a more open, sprawling kind of album." [...] As recording stretched into August, Auerbach finalized his divorce from Stephanie Gonis; many personal details of their separation were publicized in the press. Auerbach said that his emotional state during the divorce imbued the album with a moody feeling: [...] "I've never relied on music to get me through anything like <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> this one. This past year, I realised how fortunate I was to have this thing I can do: making music, and lyrically, saying things that are personal." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Play was {{released}} on May 17, 1999, it underperformed commercially. In the United Kingdom, it debuted at number 33 on the UK Albums Chart on May 29, 1999, but sales declined in the weeks immediately following its debut and the album spent only five further weeks inside the charts {{for the remainder of}} the year. Moby stated, [...] "First show that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>on</b> the tour for Play was in the basement of the Virgin Megastore in Union Square. Literally playing music while people were waiting in line buying CDs. Maybe forty people came." [...] Despite the album's strong critical reviews, Plays songs received little airplay from radio stations or television networks such as MTV. While this lack of airplay further damaged the album's commercial prospects, Moby and his record label soon found another approach to increasing public exposure of the album, by way of licensing its songs to films, television shows, and commercials. According to Moby, the goal behind the licensing of Play [...] "was simply to get people to hear the music," [...] adding, [...] "Most of the licenses weren't particularly lucrative, but they enabled people to hear the music because otherwise the record wasn't being heard." [...] According to his manager Eric Härle, although many people believed the songs were pitched for advertisements as part of the marketing campaign for an album that did not fit with mainstream radio, the licensing actually came as a result of agencies asking for permission to use the music as soundbeds, attributing the music's popularity to its evocative and emotional nature. Despite the heavy licensing, the advertisements selected were nevertheless carefully chosen and more requests were turned down than accepted.|$|E
