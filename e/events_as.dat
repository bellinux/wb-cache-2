5|$|Before each flight, a {{briefing}} was held, alerting the crewmembers to basic world <b>events</b> <b>as</b> well as safety criteria. At least 15 hours before takeoff, the crew would thoroughly pre-flight their aircraft. Inadvertently, this also increased efficiency {{in terms of}} maintenance and other pre-flight routines.|$|E

50|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century and the 21st century parliaments of several {{countries}} have formally recognized the <b>event</b> <b>as</b> genocide.

While {{attending}} the Georgian Technical University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics in 2009, Kumaritashvili maintained a rigorous training and competition schedule. Though his family endured economic hardship, Kumaritashvili attended as many luge <b>events</b> <b>as</b> he could, often driving for days to reach World Cup <b>events.</b> <b>As</b> a devout member of the Georgian Orthodox Church, he prayed at church before every competition.|$|E

5|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Milan Ćirković and colleagues {{extended}} {{the notion of}} a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic <b>events</b> <b>as</b> well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics. The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a punctuated equilibrium in which habitable planets are more likely at some times than at others. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way, the team found that the number of habitable planets is likely to increase with time, though not in a perfectly linear pattern.|$|E
5|$|A multi-locus genetic {{risk score}} study {{based on a}} {{combination}} of 27 loci, including the APOA5 gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease <b>events,</b> <b>as</b> well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).|$|E
5|$|After several {{conflicts}} with the school's administration, Leontovych got a new job as a teacher of church music and calligraphy at the Theological College in Tyvriv. Besides working with the college choir, Leontovych organized an amateur orchestra that often performed at college <b>events.</b> <b>As</b> he did earlier with choirs, Leontovych included arrangements of folk songs among the usual religious works sung in theological schools. These included arrangements by Mykola Lysenko, his own choral arrangements of folk songs, and entirely original works. One such work {{was based on a}} poem by Taras Shevchenko titled “Зоре моя вечірняя” (Oh my evening star).|$|E

5|$|All {{the games}} in the main series are {{real-time}} strategy games, where the player views the <b>events</b> <b>as</b> a military commander {{for each of the}} three species. In addition, two spin-off titles have been released; these are authorized expansion packs to the original which focus on other characters and settings based at the same time as the main storyline. Like the main series, these two titles are also real-time strategy games. A spin-off, , which was to be a third person action-stealth game was in development, but has been placed on indefinite hiatus.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{affecting}} {{the water quality}} mainly consist {{of different types of}} fecal coliforms, {{with a high level of}} E. coli bacteria. This comes from pet waste, fertilizer, manure, and other organic pollutants that are washed into the creek, raising the average bacteria level 34percent higher than levels declared safe under California law. This in turn affects recreation at popular Aliso Creek Beach at the creek's mouth, violating state swimming standards 99percent of the time, especially during storm <b>events,</b> <b>as</b> beachgoers are warned to avoid the creek for 72hours (3days) after a major storm event.|$|E

5|$|Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev to {{tear down}} the Berlin Wall, there are some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented that there is little {{evidence}} that the speech had any impact on the decision {{to tear down}} the wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the <b>events</b> <b>as</b> they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Golf – In {{addition}} to courses in neighbouring {{communities in the}} Tri-Cities, Coquitlam itself is home to several golf facilities.

The Westwood Plateau Golf & Country Club {{is one of the}} highest rated golf courses in Canada. Both the Westwood Plateau Golf Academy and Eaglequest Golf Centre are designed as executive learning courses.|$|E
5|$|Human {{language}} is also unique {{in being able}} to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical <b>events</b> <b>as</b> well as events {{that took place in the}} past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human {{language is}} also considered unique.|$|E
