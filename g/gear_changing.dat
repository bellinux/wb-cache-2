25|$|The 1904 models had 2470cc, four-cylinder, water-cooled, overhead-valve engines {{featuring}} pressure lubrication, {{very unusual}} at the time, {{and were now}} mounted with the epicyclic gearbox between the front seats rather than centrally resulting a design with the driver sitting well forwards and no bonnet. Six-cylinder models joined the line up in 1906. The specification started to become more conventional with wheel steering as an option from 1908, becoming standard {{from the end of}} 1911, and pedals and gear lever replacing the original two-lever system of <b>gear</b> <b>changing.</b> George Lanchester was now in charge, Frederick having resigned in 1913, and the engine moved further forward to a conventional position in the sporting, side-valve, 5.5-litre six-cylinder Forty but very few were made before the outbreak of World War I. A distinctive feature of the engine's valves was their use of leaf springs, rather than coil springs. Frank Lanchester ran the London sales office.|$|E

To assist them in the prototyping process the SoundRacer EVS modules have functions that will give EV manufacturers the tools to test different sounds and settings. Several files with sounds and parameter settings, such as the speed for muting the sound, sound levels and simulated <b>gear</b> <b>changing,</b> can be created with a computer program and stored on a MicroSD card. Changing sounds and settings during test drives is then performed with a touch of a button.|$|E

2500|$|Current {{systems have}} gears {{incorporated}} in the crankset or bottom bracket. Patents for such systems appeared as early as 1890. The Schlumpf Mountain Drive and Speed Drive have been available since 2001. [...] Some systems offer direct drive plus one of three variants (reduction 1:2.5, increase 1.65:1, and increase 2.5:1). Changing gears is accomplished by using your foot to tap a button protruding {{on each side of}} the bottom bracket spindle. The effect is that of having a bicycle with twin chainrings with a massive difference in sizes. Pinion GmbH introduced in 2010 an 18 speed gearbox model, offering an evenly spaced 636% range. This gearbox is actuated by traditional twist shifter and uses two cables for <b>gear</b> <b>changing.</b> The Pinion system is well suited for mountain bicycles due to its wide range and low gravity center suitable for full-suspension bikes, but it is still somewhat heavier than derailleur-based drivetrain.|$|E

5000|$|In some {{machines}} (e.g., automobiles) it {{is necessary}} to alter the gear ratio to suit the task, a process known as <b>gear</b> shifting or <b>changing</b> <b>gear.</b> There are several ways of shifting gears, for example: ...|$|R
50|$|Float {{shifting}} or floating <b>gears</b> is <b>changing</b> <b>gears</b> without depressing the clutch, {{usually on}} a non-synchronized transmission. Since the clutch is not used, {{it is easy}} to mismatch speeds of gears, and the driver can quickly cause major (and expensive) damage to the gears and the transmission.

50|$|Prim is the {{primitive}} unit in camp. Girls sleep outside on mattresses on tarps.

Two tents are put up each session: one for the campers' <b>gear</b> and <b>changing,</b> and the other for the counselors' <b>gear</b> and <b>changing.</b> If weather is poor, campers in Prim are relocated to another unit, often Tawasi.|$|R
5000|$|An [...] "{{electronic}} gear-shifting system" [...] is {{a method}} of <b>changing</b> <b>gears,</b> which enables riders to shift with electronic switches instead of using conventional control levers. The switches are connected by wire or wirelessly to a battery pack and to a small electric motor that drives the derailleur. Although expensive, an electronic system could save a racing cyclist time when <b>changing</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{arrangement}} is also sometimes {{known as a}} direct shift gearbox or powershift gearbox. It seeks to combine the advantages of a conventional manual shift with the qualities of a modern automatic transmission by providing different clutches for odd and even speed selector <b>gears.</b> When <b>changing</b> <b>gear,</b> the engine torque is transferred from one gear to the other continuously, so providing gentle, smooth gear changes without either losing power or jerking the vehicle. Gear selection may be manual, automatic (depending on throttle/speed sensors), or a 'sports' version combining both options.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to elucidate and analyze key conditions for communal acadja system on the Badagry creek in Ipokia Local Government Area of Ogun State.

The study revealed that most (86. 9 %) of the respondents were fully involved in the communal acadja with only 9 % of them participated primarily for income generation while the larger percentage of the respondents involved for subsistence. It was observed that the fishers have some degree of tenure on the area of installation because of traditional regulatory mechanism in place. However, some constraints faced by the fishers as a result of implantation of acadjas include abandon of certain fishing <b>gears,</b> <b>changing</b> of fishing grounds, small fishing grounds and destruction of fishing gears.

40|$|Health {{political}} background: In 2006, {{the prevalence}} of overweight and adiposity among children and adolescents aged three to 17 years is 15 %, 6. 3 % (800, 000) of these are obese. Scientific background: Obese children and adolescents have an increased body fat ratio. The reasons for overweight are â among others â sociocultural factors, and a low social status as determined by income and educational level of the parents. The consequences of adiposity during childhood are {{a higher risk of}} metabolic and cardiovascular diseases and increased mortality in adulthood. Possible approaches to primary prevention in children and adolescents are measures taken in schools and kindergarten, as well as education and involvement of parents. Furthermore, preventive measures <b>geared</b> towards <b>changing</b> environmental and living conditions are of particular importance. Research questions: What is the effectiveness and efficiency of different measures and programs (<b>geared</b> towards <b>changing</b> behaviour and environmental and living conditions) for primary prevention of adiposity in children and adolescents, with particular consideration of social aspects? Methods: The systematic literature search yielded 1, 649 abstracts. Following a two-part selection process with predefined criteria 31 publications were included in the assessment. Results: The majority of interventions evaluated in primary studies take place in schools. As the measures are mostly multi-disciplinary and the interventions are often not described in detail, no criteria of success for the various interventions can be extrapolated from the reviews assessed. An economic model calculation for Australia, which compares the efficiency of different interventions (although on the basis of low evidence) comes {{to the conclusion that the}} intervention with the greatest impact on society is the reduction of TV-ads geared towards children for foods and drinks rich in fat and sugar. There is a significant correlation between adiposity and socioeconomic deprivation. The lack of interventions (especially preventive measures <b>geared</b> towards <b>changing</b> environmental and living conditions) and studies focusing on this population group is noticeable. Discussion: There are only a few primary studies of high quality on adiposity prevention in children and adolescents. Especially studies which compare different measures are lacking. This holds also true for the economic analysis, which seems logical insofar, as the basis for economic analyses are usually primary studies (preferably randomized controlled trials (RCT)) due to their evidence level). Studies on interventions <b>geared</b> towards <b>changing</b> environmental and living conditions and towards specific population groups (i. e. the socially disadvantaged) are hardly available. Conclusions: There are hardly any primary studies of high quality on adiposity prevention in children and adolescents, especially studies which compare different measures are lacking. Interventions geared towards specific population groups (particularly for the socioeconomically disadvantaged) are specifically underrepresented. Establishing such studies is an essential requirement of adiposity prevention. Recommended are a combination of measures <b>geared</b> towards <b>changing</b> environmental and living conditions and towards specific population groups. Furthermore, it is recommended to systematically register future programs (preferably online) in order to be able to draft criteria of success...|$|R
