40|$|Chronic lung infections with {{opportunistic}} bacterial and fungal pathogens are <b>a</b> {{major cause}} <b>of</b> {{morbidity and mortality}} especially in patients with cystic fibrosis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most frequently colonizing bacterium in these patients, and it is often found {{in association with the}} filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. P.  aeruginosa is known to inhibit the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b>  fumigatus in <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> direct contact, suggesting the existence of interspecies communication that may influence disease outcome. Our study shows that the lung pathogens P.  aeruginosa and A.  fumigatus can interact at a distance via volatile-mediated communication and expands our understanding of interspecific signaling in microbial communities...|$|R
50|$|From the 18th {{century the}} {{population}} began to increase, {{as can be}} seen from the establishment of workers’ neighbourhoods outside the walled area. At the same time, the coastal area, now the port quarter of Cambrils, was also occupied, thanks to the construction of the Port or Moors’ Tower. For centuries living on the seashore had been fraught with danger, due to constant pirate attacks. Fishermen and others who did not have time to flee to the shelter of the walled town were often killed or kidnapped. Other small mediaeval villages such as Mas d’en Bisbe, Vilagrassa and Vilafortuny, the latter of which had its own castle and church, also suffered the ravages of the pirates, which impeded the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> their populations, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> that did not change until they were annexed to the municipality of Cambrils in the 19th century. Over time, and with the danger largely <b>a</b> thing <b>of</b> the past, the families of fishermen and seafarers began to build their houses around the Port or Moors’ Tower, thus founding the quarter that, a century later, would see the construction of the harbour, which was finished in the mid 20th century and is now the best known symbol of Cambrils.|$|R
40|$|The port is a {{compulsory}} {{meeting point}} between ships and goods; Port plays {{an essential part}} in the maritime trade of country. Despite the great important played by Seaports in Tanzania to facilitate growth trade, but still there is low rate <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> trade due to inadequate roles employed of the ports, and this hinder the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> trade. Such <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> has <b>a</b> direct impact to traders {{as well as to}} the government revenue and that could be earned from selling services and products. Therefore there is a need to study how the Dar es Salaam port facilitating the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> trade in Tanzania, The researcher was employed both qualitative and quantitative methodology in examining data. The roles of seaport in this study is to provide the Service to cargo and passengers, service to shipping lines and ships, Base for industrial developments as well as Terminal forming part of transport chain; therefore showed that the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> trade could be achieved by improving performances on Hinterland Connections, skilled labours, Technology and port and infrastructure facilities. MOT and TPA should fasten implementation of the port master plan and under high and careful supervision, and both TPA and MOT should implement the existing, or make new port policies better to improve the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> trade. Also researcher recommendations that further studies should be taken on these areas; role played by seaport <b>of</b> Tanzania as <b>a</b> whole, in facilitating <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> trade, including lake ports since this study focuses only at Dar es salaam port and a detailed study need to be undertaken to understand more causes of efficiency of seaports and the way forward...|$|R

Automatic situation recognition in complex situations enhances situation awareness of decision makers. The technical basis for achieving human situation awareness is provided through data fusion. Because of this connection, there exist unified models which combine both situation awareness and data fusion. One of these unified models is reviewed here. We also explain our interpretation of the term situation recognition and conclude that the first challenge is to find <b>a</b> suitable formalization <b>of</b> the term situation.
