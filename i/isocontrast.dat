40|$|Using Berreman 4 × 4 optical {{methods and}} {{continuum}} theory, we investigate the theoretical viewing properties {{of a potential}} homeotropically aligned biaxial nematic display switched with in-plane fields. We determine the <b>isocontrast,</b> isotransmission viewing characteristics for wide-angle viewing for in-plane switching and consider the necessary requirements for optical compensation to produce a high transmission in the bright state and low transmission in the dark state. We show how compensation can be achieved with biaxial compensation layers using a homogeneous biaxial film or from birefringence...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the parameters for the best visualization of the internal architecture of the hyaline articular cartilage a study both ex vivo and in vivo was performed. Accurate T 1 and T 2 relaxation times of articular cartilage were obtained with a particular mixed sequence and then used {{for the creation of}} <b>isocontrast</b> intensity graphs. These graphs subsequently allowed in all pulse sequences (spin echo, SE and gradient time (TR), echo time (TE) and flip angle (FA) for optimization of signal differences between MR cartilage zones. For SE sequences maximum contrast between cartilage zones can be obtained by using a long TR (> 1, 500 ms) with a short TE (400 ms) and an FA greater than 40 °. A trilaminar appearance was demonstrated with a superficial and deep hypointense ozne in all sequences and an intermediate zone that was moderately hyperintense on SET 1 -weighted images, slightly more hyperintense on proton density Rho and SE T 2 -weighted images and even more hyperintense on GRE images...|$|E
40|$|We {{observed}} that the perfect dark state problem could be solved by using orthoconic antiferroelectric liquid crystal (OAFLC) instead of normal AFLC by comparing the properties of <b>isocontrast</b> and dispersion chromaticity of W- 182 OAFLC and normal AFLC CS- 4001. We electro-optically {{observed that}} several subphases such as SmCγ*, SmC*β, SmC*α and antiferroelectric SmI*A phases exist in W- 182 OAFLC. We dielectrically observed in 4  μm thin cell that during heating, several new phases appeared. In the high temperature antiferroelectric region, a higher order than SmC* phase could be detected dielectrically, in the temperature range of 91 – 98 [*]°C, behaving similar to SmCγ* and also, another phase below SmC* region could be dielectrically detected in the temperature range of 103 – 1100 [*]°C, behaving similar to SmCα*, and an antiferroelectric, similar to SmIA* phase, was observed in the lower temperature region of the antiferroelectric phase; those are definitely arising due to surface force and interfacial charges interactions. We observed both PH and PL relaxation modes in both cells, although they differed in their strength and relaxation frequency. We studied extensively our observations of PH and PL modes in the antiferroelectric region, a Goldstone mode in the ferroelectric region and a soft mode in the ferroelectric region and SmA* phases...|$|E
