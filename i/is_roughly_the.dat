5|$|The European Southern Observatory (ESO) has {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} a planet, Beta Pictoris b, matching previous predictions, through the use of direct imagery, orbiting in the plane of the debris disk surrounding the star. This planet is currently the closest extrasolar planet to its star ever photographed: the observed separation <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> same as the distance between Saturn and the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{huge number}} of clipped coins in the Hoxne Hoard has made it {{possible}} for archaeologists to observe the process of coin-clipping in detail. The coins were evidently cut face-up to avoid damaging the portrait. The average level of clipping <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> same for coins dating from 350 onwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{recycling}} copper <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> same as {{is used to}} extract copper but requires fewer steps. High-purity scrap copper is melted in a furnace and then reduced and cast into billets and ingots; lower-purity scrap is refined by electroplating in a bath of sulfuric acid.|$|E

5|$|Because of its durability, {{titanium}} {{has become}} more popular for designer jewelry (particularly, titanium rings). Its inertness makes it {{a good choice for}} those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-carat gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> hardness of 14-carat gold and is more durable than pure 24-carat gold.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side of the temple {{courtyard}} is the Manjusri Hall (文殊殿). It was constructed in 1137 during the Jin dynasty and <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> same size as the East Hall, also measuring seven bays by four. It is located on an 83cm (2.7ft) high platform, has three front doors and one central back door, and features a single-eave hip gable roof. The interior of the hall has only four support pillars. In order to support the large roof, diagonal beams are used. On each of the four walls are murals of arhats painted in 1429 during the Ming dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic form}} of the apothecaries' system is {{essentially}} {{a subset of the}} Roman weight system. An apothecaries' pound normally consisted of 12 ounces. (In France this was changed to 16 ounces, and in Spain the customary unit was the marco, a mark of 8 ounces.) In the south of Europe and in France, the scruple was generally divided into 24 grains, so that one ounce consisted of 576 grains. Nevertheless, the subdivision of an ounce was somewhat more uniform than that of a pound, and a common feature of all variants is that 12 ounces are roughly 100 drachms (96–128 drachms) and a grain <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> weight of a physical grain.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on {{the presence or absence}} of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> size and shape of a pea, and is estimated to have more than 8,000 sensory nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|The many stamens are {{arranged}} in two series, which is a distinctive characteristic of the genus. The inner stamens are fused at the base to form a short tubular structure. The outer stamens arise from along the floral tube. The style is usually dark red and has a stigma with 6–8 lobes; the style plus stigma <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> same length as the stamens. If the flower is fertilized, a fleshy fruit forms, either smooth or with ribs. The brown or black seeds are about 1mm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} (Ailurus fulgens), {{also called the}} lesser panda, the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear, is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a {{waddling}} gait due to its shorter front legs; it <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> size of a domestic cat, though with a longer body and somewhat heavier. It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day.|$|E

5|$|Drew Karpyshyn, who {{previously}} {{served as a}} senior writer for Knights of the Old Republic, was the lead writer for Mass Effect. Despite of the fact that each of the game's planets had one primary writer, all of the writers involved in the production had to review each other's work and offer criticism. This process of collaborative feedback and individual effort is common at BioWare, and it behoved Karpyshyn to make sure the style was consistent across all different areas. One of the biggest challenges the writers faced was the amount of volume they were required to write to support the game's multiple dialogue paths and story outcomes. It took them three years to get everything into the game, which featured about 400,000 words and more than 20,000 lines of spoken dialogue. According to Karpyshyn, this <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> equivalent of 20 movies or 4-5 full novels.|$|E
5|$|The FAA granted {{approval}} for the 767-400ER to operate 180-minute ETOPS flights before it entered service. Because its fuel capacity was not increased over preceding models, the 767-400ER has a range of , less than previous extended-range 767s. This <b>is</b> <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> distance from Shenzhen to Seattle. No 767-400 version was developed, while a longer-range version, the 767-400ERX, was offered for sale in 2000 before it was cancelled a year later, leaving the 767-400ER as the sole version of the largest 767. Boeing dropped the 767-400ER and the -200ER from its pricing list in 2014. A total of 37 aircraft were delivered to the variant's two airline customers, Continental Airlines (now merged with United Airlines) and Delta Air Lines, with no unfilled orders. All 37 examples of the -400ER were in service in July 2016. One additional example was produced as a military testbed, and later sold as a VIP transport. The type's closest competitor is the Airbus A330-200.|$|E
