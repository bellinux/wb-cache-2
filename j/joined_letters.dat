They wrote in a form of the Aramaic alphabet, which continued to evolve; it separated into two forms: one intended for inscriptions (known as [...] "monumental Nabataean") and the other, more cursive and hurriedly written and with <b>joined</b> <b>letters,</b> for writing on papyrus.

25|$|The long ij extends {{below the}} {{baseline}} {{and is therefore}} written with a long stroke. Even in handwriting that does not <b>join</b> <b>letters,</b> it is often written as a single sign.|$|R
25|$|Another {{theory is}} that IJ might have arisen from the {{lowercase}} y being split into two strokes in handwriting. At {{some time in the}} 15th or 16th century, this combination began to be spelled as a ligature ij.

40|$|The {{need for}} secure {{communication}} methods has significantly increased with {{the explosive growth}} {{of the internet and}} mobile communications. The usage of text documents has doubled several times over the past years especially with mobile devices. In this paper we propose a new steganography algorithm for Arabic text. The algorithm employs some letters that can be <b>joined</b> with other <b>letters.</b> These letters are the extension letter, Kashida and Zero width character. The extension letter, Kashida, does not have any change in the word meaning if <b>joined</b> to other <b>letters.</b> Also, the Zero width character (Ctrl+ Shift + 1) does not change the meaning. The new proposed algorithm, Zero Width and Kashidha Letters (ZKS), mitigate the possibility to be discovered by steganoanalysis through using parallel connection and permutation function...|$|R
50|$|In {{the course}} of its use, the Latin {{alphabet}} was adapted for use in new languages, sometimes representing phonemes not found in languages that were already written with the Roman characters. To represent these new sounds, extensions were therefore created, be it by adding diacritics to existing <b>letters,</b> by <b>joining</b> multiple <b>letters</b> together to make ligatures, by creating completely new forms, or by assigning a special function to pairs or triplets of letters. These new forms are given {{a place in the}} alphabet by defining an alphabetical order or collation sequence, which can vary with the particular language.|$|R

50|$|Getty-Dubay is {{a modern}} version of Italic script {{developed}} in 1976 by Barbara Getty and Inga Dubay to ease the transition to cursive. Other than strokes to <b>join</b> the <b>letters,</b> only the lower-case letter 'k' and a few upper-case letters have forms different from their printed equivalents. Reportedly, about one-third of American homeschoolers (and about 7% of USA schoolchildren generally) now learn Getty-Dubay rather than conventional manuscript-then-cursive handwriting styles. Getty-Dubay books were previously published by Portland State University and are now self-published by the authors and Allport Editions. Another modern Italic handwriting curriculum used in the USA, similar to Getty-Dubay in many respects, is Barchowsky Fluent Handwriting.|$|R

50|$|Italic {{script is}} {{based largely on}} Humanist minuscule, which itself draws on Carolingian minuscule. The capital letters {{are the same as}} the Humanist capitals, modeled on Roman square capitals. The Italian scholar Niccolò de' Niccoli was {{dissatisfied}} with the lowercase forms of Humanist minuscule, finding it too slow to write. In response, he created the Italic script, which incorporates features and techniques characteristic of a quickly written hand: oblique forms, fewer strokes per character, and the <b>joining</b> of <b>letters.</b> Perhaps the most significant change to any single character was to the form of the a, which he simplified from the two-story form to the one-story form ⟨ɑ⟩ now ubiquitous to most handwriting styles.|$|R

40|$|Design {{support for}} {{typeface}} design: collaborative work commissioned by Adobe, Inc. Published 2011. The original Bickham typeface {{was based on}} the hands of the 18 th century writing master George Bickham. The ornate script represented the apogee of the art of formal writing with a steel nib, and defined the visual style for decorated, formal documents. In 2010 Adobe revised and extended the typeface, with the express purpose of making it a showcase for OpenType technology, demonstrating the visual importance of using different glyph forms in different contexts, employing contextual substitution rules. Although Bickham had published a single example of a Greek style, it was a standalone exercise, never intended to match the Latin. The key challenge was to identify historical records for appropriate Greek writing, preferably by writers familiar with the language, adapt them for digital typography and the particularities of contextual substitution, in a manner that would not make the Greek a ‘second-class citizen’. Research involved uncovering and analysing appropriate contemporary and later writing examples to identify both the range of writing styles of the period, and the manner of <b>joining</b> <b>letters</b> in written Greek with both pointed pens and broad nibs. This work was essential {{to make up for the}} comparative lack of relevant material by Bickham, as well as investigating the possible range of stylistic variants that were approved for the final typeface, which attempted to emulate a written texture through complex substitutions. This aspect of the work is highly original for implementing a substantial number of contextual alternates and ligatures. These were reviewed in the context of use, bringing together an analysis of occurring letter combinations and patterns, and the design of stylistic alternates to imitate natural handwriting...|$|R

50|$|Some of {{the letters}} of the script may easily be confounded. In order to reduce ambiguities a small oblique stroke is added at the lower right end as a diacritic. It resembles Halanta (Virāma) but it is <b>joined</b> to the <b>letter,</b> whereas Halanta is not joined. When the {{consonant}} forms a vowel ligature by which the lower right end is affected, this stroke is shifted to another position. This applies also to consonant ligatures bearing the stroke (see table of consonant ligatures).|$|R

By extension, the term was also used for a uniquely set and arranged typeface or colophon.
