5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} {{is mounted on}} the {{combustion}} chamber coolant bypass duct of each <b>engine.</b> The <b>engine</b> controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature.

For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E

5|$|After version 1.0 {{had been}} finished, the engine's code name White <b>Engine</b> {{was changed to}} the {{official}} title Crystal Tools.

5|$|<b>Engine</b> failure causes {{problems}} on conventional subsonic aircraft; {{not only does}} the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the <b>engine</b> creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank {{in the direction of the}} failed <b>engine.</b> If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties. During an <b>engine</b> failure the required air intake is virtually zero. So, on Concorde, <b>engine</b> failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the <b>engine,</b> gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double <b>engine</b> failure.|$|E

5|$|Operating an {{air-breathing}} jet <b>engine</b> at velocities {{of up to}} Mach5.5 poses numerous engineering problems; several previous engines {{proposed by}} other designers have worked well as jet engines, but performed poorly as rockets. This <b>engine</b> design aims {{to be a good}} jet <b>engine</b> within the atmosphere, as well as being an excellent rocket <b>engine</b> outside; however, the conventional problem posed by operating at Mach5.5 has been that the air coming into the <b>engine</b> rapidly heats up as it is compressed into the engine; due to certain thermodynamic effects, this greatly reduces the thrust that can be produced by burning fuel. Attempts to avoid these issues has typically resulted in the <b>engine</b> being much heavier (scramjets/ramjets) or has greatly reduced the thrust generated (conventional turbojets/ramjets); in either of these scenarios, the end result would be an <b>engine</b> that possesses a poor thrust to weight ratio at high speeds, which in turn would be too heavy to assist much in reaching orbit.|$|E
