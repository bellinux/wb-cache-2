5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a <b>dedicated</b> <b>system</b> also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In WCDMA systems, in {{particular}} {{with the introduction of}} high-speed multimedia services, the demand for good indoor coverage will become important. Overlaying macro cells can provide a sufficient level of general indoor coverage for most of the cases. However, {{in order to be able}} to provide WCDMA indoor coverage and capacity within traffic hot spots, such as airports, shopping malls and large office buildings, the deployment of <b>dedicated</b> in-building <b>systems</b> may be required. In this paper, the gain of deploying <b>dedicated</b> in-building <b>systems</b> in terms of HSDPA indoor coverage and capacity is studied; first, with a simple analytical reasoning and after that, with advanced system simulations. The results show that the HSDPA performance can be improved considerably within the indoor hotspot area by deploying a <b>dedicated</b> in-building <b>system.</b> The results also demonstrate how a <b>dedicated</b> in-building <b>system</b> can off-load the overlaying macro cell, and as a result of that, improve the grade of service considerably for the co-existing non-HSDPA users.

50|$|The main {{difference}} between TAAS and ASIC is that, {{in case of}} ASIC, the transistor is usually designed into fixed circuitry for specific task. For a <b>dedicated</b> <b>system</b> function, ASIC offers the best design efficiency (minimum transistor count, minimum power consumption). However for SoC which integrates multiple systems on a chip, different silicon IPs need to be integrated usually by putting them together that abut each other. Due to divide-and-conquer design approach adopted by ASIC, transistors between different systems are not shared.
