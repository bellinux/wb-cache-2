5|$|Ford reluctantly {{agreed to}} run for office in 1976, but <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to counter a {{challenge}} for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{joined the}} Corps in October 1916 as an air {{mechanic}} and after training was posted to London, then Norfolk; at <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> time {{to appear in}} charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined 110 Squadron which remained in England despite plans {{to send it to}} France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord's. In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF. Even so, some of his family remained critical and felt that the worst of the war was over when Hobbs went to France. He was demobilised in February 1919.|$|E
5|$|The first {{opportunity}} {{of the match}} came in the fifth minute when Kerala Blasters midfielder, Iain Hume, put Michael Chopra through on goal only for Josemi to deny Chopra with a last-minute tackle. The Blasters then had the second realistic chance of the match five minutes later when Pulga received {{the ball in the}} box from Saumik Dey but his shot went out for a corner after a deflection off Atlético's Borja Fernández. The pressure continued to mount on Atlético de Kolkata as their goalkeeper Apoula Edel was forced into action; <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to punch away a direct free-kick from Stephen Pearson before Ishfaq Ahmed's shot moments later was caught by the keeper. Atlético de Kolkata had their first major chance of the match in the 26th minute when Arnal put Mohammed Rafi through on goal, only for Nirmal Chettri to make a last-ditch tackle to keep the score level. The score would remain 0–0 going into half time.|$|E

5|$|The {{governmental}} {{structure of}} the newly formed Confederate States of America was very much {{like that of the}} parent United States. The executive branch was partitioned into several departments, each headed by a secretary or equivalent who would advise the president. The constitution provided for a navy that would be directed by its own department, and President Jefferson Davis nominated Mallory to be Confederate States Secretary of the Navy. He was chosen for two principal reasons: <b>first,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> extensive experience with nautical affairs, both in his boyhood home of Key West and later in Washington; and second, he was from Florida. In a bow to the principle of States' Rights, Davis had to spread representation in his cabinet around among the seceding states. Although the requirement of geographical representation sometimes meant that the occupant would not be the best person available, the selection process worked well in Mallory's case.|$|E
25|$|Scott's {{departure}} from politics {{by this time}} was virtually certain, for 2 main reasons. <b>First,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> become increasingly prone to bouts of depression – with his outburst against his own pastor, Murdoch Mackinnon, during the debate about educational policy, serving as indication to the province {{that he was no}} longer entirely up for the job of premier.|$|E
25|$|During the 1840s, Macaulay {{undertook}} {{his most}} famous work, The History of England from the Accession of James the Second, publishing the first two volumes in 1848. At <b>first,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> planned to bring his history down to the reign of George III. After publication of his first two volumes, his hope was to complete his work {{with the death of}} Queen Anne in 1714.|$|E

25|$|When the {{revolution}} collapsed, Heine resumed his oppositional stance. At <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> some hope Louis Napoleon {{might be a}} good leader in France but he soon began to share the opinion of Marx towards him as the new emperor began to crack down on liberalism and socialism. In 1848 Heine also returned to religious faith. In fact, he had never claimed to be an atheist. Nevertheless, he remained sceptical of organised religion.|$|E
25|$|Captain Eden, as he {{was still}} known, was {{selected}} to contest Spennymoor, as a Conservative. At <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> hoped to win (with some Liberal support as the Conservatives were still supporting Lloyd George's coalition government) {{but by the time}} of the November 1922 general election it was clear that the surge in the Labour vote made this unlikely. His main sponsor was the Marquess of Londonderry, a local coalowner. The seat went from Liberal to Labour.|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} started by Carl Severin Andrée and Gustaf Allan Rosenqvist. Andrée was an {{engineer}} originally from Gothenburg, Sweden, and lived {{for a few years}} in USA before moving to Turku 1898. <b>First</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> worked for Turun Rauta-teollisuus Oy until 1905 and then he started selling boat engines in department store Wiklund. He was particularly interested in boats and engines. He bought the boat department with his brother-in-law, Gustaf Allan Rosenqvist, in 1906. Rosenqvist, born in Turku, was then just 21-year-old and he had a business degree.|$|E

25|$|By 1871, Whistler {{returned}} to portraits and soon produced {{his most famous}} painting, the nearly monochromatic full-length figure entitled Arrangement in Grey and Black No.1, but usually (and incorrectly) referred to as Whistler's Mother. A model failed to appear one day, according to a letter from his mother, so Whistler turned {{to his mother and}} suggested that he do her portrait. In his typically slow and experimental way, at <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> her stand, but that proved too tiring so the famous seated pose was adopted. It took dozens of sittings to complete.|$|E
25|$|His father, who had {{charge of}} the king's {{military}} chest and was Treasurer of the Office of Public Works and Fortifications in Turin, should have maintained a good social position and wealth, but before his son grew up he had lost most of his property in speculations. A career as a lawyer was planned out for Lagrange by his father, and certainly Lagrange seems to have accepted this willingly. He studied at the University of Turin and his favourite subject was classical Latin. At <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no great enthusiasm for mathematics, finding Greek geometry rather dull.|$|E
25|$|On 10 August 1948 it was {{announced}} that Sir Alexander Maxwell was to retire at the end of September, and that Newsam had been appointed to follow him as Permanent Secretary at the Home Office. In effect this was a delayed promotion; Newsam was already 54, and might easily have reached the rank earlier. At <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to deal with Chuter Ede as Home Secretary, with whom he had an uneasy relationship (Ede was believed not to trust Newsam's judgment). With Ede maintaining control over the department, Newsam had to deal with routine matters including presenting evidence to the Royal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and Gaming.|$|E

25|$|For Verdi, {{the years}} 1851 to 1853 {{were filled with}} operatic activity. <b>First,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> agreed with the {{librettist}} Salvadore Cammarano on a subject for what would become Il trovatore, but work on this opera could not proceed while the composer was writing Rigoletto, which premiered in Venice in March 1851. In addition, personal affairs in his home town limited his activities that spring, but after Rigolettos success in Venice, an additional commission was offered by Brenna, the secretary of La Fenice. After Verdi's return from Paris a contract was signed in May 1852, with performances scheduled for March 1853, although no subject was chosen at that time.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to right}} shin and left ankle ailments, Hansbrough missed four games {{early on in}} the 2008–09 season, the <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> missed as a Tar Heel. On December 18, 2008, in a home game against Evansville, Hansbrough broke North Carolina's all-time career scoring record, surpassing a 30-year-old mark held by Phil Ford (2,290 points). Ten days later, Hansbrough grabbed his 1,000th career rebound in a game against Rutgers, {{becoming}} one of seven UNC players to record 1,000 career rebounds. On February 28, 2009, Hansbrough made his 906th career free throw in UNC's 104–74 win over Georgia Tech, breaking Dickie Hemric's (Wake Forest) NCAA record, set in 1955. Hansbrough finished his career with 982 made free throws.|$|E
25|$|After the Yongle Emperor's {{overthrow}} of the Jianwen Emperor, China's countryside was devastated. The fragile new economy {{had to deal with}} low production and depopulation. The Yongle Emperor laid out a long and extensive plan to strengthen and stabilise the new economy, but <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to silence dissension. He created an elaborate system of censors to remove corrupt officials from office that spread such rumors. The emperor dispatched some of his most trusted officers to reveal or destroy secret societies, bandits, and loyalists to his other relatives. To strengthen the economy, he fought population decline by reclaiming land, utilising the most he could from the existing labour force, and maximising textile and agricultural production.|$|E

He gathered his followers in Mbomwe church, the <b>first</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> built after his return from the United States, to give them final instructions for the rising. He did not accompany his men on their attacks, but divided them into several groups with different tasks. Two groups were sent north to attack the A L Bruce Estates with orders to kill all European men and bring back the head of William Jervis Livingstone, but not to harm any women. Most of the remaining men were to head south towards Blantyre, the commercial centre of the protectorate.|$|E
25|$|Dutch {{officers}} were gradually replaced with officers from Austria-Hungary and Germany, {{who arrived in}} Durrës on July 4. Soon the First World War broke out and by August 4 most of Dutch officers returned to Netherlands. In autumn 1914 Essad Pasha decided to accept invitation of Senate of the Central Albania to return to Albania {{to take over the}} power. <b>First,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to provide financial backing for his government. Therefore, he travelled to Niš, Kingdom of Serbia, where he and Serbian prime minister Pašić signed the secret treaty of Serbian-Albanian alliance on September 17, 1914. In October 1914 Essad Pasha returned to Albania. With Italian and Serbian financial backing he established armed forces in Dibër and captured the interior of Albania, including Dures.|$|E
25|$|Upon Stewart's arrival {{by train}} in Los Angeles, Fonda greeted {{him at the}} station {{and took him to}} Fonda's studio-supplied lodging, next door to Greta Garbo. Stewart's first job at the studio was as a {{participant}} in screen tests with newly arrived starlets. At <b>first,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> trouble being cast in Hollywood films owing to his gangling looks and shy, humble screen presence. Aside from an unbilled appearance in a Shemp Howard comedy short called Art Trouble in 1934, his first film was the poorly received Spencer Tracy vehicle The Murder Man (1935). Rose Marie (1936), an adaptation of a popular operetta, was more successful. After having mixed success in films, he received his first intensely dramatic role in 1936's After the Thin Man, and played Jean Harlow's character's frustrated boyfriend in the Clark Gable vehicle Wife vs. Secretary earlier that same year.|$|E
