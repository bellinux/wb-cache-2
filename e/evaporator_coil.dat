2500|$|The vapor-compression {{cycle is}} used in most {{household}} refrigerators {{as well as in}} many large commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system. [...] The thermodynamics of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as Freon enters the compressor as a vapor. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is compressed at constant entropy and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature, but still below the vapor pressure at that temperature. From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4, the vapor travels through the condenser which cools the vapor until it starts condensing, and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. Between points 4 and 5, the liquid refrigerant goes through the expansion valve (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing flash evaporation and auto-refrigeration of, typically, {{less than half of the}} liquid. [...] That results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure as shown at point 5. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the <b>evaporator</b> <b>coil</b> or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the <b>evaporator</b> <b>coil</b> or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet at point 1 to complete the thermodynamic cycle.|$|E

25|$|As {{with any}} piece of {{equipment}} that depends on coils to transfer heat between air and a fluid, {{it is important for}} both the condenser and <b>evaporator</b> <b>coils</b> to be kept clean. If deposits of dust and other debris are allowed to accumulate on the coils, the efficiency of the unit (both in heating and cooling modes) will suffer.|$|R
50|$|In {{a cooling}} {{condensation}} type atmospheric water generator, a compressor circulates refrigerant through a condenser {{and then an}} <b>evaporator</b> <b>coil</b> which cools the air surrounding it. This lowers the air temperature to its dew point, causing water to condense. A controlled-speed fan pushes filtered air over the coil. The resulting water is then passed into a holding tank with purification and filtration system {{to help keep the}} water pure and reduce the risk posed by viruses and bacteria which may be collected from the ambient air on the <b>evaporator</b> <b>coil</b> by the condensing water.|$|E
5000|$|An {{internal}} {{heat exchanger}} {{is simply a}} type of heat exchanger that uses the cold gas leaving the <b>evaporator</b> <b>coil</b> to cool the high-pressure liquid that is headed into {{the beginning of the}} <b>evaporator</b> <b>coil</b> via an expansion device. The gas is used to chill a chamber that normally has a series of pipes for the liquid running through it. The superheated gas then proceeds on to the compressor. The subcooling term refers to cooling the liquid below its boiling point. [...] of subcooling means it is 10 °F colder than boiling at a given pressure. As it represents a difference of temperatures, the subcooling value won’t change if it is measured on the absolute scale, or the relative scale (10 °F of subcooling equals 10 R K of subcooling).|$|E
50|$|Warm {{air systems}} {{distribute}} heated air through duct work systems {{of supply and}} return air through metal or fiberglass ducts.

25|$|Seawater {{is pumped}} into an evaporator, {{where it is}} boiled by a heating coil. Vapour {{produced}} is then compressed, raising its temperature. This heated vapour is used to heat the <b>evaporator</b> <b>coils.</b> Condensate from the coil outlet provides the fresh water supply. To start the cycle, an electric pre-heater is used to heat the first water supply. The main energy input to the plant is in mechanically driving the compressor, not as heat energy.|$|R
50|$|Under certain {{conditions}} of temperature and humidity, ice can form on a refrigeration dehumidifier's <b>evaporator</b> <b>coils.</b> The ice buildup can impede airflow and eventually form a solid block encasing the coils. This buildup prevents the dehumidifier from operating effectively, {{and can cause}} water damage if condensed water drips off the accumulated ice and not into the collection tray. In extreme cases, the ice can deform or distort mechanical elements, causing permanent damage.|$|R
50|$|In a car {{equipped}} with air conditioning, outside air is first forced {{through the air}} conditioner's <b>evaporator</b> <b>coil.</b> This {{can be thought of}} as a heater core filled with very cold gas, which cools rather than heats the incoming air. In order to obtain the desired temperature incoming air may first be cooled by the air conditioning and then heated again by the heater core. In a vehicle fitted with manual controls for the heater and air conditioning compressor, using both systems together will dehumidify the air in the cabin, as the <b>evaporator</b> <b>coil</b> removes moisture from the air due to condensation. This can result in increased air comfort levels inside the vehicle. Automatic temperature control systems can take the best course of action depending upon the external air temperature, the internal one and the cabin air temperature value or a rapid defrost effect requested by the user.|$|E
50|$|Dehumidification (air drying) {{in an air}} {{conditioning}} system {{is provided by the}} evaporator.

Small diameter coils can withstand higher pressures required by the new generation of environmentally friendlier refrigerants. They have lower material costs because they require less refrigerant, fin, and coil materials. And they enable the design of smaller and lighter high-efficiency air conditioners and refrigerators because the <b>evaporators</b> and condensers <b>coils</b> are smaller and lighter.|$|R

BACKGROUND Indoor corrosion failures of aluminum-finned copper-tube <b>evaporator</b> <b>coils,</b> sometimes without aluminum fins, is a menacing issue in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) industry. Of note, significantly from Japanese research, is the conclusion that approximately 10 % of all premature failures of copper tube result from a very localized form of corrosion known as formicary or “ant nest” corrosion. Based on this fact alone, the HVAC industry worldwide has recognized that formicary corrosion, albeit not identified as such in most instances, accounts for many premature failures in copper products.

50|$|Because an air {{conditioner}} moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean.

50|$|A common {{variation}} {{of this problem}} is determining the final humidity of air leaving an air conditioner <b>evaporator</b> <b>coil</b> then heated to a higher temperature. Assume that the temperature leaving the coil is 10°C (50°F) and is heated to room temperature (not mixed with room air), which is found by following the horizontal humidity ratio from the dew point or saturation line to the room dry bulb temperature line and reading the relative humidity. In typical practice the conditioned air is mixed with room air that is being infiltrated with outside air.|$|E
50|$|A {{conventional}} {{air conditioner}} {{is very similar}} to a mechanical/refrigeration dehumidifier and inherently acts as a dehumidifier when chilling the air. In an air conditioner, however, the air passes over the cold <b>evaporator</b> <b>coils</b> and then directly into the room. It is not re-heated by passing over the condenser, as in a refrigeration dehumidifier. Instead, the refrigerant is pumped by the compressor to a condenser which is located outside the room to be conditioned, and the heat is then released to the outside air. Conventional air conditioners use additional energy exhausting air outside, and new air can have more moisture than the room needs, such as a pool room that already holds a high amount of moisture in the air.|$|R
50|$|All modern air {{conditioning}} systems, even small window package units, {{are equipped with}} internal air filters.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over <b>evaporator</b> <b>coils,</b> which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.|$|R
