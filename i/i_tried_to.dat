5|$|If I {{wanted to}} get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I would offer up. I think it's because it is to me the least flawed; let me put it that way.

Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff {{out of my head}} and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the right amount of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E

5|$|Meyer {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} companion book to Twilight called Midnight Sun, {{which would be the}} story of Twilight told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that Twilight was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of Midnight Sun's first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, If <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely. Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.|$|E
5|$|The {{titles and}} styling of Her Excellency The Rev. Sir Doctor Stephen Tyrone Mos Def Colbert, D.F.A., Heavyweight Champion of the World✱✱ {{featuring}} Flo Rida La Premiere Dame De France are mostly for comedic reasons. Colbert became an ordained minister on June 2, 2011, granting himself {{the title of}} Reverend. Colbert was mock-knighted by Queen Noor of Jordan on April 7, 2009, bestowing him with the title of Sir. He was granted an honorary doctorate of fine arts by Knox College in 2006, giving him the title of Doctor {{and use of the}} suffix D.F.A. (Doctor of Fine Arts). This title is featured regularly during his segments Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, DFA. Yasiin Bey gave Colbert the use of his stage name Mos Def on October 5, 2011. Colbert was set to interview Mike Tyson on July 23, 2013. Tyson did not appear which led Colbert to declare himself Heavy Weight Champion of the World and grant himself use of the title. The large asterisk in the title is to denote that he did not defeat Tyson in a boxing match. The suffix featuring Flo Rida was added during the segment <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> sign up for Obamacare on October 23, 2013, where his name on the ACA form said featuring Flo Rida. Her Excellency was added to the title as Colbert was seated next to Michelle Obama at the White House state dinner in February 2014, in which the President of France François Hollande was not accompanied by a partner. Because it is customary that the first lady of a visiting nation is seated next to the First Lady of the United States, Colbert proclaimed himself First Lady of France on February 12, 2014.|$|E

25|$|Russia {{was able}} to {{mobilize}} a larger army but could not put all of it into action simultaneously.

Yet, he continued his occupation of Brandenburgian territories and by 1320 controlled Havelland, Teltow, Barnim, Zauche and Lower Lusatia. Like Wartislaw IV, Rudolf <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> take young Henry into custody, and probably managed to do so in early 1320. Henry died in the summer of 1320. In anticipation of a possible take-over of Brandenburg by a rival who then could claim Pomerania as a Brandenburgian fief, the Pomeranian dukes took their duchy as a fief from the bishops of Cammin the same year.|$|E
