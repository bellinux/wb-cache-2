Storke explained:The railroad refused to pay its taxes. So, during 1884, a special session of legislature was called, for the purpose of devising ways and means to enforce payment. ... Various measures were introduced, including one ... which provided that, ... stocks and bonds of railroad corporations were to be assessed on market value as shown by state stock <b>exchange</b> <b>quotation.</b> This was intended ... as a method of arriving at the real worth of the railroad, so it could be properly assessed. ...

40|$|A spin model {{relating}} physical {{to financial}} variables is presented. This {{work is the}} first to introduce the concept of negative absolute temperature into stock market dynamics by establishing a rigorous formal analogy between physical and financial variables. Based on this model, an algorithm evaluating negative temperatures was applied to an analysis of New York Stock <b>Exchange</b> <b>quotations</b> from November 2002 up to the present. We found that the magnitude of negative temperature peaks correlates with subsequent index movement. Moreover, a certain autocorrelation function decays as temperature increases. An effort was directed to the search for patterns similar to known physical processes, since the model hypotheses pointed to the possibility of such a similarity. A number of cases resembling known processes in phenomenological thermodynamics were found, namely, population inversion and the magneto-caloric effect.

Violent swings on the foreign exchange markets and greatest uncertainty of interest rates plead for a more frequent use of currency cocktails international operators. Both the Ecu and the SDR should have been more present in international finance. This article presents and analyses two international transactions in which the SDR was selected as unit of account: the first one is a syndicated loan to the Kingdom of Sweden and the second one a syndicated loan to the Republic of the Ivory Coast. A comparison of the two credits is presented and their differences are exposed. The author concludes that the SDR could be, in practice, very different from a private transaction to the next. Additional clauses are required when a currency cocktail is selected for a euro-credit : the definition of the SDR, the definition of the dollar-value of the SDR, the difficulty of the calculation of the interest rates, the problems of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>quotations</b> make additional clauses necessary.

The {{aim of this}} paper was to analyze the phenomenon of business combinations under common control (BCUCC) with emphasis on the Italian experience, focusing on information deduced from a sample of Italian financial statements and comparing them {{with each other and with}} the same number of European listed companies. We started from a theoretical analysis of the phenomenon, contextualizing it within the IAS/IFRS framework, and discussing the different visions and possible solutions that have been suggested by other important national and international organizations (US GAAP, Assirevi, China GAAP), and then proceeded to analyze the financial statements of the most important Italian companies in detail. We subsequently considered the two different methodologies for accounting, delineating the analogies and differences between them, in an attempt to investigate the reasons why one of them could be preferable to the other and the different effects of each on consolidated financial statements. Finally we analyzed the different informational needs of users of the financial statement compared with cases of “normal ” business combinations.

This article investigates the impact of MiFID's trade transparency rules on the trading volume of EU equity markets in a forward-looking mode. We use data extracted from the closest possible precedent and examine trading volume levels before and after trading in FTSE 100 stocks on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) shifted from the quote-driven Stock <b>Exchange</b> Automatic <b>Quotation</b> System (SEAQ) to the order-driven securities electronic trading service (SETS). This change resulted in significantly increased transparency standards. Trading volume is measured {{on the basis of}} three criteria: volume-based turnover, value-based turnover and turnover ratio. No evidence is found indicating that higher transparency standards lead per se to higher levels of trading volume. Therefore, the impact of MiFID's transparency rules on trading volume in EU equity markets should become a matter of further study following their implementation. trading volume; London Stock Exchange; LSE; MiFID; multilateral trading facilities; MTFs; transparency standards; regulated markets; Stock <b>Exchange</b> Automatic <b>Quotation</b> System; SEAQ; securities electronic trading service; SETS; systematic internalisers; financial instruments markets; EU directive; EU equity markets; European Union; FTSE 100 stocks. ...|$|R
