40|$|A {{significant}} flight hazard {{associated with}} liquid propellants, {{such as those}} used in the upper stage of NASA's new Ares I launch vehicle, {{is the possibility of}} leakage of hazardous fluids resulting in a catastrophic fire/explosion. The enclosed and vented interstage of the Ares I contains numerous oxidizer and <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> as well as ignition sources. The potential for fire/explosion due to leaks during ascent depends on the relative concentrations of hazardous and inert fluids within the interstage along with other variables such as pressure, temperature, leak rates, and fluid outgasing rates. This analysis improves on previous NASA Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) estimates of the probability of deflagration, in which many of the variables pertinent to the problem were not explicitly modeled as a function of time.

50|$|As the MA-5 capsule {{reached the}} Canton Island station, Mercury Control {{realized}} that the attitude control system was malfunctioning. A metal chip in a <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> had caused one of the clockwise roll thrusters to fail. The failed thruster allowed the spacecraft to drift from its normal attitude. This drift caused the automatic stabilization and control system to correct the spacecraft attitude. The spacecraft would swing back into the normal 34-degree orbital attitude, and the sequence would start again. The spacecraft repeated this drift and correction process nine times before retrofire. It did it once more between retrofire and the receipt of the 0.05 g (0.49 m/sÂ²) light telemetry signal. The remaining thrusters used 9.5 lb of fuel to keep the spacecraft properly aligned during the second orbit.

40|$|An initial {{appraisal}} is made {{of results}} of two studies of the ground requirements of liquid hydrogen (LH 2) air transports.

50|$|Fuel {{is pumped}} from the tank {{to a large}} control valve called a fuel {{distributor}}, which divides the single <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> from the tank into smaller lines, one for each injector. The fuel distributor is mounted atop a control vane through which all intake air must pass, and the system works by varying fuel volume supplied to the injectors based on {{the angle of the}} air vane in the air flow meter, which in turn is determined by the volume of air passing the vane, and by the control pressure. The control pressure is regulated with a mechanical device called the control pressure regulator (CPR) or the warm-up regulator (WUR). Depending on the model, the CPR may be used to compensate for altitude, full load, and/or a cold engine. The injectors are simple spring-loaded check valves with nozzles; once fuel system pressure becomes high enough to overcome the counterspring, the injectors begin spraying.|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Electronic Fuel Control (EFC) valve regulates {{fuel flow}} to the {{injector}} <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> in the Cummins Pressure Time (PT) fuel system. The EFC system controls the fuel flow {{by means of a}} variable orifice that is electrically actuated. The supplier of the EFC valves inspects all parts before they are sent out. Their inspection test results provide a characteristic curve which shows the relationship between pressure and current provided to the EFC valve. This curve documents the steady state characteristics of the valve but does not adequately capture its dynamic response. A dynamic test procedure is developed in order to evaluate the performance of the EFC valves. The test itself helps to understand the effects that proposed design changes will have on the stability of the overall engine system. A by product of this test is the ability to evaluate returned EFC valves that have experienced stability issues. The test determines whether an EFC valve is faulted or not before it goes out to prime time use. The characteristics of a good valve and bad valve can be observed after the dynamic test. In this thesis, a mathematical model has been combined with experimental research to investigate and understand the behavior of the characteristics of different types of EFC valves. The model takes into account the dynamics of the electrical and mechanical portions of the EFC valves. System Identification has been addressed to determine the transfer functions of the different types of EFC valves that were experimented. Methods have been used both in frequency domain as well as time domain. Also, based on the characteristic patterns exhibited by the EFC valves, fuzzy logic has been implemented for the use of pattern classification...|$|E

Terminals can offer an alternative approach for the fleet management of <b>fuel</b> <b>supplies</b> in terms of smoothing the unbalanced fleet use towards more even year-round operations. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the supply costs of a conventional direct forest chip supply to an alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> with the use of a feed-in terminal using the discrete-event simulation method. The influences of the terminal location, terminal investment cost, outbound terminal transport method, terminal truck utilization and quality changes of terminal-stored forest chips for the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> cost were studied in the case environment. By introducing a feed-in terminal and a shuttle truck for the transports of terminal-stored forest chips, the total supply cost was 1. 4 % higher than the direct <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> scenario. In terminal scenarios, the supply costs increased 1 â 2 % if the cost of the terminal investment increased 30 %, the distance to the terminal increased from 5 to 30 km or the total annual use of a terminal truck decreased 1500 h. Moreover, a 1 per cent point per month increase in the dry matter loss of terminal stored chips increased the total supply cost 1 %. The study revealed that with the relatively low additional cost, the feed-in terminal can be introduced to the conventional forest chip supply. Cost compensation can be gained through the higher annual use of a <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> fleet and more secured <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> to power plants by decreasing the need for supplement fuel, which can be more expensive at a time of the highest fuel demand...|$|R

The method also takes into account the flow Mach number in the supplying pipes, which can be non negligible because of their reduced diameter.
