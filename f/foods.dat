40|$|Global <b>food</b> aid is {{considered}} a critical consumption smoothing mechanism in many countries. However, its record of stabilizing consumption has been mixed. This paper examines the cyclical properties of <b>food</b> aid with respect to <b>food</b> availability in recipient countries, {{with a view to}} assessing its impact on consumption in some 150 developing countries and transition economies, covering 1970 to 2000. The results show that global <b>food</b> aid has been allocated to countries most in need. <b>Food</b> aid has also been countercyclical within countries with the greatest need. However, for most countries, <b>food</b> aid is not countercyclical. The amount of <b>food</b> aid provided is also insufficient to mitigate contemporaneous shortfalls in consumption.

25|$|The next {{pillar of}} <b>food</b> {{security}} is <b>food</b> utilization, {{which refers to}} the metabolism of <b>food</b> by individuals. Once <b>food</b> is obtained by a household, {{a variety of factors}} affect {{the quantity and quality of}} <b>food</b> that reaches members of the household. In order to achieve <b>food</b> security, the <b>food</b> ingested must be safe and must be enough to meet the physiological requirements of each individual. <b>Food</b> safety affects <b>food</b> utilization, and can be affected by the preparation, processing, and cooking of <b>food</b> in the community and household. Nutritional values of the household determine <b>food</b> choice, and whether <b>food</b> meets cultural preferences is important to utilization in terms of psychological and social well-being. Access to healthcare is another determinant of <b>food</b> utilization, since the health of individuals controls how the <b>food</b> is metabolized. For example, intestinal parasites can take nutrients from the body and decrease <b>food</b> utilization. Sanitation can also decrease the occurrence and spread of diseases that can affect <b>food</b> utilization.

30|$|Despite {{the variety}} of <b>food</b> {{security}} indicators {{that exist in the}} literature, there is lack of consensus on the core household <b>food</b> security indicators that are needed to adequately measure and monitor <b>food</b> security situation around the world both at the micro- and macro-level (Carletto et al. 2013), given that these indicators only focus on one dimension at a time. The absence of an all-encompassing indicator of <b>food</b> security limits the extent to which panoptic <b>food</b> security policies can be made from existing studies. For example, the use of crop yield indicates availability; <b>food</b> consumption and <b>food</b> expenditure denote <b>food</b> accessibility; dietary diversity, anthropometric measures, and <b>food</b> consumption score reflect <b>food</b> utilization; and coping strategy index represents <b>food</b> sustainability among others. The implication of this is that the choice among available <b>food</b> security indicators involves a trade-off, as concept of <b>food</b> security is inherently hierarchical (Barret 2010).
