Material and Methods—In-line pressure transducer measurements of mean Rfilter across PRs with nominal Rfilter of 29. 4 Pa, 58. 8 Pa and 88. 2 Pa (measured at 85 l/min constant airflow) were obtained during nasal and oral breathing at sedentary and low-moderate work rates for 10 subjects. Results—The mean Rfilter for the 29. 4 PR was {{significantly lower than the}} other 2 PRs (p 0. 05). The mean Rfilter was greater for oral versus nasal breathing and for exercise compared to sedentary activity (p < 0. 001). Conclusions—Mean oral and nasal Rfilter for all 3 PRs was at, or below, the minimal threshold level for detection of inspiratory resistance (the 58. 8 – 74. 5 Pa/ 1 ×s− 1), which may account for the previously-reported lack of significant subjective or physiological differences when wearing PRs with these low Rfilter.

TMT measurements, with and without wearing an N 95 <b>filtering</b> <b>facepiece</b> respirator (N 95 FFR) were obtained at the onset and termination of 120 h of treadmill exercise in 21 subjects, and at staggered time intervals (0, 20, 40, 6020 min) during combined sedentary activity and exercise of another 46 subjects, to determine any effect on TMT. A total of 877 TMT measurements were obtained that demonstrated a mean TMT increase of 0. 052020 C in the first study group (p 20 = 200. 04) and a 0. 192020 C decrease in the second study group (p 20 < 200. 001) with the wearing of an N 95 FFR, {{both of which were}} lower than controls. Wearing an N 95 FFR for 120 h, at different levels of activity, results in significantly lower TMT values than not wearing an N 95 FFR, but the magnitude of the changes would likely have minimal clinical significance.

40|$|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{recommends}} {{the use of}} particulate res-pirators for protection against nanoparticles (< 100 nm size). Protection afforded by a <b>filtering</b> <b>facepiece</b> particulate respirator {{is a function of}} the filter efficiency and the leakage through the face-to-facepiece seal. The combination of particle penetration through filter media and par-ticle leakage through face seal and any component interfaces is considered as total inward leakage (TIL). Although the mechanisms and extent of nanoparticle penetration through filter media have been well documented, information concerning nanoparticle leakage through face seal is lacking. A previous study in our laboratory measured filter penetration and TIL for spe-cific size particles. The results showed higher filter penetration and TIL for 50 nm size par-ticles, i. e. the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) than for 8 and 400 nm size particles. To better understand the significance of particle penetration through filter media and through face seal leakage, this study was expanded to measure filter penetration at sealed condition and TIL with artificially introduced leaks for 20 – 800 nm particles at 8 – 40 l minute volumes for four N 95 models of <b>filtering</b> <b>facepiece</b> respirators (FFRs) using a breathing manikin.

40|$|Abstract: Workplace {{protection}} factor (WPF) means {{a measure}} of the actual protection of respirator provided in the workplace when correctly worn. While fit factor (FF) represents a quantitative measure of the fit of a particular respirator to an individual and it is determined in the laboratory. To evaluate the relationship between WPF and FF is very important since FF {{may or may not be}} taken advantage of estimating WPF. Outside and inside Fe concentrations for three brand N 95 <b>filtering</b> <b>facepieces</b> were collected on 14 workers/three respirator combinations in the welding workplace. The WPF measurements on the samples of the three respirator brands worn by 14 workers were observed to range from 2. 2 to 132. 9 with a geometric mean of 15. 9 and a geometric standard deviation of 2. 63. Respirator performances as measured by the WPF differed significantly among different respirator brands (p< 0. 05). In this study, correlations were found between the WPF measurements and the FF data for all samples of the three respirators (R 2 = 0. 38). The percentage of Fe particles having a smaller fraction than 1. 1 µm diameter was observed as 71. 6 % of the total...|$|R

This has led experts to question the high efficiency of the respirator, and it is similar to the events in the US nuclear industry in the late 1960s.

Specialists conducted parallel attempts to identify the reasons for the low efficiency of the respirator in Chernobyl.|$|R
40|$|A {{respirator}} {{fit test}} panel (RFTP) with facial size distribution representative of intended users {{is essential to}} the evaluation of respirator fit for new models of respirators. In this study an anthropometric survey was conducted among youths representing respirator users in mid-Taiwan to characterize head-and-face dimensions key to RFTPs for application to small-to-medium facial features. The participants were fit-tested for three N 95 masks of different facepiece design and the results compared to facial size distribution specified in the RFTPs of bivariate and principal component analysis design developed in this study to realize the influence of facial characteristics to respirator fit in relation to facepiece design. Nineteen dimensions were measured for 206 participants. In fit testing the qualitative fit test (QLFT) procedures prescribed by the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration were adopted. As the results show, the bizygomatic breadth of the male and female participants were 90. 1 and 90. 8 % of their counterparts reported for the U. S. youths (P < 0. 001), respectively. Compared to the bivariate distribution, the PCA design better accommodated variation in facial contours among different respirator user groups or populations, with the RFTPs reported in this study and from literature consistently covering over 92 % of the participants. Overall, the facial fit of <b>filtering</b> <b>facepieces</b> increased with increasing facial dimensions. The total percentages of the tests wherein the final maneuver being completed was "Moving head up-and-down", "Talking" or "Bending over" in bivariate and PCA RFTPs were 13. 3 - 61. 9 % and 22. 9 - 52. 8 %, respectively. The respirators with a three-panel flat fold structured in the facepiece provided greater fit, particularly when the users moved heads. When the facial size distribution in a bivariate RFTP did not sufficiently represent petite facial size, the fit testing was inclined to overestimate the general fit, thus for small-to-medium facial dimensions a distinct RFTP should be considered...|$|R
