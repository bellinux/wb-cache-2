40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} site investigation on durability and deterioration of school houses in three villages of northern part of Okinawa Island. The school houses in this region have been damaged most seriously in this series of investigations in Okinawa Prefecture. The rate of the damaged school houses in columns and girders to all school houses in this region amounts {{to as much as}} 37. 1 %. The rate of the damaged school houses in slabs and laves is 84. 6 %. The most prominent cause for above high damage rate is salt contained in concrete of school houses. The largest salt content value is observed at an school house in this region. The value is 1. 91 %. The average salt content value in this region is 0. 52 %. The salt contained in concrete comes from sea sand, sea gravels and mixing water, as well as directly from sea water. The first step to decrease the rate of damaged school houses is preventing school houses concrete from salt permeation. Houses of 4 schools in this region are directly attacked by sea water sprays, and the houses are most severly damaged. Other than above, the following comment to be mentioned: 1. The two kinds of coarse aggregate are used in construction of school houses in this region, one is natural gravels in older school houses and the other is crushed hard lime stone in newer school houses. 2. Heavily damaged school house concrete contained the natural gravels. 3. The <b>hand-rails</b> of stairs are damaged as seriously as the ones in other regions of Okinawa Prefecfure, and after 1965 the damages in the <b>hand-rails</b> decreased suddenly on account of the change in mode of stairs. 4. The quality of concrete in this region, estimating from the observed values of specific weight and absorption capacity of concrete, is highest one. But this does not means that concretes in this region is durable. 5. The school houses sprayed by sea water must be moved. 6. There are three critical school houses, not to be used and must be removed...|$|R

Three {{days later the}} main US drive on Tambu Bay commenced, with two {{companies}} striking towards the north via an inland route, while another <b>hand-railed</b> the coast, guided by PIB scouts. The advance was slow and on the coast, the US company was held up around Lake Salu while a platoon from the PIB destroyed one of the Japanese outposts around Boisi on 20 July. The US company was then able to occupy Boisi, but found itself receiving harassing fire from Roosevelt Ridge, which stretched from the sea about [...] to the west.The 2nd Battalion, 162nd was subsequently brought up to Tambu Bay as preparations were made for an attack on Roosevelt Ridge. The Australian divisional commander, Savige, to whom Coane Force was subordinated, suggested an attack from the west, which would allow the US troops to advance downhill; however, Coane determined he would assault from the east. A platoon from the PIB scouted the area, and then {{this was followed by}} an attack by two companies: 'K' and 'I'. The Japanese defenders rolled hand grenades down the steep slope and fired mortars down on the attacking Americans. Upon cresting the hill small arms fire engaged them from several concealed positions. With this the assault was turned back. A second attempt was made later that day, but again it was defeated and two days later the two US companies withdrew from the ridge. Afterwards, 'I' Company secured the western end of the ridge around Scout Ridge, which lay opposite Roosevelt Ridge, separated by a deep ravine.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an study on durability aspect of reinforced concrete school houses in Ishigaki Island. The school houses have been seriouly damaged {{on account of}} corrosion of steel bars embeded in concrete. The highest salt content of concrete samples taken from school houses amounts to as high as 1. 41 %, and the average salt content of the samples is 0. 37 %. The salt contained in concrete {{has been responsible for}} the above damages. 33 % of all of the school houses are damaged in columns and girders, and 83 % of school houses are deteriorated in some to considerable degree in slabs. It must be said that some fundamental changes in the method of construction of reinforced concrete school buildings are needed. Some remarks clarified in this investigation are mentioned: 1. The salt above come from sea sands, sea gravels and mixing water. Some salt in concrete also come from sea water directly. The concrete made from sea gravels contains 0. 52 % of salt in mortar weight, and the concrete made from crushed stones contained 0. 24 % salt on the average. 2. The protective measures for harmful salt content must be taken by regulating not only the use of sea sands but also the use of sea gravels. The mixing water other than tap water must be examined before its use. 3. The average values of concrete samples in specific weight and absorption capacity are 2. 23 and 9. 49 %, respectively. These values show the concrete quality of the school houses in this island are not durable. 4. Even the laves in newly built school houses are slightly damaged. The most responsible for this fact is poor construction practice in placing steel bars. 5. The <b>hand-rails</b> of stairs are damaged at 100 % degree. The conditions exposed to rain, wind and sunshine, small cross sections and containing many steel bar in small spaces are responsible for the above damage. 6. The high ratio of damaged school houses are due partly to small number of newly built houses, which comes from decreasing tendency of population in Ishigaki Island. 7. Slabs near the outdoor columns and lave ends are damaged fastly and seriously. The main reasons for the above are their small dimensions and thin concrete covers on steel bars...|$|R

5000|$|... (A) The {{first class}} {{includes}} factory and workshop acts, laws relating to hours of labour, work on Sundays and holidays, {{the payment of}} wages, the liability of employers for injuries to their employees, &c. Factory acts have been passed by Factory [...] nearly all {{the states of the}} Union. These may be and work- [...] considered in two groups - first, laws which relate to conditions of employment and affect only children, young persons and women; and second, laws which relate to the sanitary condition of factories and workshops and to the safety of employees generally. The states adopting such laws have usually made provision for factory inspectors, whose duties are to enforce these laws and who have power to enter and inspect factories and workshops. The most common provisions of the factory acts in the various states are those which fix an age limit below which employment is unlawful. All but five states have enacted such provisions, and these five states have practically no manufacturing industries. In some states the laws fixing an age limit are restricted in their application to factories, while in others they extend also to workshops, bakeries, mercantile establishments and other work places where children are employed. The prescribed age limit varies from ten to fourteen years. Provisions concerning the education of children in factories and workshops may be considered in two groups, those relating to apprenticeship and those requiring a certain educational qualification as a prerequisite to employment. Apprenticeship laws are numerous, but they do not now have great force, because of the practical abrogation of the apprenticeship system through the operation of modern methods of production. Most states have provisions prohibiting illiterates under a specified age, usually sixteen, from being employed in factories and workshops. The provisions of the factory acts relating to hours of labour and night work generally affect only the employment of women and young persons. Most of the states have enacted such provisions, those limiting the hours of children occurring more frequently than those limiting the hours of women. The hour limit for work in such cases ranges from six per day to sixty-six per week. Where the working time of children is restricted, the minimum age prescribed for such children ranges from twelve to twenty-one years. In some cases the restriction of the hours of labour of women and children is general, while in others it applies only to employment in one or more classes of industries. Other provisions of law for the protection of women and children, but not usually confined in their operation to factories and workshops, are such as require seats for females and separate toilet facilities for the sexes, and prohibit employment in certain occupations as in mines, places where intoxicants are manufactured or sold, in cleaning or operating dangerous machinery, &c. Provisions of factory acts relating to the sanitary condition of factories and workshops and the safety of employees have been enacted in nearly all the manufacturing states of the Union. They prohibit overcrowding, and require proper ventilation, sufficient light and heat, the lime-washing or painting of walls and ceilings, the provision of exhaust fans and blowers in places where dust or dangerous fumes are generated, guards on machinery, mechanical belts and gearing shifters, guards on elevators and hoistways, <b>hand-rails</b> on stairs, fire-escapes, &c.|$|R

According to {{the recent}} researches, a high percent of the {{population}} now live in cities which present itself with an urban environment. A typical citizen is born into this environment; in which they don't have an actual control or right to speak about their physical surrounding which are composed of the spaces proposed by authority in a dominating manner. Â  The ordinary citizen sustain the daily life which in character is unpredictable, vague and ambigious; in this environment. This uncertainty of the daily life is the very reason why the predefined spaces with their borders and definitions offered by the authorities cannot fully adjust with the actions of the citizens; these borders and the definitons constantly get disintegrated by the interests of daily life, intervention by the user is an unavoidable feature of the designed spaces; in this case for the city too. Hence the citizens keep interfering and reshaping their urban environment; in order to create spaces of their own interest. To do this; the citizens generate spatial and constructional solutions regarding their concerns without a notable education or accumulation on the field of architecture or design. They actualize the possibilities and potentials by the virtue of their conscious that has an architectural essence in it, which this study aims to capture and demonstrate. Â  This exact essence is thought to be the origin of the dicipline; like the primitive in nature when {{there was not a single}} building around, the citizen of today also tries to take opportunities of their physical environment; they make ways, they take shelter. For instance like sitting on a rock when tired; citizens use doorsteps, <b>hand-rails</b> to sit; use a park as a tribune of a stadium. They find, make and compose a space for their intentions. The only difference is the setting; the basic instinct of the protagonist seems to stay the same. Â  Consequently; this dense, solid and predefined setting that goes by the name of "the city" acts as a terrain vague for the ordinary citizen. It is possible to find numberless possibilities in any given definition. Terrain vague; although as a concept that is usually associated with the form of absence, obsolete and undefined spaces; in this way can be experienced through the over-defined setting of the city. Â  The citizen makes this possible by using the city as a material; how handy they are beats the urban entities' definitions, resulting in space productions which may be called as "snatch spaces" based upon their instant, cunning and quirky character. The resident sees a potential, realizes it and makes a production. By this way the city turns into a kind of physical fund, resource and opportunity for its residents. In this materialisation process; citizen degrades the urban environment into its very basic physical features like corners, gaps, surfaces, voids, slopes, heights and motion, flow, crowd, noise and so on. After this cognitive operation these basic features are taken to be used in establishing an alternative space for the proposed one. Besides the creativity and the cunning it requires and highlights; this kind of space production is the ordinary's way of having a say in shaping the city, which makes it quintessentially a political action. The ordinary informally takes their right to the city and its resources. Though the goal is not making a spatial statement; but just making use of an opportunity; spatially speaking, this action takes the given meanings off the predefined spaces, turns them into something else. Competency in shaping the surrounding also brings significant dominance in its wake and this can be seen as a victory for the weak over the powerful, and it might be considered as the only possible one. Residents keep operating on this environment and by doing this they also change the character of the notion of consumption. This process also resembles with the notions of language and talking; in which users create a saying with the help of the language and by changing the order of the words expression changes too. The citizens change the product, just by the way they are using it; in this case this product is the city. Urban skaters that are common features of the urban environment also adopt the same manner; they take the urban entities far from their definiton; and just by using them in their own interests they simultaneously add value to our urban lives. Skateboarding might be seen as a critical activity which is also Â in direct relation to architecture and urban space. It suggest that the city is not just a place as it is proposed to be; but in this case it can be a pleasure-gound. Just like the samples in this study it is also an offer to to see the city with a different point of view. Â  The notion of "gecekondu" in Ä°stanbul also might be seen as a product of the same instinct; using the convenient spaces, lacunaes in law and as a result generating an informal space by using these vacancies and also the waste that is generated by the city itself. Â  The recent occupy movements also represent this manner; they include snatch space productions in their process; using an urban environment by giving it different definitions; changing the way it is proposed. Productions as settled as "gecekondu" and as extraordinary as occupy movements will not be included in the study with samples; because of the aim of focusing on the spatial productions of the ordinary. Â  This familiar and daily samples included in the study demonstrates how the ordinary become entitled to receive a right to speak on their physical surrounding; namely the city, which is filled with definitions, borders and regulations that aim to give a kind of order to actions through spaces. In the study the spatial process of using an opportunity of the urban environment will be examined through urban samples that were collected with an autoethnographic manner, meaning collected from the routes, surroundings of the researcher's daily life. This manner was used as a form of self-reflection; with the aim of connecting a more personal story to a wider cultural, political and social meaning and understanding. Samples collected will be documented by photographs and afterwards will be examined through architectural diagrams in able to catch the essence of the forementioned architectural essence of the ordinary. The aim is to read this undesigned snatch spaces backwards with a spatial concern in order to highlight the production process of the ordinary citizen in predefined urban environment. While the mentioned interventions of the ordinary to the predefined environment points out its deficiencies, bugs, defects and failures such as complicated routes, insufficient spaces and excessive restrictions; this kind of productions also bring out Â the Â uncalculated potentials of a given shape. The ordinary citizen sees the potential and vacancies in this given, urban environment; takes the advantage and turns it into a living, running, active space to use for commercial or social purposes. Â  From this aspect these actions and the resulting spatial productions might provide an insight for the discipline which in spite of appearance stands somewhat far away from the user; in this case the ordinary citizen with ordinary worries.
