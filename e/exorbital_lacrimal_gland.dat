40|$|PURPOSE. To {{determine}} the expression {{patterns of the}} vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the pterygopalatine ganglion (PPG) and the <b>exorbital</b> <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> of normal mice. METHODS. Mouse PPG and lacrimal glands were processed for single- and double-labeled indirect immunofluorescence studies. Slides were examined with conventional fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. RESULTS. All the somata in the PPG expressed both VAChT and nNOS immunoreactivity (IR). The postganglionic axons within the ganglion showed less VAChT-immunoreactive intensity than that seen in the somata, whereas nNOS IR was almost undetectable.

40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of the cytosolic fraction from rat <b>exorbital</b> <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> with DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography showed {{the presence of a}} peak of protein kinase activity which was dependent on the presence of phosphatidylserine and diolein as well as calcium. This activity showed the same properties as the previously reported protein kinase C (PKC). Moreover, we have shown {{for the first time that}} this kinase or a kinase that coeluted from the column with PKC could be activated by a phorbol ester, PMA, in a phospholipid-free system, i. e. in the absence of any cofactor of PKC. These findings emphasize the need for caution in the interpretation of experimental results obtained when using phorbol esters to probe for a role of PKC in many regulatory processes...|$|E

Material and methods. White not purebred rats males (n = 40) were subjected to continuous influence of light intensity by 3500 lx within 1, 7, 14 and 30 days, the control group (n = 10) contained in conditions of natural lighting (20 lx). <b>Exorbital</b> <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin wax, stained hematoxylin-eosine. By means of an oculary insert of Avtandilov counted specific volumes of output channels, an epithelium, stroma and vessels of <b>exorbital</b> <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands,</b> defined an epitelio/stroma ratio. The analysis of data {{was carried out by}} methods of descriptive statistics with calculation of a median (Ме) and interquartile range (Q 1 –Q 3).

40|$|The {{method of}} {{secretory}} granule {{formation in the}} acinar cells of the rat <b>exorbital</b> <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> was studied by electron microscope morphological and cytochemical techniques. Immature secretory granules at the inner face of the Golgi apparatus were frequently attached to a narrow cisternal structure similar to GERL as described in neurons by Novikoff et al. (Novikoff, P. M., A. B. Novikoff, N. Quintana, and J. -J. Hauw. 1971. J. Cell Biol. 50 : 859 - 886). In the lacrimal gland, GERL was located adjacent to the inner Golgi saccule, or separated from it by a variable distance. Portions of GERL were often closely paralleled by modified cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), which lacked ribosomes on the surface adjacent to GERL. Diaminobenzidine reaction product of the secretory enzyme peroxidase was localized in the cisternae of the nuclear envelope, RER, peripheral Golgi vesicles, Golgi saccules, and immature and mature secretory granules. GERL was usually free of peroxidase reaction product or contained only a small amount. Thiamine pyrophosphatase reaction product was present in two to four inner Golgi saccules; occasionally, the innermost saccule was dilated and fenestrated, and contained less reaction product than the next adjacent saccule. Acid phosphatase (AcPase) reaction product was present in GERL, immature granules, and, rarely, in the innermost saccule, {{but not in the}} rest of the Golgi saccules. Thick sections of AcPase preparations viewed at 100 kV revealed that GERL consisted of cisternal, and fenestrated or tubular portions. The immature granules were attached to GERL by multiple connections to the tubular portions. These results suggest that, in the rat <b>exorbital</b> <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland,</b> the Golgi saccules participate in the transport of secretory proteins, and that GERL is involved in the formation of secretory granules.

40|$|In our {{previous}} study we described a bilateral-macroscopic and structural dimorphism of young rat <b>exorbital</b> <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> (Loewenthal's gland), {{which was the}} probable cause of the bibliographic discrepancies in the entity and the onset of its sexual dimorphism.

The present study aims {{to carry out a}} comparative analysis on age-dependent changes in glands of both sides from male and female rats, using histological, histochemical and transmission electron microscopy, to evaluate whether the gland bilateral-macroscopic and structural dimorphism might influence the kind of alterations which occur in senescence. Our findings indicate that the macroscopic and structural side-specific dimorphism is not so evident in comparison with young rats. The side-specific dimorphism is evident only in male rats, in which the roundish gland appears to be more Sudan-positive in comparison with the ellipsoidal gland. The gland bilateral-macroscopic and structural dimorphism, although more evident in comparison with young animals, does not seem to influence these kinds of alterations due to senescence, a time-window in which we still observed some sexual differences also in more aged rats...|$|E

Differential display analysis of the <b>exorbital</b> <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> of male and female Swiss Webster mice detected a potential female-specific cDNA, designated Y 2. Using the technique of rapid amplification of cDNA ends, a full-length cDNA of Y 2 was obtained and the nucleotide sequence determined. To assess tissue-specific expression, a labeled Y 2 cDNA probe was hybridized to RNA blots of male and female mouse lacrimal, harderian, parotid, mandibular, sublingual, and pancreas glands and liver.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} whether IgA in rat tears originates from serum and/or local synthesis. To examine the first possibility, we compared the IgA levels in serum and tears of rats with a portacaval anastomosis. This operation induced a chronic and progressive elevation of polymeric IgA concentrations in serum. By 8 weeks after surgery, serum IgA levels in 'portacaval' rats were 20 -fold higher than those of sham-operated or intact controls. In contrast, IgA levels in tears of 'portacaval' rats did not increase after surgery, despite the availability of free secretory component (SC) in tears. The lack of correlation between tear and serum IgA concentrations resulted in a significant decrease in the tear IgA/serum IgA ratio after anastomosis surgery. To assess whether tear IgA might be derived from local synthesis, we cultured various ocular tissues from male rats in the presence or absence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Incubation of <b>exorbital</b> (<b>lacrimal)</b> <b>glands</b> resulted in the accumulation of substantial quantities of IgA in the culture medium. This accumulation was significantly reduced by the presence of cycloheximide. In contrast, cycloheximide had no effect on the amounts of IgA in cultures of 'lids', Harder's glands and globes. These results indicate that IgA in rat tears originates from local synthesis and not from serum transfer. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the rat exorbital gland is responsible for the synthesis and secretion of tear IgA...|$|R
40|$|Cytochemical {{localization}} of NAD (P) H oxidase, a hydrogen-peroxide generating enzyme, {{has been}} investigated using the cerium method in several mammalian exocrine glands: (a) salivary glands of the rat, Mongolian gerbil, house musk shrew and man, (b) lactating mammary glands of the rat and Mongolian gerbil and (c) <b>exorbital</b> <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> of the rat. The NAD (P) H oxidase activity could be exclusively localized {{in association with the}} myoepithelial cells (MEC) of all the exocrine glands examined. The reaction products in the MEC were found mostly on the plasma membranes facing the neighboring cells (acinar cells, ductal cells and MEC) and in the caveolae. These localizations imply that a membrane-bound NAD (P) H oxidase specific for the MEC could exist in mammalian exocrine glands, and that it may be involved in some intercellular regulatory system between MEC and other parenchymal cells of the glands. With regard to the reactivities on MEC, there were apparent diversities among different glands. Intense and constant activities were found in both the lactating mammary glands of the rat and Mongolian gerbil and the salivary glands of house musk shrew, in which the MEC are extremely developed. The usefulness of NAD (P) H oxidase as a marker enzyme of MEC and the significance of its localization in MEC are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Electrolyte {{and fluid}} {{secretion}} by the avian salt gland is regulated by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (R). In this study, these receptors were characterized and quantitated in homogenates of salt gland from domestic ducks adapted to conditions of low (freshwater, FW) and high (saltwater, SW) salt stress using the cholinergic antagonist [3 H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB). Specific binding of the antagonist to receptors in both FW- and SW-adapted glands reveals a single population of high affinity binding sites (KdFW = 40. 1 +/- 3. 0 pM; KdSW = 35. 1 +/- 2. 1 pM). Binding is saturable; RLmaxFW = 1. 73 +/- 0. 10 fmol/micrograms DNA; RLmaxSW = 4. 16 +/- 0. 31 fmol/micrograms DNA (where L is [3 H]QNB and RL the high affinity complex). Calculated average cellular receptor populations of 5, 800 sites/cell in FW-adapted glands and 14, 100 sites/cell in SW-adapted glands demonstrate that upward regulation of acetylcholine receptors in the secretory epithelium follows chronic salt stress. The receptor exhibits typical pharmacological specificities for muscarinic cholinergic antagonists (QNB, atropine, scopolamine) and agonists (oxotremorine, methacholine, carbachol). In addition, the loop diuretic furosemide, which interferes with ion transport {{processes in the}} salt gland, competitively inhibits [3 H]QNB binding. Preliminary studies of furosemide effects on [3 H]QNB binding to rat <b>exorbital</b> <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> membranes showed a similar inhibition, although the diuretic {{had no effect on}} antagonist binding to rat brain or atrial receptors...|$|E
40|$|In this report, it is {{demonstrated}} that the C 3 component of prostatic binding protein (PBP) is also expressed and androgen regulated in the <b>exorbital</b> <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland,</b> as shown previously for cystatin-related protein (CRP), another abundant secretory protein from the ventral prostate. The presence of C 3 messenger RNA (mRNA) could be demonstrated by both Northern blot hybridization and PCR amplification and sequencing. The mRNAs encoding the C 1 and C 2 components of PBP, however, were undetectable. At the protein level, the C 3 component in the lacrimal gland is glycosylated and linked by disulfide bridges to a new 10 -kDa component not reacting with the PBP antiserum. As shown previously for CRP, the expression of C 3 in the lacrimal gland requires the simultaneous presence of androgens and a functional androgen receptor. The effects of castration and androgen treatment on CRP and C 3 mRNA concentrations were studied by Northern blot and dot blot hybridization; effects on transcription rates were determined by nuclear run-on assay. Two days after castration, the relative abundance of CRP mRNA had declined significantly (P < 0. 01) to 10. 5 +/- 1. 5 % (+/-SEM) of precastration levels in the prostate and to 14. 5 +/- 8. 0 % in the lacrimal gland; the transcription rates declined to 14. 3 % and 10. 0 %, respectively. The C 3 mRNA level and transcription rate in the prostate showed a more moderate decrease (P < 0. 05) to 40. 6 +/- 8. 5 % and 41. 7 %, but were hardly measurable in the lacrimal gland. Androgen administration resulted in a rapid increase in the transcription rates, which reached or exceeded control levels after 6 - 9 h of treatment and clearly preceded the increase in mRNA levels. It is concluded that the lacrimal gland, which can be studied conveniently in female and long term androgen-depleted animals offers a suitable model {{for the study of}} androgen-regulated gene expression. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{administration}} of -isoproterenol, a [beta]-adrenergic agonist, to male Sprague-Dawley rats increased submandibular gland weights by 3 to 4 -fold. This increase {{resulted from a}} combination of hyperplasia and hypertrophy of secretory cells. Possible effects of this drug regimen on submandibular gland muscarinic acetylcholine receptors were examined by analysis of the binding of the cholinergic antagonist, -quinuclidinyl [3 H]benzilate, to receptors in gland homogenates. Parallel investigations of receptors in <b>exorbital</b> <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands,</b> an organ that is not grossly affected by chronic isoproterenol treatment, were also carried out. [3 H]QNB bound to submandibular receptors with a Kd of 37. 8 +/- 6. 3 pM in control rats and 41. 0 +/- 4. 0 pM in isoproterenol-treated animals, a non-significant difference (P > 0. 05). In contrast, the maximal binding level (Bmax) is isoproterenol-treated rats, 1. 52 +/- 0. 10 fmol/[mu]g DNA, was depressed by approx. 30 % (PKd (61. 3 +/- 5. 3 vs. 53. 2 +/- 4. 0 pM) and Bmax (1. 74 +/- 0. 24 vs. 1. 78 +/- 0. 17 fmol/[mu]g DNA) were unchanged by isoproterenol treatment. The affinity of glandular muscarinic receptors for cholinergic agonists was also examined by competition experiments using carbachol. This agonist inhibited [3 H]QNB binding to receptors in homogenates from both glands in a dose-dependent fashion. Inhibition constant (Ki) for this interaction were similar in control and isoproterenol-treated lacrimal glands; 53. 6 +/- 5. 4 [mu]M and 66. 6 +/- 7. 9 [mu]M, respectively (P> 0. 05). In submandibular glands, isoproterenol treatment elicited a highly significant (P) shift in Ki from 17. 3 +/- 1. 4 [mu]M to 68. 3 +/- 5. 2 [mu]M. These results demonstrate that chronic {{administration of}} isoproterenol to rats results in a reduction in receptor numbers and a decrease in their sensitivity to cholinergic agonists in submandibular, but not <b>lacrimal,</b> <b>glands...</b>|$|R
40|$|Androgens {{are known}} to {{regulate}} the level of secretory component (SC) in tears of male rats. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to explore the underlying mechanism of this hormone action by (i) identifying the ocular tissue(s) involved in SC production; and (ii) determining whether androgens increase SC production by this tissue. We also examined whether androgen administration influenced the concentration of SC in tears of female rats. Ocular tissues from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were cultured in the presence or absence of cycloheximide in the incubation medium. Secretory component in the culture media was measured by an RIA which detects primarily free SC. Analysis of media obtained after incubation of <b>exorbital</b> (<b>lacrimal)</b> <b>glands,</b> 'lid' tissues, globes, and Harderian glands revealed that only exorbital glands released substantial amounts of SC. This exorbital gland production of SC, which was significantly greater in tissues from male rats, as compared to those of female rats, was reduced by approximately 50 % when cycloheximide was present in the culture medium. To determine whether SC production by exorbital glands was influenced by androgens, orchiectomized glands was influenced by androgens, orchiectomized rats were administered either saline or testosterone (2. 0 mg/day for 4 days), and exorbital glands were cultured 24 hr after the last injection. Testosterone treatment in vivo induced a significant, cycloheximide-sensitive increase in SC production in vitro, compared to the glandular SC output of saline-injected controls. It is interesting that similar androgen treatment of ovariectomized females also resulted in elevated tear SC concentrations and enhanced output of SC by their exorbital glands in vitro. These findings indicate that the exorbital gland is primarily responsible for SC production in the rat eye and that androgens may modulate the synthesis of SC in this gland...|$|R

A {{sequential}} {{light and}} electron microscopic {{study of the}} <b>exorbital</b> and Harderian <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> was done on 2. 5 - to 15 -month-old Wistar rats exposed to sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus. Typical coronaviral particles were readily demonstrated in cytoplasmic vesicles of Harderian and exorbital glands examined at 6 days post-inoculation. Lesions were seen in a relatively high percentage of <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> in infected animals of all ages, with no obvious age-related variations in the incidence and extent of changes. Lesions frequently persisted for a longer interval post-exposure in <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> than in salivary glands. The persistence of lesions commonly seen in Harderian glands was attributed, at least in part, to the cytotoxic effects of porphyrin-containing secretions released during the acute necrotizing stages of the disease. The persistence of lesions in some <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> indicates that they are useful tissues for microscopic examination for the retrospective provisional diagnosis of SDA. Persistent lesions also indicate that normal functions of these glands may be compromised for up to several weeks following outbreaks of SDA.

Recording from cell-attached and excised inside-out patches of acinar membrane with quasi-physiological ion gradients demonstrated large outward current events that correspond to single-channel openings. The amplitude, frequency and duration of channel events increased as the membrane patch was depolarized and were reduced by hyperpolarization of the patch membrane. The reversal potential for these channel events is more negative than - 40 mV. In excised inside-out patches exposed to quasi-physiological ion gradients single-channel events were abolished when K+ was replaced by Rb+. Since there was no Cl- gradient the channel is clearly highly selective for K+. In excised inside-out patches, when the free Ca 2 + concentration bathing the physiological inside of the membrane was raised from less than 10 (- 9) M to 10 (- 8) M the frequency and duration of opening of the K+ channel was increased. The channel was almost continuously open when the membrane was exposed to 10 (- 7) M-free Ca 2 +. 'Whole cell' recording of lacrimal acinar cells containing 140 mM-KCl and 1 mM-EGTA (with no added Ca 2 +) provided cell resting membrane potentials of - 30 to - 40 mV. Depolarizing voltage jumps from the resting membrane potential evoked large outward currents. Hyperpolarizing voltage jumps only evoked small inward currents. Whole-cell recording where RbCl replaced KCl in the pipette provided resting membrane potentials of - 20 to - 30 mV, reduced the amplitude of outward currents evoked by cell-depolarizing voltage steps by 60 % and slowed {{the time course of}} the currents. Isolated cells containing 140 mM-KCl and 1 mM-EGTA were voltage clamped at their resting membrane potentials. Acetylcholine (ACh) was applied locally and immediately evoked a strong outward current which rapidly declined to a steady-state level. Sustained agonist responses were obtained by exposing the isolated cell to a solution containing 10 (- 6) M-ACh. In both K+- and Rb+-filled cells, where the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration was buffered by the inclusion of 1 mM-EGTA, 10 (- 6) M-ACh evoked sustained outward currents that corresponded to cell hyperpolarizations of 5 - 15 and 10 - 20 mV, respectively. Increasing intracellular Ca 2 + buffering by including 10 mM-EGTA abolished secretagogue-induced outward current in both K+- and Rb+-filled cells. It is concluded that the lacrimal acinar cell membrane contains voltage- and Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|The rat {{lacrimal}} gland has a characteristic pattern of autonomic innervation which has {{important roles in}} the control of lacrimation and blood flow. Protein secretion is observed {{in the presence of}} cholinergic and adrenergic antagonists, implicating the involvement of a noncholinergic, nonadrenergic nervous pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of peptidergic nerves, and the neuropeptide VIP is established as a lacrimal secretagogue, however the involvement ofother neurotransmitters in the control of lacrimal function remains unclear. Ageing has been suggested to be involved in one of the common malfunctions ofthis gland, that ofreduced tear production which {{may play a role in}} the development of the disease state keratconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). However, there is no evidence as to whether age-related changes occur in the innervation pattern ofthe {{lacrimal gland}}. This study employs histochemical and immunocytochemical techniques to elucidate and compare the occurrence and precise distribution of nerve fibres and markers of mast cells in the lacrimal glands of 3 - 5, 14 and 24 month old rats. The glands of the three age groupswere innervated with acetycholinesterase (AChE), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) -, neuropeptide Y (NPY) -, substance P (SP) -, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) -, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) - and the phosphoprotein B-SO- immunoreactive (IR) nerve fibres. 13 - 50 -lit was distributed around acini, blood vessels and ducts, in a similar manner to VIP, SP and CGRP; though there was less VIP-IR nerves particularly associated with ducts and a generally sparse SP and CGRP innervation. NPY- and TH-IRnerves were apparent only around the vascular tissue. Mast cells, to date have lacked description and enumeration in the lacrimal gland. A high densityof 5 -HT and histamineimmunofluorescencewasobserved inclose oppositionto neurovascular tissue, paralleling histochemical staining for mast cells. In the 14 month, and to a greater extent, in 24 month old rats there were signs of chronic inflammation and patchy destruction of acinar, ductal and vascular tissue. The 3 - 5 and 14 month old rats displayed a similar pattern of innervation, however, by 24 months there was a reduction in the number and intensity of immunoreactive nerves. The loss of nerves was particularly associated with damage to the gland. In contrast to nerves, there was a large infiltration of mast cells in the aged tissue, indicative of inflammation and tissue degeneration. The decrease in innervation, chronic inflammation and mast cell infiltration observed in aged rats may be contributing factors to reduced tear output in ageing and KCS This study investigates the role of VIP, NPY, SP, CORP and 5 -HT in enzyme secretion and the presence of receptors for VIP and NPY on isolated rat acini. Protein secretion was measured from segments ofthe <b>exorbital</b> <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> and receptor binding studies were carried out on dispersed acini, separated on percoll density gradients, with WI-VIP or wINPY. All neuropeptides enhanced lacrimal secretion, but the net effect of all neuropeptides was dependent on dose. The response to VIP was abolished by the VIP receptor antagonist [4 Cl-D-Phe 6, leu' 7 VIP, which reduced the response to NPY. In addition, when VIP was combined with NPY an attenuated response was observed. VIP and NPY binding sites were present on lacrimal acinar cells, but binding sites for NPY were far less numerous than those for VIP. Collectively, the results are consistent with aphysiological role for VIP in the regulation ofsecretion in the lacrimal gland. NPY stimulates secretion, however, there is considerable interaction between these two peptides and their receptorsin both secretory and receptorbinding assays. Taken with the immunocytochemistry, a role for NPY in enzyme secretion is less clear. In various tissues ofthe body, notably the gastrointestinal tract, nerves and mast cells are in close apposition suggesting a functional relationship. There are no reports available describing a neuroimmune connection in the lacrimal gland. Observations from this study have demonstrated peptidergic nerves in particular SP and CGRP, to be closely associated with mast cells. Pharmacological studies indicate that SP and CORP cause mast cell degranulation leading to 5 -HT release. This data suggests an interaction of the nervous and immune systems in the control of lacrimation. The morphological, biochemical and functional data presented provides new insights into the integration ofthe nervous control oflacrimal gland secretion. A better understanding ofthe normal lacrimal stimulus-secretion mechanisms will help to perceive the specific cellular mechanisms that are affected in diseases of the lacrimal gland or that break down during the aging process. Based on this knowledge it should be possible to develop scientifically based treatments for the decrease in lacrimal gland secretion that occurs in KCS and related diseases ofaqueous tear film deficiency...|$|E

Results When compared to control animals, the scopolamine treatment induced an increase in the cornea fluorescein staining score (from 0. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 0 to 2. 5 [*]±[*] 1. 0 arbitrary units (AU) for the balanced diet and from 1. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 8 to 2. 6 [*]±[*] 0. 5  AU for the n- 3 PUFA-deficient diet); a decrease in rMuc 5 AC immunostaining in the conjunctival epithelium (− 34 % for the balanced diet and − 23 % for the n- 3 PUFA-deficient diet); an increase in the LG transcript levels of TNF-α for the balanced diet and of TNF-α and IFN-γ for the deficient diet; an increase in the conjunctival transcript levels of IL- 1 β and IL- 6 for the deficient diet; an increase in arachidonic acid (AA) and in the ∆ 5 -desaturase index (ratio of AA to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid) in the exorbital LG for both diets. When compared to the balanced diet, the n- 3 PUFA-deficient diet induced an increase in the LG transcript levels of IL- 6 for the control animals and of TNF-α for the control and dry eye animals as well as an increase in the conjunctival transcript levels of IL- 6 for the dry eye animals. There was no significant diet difference in fluorescein staining, rMuc 5 AC, and MHC II immunostaining scores. Conclusions Our data suggest that an n- 3 PUFA deficiency does not increase the severity of dry eye in a rat model of dry eye...|$|R

The colchicine-sensitive steps have been localized by using the drug at various times {{with respect to the}} pulse labeling of proteins. Colchicine (10 /IM) does not block any step of the secretory protein transport, but when introduced before the pulse it decreases the transfer of labeled proteins from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi area, suppressing their temporary accumulation in the Golgi area before any alteration of this organelle is detectable. Moreover, colchicine inhibits protein release only from the secretory granules formed in its presence because the peroxidase discharge is diminished I h after colchicine addition, and the secretion of newly synthesized proteins is strongly inhibited only when colchicine is introduced before secretory granule formation. Morphometric studies show that there is a great increase of secondary lysosomes, related to crinophagy, as early as 40 - 50 rain after colchicine is added. However, changes in lysosomal enzymatic activities remained biochemically undetectable...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> is {{responsible}} for tear synthesis and secretion, and {{is derived from the}} epithelia of ocular surface and generated by branching morphogenesis. The dataset presented in this article is to support the research results of the effect of chitosan biomaterials on facilitating the structure formation of the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> by regulating temporospatial dynamics of morphogen. The embryonic <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> explants were used as the standard experimental model for investigating <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> branching morphogenesis. Chitosan biomaterials promoted <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> branching with a dose-dependent effect. It helped in vivo binding of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) related molecules in the epithelial-mesenchymal boundary of emerging epithelial branches. When mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) inhibitors applied, the chitosan effects reduced. Nonetheless, the ratios of MAPK and Akt/PKB phosphorylation were still greater in the chitosan group than the control.
