5|$|A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a {{merchant}} ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized bulk carrier {{was built in}} 1852, <b>economic</b> <b>forces</b> have fuelled {{the development of these}} ships, causing them to grow in size and sophistication. Today's bulkers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, efficiency, and durability.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by <b>economic</b> <b>forces.</b> This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E

5|$|New <b>economic</b> <b>forces</b> {{also changed}} the Commonwealth. Virginian James Albert Bonsack invented the tobacco {{cigarette}} rolling machine in 1880 leading to new {{industrial scale production}} centered on Richmond. In 1886, railroad magnate Collis Potter Huntington founded Newport News Shipbuilding, which was responsible for building six major World War I-era battleships for the U.S. Navy from 1907 to 1923. During the war, German submarines like U-151 attacked ships outside the port. In 1926, Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, rector of Williamsburg's Bruton Parish Church, began restoration of colonial-era buildings in the historic district with financial backing of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Though their project, like others in the state, {{had to contend with}} the Great Depression and World War II, work continued as Colonial Williamsburg became a major tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Crusade {{resulted}} in the disruption of Byzantine manufacturing and the commercial dominance of the Western Europeans in the eastern Mediterranean, events that amounted to an economic catastrophe for the Empire. The Palaiologoi tried to revive the economy, but the late Byzantine state would not gain full control of either the foreign or domestic <b>economic</b> <b>forces.</b> Gradually, it also lost its influence on the modalities of trade and the price mechanisms, and its control over the outflow of precious metals and, according to some scholars, even over the minting of coins.|$|E
5|$|Arrington's father {{offered to}} pay for Arrington {{to serve as an}} LDS missionary, but not for a {{university}} education. Arrington did not serve an LDS mission, but considered his educational endeavors a form of church service. Under a scholarship to the University of Idaho, Arrington studied agricultural science in 1935, later changing to agricultural economics. George S. Tanner, the director of the LDS Institute at the University of Idaho, was a progressive intellectual Mormon who taught Arrington that Christianity and science could be compatible and that other translations of the Bible could assist in its interpretation. One of the university's newest economics professors, Erwin Graue, taught the ideas of Alfred Marshall and influenced Arrington to see economics as a study of human relationships and not just mathematical <b>economic</b> <b>forces.</b> Marshall wrote that religious fervor could influence people to act altruistically.|$|E
25|$|Railroads also {{remain a}} major <b>economic</b> <b>force</b> for the city, {{with both the}} Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union Pacific {{employing}} many residents.|$|R

25|$|After World WarII, Hudson River Mill workers {{developed}} and perfected {{the production of}} coated papers for the company. Shifting <b>economic</b> <b>forces</b> resulted in the mill's closure in November 2002. The historic mill was slated for demolition in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Wieser {{tried to}} explain the {{relationships}} and social forces through the study of history, and he concluded that <b>economic</b> <b>forces</b> held {{a prominent role in}} social evolution. Despite his interest in collective goals, such as economic well-being, Wieser adopted an individual approach, explicitly rejecting collectivism, approaching a more liberal stance, and establishing the essential difference between social economics in general and Socialist Economics.|$|E
25|$|Urban {{areas as}} a rule cannot produce their own food and {{therefore}} must develop some relationship with a hinterland which sustains them. Only in special cases such as mining towns which {{play a vital role}} in long-distance trade, are cities disconnected from the countryside which feeds them. Thus, centrality within a productive region influences siting, as <b>economic</b> <b>forces</b> would in theory favor the creation of market places in optimal mutually reachable locations.|$|E
50|$|The King Ranch {{continues}} to be a dominant <b>economic</b> <b>force</b> in the region. The town of Kingsville, Texas is named for King. Corpus Christi has a high school named for King.|$|R
25|$|Early roads crisscrossed the region, {{but it was}} the {{eventual}} construction of the Pennsylvania Canal and the railroads that followed that truly positioned Mifflin County as an <b>economic</b> <b>force</b> in the state.|$|R
2500|$|Gungunum's two successors, Abisare (c. 1841–1830 BC) and Sumuel (c. 1830–1801 BC), both {{took steps}} to cut Isin {{completely}} off from access to canals. [...] After this period, Isin quickly lost political and <b>economic</b> <b>force.</b>|$|R
25|$|At {{the stock}} exchange, share prices {{rise and fall}} depending, largely, on <b>economic</b> <b>forces.</b> Share prices tend to rise or remain stable when {{companies}} and the economy in general show signs of stability and growth. An economic recession, depression, or financial crisis could eventually lead to a stock market crash. Therefore, the movement of share prices and in general of the stock indexes can be {{an indicator of the}} general trend in the economy.|$|E
25|$|Development {{geography}} is {{a branch of}} geography which refers to {{the standard of living}} and its quality of life of its human inhabitants. In this context, development is a process of change that affects people's lives. It may involve an improvement in the quality of life as perceived by the people undergoing change. However, development is not always a positive process. Gunder Frank commented on the global <b>economic</b> <b>forces</b> that lead to the development of underdevelopment. This is covered in his dependency theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} {{value of the}} yen is determined in foreign exchange markets by the <b>economic</b> <b>forces</b> of supply and demand. The supply of the yen in the market is governed by the desire of yen holders to exchange their yen for other currencies to purchase goods, services, or assets. The demand for the yen is governed by the desire of foreigners to buy goods and services in Japan and by their interest in investing in Japan (buying yen-denominated real and financial assets).|$|E
50|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the organization, and Klein's role in {{building}} it into a regional <b>economic</b> <b>force</b> were the subject {{of one of the}} case studies in C. K. Prahalad's Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid.|$|R

50|$|One of the Valley's major {{tourist attractions}} is the semi-tropical wildlife. Birds and {{butterflies}} attract {{a large amount}} of visitors every year all throughout the entire valley. Ecotourism is a major <b>economic</b> <b>force</b> in the Rio Grande Valley.|$|R
25|$|Avalon Hill {{was subject}} {{to a number of}} bad <b>economic</b> <b>forces</b> around 1961, and quickly ran up a large debt. In 1963 Avalon Hill was sold to the Monarch Avalon Printing company to settle the debts. The new owners {{resolved}} to let the company continue to do what it had been doing, and while Roberts left, his friend, Tom Shaw, who already worked at the company, took over. The sale {{turned out to be an}} advantage, as being owned by a printing company helped insure that Avalon Hill games had access to superior physical components.|$|E
25|$|Because of its diverse {{landscapes and}} waterways, Oregon's economy is largely powered by {{various forms of}} agriculture, fishing, and {{hydroelectric}} power. Oregon is also the top timber producer of the contiguous United States, and the timber industry dominated the state's economy in the 20thcentury. Technology is another one of Oregon's major <b>economic</b> <b>forces,</b> beginning in the 1970s {{with the establishment of}} the Silicon Forest and the expansion of Tektronix and Intel. Sportswear company Nike, Inc., headquartered in Beaverton, is the state's largest public corporation with an annual revenue of $30.6billion.|$|E
25|$|The Service {{responded to}} the {{emerging}} social and <b>economic</b> <b>forces</b> of the New Deal era, by expanding its cooperative relationships with the States, securing enactment of the comprehensive Park, Parkway and Recreation Area Study Act of 1936, and initiating four new types of Federal park areas — National Parkways, National Recreation Areas, National Seashores and Recreational Demonstration Areas. By {{the end of this}} period, fifteen of the over 50 such areas remained under the administration of the National Park Service. Because they had much in common, they were collectively designated Recreation Areas in the Reorganization of 1964.|$|E
500|$|From {{roughly the}} last half of the 19th century until independence, the Pieds-Noirs {{accounted}} for approximately 10% of the total Algerian population. [...] Although they constituted a numerical minority, they were undoubtedly the prime political and <b>economic</b> <b>force</b> of the region.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{the sole}} <b>economic</b> <b>force</b> driving {{the growth of}} Altoona into a City was the Pennsylvania Railroad. While the various local {{railroad}} shops still employ over a thousand people, {{they are no longer}} the driving economic engine of the area.|$|R
25|$|Silversmithing was reinvigorated in Taxco by American William Spratling, {{who moved}} to the town in the 1920s, {{creating}} silver design workshops and exported items, mostly to the United States. With its fame for silversmithing, tourism became a major <b>economic</b> <b>force</b> in Taxco.|$|R
25|$|As the {{availability}} and fame of high-quality Pocahontas bituminous coal increased, <b>economic</b> <b>forces</b> took over. Coal operators and their employees settled dozens of towns in southern West Virginia, {{and in the next}} few years, as coal demand swelled, some of them amassed fortunes. The countryside was soon sprinkled with tipples, coke ovens, houses for workers, company stores and churches. In the four decades before the Crash of 1929 and subsequent Depression, these coal towns flourished. One example was the small community of Bramwell, West Virginia, which in its heyday boasted the highest per capita concentration of millionaires in the country.|$|E
25|$|British money {{managers}} were {{driven by a}} complex set of global <b>economic</b> <b>forces</b> including a decline in British investment opportunities, excess capital, and massive investment expansion on the Canadian frontier. Reduced grain production in Europe and increased grain production in the Prairie Provinces also encouraged the export of capital from London. The mythical image of the Palliser as an abundant region, coupled with a growing confidence in technology, created {{a false sense of security}} and stability. Between 1908 and 1913 British firms lent vast sums to Canadian farmers to plant their wheat crops; only when the drought began in 1916 did it become clear that far too much credit had been extended.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} nineteenth century through the Great Depression, social and <b>economic</b> <b>forces</b> exerted a harmful impact on the {{structure}} of Bengal's income distribution and the ability of its agricultural sector to sustain the populace. These processes included a rapidly growing population, increasing household debt, stagnant agricultural productivity, increased social stratification, and alienation of the peasant class from their landholdings. The interaction of these left clearly defined social and economic groups mired in poverty and indebtedness, unable to cope with economic shocks or maintain their access to food beyond the near term. In 1942 and 1943, in the immediate and central context of the Second World War, the shocks Bengalis faced were numerous, complex and sometimes sudden. Millions were vulnerable to starvation.|$|E
50|$|Public {{procurement}} is {{an important}} <b>economic</b> <b>force,</b> and therefore it {{is an important}} tool to promote accessibility. The legislative package of public procurement Directives, approved in 2004 by the European Parliament and the EU's Council of Ministers, will help simplify and modernize procurement procedures.|$|R
50|$|The {{extensive}} lands {{owned by}} monasteries made the monasteries a significant political and <b>economic</b> <b>force.</b> Many of these monasteries also owned Gypsy and Tatar slaves. Monastic institutions enjoyed fiscal privileges, including an exemption from taxes, although 16th-century monarchs occasionally tried to seize monastic assets.|$|R
2500|$|UIC is a {{major part}} of the Illinois Medical District (IMD). While IMD's billing itself [...] "the nation's largest urban medical {{district}}" [...] may be up for debate, the district {{is a major}} <b>economic</b> <b>force</b> contributing $3.3 billion to the local economy and supporting 50,000 jobs.|$|R
