As an operating business of IAC, Ask Partner Network had also historically entered into partnerships with some software security vendors, whereby they distributed the toolbar alongside their software.

The Personal <b>Home</b> <b>Pages</b> of five Internet Service Providers were sampled and 16 Personal <b>Home</b> <b>Pages</b> of adults with Down's syndrome were found that referred in some way to friendships. A thematic analysis of these pages indicated that the authors could be attempting to present an image of themselves as someone who is capable of having friends. Analysis of the guest-book messages also revealed that the readers of the <b>Home</b> <b>Pages</b> were responding to these attempts at initiating a relationship.
