40|$|This paper {{presents}} a digits classification system to recognize telephone numbers written on signboards. Candidate regions of digits are extracted from an image through edge extraction, enhancement and labeling. Since the digits in the images often have skew and slant, the digits are recognized after the skew and slant correction. To correct the skew, Hough transform is used, and the slant is corrected {{using the method}} of circumscribing digits with tilted rectangles. In experiments, we tested a total of 1, 332 images of signboards with 11, 939 digits.

The Jamaican dollar has been slipping, despite intervention, resulting in an average exchange rate of J$73.40 per US$1.00 and J136.2 per €1.00 (February 2011). In addition, inflation has been trending upward since 2004 and is projected to once again reach a double <b>digit</b> <b>rate</b> of 12-13% through the year 2008 due {{to a combination of}} unfavorable weather damaging crops and increasing agricultural imports and high energy prices.|$|R

5000|$|The {{key to the}} {{new system}} was {{two-stage}} multi-frequency pulsing. The outgoing sender sent its Class 4 toll center an off-hook signal as usual, received a wink as usual as a [...] "proceed to send" [...] signal, and outpulsed only a special 3-digit (later 6-digit) access code. The toll center picked a trunk through the long distance network to the gateway office, which sent a second wink to the originating office, which then sent the whole dialed number. Thus the toll switching system needed no modification except at the gateway. The international trunks used Signaling System No. 5, a [...] "North Atlantic" [...] version of the North American multi-frequency signaling system, with minor modifications including slightly higher <b>digit</b> <b>rate.</b> European MF systems of the time used compelled signalling, which would slow down too much on a long transoceanic connection.|$|R

40|$|Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit diverse functions, {{including}} {{regulation of}} development. Here, we combine genome-wide mapping of SMAD 3 occupancy with expression analysis to identify lncRNAs induced by activin signaling during endoderm differentiation of {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESCs). We find that DIGIT is divergent to Goosecoid (GSC) and expressed during endoderm differentiation. Deletion of the SMAD 3 -occupied enhancer proximal to DIGIT inhibits DIGIT and GSC expression and definitive endoderm differentiation. Disruption of the gene encoding DIGIT and depletion of the DIGIT transcript reveal that DIGIT is required for definitive endoderm differentiation. In addition, we identify the mouse ortholog of DIGIT and show that it is expressed during development and promotes definitive endoderm differentiation of mouse ESCs. DIGIT regulates GSC in trans, and activation of endogenous GSC expression is sufficient to rescue definitive endoderm differentiation in DIGIT-deficient hESCs. Our study <b>defines</b> <b>DIGIT</b> as a conserved noncoding developmental regulator of definitive endoderm...|$|R
40|$|Recent events, {{historical}} evidence and geographical proximity {{suggest that the}} six EFTAns and twelve Central and East European countries (CEECs) are natural trading partners. This paper evaluates this suggestion by estimating the potential for EFTA-CEEC trade using the gravity model of Wang and Winters (1991). The findings show that even at 1989 CEEC income levels, EFTA-CEEC trade should have been four times greater than it was. Thus the CEEC markets should have been as important to Austria, Iceland and Switzerland as were the EFTA markets. A second estimation is carried out assuming that CEECs' incomes catch up to 70 % of the EC's by 2005, 2010 and 2020. In this scenario, EFTA-CEEC trade grows at double <b>digit</b> <b>rates</b> for decades, finally attaining a level where CEEC markets account for almost a fifth of EFTA members' exports to all of Europe.
