5|$|Eldred {{arrived in}} Italy in July 1918 and {{eventually}} at Sub Chaser Base 25, located in Corfu, Greece in September 1918. There {{he served as}} a machinist aboard submarine chaser SC-244, where they patrolled the Strait of Otranto and were engaged in combat. While in Corfu, Eldred and many others got sick with the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic. The conditions at the hospital were so bad that he had to crawl to a stream to <b>get</b> <b>water,</b> which resulted in a permanent scar on his left hip. Eldred began his return to the United States and arrived in Malta on December 25, 1918. By February 1919, he was in Gibraltar. He was given the option of staying in the Navy until they arrived home in six months or being discharged and paying his own way home. He elected the discharge and was separated from the Navy on March 4, 1919. He met some U.S. Army soldiers who were en route to America aboard an Army troop ship. They took him aboard as a stowaway and loaned him an Army uniform. Eldred slept in a life boat {{on the way back to}} America.|$|E
5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not <b>get</b> <b>water,</b> he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E

25|$|In urban areas, {{those that}} do not receive water from the piped network often have to purhchase {{expensive}} water of dubious quality from private water vendors. For example, in Delhi water trucks <b>get</b> <b>water</b> from illegal wells {{on the banks of the}} Yamuna River for 0.75 rupees per gallon (about USD 2.70/m3).|$|E
25|$|Kevin Black (Paul Gross) is a yuppie {{developer}} {{from the}} big city who is usually outwitted by the landowners of Possum Lake. Kevin Black appeared in the sixth and seventh seasons. He is frequently surprised by the rural aspects of Possum Lake, such as {{the idea of having}} to dig a well in order to <b>get</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1660, Riquet {{found the}} {{solution}} to the main problem: the water supply to the summit point to feed both sides of the canal. His idea was to <b>get</b> <b>water</b> flowing from the Black Mountain. His important knowledge of the hydrography of the Black Mountain and Sor allowed him to imagine an ingenious irrigation system. He was inspired by the French engineer Adam de Craponne who had implemented the same system for the Craponne Canal.|$|E

25|$|Prices paid {{to water}} vendors. In some slums the {{majority}} of residents does not have legal access to water, and most people <b>get</b> <b>water</b> from tankers or water points. Because residents lack legal title over the land that they occupy, {{they are unable to}} connect legally to the water and sanitation network. Water provided by tankers costs two to three Egyptian pounds for 25 litres, approximately 300 times more than the tariff for piped water.|$|E
25|$|Colonel DeLand {{tried to}} impose {{discipline}} on the disorderly camp but was frustrated by its poor condition and corrupt guards, including especially those {{from his own}} regiment. Because only two water hydrants were available to the prisoners, they had {{to wait in the}} cold for hours to <b>get</b> <b>water.</b> Open sinks (latrines), or sewers, ran through the middle of the camp. The rundown buildings provided inadequate shelter. Hospital capacity, with 120 beds for prisoners and 50 beds for guards, was seriously inadequate. The post chapel was converted into hospital space, but there was still insufficient capacity for all the sick prisoners and guards.|$|E
25|$|Public opinion. A 2008 {{survey of}} Kenyan public opinion {{reported}} that water supply {{is not considered}} as {{a high priority for}} government action. Only about 5% of respondents said that water supply was among the ten most important issues that the government should address, even though 60% think that the government is handling the issue badly. The survey also monitored instances of corruption in the sub-sector: 15% of urban and 11% of rural respondents reported that they had to pay a bribe, give a gift or do a favour to government officials to <b>get</b> <b>water</b> or sanitation services in the past year.|$|E

25|$|Lack {{of access}} to water supply and {{sanitation}} has significant health impacts. In addition, it imposes a significant burden on women and girls who have to carry water. For instance, more than one in five households in Umutara is more than an hour away from its water source. This has implications for the quality of women's and girls' lives, their economic productivity and their access to education. Even where people statistically do have access to an improved water source such as a communal borehole that in some cases is shared by up to 175 families, they sometimes have to wait for more than four hours before they can <b>get</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
25|$|Starting {{in about}} 1848 the South Alternate of Oregon Trail (also called the Snake River Cutoff) was {{developed}} as a spur off the main trail. It bypassed the Three Island Crossing and continued traveling down {{the south side of}} the Snake River. It rejoined the trail near present-day Ontario, Oregon. It hugged the southern edge of the Snake River canyon and was a much rougher trail with poorer water and grass, requiring occasional steep descents and ascents with the animals down into the Snake River canyon to <b>get</b> <b>water.</b> Travellers on this route avoided two dangerous crossings of the Snake River. Today's Idaho State Route 78 roughly follows the path of the South Alternate route of the Oregon Trail.|$|E
25|$|According to the government's National Research Center, 40 {{percent of}} Cairo's {{inhabitants}} do not <b>get</b> <b>water</b> {{for more than}} three hours per day and three large districts do not receive any piped water. In 2008 demonstrations concerning this issue took place in Suez, where 500 people blocked a main road to Cairo. According to a survey carried out prior to 2006 in governorate of Fayoum, 46% of households complained about low water pressure, 30% about frequent water cuts and 22% complained that water is not available during day time. These problems lead many people to use water from canals which could be hazardous to health. Service quality is particularly poor in mature informal districts where about 20% of the Egyptian population lives.|$|E

50|$|The {{aim of the}} {{community}} development projects was to get children back into schools and provide parents with sustainable lively hoods. The education side focused on making class rooms safe, relaying floors and fixing anything broken. They also wanted to improve uniforms, first aid kits, text book standards and school moral. Another huge problem was sanitation and water. Being {{at the side of}} Niger, there should be no trouble <b>getting</b> <b>water.</b> However lack of finance for plumbing makes <b>getting</b> <b>water</b> into the town very hard. RHHF before any volunteers arrived established SBMC’s (Schools based management committees) at five schools in Jebba. The volunteers would focus on putting these ideas into practice.|$|R

25|$|Gopher {{tortoises}} are herbivore scavengers. Their diets contains over 300 {{species of}} plants. They consume {{a very wide}} range of plants, but mainly eat broad-leaved grass, regular grass, wiregrass, and terrestrial legumes. They also eat mushrooms, and fruits such as gopher apple, pawpaw, blackberries, and saw palmetto berries. In addition, gopher tortoises eat flowers from the genera Cnidoscolus (nettles), Tillandsia (Spanish and ball moss), Richardia, and Dyschoriste. Juvenile tortoises tend to eat more legumes, which are higher in protein, and fewer grasses and tough, fibrous plants than mature tortoises. Gopher tortoises {{have been known to}} scavenge carrion and eat excrement. As gopher tortoises usually <b>get</b> <b>water</b> from the food they eat, they usually only drink standing water in times of extreme drought.|$|E
25|$|According to PALYJA in {{its western}} {{half of the}} {{concession}} the service coverage ratio increased substantially from 34% in 1998 to 59% in 2007 and 65% in 2010. According to data by the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body, access in {{the eastern half of}} the city served by PTJ increased from about 57% in 1998 to about 67% in 2004, but stagnated after that. However, other sources cite much lower access figures for piped water supply to houses, excluding access provided through public hydrants: One study estimated access as low as 25% in 2005, while another source estimates it to be as low as 18.5% in 2011. Those without access to piped water supply <b>get</b> <b>water</b> mostly from wells that are often salty and polluted with bacteria. As of 2017, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jakarta has a crisis of clean water.|$|E
25|$|The Afrobarometer Survey 2008 {{collected}} {{information about}} Tanzanians' {{opinions about the}} water sector. The disparity in access to safe and clean water between rural and urban areas {{is illustrated by the}} responses: 51% of urban residents were satisfied with government efforts to deliver water and sanitation services, compared to 39% in rural areas. Accordingly, the water sector is considered as a higher priority for government action by rural Tanzanians. 44% of respondents in rural areas cited water supply as one of the three most pressing issues that the government should address (for 16% it {{is the single most important}} problem). In urban areas water supply came third behind economic and health concerns in 25% of responses. Issues of corruption in the water sector were also examined by the Survey: 4% of respondents admitted that they had to pay a bribe, give a gift, or do a favor to government officials in order to <b>get</b> <b>water</b> or sanitation services in the past year.|$|E

25|$|The Castilian fleet {{divided and}} part of the ships headed to the Llobregat river to <b>get</b> <b>water.</b> There they were confronted by many peasants of Barcelona and Sant Boi, and Peter I reorganized his forces and sailed to Ibiza, where he placed its castle under siege. Peter IV {{gathered}} a force of 50 galleys collected from Collioure, which he entrusted to Admiral Count of Osona with Cardona as vice-admiral. Relieving the island, the Castilian army left the siege and reembarked. Though he had numerical advantage, Peter I chose not to join the battle and withdrew. He was pursued by 15 or 20 galleys under Bernat de Cabrera. This force then anchored at the Denia estuary. The Castilians were then willing of fight, but as the Aragonese position was strong and supported by land forces, Peter I decided to sail back to Seville. Upon his arrival, Peter found that his armies had been defeated on 22 September in the largest land battle of the war at Araviana.|$|E
25|$|On July 16, 1861, McDowell {{departed}} Washington {{with the}} largest field army yet gathered on the North American continent, about 35,000 men (28,452 effectives). McDowell's plan was to move westward in three columns and make a diversionary attack on the Confederate line at Bull Run with two columns, while the third column moved around the Confederates' right flank to the south, cutting the railroad to Richmond and threatening {{the rear of the}} Confederate army. He assumed that the Confederates would be forced to abandon Manassas Junction and fall back to the Rappahannock River, the next defensible line in Virginia, which would relieve some of the pressure on the U.S. capital. McDowell had hoped to have his army at Centreville by 17 July, but the troops, unaccustomed to marching, moved in starts and stops. Along the route soldiers often broke ranks to wander off to pick apples or blackberries or to <b>get</b> <b>water,</b> regardless of the orders of their officers to remain in ranks.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking more}} captives and booty, the raiders left Mindoro {{to return to}} Mindanao. They put into the river of a little {{uninhabited}} island to <b>get</b> <b>water</b> and wood. Just at that time Governor Bravo, who was hastily returning to Manila after he had received news of the pirates, passed the island. He passed so {{near the mouth of}} the river, in three small boats with very few men, that it was a wonder that he was not seen and captured by the enemy. He learned that the enemy was there, and then he met with the twelve vessels sent from Manila in search of the raiders. The governor ordered the commander to make more haste and gave him some of his own men to guide him to where he had left the pirates the day before, whereupon they went to attack them. However, the sentinels of the raiders raised the alarm, and they left the river in haste, throwing into the sea goods and slaves in order to flee more lightly.|$|E
