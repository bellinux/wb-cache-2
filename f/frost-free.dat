5|$|Due to A. rubrums {{very wide}} range, there is {{significant}} variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, <b>frost-free</b> periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As {{a result of the}} variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban cultivars that require resistance from verticillium wilt, air pollution, and drought.|$|E
5|$|Michigan, one of {{the fifty}} United States, is home to two types of lizards, {{nineteen}} types of snakes and eleven types of turtles, {{all members of the}} class Reptilia. Reptiles are found throughout Michigan, although the only venomous species, the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, is seen only in the Lower Peninsula. Reptiles are cold-blooded, and so usually pass the cold winters of Michigan in <b>frost-free</b> areas, such as underground burrows (for snakes and land-dwelling turtles) or the bottoms of lakes and streams (for water-dwelling turtles). Most reptiles in Michigan are protected by state law, but many are still at risk due to human encroachment on their habitats, the draining of wetlands and, in the case of snakes, indiscriminate killing by fearful humans. In 1995, the painted turtle was named as Michigan's state reptile.|$|E
5|$|During the Triassic {{period of}} some 251–199.6Ma, the Indian subcontinent {{was part of}} a vast supercontinent known as Pangaea. Despite its {{position}} within a high-latitude belt at 55–75°S—latitudes now occupied by parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, as opposed to India's current position between 5 and 35°N—India likely experienced a humid temperate climate with warm and <b>frost-free</b> weather, though with well-defined seasons. India later merged into the southern supercontinent Gondwana, a process beginning some 550–500Ma. During the Late Paleozoic, Gondwana extended from a point at or near the South Pole to near the equator, where the Indian craton (stable continental crust) was positioned, resulting in a mild climate favourable to hosting high-biomass ecosystems. This is underscored by India's vast coal reserves—much of it from the late Paleozoic sedimentary sequence—the fourth-largest reserves in the world. During the Mesozoic, the world, including India, was considerably warmer than today. With the coming of the Carboniferous, global cooling stoked extensive glaciation, which spread northwards from South Africa towards India; this cool period lasted well into the Permian.|$|E
25|$|Only about 20% of North Korea's mountainous {{terrain is}} arable land. Much {{of the land}} is only <b>frost-free</b> for six months, {{allowing}} only one crop per year. The country has never been self-sufficient in food, and many experts considered it unrealistic to try to be.|$|E
25|$|Plants may {{be grown}} from seed and treated as annuals. In <b>frost-free</b> climates, {{or where the}} roots can be {{protected}} from frost, plants may be perennial, regrowing from the base after dying back in the winter. Selected forms and cultivars may be grown from cuttings.|$|E

25|$|Waterloo has a humid {{continental}} {{climate of the}} warm summer subtype (Dfb under the Köppen climate classification); this means that there are large seasonal differences, usually very warm to hot (and humid) summers and cold (to very cold) winters. Compared {{to the rest of}} Canada, it has moderate weather. Winter temperatures generally last from the middle of December until the middle of March, while summer temperatures generally occur between the middle of May to close to the end of September. Temperatures can exceed 30℃ (86℉) several times a year. Waterloo has approximately 140 <b>frost-free</b> days per year.|$|E
25|$|Dahlias grow {{naturally}} in climates {{which do not}} experience frost (the tubers are hardy to USDA Zone 8), consequently they are not adapted to withstand sub-zero temperatures. However, their tuberous nature enables them to survive periods of dormancy, and this characteristic means that gardeners in temperate climates with frosts can grow dahlias successfully, provided the tubers are lifted {{from the ground and}} stored in cool yet <b>frost-free</b> conditions during the winter. Planting the tubers quite deep (10 – 15cm) also provides some protection. When in active growth, modern dahlia hybrids perform most successfully in well-watered yet free-draining soils, in situations receiving plenty of sunlight. Taller cultivars usually require some form of staking as they grow, and all garden dahlias need deadheading regularly, once flowering commences.|$|E
25|$|Modern humans spread rapidly from Africa {{into the}} <b>frost-free</b> zones of Europe and Asia around 60,000 years ago. The rapid {{expansion}} of humankind to North America and Oceania {{took place at the}} climax of the most recent ice age, when temperate regions of today were extremely inhospitable. Yet, humans had colonized nearly all the ice-free parts of the globe {{by the end of the}} Ice Age, some 12,000 years ago. Other hominids such as Homo erectus had been using simple wood and stone tools for millennia, but as time progressed, tools became far more refined and complex. Perhaps as early as 1.8 million years ago, but certainly by 500,000 years ago, humans began using fire for heat and cooking. They also developed language in the Paleolithic period and a conceptual repertoire that included systematic burial of the dead and adornment of the living. Early artistic expression can be found in the form of cave paintings and sculptures made from ivory, stone, and bone, showing a spirituality generally interpreted as animism, or even shamanism. During this period, all humans lived as hunter-gatherers, and were generally nomadic. Archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover.|$|E

500|$|Sugarcane {{refers to}} any of several species, or their hybrids, of giant grasses in the genus Saccharum [...] in the family Poaceae. They have been {{cultivated}} in tropical climates in South Asia and Southeast Asia since ancient times for the sucrose that is found in their stems. A great expansion in sugarcane production {{took place in the}} 18th century with the establishment of slave plantations in the Americas. The use of slavery meant that {{this was the first time}} that sugar became cheap enough for most people, who previously had to rely on honey to sweeten foods. It requires a <b>frost-free</b> climate with sufficient rainfall during the growing season to make full use of the plant's great growth potential. The crop is harvested mechanically or by hand, chopped into lengths and conveyed rapidly to the processing plant (commonly known as a sugar mill). Here, it is either milled and the juice extracted with water or extracted by diffusion. The juice is then clarified with lime and heated to destroy enzymes. The resulting thin syrup is concentrated in a series of evaporators, after which further water is removed by evaporation in vacuum containers. The resulting supersaturated solution is seeded with sugar crystals and the sugar crystallizes out and is separated from the fluid and dried. Molasses is a by-product of the process and the fiber from the stems, known as bagasse, is burned to provide energy for the sugar extraction process. The crystals of raw sugar have a sticky brown coating and either can be used as they are or can be bleached by sulfur dioxide or can be treated in a carbonatation process to produce a whiter product. [...] About [...] of irrigation water is needed for every one kilogram of sugar produced.|$|E
