5|$|The {{effects of}} miRNA dysregulation of gene {{expression}} {{seem to be}} important <b>in</b> <b>cancer.</b> For instance, in gastrointestinal cancers, nine miRNAs {{have been identified as}} epigenetically altered and effective in down regulating DNA repair enzymes.|$|E
50|$|Deficient {{expression}} of multiple DNA repair genes are often found <b>in</b> <b>cancers,</b> and {{may contribute to}} the thousands of mutations usually found <b>in</b> <b>cancers</b> (see Mutation frequencies <b>in</b> <b>cancers).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Reductions in {{expression}} of DNA repair genes (usually caused by epigenetic alterations) are very common <b>in</b> <b>cancers,</b> and are ordinarily even more frequent than mutational defects in DNA repair genes <b>in</b> <b>cancers.</b> [...] DNA-PKcs expression was reduced by 23% to 57% <b>in</b> six <b>cancers</b> as indicated <b>in</b> the table.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{not clear}} what causes reduced {{expression}} of DNA-PKcs <b>in</b> <b>cancers.</b> MicroRNA-101 targets DNA-PKcs via binding to the 3'- UTR of DNA-PKcs mRNA and efficiently reduces protein levels of DNA-PKcs. [...] But miR-101 is more often decreased <b>in</b> <b>cancers,</b> rather than increased.|$|R
5|$|A 2013 review {{said that}} there is enough {{suggestion}} of potential benefit from ketogenic diets <b>in</b> <b>cancer</b> therapy that establishing clinical trials is probably warranted. At present the only evidence of benefit is anecdotal, but designing effective trials to measure the effect of adopting a ketogenic diet could prove challenging.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used <b>in</b> <b>cancer</b> chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Cervical cancer {{nearly always}} {{involves}} human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is a virus with numerous strains, several of which predispose to precancerous {{changes in the}} cervical epithelium, particularly in the transformation zone, {{which is the most}} common area for cervical cancer to start. HPV vaccines, such as Gardasil and Cervarix, reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, by inoculating against the viral strains involved <b>in</b> <b>cancer</b> development.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{a number}} of pre-clinical studies {{indicating}} synthetic lethality of irinotecan with other genetic or epigenetic DNA repair deficiencies common <b>in</b> <b>cancers.</b> For instance, the DNA repair gene ATM is frequently hypermethylated (silenced) <b>in</b> many <b>cancers</b> (see hypermethylation of ATM <b>in</b> <b>cancers).</b> A 2016 study showed that low expression of the ATM protein <b>in</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> cells <b>in</b> vitro and in a mouse model caused increased sensitivity to inactivation by irinotecan compared to cells with high expression of ATM. [...] This indicates synthetic lethality of ATM deficiency with irinotecan-mediated TOP1 deficiency.|$|R
5|$|Commercially, the {{radioactive}} isotope bismuth-213 {{can be produced}} by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator. In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia. This isotope has also been tried <b>in</b> <b>cancer</b> treatment, for example, in the targeted alpha therapy (TAT) program.|$|E
5|$|Heterodimeric {{antibodies}} have {{a greater}} range in shapes they can take and the drugs that {{are attached to the}} arms donâ€™t have to be the same on each arm, allowing for different combinations of drugs to be used <b>in</b> <b>cancer</b> treatment. Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.|$|E
5|$|However, a {{burst of}} intense neutron and gamma {{radiation}} came directly from the fireball. Its lethal radius was , covering {{about half of the}} firestorm area. An estimated 30% of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation, but died in the firestorm before their radiation injuries would have become apparent. Over 6,000 people survived the blast and fire, but died of radiation injuries. Among injured survivors, 30% had radiation injuries from which they recovered, but with a lifelong increase <b>in</b> <b>cancer</b> risk. To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors' children.|$|E
5000|$|Reductions in {{expression}} of DNA repair genes (usually caused by epigenetic alterations such as promoter hypermethylation) are very common <b>in</b> <b>cancers,</b> and are ordinarily much more frequent than mutational defects in DNA repair genes <b>in</b> <b>cancers.</b> [...] The {{table below shows}} that XPC expression was frequently epigenetically reduced <b>in</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> and also <b>in</b> non-small cell lung cancer, and also shows that XPC was more frequently reduced in the more advanced stages of these cancers.|$|R

50|$|The {{information}} {{summarized in}} Table 2 suggests that under-expression of microRNAs (causing induction of RAD51) occurs frequently <b>in</b> <b>cancers.</b> Over-expression of a microRNA that causes repression of RAD51 {{appears to be}} less frequent.

5|$|In vivo {{studies in}} {{mice and rats}} showed that a topically {{administered}} SEGRAM inhibited peroxidase activity and formation of oedema, both indicators of anti-inflammatory activity, comparably to prednisolone. Systemic administration in mice or rats indicate that SEGRAMs can diminish acute infections, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and colitis. In vivo evidence on whether particular SEGRAMs can elicit similar effects than classic glucocorticoid <b>in</b> <b>cancer</b> pathologies is currently lacking.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid {{has been}} studied as an {{alternative}} to vancomycin in the treatment of febrile neutropenia <b>in</b> <b>cancer</b> patients when Gram-positive infection is suspected. It is also one of few antibiotics that diffuse into the vitreous humor, and may therefore be effective in treating endophthalmitis (inflammation of the inner linings and cavities of the eye) caused by susceptible bacteria. Again, there is little evidence for its use in this setting, as infectious endophthalmitis is treated widely and effectively with vancomycin injected directly into the eye.|$|E

5|$|Pain <b>in</b> <b>cancer</b> can be {{produced}} by mechanical (e.g. pinching) or chemical (e.g. inflammation) stimulation of specialized pain-signalling nerve endings found {{in most parts of}} the body (called nociceptive pain), or it may be caused by diseased, damaged or compressed nerves, in which case it is called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is often accompanied by other feelings such as pins and needles.|$|E
5|$|Pain <b>in</b> <b>cancer</b> {{may arise}} from a tumor {{compressing}} or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response. Most chronic (long-lasting) pain {{is caused by the}} illness and most acute (short-term) pain is caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures. However, radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.|$|E

5|$|Some authors {{challenge}} {{the validity of}} the second step (mild opioids) and, pointing to their higher toxicity and low efficacy, argue that mild opioids could be replaced by small doses of strong opioids (with the possible exception of tramadol due to its demonstrated efficacy <b>in</b> <b>cancer</b> pain, its specificity for neuropathic pain, and its low sedative properties and reduced potential for respiratory depression in comparison to conventional opioids).|$|E
5|$|TCDD may in some {{conditions}} potentiate the carcinogenic {{effects of}} other compounds. An example is benzo(a)pyrene that is metabolized in two steps, oxidation and conjugation. Oxidation produces epoxide carcinogens that are rapidly detoxified by conjugation, but some molecules may {{escape to the}} nucleus of the cell and bind to DNA causing a mutation, resulting <b>in</b> <b>cancer</b> initiation. When TCDD increases the activity of oxidative enzymes more than conjugation enzymes, the epoxide intermediates may increase, increasing the possibility of cancer initiation. Thus a beneficial activation of detoxifying enzymes may lead to deleterious side effects.|$|E
