Secondly, that of using this English language... in a more varied and, to me, more <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> than I had previously had the chance of doing in a film. Thirdly, that of making a picture which paid no regard whatever to established, although not practised, moral convention.|$|E
5|$|To {{demonstrate}} Henry's immortality, Miller {{decided that}} Henry would die and {{would feel the}} pain every time he died. Anything on Henry's body would disappear with his body during each death. Miller felt that Henry's naked rebirth in water would be an <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> to keep the show's protagonist alive during the series by completing the death and rebirth process; the nakedness would create several comedic moments within the series. Miller intended to use Henry's death and rebirth process sporadically after the first two episodes so that the series would focus on Henry's long life.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{encompasses}} many species-rich ecosystems for animals, fungi and plants, Brazil houses {{many thousands}} of species, with many (if not most) of them still undiscovered. Due to the relatively explosive economic and demographic rise {{of the country in}} the last century, Brazil's ability to protect its environmental habitats has increasingly come under threat. Extensive logging in the nation's forests, particularly the Amazon, both official and unofficial, destroys areas {{the size of a small}} country each year, and potentially a diverse variety of plants and animals. However, as various species possess special characteristics, or are built in an <b>interesting</b> <b>way,</b> some of their capabilities are being copied for use in technology (see bionics), and the profit potential may result in a retardation of deforestation.|$|E

25|$|Measurements of the {{preceding}} sort are of ambient air - that is, air where people might breathe it and not in workplaces. These measurements are usually reliable and available. A possibly trickier measurement is of where the pollution comes from, often a question addressed by emissions inventories. In BC and other Canadian jurisdictions facilities are required to report to Environment Canada {{on an annual basis}} their releases of toxic substances to the air. There is a natural tendency in self reporting to under-report, notwithstanding which the inventory resulting tracks releases in an <b>interesting</b> <b>way.</b> At the NPRI we can see a complex example in the historical report summary of Canfor's NPRI reporting in recent years. Criticisms of such reporting has been done by Scott Vaughan, Commissioner for Sustainable Development and the Environment in his Fall 2009 report.|$|E

500|$|Rippy {{used the}} Audiokinetic Wwise {{pipeline}} to create dynamic music that changes with {{the action in}} the game. Although Rippy used Wwise's tools only for dynamic music, they made audio system setup much easier than in previous Ensemble games. For each battle sequence, the musical cue was divided into sections and mixed differently for each section. [...] "When a cue is triggered, an intro plays and then the game randomly picks between all of those elements {{for as long as}} the battle continues," [...] Rippy explained. [...] "Once it's over, an outro plays and then it's back to the regular [...] "world" [...] music.

It was written and produced by Gotye himself, while in his parents' barn on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria.

[...] The producers doubled it to around $4 million, and she signed on, allowing Fox to greenlight the film. According to Frankel, Streep saw the film {{as a chance to}} [...] "skewer the doyennes of the fashion world."

500|$|Akiva Goldsman {{decided to}} move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take {{advantage}} of locations that would more easily show emptiness. Goldsman explained, [...] "L.A. looks empty at three o'clock in the afternoon, [...] New York is never empty [...] [...] [...] it was a much more <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> of showing the windswept emptiness of the world." [...] Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics, but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder, and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people. The test had a powerful effect on studio executives. Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct, several blocks of Fifth Avenue, and Washington Square Park. The film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format, with flashback scenes shot in Super 35.|$|E
500|$|Michael Tedder of Vulture {{awarded the}} episode—along with [...] "Junior Salesman"—four stars out of five.

[...] However, he was critical of the Brian subplot, calling it [...] "the least <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> this camera crew reveal could have gone". Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode a 7 out of 10, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. Despite noting that the show itself was still good in comparison to much of television, Cornet wrote that the episode {{is an example of the}} [...] "danger of needlessly dragging things out, as we have seen the waste of ending things before they have had the opportunity to reach their full potential in the past." [...] Cornet praised Kevin's [...] "truth bomb", writing that it [...] "worked beautifully", but she called [...] "the 'man behind the curtain' reveal ... a bitter disappointment" [...] and a [...] "cop-out" [...] to engage the audience.|$|E
500|$|On {{the subject}} of {{returning}} for the sequel, Larter was chosen by New Line Cinema over her co-star Devon Sawa, who played as Alex Browning in the first film. [...] "We’ve brought back Clear in an <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> and we just felt that to bring both of them back would make you wonder too much just what the hell they’d {{been doing for the}} past few months," [...] producer Craig Perry conveyed on developing the cliffhanger of Final Destination. Perry said that bringing back Clear over Alex was due to narrative reasons, stating that there were no financial problems that prevented Sawa from returning. He also observed that Clear is more knowledgeable in terms of mentoring the new protagonist and that she was utilized as the main link to the original film. Larter was delighted when New Line reinstated her and found it [...] "terrific" [...] that she had some input into the script. As a result, Sawa's character was killed off-screen in Final Destination 2, as divulged by Clear to Kimberly during their first meeting.|$|E

Critics also praised the weapon customization system, [...] "the weapon upgrade system puts a unique spin on traditional standards. Although you do earn the occasional new gun, you spend more time enhancing your current firearm." [...] RPGamer gave the game its Most Original award, for presenting [...] "a gaming experience unlike any this past year", including a [...] "unique battle system" [...] emphasizing tactical combat, the strategic way in which [...] "the world map was opened up", the ability to [...] "modify almost every aspect of the characters' appearances", and [...] "the way that its story is told."

The subplot involving Brian (played by Chris Diamantopoulos), a boom mic operator for the in-series documentary, was met with mostly negative reviews. Michael Tedder of Vulture called it [...] "the least <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> this camera crew reveal could have gone". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic criticized the reintroduction of the character in the episode [...] "Promos", noting that his reappearance felt [...] "forced".

500|$|In 2002, Rick and Laura Brown, two sculptors from Massachusetts, {{along with}} Massachusetts College of Art and Design {{students}} and faculty, constructed another replica. The Browns {{set out to}} gain a better understanding of human ingenuity while keeping Bushnell’s design, materials, and technique authentic. “With it, Yankee ingenuity was born,” observed Rick Brown, referring to the latest in a long line of commemoration that perceived the Turtle as something authentically American. Of the temptation to use synthetic and ahistorical materials, Rob Duarte, a MassArts student observed, “It was always a temptation to use silicone to seal the thing," [...] says Rob Duarte, a MassArt student.

The log was seven feet in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor test tank at the United States Naval Academy.
