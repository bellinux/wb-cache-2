5|$|Due to {{attitudes in}} Western {{medicine}} in the 1940s and 1950s, Native American and Fijian cultures and societies were strongly dissuaded from premastication due to concerns about the hygiene of the practice. However, the lack of knowledge regarding premastication and its prohibition by missionaries and doctors instead caused severe anemia in the infants of the population, or resulted in malnourished <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> children deprived of nourishment.|$|E
5|$|Premastication is {{complementary}} to breastfeeding in {{the health}} practices of <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> young children, providing large amounts of carbohydrate and protein nutrients not always available through breast milk, and micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12 which are essential nutrients present mainly in meat. Compounds in the saliva, such as haptocorrin also help increase B12 availability by protecting the vitamin against stomach acid.|$|E

5|$|Tuberculosis {{prevention}} and control efforts rely {{primarily on the}} vaccination of <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.

5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
5|$|At {{each stage}} {{mentioned}} above, children play with sounds and learn methods {{to help them}} learn words. There is a relationship between children's prelinguistic phonetic skills and their lexical progress at age two: failure to develop the required phonetic skills in their prelinguistic period results in children's delay in producing words. Environmental influences may affect children's phonological development, such as hearing loss {{as a result of}} ear infections. Deaf <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> children with hearing problems due to infections are usually delayed in the beginning of vocal babbling.|$|E

5|$|Attachments between <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is {{not sensitive}} and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves {{as best they can}} within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E

5|$|Dopamine as a {{manufactured}} {{medication is}} sold under the trade names Intropin, Dopastat, and Revimine, among others.

It is most commonly used as a stimulant drug {{in the treatment of}} severe low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and cardiac arrest. It is especially important in treating these in newborn infants. It is given intravenously. Since the half-life of dopamine in plasma is very short—approximately one minute in adults, two minutes in newborn <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> up to five minutes in preterm infants—it is usually given in a continuous intravenous drip rather than a single injection.|$|E
50|$|Theorists have {{proposed}} {{four types of}} attachment styles: secure, anxious-avoidant, anxious-resistant, and disorganized. Secure attachment is a healthy attachment between the <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> the caregiver. It is characterized by trust. Anxious-avoidant is an insecure attachment between an <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> a caregiver. This {{is characterized by the}} infant's indifference toward the caregiver. Anxious-resistant is an insecure attachment between the <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> the caregiver characterized by distress from the <b>infant</b> when separated <b>and</b> anger when reunited. Disorganized is an attachment style without a consistent pattern of responses upon return of the parent.|$|R

5|$|Exposure to {{conversations and}} {{engaging}} in conversation with others help school-age children develop vocabulary. Fast mapping {{is the process of}} learning a new concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> toddlers, but by preschool children and adults as well. This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly in conversation, but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.|$|E
5|$|For <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier}} than the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E
5|$|However, stool {{cultures}} {{should be}} performed in those with blood in the stool, those {{who might have been}} exposed to food poisoning, and those who have recently traveled to the developing world.

As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.|$|E

Our result shows that urban advantage over rural areas in under- 5 mortality rate only exist among the richest quintiles in Nigeria. We find no evidence of statistically significant difference between the urban poorest and poorer quintiles and the rural poorest and poorer quintiles in both <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> under- 5 mortality in Nigeria. We find wealth, educational attainment of the mother, the use of health facility, religion, gender of a child, and number of births in the last 3 years to be highly correlated with <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> under- 5 mortality in Nigeria.

5|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common nutritional deficiency in the world. When loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary iron intake, a state of latent iron deficiency occurs, which over time leads to iron-deficiency anemia if left untreated, which is characterised by an insufficient number of red blood cells and an insufficient amount of hemoglobin. Children, pre-menopausal women (women of child-bearing age), and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease. Most cases of iron-deficiency anemia are mild, but if not treated can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat, complications during pregnancy, and delayed growth in <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> children.|$|E
