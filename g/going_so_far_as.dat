Despite the absence of these states, Agesilaus campaigned effectively against the Persians in Lydia, advancing as far inland as Sardis. The satrap Tissaphernes was executed for his failure to contain Agesilaus, and his replacement, Tithraustes, bribed the Spartans to move north, into the satrapy of Pharnabazus. Agesilaus did so, but simultaneously began preparing a sizable navy.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{having taken}} Anne to France on a pre-nuptial honeymoon, Henry married her in Westminster Abbey in January 1533. This was made easier {{by the death}} of Archbishop Warham, a strong {{opponent}} of an annulment. Henry appointed Thomas Cranmer as his successor as Archbishop of Canterbury. Cranmer was prepared to grant the annulment of the marriage to Catherine as Henry required, <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to pronounce the judgment that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God on 23 May. Anne gave birth to a daughter, Princess Elizabeth, in September 1533. The Pope responded to the marriage by excommunicating both Henry and Cranmer from the Roman Catholic Church (11 July 1533). Henry was excommunicated again in December 1538.|$|E
5|$|While {{this was}} not yet {{the end of the}} media’s freedom after the Prague Spring, it was the {{beginning}} of the end.

When the weeklies Reporter and Politika responded harshly to this threat, even <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to not so subtly criticize the Presidium itself in Politika, the government banned Reporter for a month, suspended Politika indefinitely, and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television.|$|E
5|$|Aeronautical {{engineering}} {{firms were}} quick {{to respond to the}} Comet's commercial advantages and technical flaws alike; other aircraft manufacturers learned from, and profited by, the hard-earned lessons embodied by de Havilland's Comet. While the Comet's buried engines were used on some other early jet airliners, such as the Tupolev Tu-104, later aircraft, such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, would differ by employing podded engines held on pylons beneath the wings. Boeing stated that podded engines were selected for their passenger airliners because buried engines carried a higher risk of catastrophic wing failure in the event of engine fire. In response to the Comet tragedies, manufacturers also developed various means of pressurisation testing, often <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to explore rapid depressurisation; subsequent fuselage skins were of a greater thickness than the skin of the Comet.|$|E

5|$|After his April 2000 release, Bell {{publicly}} {{announced that}} he believed that there was extensive Federal Government corruption associated with his 1997–2000 criminal case, {{and that he was}} going to research the facts and file a lawsuit. Bell filed this lawsuit in 2003. Bell was put under heavy surveillance and rearrested for harassment and stalking of federal agents. He was charged with intimidation and stalking and was convicted and again imprisoned, this time for a decade-long sentence. Bell protested vociferously against the conduct of the trial, <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to file civil lawsuits against two judges, at least two prosecutors, his former probation officers, and his defense attorneys, but ultimately to no avail. He was released in December 2009, only to be rearrested in July 2010 for violating his parole conditions. Bell's parole violation hearing resulted in another sentence, and Bell was released on March 12, 2012.|$|E

On her travels, she finds a dead man's diary which states that there is an uninfected area in Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Due to erotomania, Hinckley's {{motivation}} for the attack was born of his obsession with actress Jodie Foster. While living in Hollywood in the late 1970s, he saw the film Taxi Driver at least 15 times, apparently identifying strongly with Travis Bickle, the lead character portrayed by Robert De Niro. The arc of the story involves Bickle's attempts to protect a 12-year-old child prostitute, played by Foster. Toward {{the end of the}} film, Bickle attempts to assassinate a United States Senator who is running for president. Over the following years, Hinckley trailed Foster around the country, <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to enroll in a writing course at Yale University in 1980 after reading in People magazine that she was a student there. He wrote numerous letters and notes to her in late 1980. He called her twice and refused to give up when she indicated that she was not interested in him.|$|E

5000|$|His {{first three}} works were Gothic novels {{published}} under the pseudonym Dennis Jasper Murphy and were critical and commercial failures. They did, however, catch {{the attention of}} Sir Walter Scott, who recommended Maturins work to Lord Byron. With their help, Maturins play, Bertram was staged in 1816 at the Drury Lane for 22 nights, with Edmund Kean starring in the lead role as Bertram. Financial success, however, eluded Maturin, as the plays run coincided with his fathers unemployment and another relatives bankruptcy, both of them assisted by the fledgling writer. To make matters worse, Samuel Taylor Coleridge publicly denounced the play as dull and loathsome, and [...] "melancholy proof of the depravation of the public mind", <b>going</b> nearly <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to decry it as atheistic.|$|R
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} talk of {{building}} a replica of the memorial.

5|$|Stephen {{was finally}} able to bring Symeon before the Synod on charges of honoring as a saint someone who Stephen {{believed}} was far from saintly. At first, Patriarch Sergius II of Constantinople supported Symeon, <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to send candles and perfume in support of the veneration of Symeon the Studite at St. Mammas. Stephen attacked the Studite as unholy and sinful, and was eventually able to convince others that Symeon's homage was improper by convincing them that the Studite held some unorthodox beliefs. As a compromise, Stephen suggested that the annual festival honoring the elder Symeon be held as a private observance within the monastery. Symeon the New Theologian refused to compromise, declaring that it was his duty to honor the church fathers and the saints, and in January 1009 was condemned to go into exile. Stephen also convinced the Patriarch to order all icons of Symeon the Studite removed from St. Mammas, with many of them destroyed or covered over with soot.|$|E
5|$|Where his {{political}} and military career had ended in disappointment, Domitian's private affairs were more successful. In 70 Vespasian attempted to arrange a dynastic marriage between his youngest son and the daughter of Titus, Julia Flavia, but Domitian was adamant in his love for Domitia Longina, <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to persuade her husband, Lucius Aelius Lamia, to divorce her so that Domitian could marry her himself. Despite its initial recklessness, the alliance was very prestigious for both families. Domitia Longina was the younger daughter of Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, a respected general and honoured politician who had distinguished himself for his leadership in Armenia. Following the failed Pisonian conspiracy against Nero in 65, he {{had been forced to}} commit suicide. The new marriage not only re-established ties to senatorial opposition, but also served the broader Flavian propaganda of the time, which sought to diminish Vespasian's political success under Nero. Instead connections to Claudius and Britannicus were emphasised, and Nero's victims, or those otherwise disadvantaged by him, rehabilitated.|$|E
60|$|The force {{expended}} on {{the table}} was very great, almost furious, {{and even if the}} psychic had been able to extend her foot or release a hand she could not have produced such movement, and if she had done so we could have detected it. Intelligent forces were plainly at work {{on the table}}, and writing was <b>going</b> on. <b>So</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> I was concerned, I was convinced that the psychic had externalized her power in some occult fashion, and that it was she who was speaking to us.

He cited an example: Only three bottles, faithfully taken, cured a Louisiana widow (for three weeks sleepless in a darkened chamber) of neuralgic sorrow {{for the loss of}} husband and child, swept off in one night by the last epidemic. For the truth of this, a printed voucher was produced, duly signed.|$|R
25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, {{so there was a}} difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way to}} explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never <b>going</b> quite <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to say he thought Darwin was right.|$|R
5|$|As part of {{the buildup}} to this feud, Hardy {{strongly}} implied that {{he was responsible for}} all of Jeff's accidents leading back to November, including an assault in a hotel stairwell that prevented Jeff from appearing at Survivor Series, an automobile accident where Jeff's car was run off the road, and a pyrotechnics malfunction where {{part of the}} pyro from Jeff's entrance was fired directly at Jeff, in an attempt to stop Jeff holding the WWE Championship. Despite Hardy's attempts to goad Jeff into fighting him, Jeff refused to fight his brother, but, on the March 3 episode of SmackDown!, Jeff viciously attacked him during a promo where Hardy implied that he was also responsible for the fire that burned down Jeff's house, <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to reveal that he had in his possession a dog collar that supposedly belonged to Jeff's dog, Jack (who perished in the fire), that he claimed to have salvaged from the wreckage of the house.

She takes an interest in encouraging Shuichi to cross-dress, even <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to buy Shuichi an expensive dress for Shuichi's birthday, which Shuichi later returns, much to her displeasure. Saori finds it difficult to associate with others; she has few friends, though becomes close to Shuichi. She tends to convey what is on her mind and disregards how others may take what she says. As Saori grows up, she gradually becomes more standoffish and stoic; she even has bad relations with her teachers. Despite her self-centered attitude, she remains popular among her male classmates due to her physical attractiveness. She is a sensitive girl whose temper sometimes gets the better of her when reprimanding bullies that tease Shuichi, because of Shuichi's femininity and cross-dressing. Saori is often emotionally affected by circumstances involving Shuichi, because of her feelings for Shuichi. Saori converts to Christianity partly because of this influence to seek forgiveness for her previous actions, though she only attends mass when feeling guilty about her behavior.|$|E

Upon graduation, through one of his friend's father, the actor Dennis Weaver, he was invited to watch a recording session for the music of a television show Weaver was working in. There, he met a ghost composer for the show, who in turn told him about a job composing for Lutheran television which he applied for and was hired. He also met the composers Pete Carpenter and Mike Post, the titled composers for the show Weaver had been acting in. They were working on four to five shows each week, and brought him on board as a ghost composer to help them create music for several shows, such as Magnum, P.I. and The Greatest American Hero, for which he is credited for starting in 1980.|$|E

Although Ward opposed a timetable for withdrawal of troops, he was critical of mistakes made early in the conflict, called for the increased involvement of non-military U.S. agencies and the establishment of [...] "benchmarks" [...] leading towards eventual troop withdrawal. Ward was critical of Republican leadership for straying from traditional conservative principles of limited government and for failures on energy and economic policy, <b>going</b> to <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to eschew endorsements from prominent Republicans.

She had never spoken of such a chance, but had always looked forward to getting well and <b>going</b> home, <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> the girl knew, and the most careful search now brought to light nothing that bore upon it.
