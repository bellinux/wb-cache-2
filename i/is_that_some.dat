5|$|A {{consequence}} of his perfectionism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> artists who initially sign deals with Dr.Dre's Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack {{to the movie}} The Wash, featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr.Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King Tee, 2001 vocalist Hittman, Joell Ortiz, Raekwon and Rakim.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation {{may cause}} either the gain {{of a new}} feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is {{bacterial}} adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying {{the target of the}} drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell. Other striking examples are the bacteria Escherichia coli evolving the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term laboratory experiment, Flavobacterium evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products of nylon manufacturing, and the soil bacterium Sphingobium evolving an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol. An interesting but still controversial idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection (increasing organisms' evolvability).|$|E

5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E
5|$|If the {{controller}} were to background garbage collect {{all of the}} spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its peak speed. The trade-off <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS did not tell {{the controller}} this information. The result is that the soon-to-be-deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up {{only a small number of}} blocks then stops, thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another solution is to have an efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability.|$|E
5|$|The net could ensnare the secutors {{weapon to}} disarm him and snag away his shield {{to put him}} at a {{significant}} disadvantage. Other retiarius tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the secutor was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the secutor knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and {{hold on to the}} weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the retiarius could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The secutor stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the retiarius used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a retiarius in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> retiarii simply did not use nets.|$|E

It is however different from ericoid mycorrhiza and resembles ectomycorrhiza, both functionally {{and in terms}} of the fungi involved.

It will go hard with any man to adjudge ten men to death for one deed of murder; {{and it is very}} hard for that one to {{remember}} always that the doom he is to give is the only means in our power to stop the downward path of crime among us. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> among the ten shall be spared, and it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> he or they who spare them shall have done right.|$|R
25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} proposed <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> imprinted genes act coadaptively {{to improve}} both fetal development and maternal provisioning for nutrition and care. In it {{a subset of}} paternally expressed genes are co-expressed in both the placenta and the mother's hypothalamus. This would come about through selective pressure from parent-infant coadaptation to improve infant survival. Paternally expressed 3 (Peg3) is a gene for which this hypothesis may apply.|$|E
25|$|The {{motivating}} insight behind topology <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> geometric problems depend not on {{the exact}} shape of the objects involved, but rather on {{the way they are}} put together. For example, the square and the circle have many properties in common: they are both one dimensional objects (from a topological point of view) and both separate the plane into two parts, the part inside and the part outside.|$|E
25|$|One more issue <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> complex {{instructions}} {{are difficult to}} restart, e.g. following a page fault. In some cases, restarting from the beginning will work (although wasteful), {{but in many cases}} this would give incorrect results. Therefore, the machine needs to have some hidden state to remember which parts went through and what remains to be done. With a load/store machine, the program counter is sufficient to describe the state of the machine.|$|E

A story often told of Makley <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> time in the mid-1920s after robbing a bank he went straight to a civic luncheon at which he was giving the keynote speech. The story itself is most likely apocryphal, but its popularity gives an insight into the man's charisma.|$|E
25|$|A {{side effect}} of the heating of {{pasteurization}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> vitamin and mineral content is lost. Soluble calcium and phosphorus decrease by 5%, thiamin and vitamin B12 by 10%, and vitamin C by 20%. Because losses are small {{in comparison to the}} large amount of the two B-vitamins present, milk continues to provide significant amounts of thiamin and vitamin B12. The loss of vitamin C is not nutritionally significant, as milk is not an important dietary source of vitamin C.|$|E

25|$|In the {{election}} itself, Likud won {{the second highest}} number of seats, Livni's party having outnumbered the Likud by one seat. A possible explanation for Likud's relatively poor showing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> Likud supporters defected to Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu party. Netanyahu, however, claimed victory {{on the basis that}} right-wing parties won the majority of the vote, and on 20 February 2009, Netanyahu was designated by Israeli President Shimon Peres to succeed Ehud Olmert as prime minister, and began his negotiations to form a coalition government.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{political}} initiatives in Hedmark to re-establish passenger {{traffic on the}} line. Both the track and stations hold sufficient standard, but a concern <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> level crossings may need removing to allow for increased traffic. A 2012 report estimated that passenger services calling at four stations would allow a travel time between Kongsvinger and Elverum of 1 hour and 20 minutes, 35 minutes less than the current bus service. It recommended that the line be electrified and receive centralized traffic control first, which would allow for direct train services onwards to Oslo.|$|E
