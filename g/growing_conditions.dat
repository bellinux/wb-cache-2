5|$|Banksia verticillata {{is seldom}} seen in cultivation. The natural <b>growing</b> <b>conditions</b> {{point to a}} sunny aspect and good {{drainage}} as being important in cultivation. It is good for coastal situations and erosion control. Very sensitive to dieback, B. verticillata (like most other western Australian banksias) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor drainage. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 49 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Within-crop diversity, a {{specific}} crop {{can result from}} various <b>growing</b> <b>conditions,</b> for example a crop growing in nutrient-poor soil {{is likely to have}} stunted growth than a crop growing in more fertile soil. The availability of water, soil pH level, and temperature similarly influence crop growth.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, using a {{modified}} Poisson kernel in an upper half-space, we prove that a harmonic function u(z) in a upper half space with its positive part u+(x) =max{u(x), 0 } satisfying a slowly <b>growing</b> <b>condition</b> {{can be represented}} by its integral in the boundary of the upper half space, the integral representation is unique up to {{the addition of a}} harmonic polynomial, vanishing in the boundary of the upper half space and that its negative part u−(x) =max{−u(x), 0 } can be dominated by a similar slowly <b>growing</b> <b>condition,</b> this improves some classical result about harmonic functions in the upper half space...|$|R
40|$|In 1992, 24 corn hybrids {{were grown}} under both {{irrigated}} and dryland conditions and were harvested at 90 % of the kernel milk line. <b>Growing</b> <b>condition</b> and hybrid significantly affected plant height {{and the number}} of days to the tasseling and silking stages. Most dryland hybrids had higher dry matter (DM) contents than irrigated hybrids, but all 24 hybrids had higher grain yields under irrigation. <b>Growing</b> <b>condition</b> and hybrid also significantly affected whole-plant DM and stover yields and percentages of cob and stover. The grain portion made the greatest contribution to the higher whole-plant silage yields for the irrigated hybrids compared to their dryland counterparts...|$|R

5|$|Details of {{the fruit}} bodies' appearance, color in particular, are {{somewhat}} variable and dependent on <b>growing</b> <b>conditions.</b> For example, specimens growing on logs in oak and hickory forests in the spring {{tend to have more}} yellowish-white, depressed caps than those found in the same location in autumn, which are light yellow brown and more convex in shape. The fruit body development of M.rotula is hemiangiocarpous, with an hymenium that is only partially enclosed by basidiocarp tissues. Robert Kühner showed that a -like tissue covers the young gills before the expanding cap breaks away from the stem. In unfavorable weather conditions, however, the mushrooms may fail to develop normally and instead produce semi-gasteroid basidiocarps.|$|E
5|$|Many {{vegetarian}} {{restaurants and}} producers of vegetarian foods acquire a hechsher, certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher. The hechsher usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for insect infestation and steps {{have been taken}} to ensure that cooked food meets the requirements of bishul Yisrael. Vegetables such as spinach and cauliflower must be checked for insect infestation. The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, <b>growing</b> <b>conditions,</b> and views of individual rabbis.|$|E
5|$|When <b>growing</b> <b>conditions</b> improve, such as {{the arrival}} of warmer weather and the longer days {{associated}} with spring in temperate regions, growth starts again. The expanding shoot pushes its way out, shedding the scales in the process. These leave behind scars {{on the surface of}} the twig. The whole year's growth may take place in just a few weeks. The new stem is unlignified at first and may be green and downy. The Arecaceae (palms) have their leaves spirally arranged on an unbranched trunk. In some tree species in temperate climates, a second spurt of growth, a Lammas growth may occur which is believed to be a strategy to compensate for loss of early foliage to insect predators.|$|E

5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is {{a species}} of lichen in the Arthoniaceae family of fungi. The species is {{distributed}} in subtropical and tropical locations throughout the southeastern United States, as well as Central and South America, and has been collected infrequently in a few locales in Africa. The body of the lichen forms continuous, circular crust-like patches on dead wood, readily recognizable by the prominent red pigment. The older, central region is covered with red, spherical to cylindrical granules. Moving outwards from the center, zones of color may be distinguished, the first gray-green, the second white, and finally a bright red cottony rim. The red and green colors of this unmistakable woodland lichen {{give the appearance of}} a Christmas wreath, suggestive of its common North American name, the Christmas wreath lichen. The red pigment, called chiodectonic acid is one of several chemicals the lichen produces to help tolerate inhospitable <b>growing</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Telopea speciosissima is a pyrogenic-{{flowering}} species, {{relying on}} post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds {{to take advantage}} of favourable <b>growing</b> <b>conditions</b> in the altered environment following a fire. Of the woody resprouter species of southeastern Australia, {{it is one of the}} slowest to produce seedlings after bushfires, taking at least two years. The species resprouts from a lignotuber, a swollen woody base largely under the soil, that stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth of new shoots after a bushfire. Waratahs dominate the understorey around two years after a fire, but are later overtaken by the slower-growing banksias (Banksia) and wattles (Acacia). Fire also serves to strip away diseases and pests. Flowering may be prolific at this time.|$|E
5|$|Tree {{of heaven}} {{is a popular}} {{ornamental}} tree in China and valued for its tolerance of difficult <b>growing</b> <b>conditions.</b> It was once very popular in cultivation in both Europe and North America, but this popularity dropped, especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable odor of its blossoms and the weediness of its habit. The problem of odor was previously avoided by only selling pistillate plants since only males produce the smell, but a higher seed production also results. Michael Dirr, a noted American horticulturalist and professor at the University of Georgia, reported meeting, in 1982, a grower who could not find any buyers. He further writes (his emphasis): In Europe, however, the tree is still used in the garden to some degree as its habit is generally not as invasive {{as it is in}} America. In the United Kingdom it is especially common in London squares, streets, and parks, though it is also frequently found in gardens of southern England and East Anglia. It becomes rare in the north, occurring only infrequently in southern Scotland. It is also rare in Ireland. In Germany the tree is commonly planted in gardens. The tree has furthermore become unpopular in cultivation in the west because it is short-lived and that the trunk soon becomes hollow, making trees more than two feet in diameter unstable in high winds.|$|E

By {{the early}} 1950s, Bayit Lepletot housed several dozen girls in two small rooms with a leaky roof and an outdoor toilet shared with a neighboring family.

30|$|Photosynthesis {{is widely}} used {{as a tool for}} {{indicating}} environmental stress and selection of growth conditions suitable for different species (Weng and Ueng 1997). The knowledge of leaf structural and physiological characteristics of species and how these triats relate to their physical habitats is essential for introduction and domestication programs (Guan et al. 2011; Zhang and Yin 2012), and subsequent commercial production. Indeed, although several numbers of Rhododendron have been cultivated for centuries, it is still not an easy task because the optimum <b>growing</b> <b>condition</b> remains unclear.|$|R

40|$|Quantile {{regression}} provides {{estimates of}} a range of conditional quantiles. This stands in contrast to traditional regression techniques, which focus on a single conditional mean function. Lee et al. (2012) proposed efficient quantile regression by rounding the sharp corner of the loss. The main modification gen-erally involves an asymmetric ` 2 adjustment of the loss function around zero. We extend the idea of ` 2 adjusted quantile regression to linear heterogeneous models. The ` 2 adjustment is constructed to diminish as sample size <b>grows.</b> <b>Conditions</b> to retain consistency properties are also provided...|$|R
