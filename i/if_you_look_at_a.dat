To qualify as a probability, the assignment of values must satisfy the requirement that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> collection of mutually exclusive events (events with no common results, e.g., the events {1,6}, {3}, and {2,4} are all mutually exclusive), the probability {{that at least one of}} the events will occur is given by the sum of the probabilities of all the individual events.|$|E

2500|$|Spectroscopic {{binaries}} can be also detected due {{to their}} radial velocity; as they orbit around each other one star may be moving towards the Earth whilst the other moves away, causing a Doppler shift in the composite spectrum. The orbital plane of the system determines {{the magnitude of the}} observed shift: if the observer is looking perpendicular to the orbital plane there will be no observed radial velocity. [...] For example, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> carousel from the side, you will see the animals moving toward and away from you, whereas if you look from directly above they will only be moving in the horizontal plane.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{gunpowder}} {{is strong}} sometimes: but not always. You may carry it in a flask, {{or in your}} hand, and then it is weak enough. It only becomes strong by being turned into gas and steam. But steam is always strong. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> railway engine, still more {{if you had ever}} seen--which God forbid you should--a boiler explosion, you would agree with me, that the strongest thing we know of in the world is steam.|$|E

The little neighbouring islands, which are so small upon the Map as to be mere dots, are chiefly little bits of Scotland,--broken off, I dare say, {{in the course of a}} great length of time, by the power of the restless water.|$|E

60|$|And {{she took}} {{out of one of}} her {{cupboards}} (she had all sorts of mysterious cupboards in the cracks of the rocks) the most wonderful waterproof book, full of such photographs as never were seen. For she had found out photography (and this is a fact) more than 13,598,000 years before anybody was born; and, what is more, her photographs did not merely represent light and shade, as ours do, but colour also, and all colours, as you may see <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> black-cock's tail, or a butterfly's wing, or indeed most things that are or can be, so to speak. And therefore her photographs were very curious and famous, and the children looked with great delight for the opening of the book.|$|E
