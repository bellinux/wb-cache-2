Tests were conducted with both HTPB and PMM fuels in order to obtain general results. The swirl tests were conducted at high and low air mass fluxes with <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios</b> less than unity. Swirl was found effective for increasing the fuel regression rate but the magnitude was highly dependent upon motor geometry, fuel type and operating environment. The gas injection tests included hydrogen at low <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios,</b> and nitric oxide and nitrous oxide at high <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios.</b> Secondary injection generally resulted in increases in combustion pressure in agreement with equilibrium, adiabatic combustion expectations.

40|$|Efficient {{mixing of}} fuel and air is a major {{objective}} for the successful operation of scramjet engines, in which the supersonic combustion process must occur within an extremely short time frame in the hypersonic flight. This paper presents the insights gained into the key design factors and underlying mechanism for fuel/air mixing enhancement with streamwise vortices introduced by alternating wedges called hypermixers. The results of a parametric numerical study and sensitivity analysis suggest that narrow spanwise intervals between the alternating wedges and large fuel/air <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios</b> are beneficial for effective mixing, while higher total pressure recovery is associated with shallower ramp angles and lower fuel/air <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios.</b> Higher fuel penetration is achieved with steeper ramp angles and higher fuel/air <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios.</b> Streamwise vortex circulation increases with wider spanwise spacing and steeper ramp angles, but effective mixing enhancement is observed only in the latter case...|$|R

The thruster was similar in design and function to that which {{will be used in}} the flight test series of Dryden's Ducted-Rocket Experiment. The determination of duct ignition limits was made based on the variation of secondary air flow rates and primary thruster <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios.</b> Thrust augmentation and improvements in specific impulse were studied along with the pressure and temperature profiles of the duct to study mixing lengths and thermal choking. The occurrence of ignition was favored by lower rocket <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios.</b> However, among ignition cases, better thrust and specific impulse performance were seen with higher <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios</b> owing to the increased fuel available for combustion.

Preliminary measurements were made to optimize spark duration and spark gap, optimum conditions being those at which the maximum frequency or probability of ignition was observed. The effect of spark duration on ignition frequency for several spark energies was determined for <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios</b> of 0. 5 and 1. 0 and initial droplet diameters of 28 and 68 microns. Spark duration had little effect on ignition frequency over the entire 15 to 170 mu s range examined. Spark durations of 70 to 80 mu s were used for all subsequent work.

40|$|A shock-tunnel {{investigation}} of a scramjet with a rectangular-to-elliptical shape-transition inlet and an elliptical combustor has been conducted at conditions simulating flight at Mach 8. 7. The inlet was designed using a quasistreamline-tracing method to have a design point of Mach 12. 0 and operation down to Mach 6. 0. The elliptical combustor began with a rearward-facing step around its perimeter and {{was followed by a}} constant-area and diverging section. The flowpath was completed by a short thrust nozzle. Gaseous hydrogen fuel was injected either through multiple portholes on the intake, a series of 48 portholes on the rearward-facing step at the combustor entrance, or a combination of the two. All fueling configurations resulted in a positive thrust coefficient at <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios</b> above 0. 3 without the use of ignition aids. Fuel injection in the intake produced robust combustion and good internal thrust levels, but led to inlet unstart at fuel <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios</b> above 0. 61.

50|$|Combustion instabilities are {{typically}} violent pressure oscillations in a combustion chamber. These pressure oscillations {{can be as}} high as 180 dB, and long term exposure to these cyclic pressure and thermal loads reduces the life of engine components. In rockets, such as the F1 used in the Saturn V program, instabilities led to massive damage of the combustion chamber and surrounding components. This problem was solved by re-designing the fuel injector. In liquid jet engines the droplet size and distribution can be used to attenuate the instabilities. Combustion instabilities are a major concern in ground-based gas turbine engines because of NOx emissions. The tendency is to run lean, an <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratio</b> less than 1, to reduce the combustion temperature and thus reduce the NOx emissions; however, running the combustion lean makes it very susceptible to combustion instability.|$|E

A continuing investigation of the inhibition activity of organophosphorus compounds under a range of <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios</b> was performed experimentally and computationally, {{as measured by the}} burning velocity.

In this work, the laminar flame speed is measured experimentally and calculated numerically for a premixed propane/air flame, under a range of <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios,</b> undoped and doped with dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP). A detailed investigation of the catalytic cycles involved in the recombination of key flame radicals is made for two <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios,</b> lean and rich.

Although the importance of certain cycles is different under different stoichiometries, the OPCs are similarly effective across the range, demonstrating the robustness of OPCs as flame suppressants.

In the present study, new experimental data for iso-pentanol in shock tube, rapid compression machine, jet stirred reactor, and counterflow diffusion flame are presented. Shock tube ignition delay times were measured for iso-pentanol/air mixtures at three <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios,</b> temperatures ranging from 819 to 1252.

A detailed chemical kinetic model for iso-pentanol oxidation was developed including high- and low-temperature chemistry for {{a better understanding of the}} combustion characteristics of higher alcohols. First, bond dissociation energies were calculated using ab initio methods, and the proposed rate constants were based on a previously presented model for butanol isomers and n-pentanol. The model was validated against new and existing experimental data at pressures of 1 - 60. atm, temperatures of 650 - 1500. K, <b>equivalence</b> <b>ratios</b> of 0. 25 - 4. 0, and covering both premixed and non-premixed environments. The method of direct relation graph (DRG) with expert knowledge (DRGX) was employed to eliminate unimportant species and reactions in the detailed mechanism, and the resulting skeletal mechanism was used to predict non-premixed flames.
