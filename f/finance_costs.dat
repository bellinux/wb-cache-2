40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} offered diverse {{contractual}} forms of alliance, {{in which the}} supply chain partners coordinate their decisions for greater joint performance in an entirely self-interested way. Prior literature implicitly assumes free inventory financing. However, this assumption is questionable in the real marketplace. Firms frequently finance their working capital {{from a variety of}} credit sources, such as banks, and incur positive costs of the funds for inventory. Surprisingly, the impact of inventory <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> on supply chain coordination has not been sufficiently investigated by supply chain academics. We address this issue by explicitly assuming capital-constrained agents and positive inventory <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> Specifically, we consider four extensively discussed coordination mechanisms for investigation: (i) all-unit quantity discount, (ii) buybacks, (iii) two-part tariff, and (iv) revenue-sharing. We show that, under the assumption of positive inventory <b>financing</b> <b>costs,</b> these contracts fail to achieve joint profit maximization if each agent relies on direct financing from a financial institution. Positive <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> call for trade-credit in order to subsidize the retailer's <b>costs</b> of inventory <b>financing.</b> Using trade-credit in addition to the contracts, the supplier fully coordinates the supply chain for the largest joint profits. Moreover, positive inventory <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> make revenue-sharing less profitable than the other three contracts. We present three different schemes for coordination in a decentralized supply chain, using buybacks, quantity discount, and two-part tariff, respectively. We also derive the optimal trade-credit rate not only for the supplier's profit, but also for joint supply chain profit.

40|$|Part I of this {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effect of <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> on {{the efficiency of the}} T-bill futures market. The cost-of-carry model is used and three types of <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> are selected as proxies for RP (repurchase agreement) rates. The results suggest that the cost-of-carry model assuming a constant RP rate is unreliable in explaining the pricing of T-bill futures. A search for "true" <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> shows that such <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> could be a nonlinearly weighted rate of the term RP rate (or the 90 -day-maturity T-bill rate) and the federal funds rate. Theoretically implied RP rates in the year of 1983 are also generated for comparisons. Part II examines the impact of inflation uncertainty on the futures-forward rate differential. The cost-of-carry model assuming a constant RP rate ignores the future fluctuations of <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> A "risk premium" could arise due to inflation uncertainty. This part provides evidence that there exists a systematic relationship between the daily futures-forward rate differences and the inflation rate. Part III provides a theoretical treatment of the optimal arbitrage investment under uncertainty and of equilibrium pricing in the T-bill futures market. A dynamic stochastic programming model shows that a "myopic" property exists in the T-bill futures market in the sense that expectations of the future one-period price movements do not exert an impact on the current optimal arbitrage investment decision under uncertainty. It shows, however, that such a "myopic" property is not pure in that expectations of <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> in the next period affect the investment decision in the current period. Equilibrium pricing of the T-bill futures is obtained under arbitrage arguments. It shows that an equilibrium price is achieved {{at the point where the}} expected current one-period arbitrage profits are zero when cost-of-carry is required, even in a multi-period setting...|$|R

50|$|Housing {{supply is}} {{produced}} using land, labor, and various inputs, such as electricity and building materials. The quantity of new supply {{is determined by}} the cost of these inputs, the price of the existing stock of houses, and the technology of production. For a typical single-family dwelling in suburban North America, approximate cost percentages can be broken down as follows: acquisition costs, 10%; site improvement costs, 11%; labour costs, 26%; materials costs, 31%; <b>finance</b> <b>costs,</b> 3%; administrative costs, 15%; and marketing costs, 4%. Multi-unit residential dwellings typically break down as follows: acquisition costs, 7%; site improvement costs, 8%; labour costs, 27%; materials costs, 33%; <b>finance</b> <b>costs,</b> 3%; administrative costs, 17%; and marketing costs, 5%. Public subdivision requirements can increase development costs by up to 3% depending on the jurisdiction. Differences in building codes account for about a 2% variation in development costs. However, these subdivision and building code costs typically increase the market value of the buildings by at least the amount of their cost outlays. A production function such as Q=f(L,N,M) can be constructed in which Q is the quantity of houses produced, N is the amount of labour employed, L is the amount of land used, and M is the amount of other materials. This production function must, however, be adjusted to account for the refurbishing and augmentation of existing buildings. To do this, a second production function is constructed that includes the stock of existing housing and their ages as determinants. The two functions are summed, yielding the total production function. Alternatively, a hedonic pricing model can be regressed.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we employ firm-level data {{to analyze}} {{to what extent}} {{financing}} conditions of non-financial corporations in the Euro Area depend on country-specific factors, in particular the respective country's government bond yield and the share of non-performing loans to the corporate sector.

In a real options model with costly external financing we derive optimal investment timing as a trade-off of present and expected future <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> While a pure-quantity constrained firm always overinvests in investment states, we find that <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> can induce both voluntary delay and acceleration of investment, and we show that both investment volume and investment-cash flow sensitivities are non-monotonic in financing constraints. For high- and low-liquidity firms, we find that sensitivities are increasing in con-straints, and that both dimensions of constraints, namely liquidity constraints and capital market frictions inducing <b>financing</b> <b>costs,</b> have similar effects on investment. In contrast, the effects are ambiguous for firms with intermediate liquidity. JEL Classification: G 31, G 3...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies optimal {{monetary}} and fiscal policy {{in a small}} open economy. Two forces in the economy impose orthogonal restrictions on <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> across governments.

Thus, optimal {{monetary and}} fiscal policy is time inconsistent. However, if preferences (and/or productivity) satisfy certain conditions, the former force disappears and optimal monetary and fiscal policy becomes time consistent. The results hold with both flexible exchange rate regimes and fixed exchange rate regimes. The latter indicates that a credible fixed exchange rate regime does not help render optimal policy time consistent. ...|$|R
