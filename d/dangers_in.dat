Later, he is forced to abandon his car when he runs out of gas, continuing {{the rest of the way}} on horseback. When he radios Morgan the next day, his signal is picked up by a survivors' camp where Shane, Rick's wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies), and his son Carl (Chandler Riggs) are safe. Unaware that it is Rick on the other line, they lose radio signal before they can warn him of the <b>dangers</b> <b>in</b> Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{demonstrates}} how lawmakers {{in other states}} used the Ginsberg v. New York ruling to increase morality-based censorship of material from children. A year after the ruling, an Ohio court determined that Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was inappropriate for youth. The author explains the <b>dangers</b> <b>in</b> allowing the government to determine appropriate material for youth to view, {{pointing out that the}} belief in sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven. Heins notes that the fear of this impact is used to support morality-based arguments, and appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually harms them through the censorship itself.|$|E
5|$|While {{the primary}} focus is on driver safety near {{railroad}} crossings, other basic driving safety rules are reinforced, such as not passing on hills or curves, not driving or pulling over when fatigued or sleepy and not being a distracted driver. Alan is also shown a police report of an accident where an acquaintance of his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. Filling out the film is a nostalgic {{look back at the}} early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways—in the late 1950s still a relatively new concept—weren't even thought of, and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer <b>dangers</b> <b>in</b> driving; however, Hal cautions that his point is that the human body hasn't changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded.|$|E

5|$|Most organisms {{studied to}} date utilize a reward–punishment mechanism: for instance, worms and insects can alter their {{behavior}} to seek food sources or to avoid <b>dangers.</b> <b>In</b> vertebrates, the reward-punishment system is implemented by a {{specific set of}} brain structures, at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia, a set of interconnected areas {{at the base of the}} forebrain. The basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are made: the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out. Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively. Research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role: addictive drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced.|$|E

25|$|Pliny was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for training vines up trees in a pergola, noting that the finest wines in Campania all derived from this practice. Due to the <b>dangers</b> <b>in</b> working on and pruning vines trained this way, however, he advised not using valuable slaves but rather vineyard workers hired with a stipulation in their contract to cover grave and funeral expenses. He described some contemporary varieties, recommending Aminean and Nomentan as the best. Ampelographers believe that two white wine varieties mentioned, Arcelaca and Argitis, may be early ancestors to the modern grape Riesling.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause of}} the {{progress}} of the missionaries was the ease and frequency of communication in consequence of the invention of steam and the opening of the Suez Canal. A voyage could be made safely in one month which formerly required eight to ten months amid many <b>dangers.</b> <b>In</b> Vietnam, the persecutions of numerous priests such as Pierre Borie or Augustin Schoeffer was used as a justification for the armed interventions of Jean-Baptiste Cécille and Rigault de Genouilly, ultimately leading to the occupation of Vietnam and the creation of French Indochina. In Korea, the beheading of Siméon-François Berneux and other priests justified the 1866 French Campaign against Korea.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that within choral music, singers voices are divided {{solely on the basis of}} vocal range. Choral music most {{commonly}} divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB). As a result, the typical choral situation affords many opportunities for misclassification to occur. Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers there are fewer <b>dangers</b> <b>in</b> singing too low than in singing too high.|$|E

25|$|The {{style of}} the Moomin books changed as time went by. The first books, up to Moominland Midwinter (1957), are {{adventure}} stories that include floods, comets and supernatural events. The Moomins and the Great Flood deals with Moominmamma and Moomintroll's flight through a dark and scary forest, where they encounter various <b>dangers.</b> <b>In</b> Comet in Moominland, a comet nearly destroys the Moominvalley (some critics have considered this an allegory of nuclear weapons). Finn Family Moomintroll deals with adventures {{brought on by the}} discovery of a magician's hat. The Exploits of Moominpappa (1950) tells the story of Moominpappa's adventurous youth and cheerfully parodies the genre of memoirs. Finally, Moominsummer Madness (1955) pokes fun at the world of the theatre: the Moomins explore an empty theatre and perform Moominpappa's pompous hexametric melodrama.|$|E
25|$|The high {{production}} and consumption of beef cattle in the United States made the meat industry increasingly powerful {{by the end of}} the 19th century. Corruption problems soon arose in the meat industry, problems that endangered both quality and hygiene. At the beginning of the 20th century, Upton Sinclair published The Jungle, a novel about conspiracies and corruption in the American meat industry, intended as a veiled criticism of the industry itself. The book raised popular awareness about the safety of meat processing and helped lead to the creation of the Pure Food and Drug Act, which was sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration. The Jungle was a milestone in the subsequent history of the hamburger, as it led the American public to force restaurant chains to prove the safety of their cooked meat. In 1933, Arthur Kallett published a similar book, entitled 100 million guinea pigs; <b>Dangers</b> <b>in</b> Everyday foods, drugs, and cosmetics, which warned consumers specifically about the content preservatives in hamburgers.|$|E

25|$|The {{largest and}} most {{important}} form of incunabula of the era was satire. There were great <b>dangers</b> <b>in</b> being associated with satire and its publication was generally done anonymously. To begin with, defamation law cast a wide net, and {{it was difficult for}} a satirist to avoid prosecution if he were proven to have written a piece that seemed to criticise a noble. More dangerously, wealthy individuals would often respond to satire by having the suspected poet physically attacked by ruffians. The Earl of Rochester hired such thugs to attack John Dryden suspected of having written An Essay on Satire. A consequence of this anonymity is that a great many poems, some of them of merit, are unpublished and largely unknown. Political satires against The Cabal, against Sunderland's government, and, most especially, against James II's rumoured conversion to Roman Catholicism, are uncollected. However, such poetry was {{a vital part of the}} vigorous Restoration scene, and it was an age of energetic and voluminous satire.|$|E
25|$|The British came up {{and found}} her to be Princesa, {{carrying}} 64 guns and a crew of 650 {{under the command of}} Don Parlo Augustino de Gera. They began to chase her at 10am, upon which she lowered the French colours she had been flying and hoisted Spanish ones. Mayne addressed his men saying 'When you received the pay of your country, you engaged yourselves to stand all <b>dangers</b> <b>in</b> her cause. Now is the trial; fight like men for you have no hope but in your courage.' After a two and half hour chase the British were able to come alongside and exchange broadsides, which eventually left the Spanish ship disabled. The British then raked her until she struck her colours. The Spanish ship had casualties of 33 killed and around 100 wounded, while eight men were killed aboard both Kent and Orford, and another one aboard Lenox. Total British wounded amounted to 40, and included Captain Durell of Kent, who had one of his hands shot away. The commander of Orford during the engagement had been Lord Augustus FitzRoy.|$|E
