5|$|As {{the game}} wears on, Shooter only deals, {{and then after}} another hand when Howard outplays them, two more players, Yeller and Sokal, drop out. That leaves just Howard and the Kid. After a few {{unlikely}} wins, the Kid calls for a break and confronts Shooter, who admits to being forced into cheating by Slade. The Kid insists <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> {{on his own and}} tells Shooter to deal straight or he will blow the whistle, destroying Shooter's reputation. Before the game resumes, Melba succeeds in seducing the Kid. Christian makes a surprise visit to the room, catches them after the fact and walks out on The Kid.|$|E
25|$|Granger, a captain, {{arrives in}} town to see his lover, Elizabeth. Her uneducated father, Abraham Doiley, has promised her hand to the most educated man he can find, an unappealing but {{intelligent}} scholar named Gradus. Elizabeth's friend Charlotte, who fancies Gradus for herself, persuades Gradus to act more fashionable and less bookish so that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> Elizabeth's heart. Doiley is not impressed by the new Gradus; meanwhile, Granger presents himself to Doiley as a scholar so that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> Elizabeth's hand. Granger and Gradus square off against each other to see who is the more educated, and Granger wins by using phony Greek that nonetheless impresses Doiley. Gradus is consoled by winning Charlotte.|$|E

It is the first time Mr. Galvin is nice to Nate.|$|E
50|$|Notice the entry-shifting {{mechanism}} in the trump suit. South chooses the card to ruff with depending on East's discard. If East discards a diamond on the 7, South ruffs high so that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> later <b>win</b> a trump trick with the 10. If East discards a club on the 7, South ruffs low so that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> later <b>win</b> the J.|$|R

25|$|The more fearsome a mafioso's {{reputation}} is, {{the more}} <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> disputes without having recourse to violence. It can even happen that a mafioso who loses his means to commit violence (e.g. his soldiers {{are all in}} prison) can still use his reputation to intimidate and provide protection if everyone is unaware of his weakness and still believes in his power. However, in the tough world of the Mafia, such bluffs generally do not last long, as his rivals will soon sense his weakness and challenge him.|$|E
25|$|Michal Horáček officially {{launched}} his campaign on 3 November 2016. A week earlier he had moderated {{a meeting at}} Old Town Square, which {{was considered to be}} the actual start of his campaign as it was meant to coincide with official celebrations of Czech Statehood Day. Horáček stated that he wants his campaign to be based on respect for all people and their opinions. He also stated that he believes <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> in the first round. TOP 09, STAN and KDU-ČSL were considering supporting Horáček before his campaign started, but TOP 09 and STAN decided to support an alternative candidate. Horáček also entered into a dispute with TOP 09.|$|E
25|$|Sir Eglamour {{has already}} {{recovered}} from the wound he received whilst slaying the dragon, returned home to Artois, been told the dreadful news about Christabel and after seizing control of Artois from the earl, has travelled to the Holy Land. But fifteen years have now passed and Sir Eglamour, at last, is making his way back home. Christabel {{is looking for a}} husband and is the prize at a tournament in Egypt. Her son Degarébel, in Israel, has just learned that a beautiful woman is available to wed. If he can prove his courage on the tournament field <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> her, so he {{is on his way to}} Egypt to take part in the fighting.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{perpetual}} check {{can even}} save the draw {{in a very}} simplified ending. In Keres–Eliskases, Noordwijk 1938, (diagram at right), Black {{seems to be in}} desperate straits: <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> either of White's pawns, but then the other will queen, leaving White with a theoretical win in the queen versus rook ending. However, the players agreed to a draw after 56...Rb6+! 57. Kc1 Rh6! Because of continuous checks and mate threats from Black's rook, White will never have time to queen either pawn. For instance, 58.Kd1 Kd3 59.Ke1 Ke3 60.Kf1 Kf3 61.Kg1 Rg6+! 62.Kh2 Rh6+! 63.Kg1 Rg6+ 64.Kf1 Rh6! 65.Ke1 Ke3 66.Kd1 Kd3 67.Kc1 Kc3 68.Kb1 and now Black even has a choice of draws: (a) 68...Rb6+ 69.Ka2 Ra6+! or (b) 68...Rh1+ 69.Ka2 Rh2+ 70.Ka3 Rh1! 71.Ka4 Kc4 72.Ka5 Kc5 73.Ka4 (forced) Kc4 etc.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Watkins Glen, Ambrose started {{fifth and}} {{dominated}} {{part of the}} race but was passed in a three-wide move by Kyle Busch with 20 laps remaining. When the white flag was about to wave he saw that Busch was slipping in oil; in {{the entrance to the}} esses he and Brad Keselowski passed him; Ambrose then saw that Keselowski was slipping in oil too and he took the lead in the final turn, holding off Keselowski {{for the second time in}} a row and defending his win from the previous year. Ambrose was very emotional about his win due to his father seeing it on television in a hospital for an illness and due to his luck that day. The win moved Ambrose up one position in the standings from 18th to 17th. Ambrose still has promised the racing world for a future oval win since his #1 goal currently is to prove <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> at places other than road courses.|$|E
25|$|Courtship and {{relationships}} in the Philippines are conservative in nature. The man will have to court the woman and prove his love for her before <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> her heart. Sometimes the courtship period would last for years; this however, is a very old fashioned idea. In the bigger more urbanized cities, this conservative courtship idea is not so emphasized as much. Parents prefer their daughter to be courted in theirhome, so {{they can have a}} chance to know the man. It is during the courtship period that the man would put his best foot forward to create a good impression on the woman and her family. Generally, the man is being measured on his being a gentleman, ability to respect the woman's family, and servitude (the extent of what he was willing to do to prove his love for the woman). Usually, the woman is courted by several men and will have to choose the best from among her suitors. Courtship {{and relationships}} remain the same for rural and urban areas despite the modern western influence.|$|E

The resulting commotion allows the sales team in Scranton, specifically Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to begin poaching former customers of the closed branch. Harry Jannerone (Chris Bauer), an angry employee from the Syracuse branch of Dunder Mifflin arrives in Scranton to berate Jim and Dwight for taking New York clients even though those particular clients {{are closer to}} Scranton than Syracuse. The two argue, dropping {{the name of a}} particularly large client, Prestige Direct Sale Solutions, that is up for grabs. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is cooking lunch for everyone in the office, overhears the argument and gets an idea: if <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> the client, {{he might be able to}} use the account as leverage to get his job as manager back.|$|E
500|$|The {{next day}} Kenny rejoins his friends, who are {{dressed up for}} a Halloween costume contest. Stan is dressed as Raggedy Andy (since Wendy would be going as Raggedy Ann, thus making a pair), Kyle wears a Chewbacca mask, and Cartman is dressed as Adolf Hitler, much to the fury of Kyle, who is Jewish. A zombified Kenny joins the boys, but they fail to notice {{that he is a}} zombie. At school, Kyle gets more annoyed after {{discovering}} that the other students (as well as Mr. Hat) are also dressed as Chewbacca, while Mr. Garrison is dressed as Marilyn Monroe. Worst of all, Wendy is dressed as Chewbacca; she explains that she changed costumes because they would have looked stupid as the Raggedy couple and she figured Stan would realize it too. A stubborn Kyle decides to make a new costume so <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> the prize, two tons of candy. Both Chef (dressed as Evel Knievel) and Principal Victoria are annoyed to see Cartman dressed as Hitler. Victoria makes him a [...] "ghost" [...] costume but he ends up looking more like a Ku Klux Klan member, which annoys Chef even more. At the contest, which is judged by Tina Yothers, Wendy (despite wearing the same costume as the other students) wins the candy, much to the fury of Kyle, who is now dressed as the Solar System. Stan wins the worst costume and everyone laughs at him, leaving him humiliated.|$|E
