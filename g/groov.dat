Shells may be smooth or sculptured with transverse striae (fine <b>groovs)</b> and constrictions. The ventral lobe of the suture is double pronged, prongs being relatively wide but sides not diverging. The median saddle is half as high or {{more so than the}} height of the entire ventral lobe. The first lateral saddle, which lies next to the ventral lobe is either rounded or subacute.|$|R
5000|$|... == <b>Groov</b> == In the past, a {{river branch}} had been {{separated}} from the Rhine by the <b>Groov</b> island, also called Mittelwerth. Prone to silting, {{as a consequence of}} the 1831 staple right abolishment, the island was connected downstream to the mainland by a dam in 1849 and broadened in 1862 by newly established groynes.Today, the Rhine branch consists of two lakes, which are linked to each other by two channel pipes. As there is no source of fresh water anymore, the lakes are threatened by collapse. Therefore, in the summertime, a floating fountain provides fresh oxygen to the water of the lower lake. The upper lake is supplied with fresh well water to achieve the same effect.The adjacent market place is equipped with foundations for a mobile flood protection wall and had been raised in comparison to the Rhine river in 1972 and subsequently in 2006.|$|E

40|$|A {{new series}} of {{fourteen}} dicationic flexible triaryl bis-guanidines 3 a,b, bis-N-substituted guanidines 7 a,b and 8 a,b as well as bis-imidamides 9 - 12 a,b having a 1, 3 - or 1, 4 -diphenoxybenzene scaffold backbone were synthesized. The in vitro activity of the novel dications as antiprotozoal agents against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (T. b. r.) and Plasmodium falciparum (P. f.) was assessed. Interestingly, six of the newly synthesized dications viz 3 a,b, 7 a,b and 8 a,b were more active against P. f. than the reference drug pentamidine. Also, some of the dications showed moderate antitrypanosomal activity. Thermal melting analysis of the novel dications was performed to determine their ligand-DNA relative binding affinities. Finally, docking of the dications with an AT rich DNA oligonucleotide was executed to understand their binding mode with the minor <b>groov...</b>|$|E
40|$|The nasolabial skin is {{the ideal}} donor site for nasal ala reconstruction. The classic {{techniques}} involve a two-stage procedure to reconstruct an aesthetically pleasing nasal ala. A one-stage technique for reconstruction of the nasal ala with a free style nasolabial perforator flap is presented in this article. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The technique {{has been used in}} eight patients between November 2004 and June 2007. In most of the cases (seven out of eight) the whole alar subunit was reconstructed. RESULTS: Besides a small distal 2 mm necrosis in one flap [...] which healed without further treatment [...] all the flaps healed uneventfully with aesthetically pleasing results using the one-stage technique. CONCLUSIONS: The free style perforator nasolabial island flap has become the method of choice in the authors' institution for nasal ala reconstruction, especially when the defect involves the whole subunit. It allows one-stage reconstruction with very similar tissue and a concealed scar in the natural <b>groov...</b>|$|E
40|$|Sexually dimorphic {{characteristics}} are described for four species of Schistura from the Mae Khlong basin and peninsular Thailand. Males of S. mahnerti have a suborbital flap {{and rows of}} unculi on the upper surfaces of the pectoral-fin rays. Females of S. mahnerti have a suborbital groove. None of the morphological measurements differ significantly {{between males and females}} of S. mahnerti. In the other three species, S. aurantiaca, S. cf. aurantiaca, and S. sexcauda, all individuals lack the flap or groove, but most males have a conspicuous black botch on the procurrent rays of the upper lobe of the caudal fin, a feature absent in most females. Some morphometric characteristics vary between sexes of these species. Sexually dimorphic traits presumably have a function related to reproduction; however, little is known about reproduction in Schistura, and variation in morphology in relation to habitat or other environmental factors has not been studied.

40|$|Palatogingival groove (PGG) is a developmental anomaly {{affecting}} {{mainly the}} maxillary incisors.  PGG incidence, depth, and length are clinically important {{because it may}} cause severe and localized periodontitis; and it may divide the root canal resulting in accessory foramina. This study aimedto analyze the presence, shape, length, and depth of the palatogingival groove in maxillary central incisors. 1, 668 maxillary central incisors wereused. Each tooth had its root portion inspected in order to verify PGG presence and depth. The found palatogingival grooves were classified according to the system proposed by Gu [5], as follows: Type I (short and superficial), Type II (long and superficial), and Type III (long and deep). All teeth that showed the grooves were radiographed; five teeth had theirroot surface analyzed through Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM); and four teeth corresponding to each PGG type were sent to obtain histologicalsections and then submitted to microscopic analysis.  Of the 1. 668 analyzed incisors, 27 (1. 61 %) showed the palatogingival groove: 8 (29. 6 %) Type I, 17  (63 %) type II, and 2 (7. 4 %) Type III. Microscopic analysis revealed no communication between PGG and root canal. In conclusion, our results showed that PGG can be clinically and radiographically diagnosed on maxillary central incisors, with the type II being the most common. The professionalsshould {{be aware of the}} features of this groove due to its severe clinical consequences.  KEYWORDSIncisor; Anatomical variation; Palatogingival <b>groov...</b>|$|E
