40|$|Teaching {{engineering}} to industrial designers {{is an exciting}} challenge. The lengthy, manifold ways to develop competencies in materials within the wide-ranging, eclectic population of designers began at the Politecnico di Milano in 1993, when the first Industrial Design School was founded in Italy. Since the days that <b>iron-carbon</b> <b>diagrams</b> spread panic among freshmen, {{a great deal of}} work has been done; today we can proudly observe the birth of many different educational models for teaching materials. This chapter analyzes and classifies four of those models by following their growing complexity: (i) teaching fundamentals of materials engineering and selection criteria to bachelor level classes; (ii) experiencing materials within studios; (iii) the degree in materials and engineering: from know-what to know-why; and (iv) from sense and perception to materials and technology: an inverted perspective for selecting materials. We illustrate basic concepts, teaching tools, and educational goals for each of these different but complementary approaches. Finally, we portray some case histories of the mutual effects between education and research. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|Carbon (C) {{ranging from}} 1.8-4 wt%, and silicon (Si) 1-3 wt% {{are the main}} {{alloying}} elements of cast iron. Iron alloys with lower carbon content (~0.8%) are known as steel. While this technically makes the Fe-C-Si system ternary, the principle of cast iron solidification can be understood from the simpler binary <b>iron-carbon</b> phase <b>diagram.</b> Since the compositions of most cast irons are around the eutectic point (lowest liquid point) of the iron-carbon system, the melting temperatures usually range from 1150 to 1200 C, which is about [...] lower than the melting point of pure iron.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, most {{engineering}} schools had a department of metallurgy and perhaps of ceramics as well. Much effort was expended on consideration of the austenite-martensite-cementite phases found in the <b>iron-carbon</b> phase <b>diagram</b> that underlies steel production. The fundamental understanding of other materials was not sufficiently advanced for them to be considered as academic subjects. In the post-WWII era, the systematic study of polymers advanced particularly rapidly. Rather than create new polymer science departments in engineering schools, administrators and scientists began to conceive of materials science as a new interdisciplinary field in its own right, one that considered all substances of engineering importance from a unified point of view. Northwestern University instituted the first materials science department in 1955.|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} iron and Damascus steels is {{described}} {{through the eyes of}} ancient blacksmiths. For example, evidence is presented that questions why the Iron Age could not have begun {{at about the same time}} as the early Bronze Age (i. e. approximately 7000 B. C.). It is also clear that ancient blacksmiths had enough information from their forging work, together with their observation of color changes during heating and their estimate of hardness by scratch tests, to have determined some key parts of the present-day <b>iron-carbon</b> phase <b>diagram.</b> The blacksmiths' greatest artistic accomplishments were the Damascus and Japanese steel swords. The Damascus sword was famous not only for its exceptional cutting edge and toughness, but also for its beautiful surface markings. Damascus steels are ultrahigh carbon steels (UHCSs) that contain from 1. 0 to 2. 1 %. carbon. The modern metallurgical understanding of UHCSs has revealed that remarkable properties can be obtained in these hypereutectoid steels. The results achieved in UHCSs are attributed to the ability to place the carbon, in excess of the eutectoid composition, to do useful work that enhances the high temperature processing of carbon steels and that improves the low and intermediate temperature mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|First-semester freshmen {{have little}} {{experience}} with engineering graphs. To become successful engineers, {{students need to}} develop skills in presenting and interpreting graphical data. An introductory materials course is an ideal place to introduce these concepts because the topic is data-rich, and successful interpretation of graphs leads to understanding of materials engineering and economic concepts. For example, {{the shape of the}} liquidus curve on the <b>iron-carbon</b> phase <b>diagram</b> helps explain why cast steels are more expensive to manufacture than cast irons. In this course, students develop graphical skills from lectures, handouts, and assignments. For example, students plot their own hardness readings together with an empirically-derived ASTM curve, then they evaluate how well their data matches the curve. They create phase diagrams from alloy data. They create stress-strain diagrams from their own laboratory readings, and calculate mechanical properties from the results. They learn how to deal with outliers on a homework assignment. They learn that Excel’s built-in curve-fitting choices do not cover all data patterns, such as the S-curves for impact vs. temperature graphs. Student performance is assessed with a grading rubric which evaluates graphs within laboratory reports. Low performance on three laboratory reports has led to instructional improvements, including additional focus in the lecture and detailed handouts. Subsequent assessment shows continued improvement in skill levels from one laboratory report to the next, and from one semester to the next...|$|R
40|$|Thermochemical {{modelling}} {{offers a}} wide range of possibilities to understand and visualise the existence of stable phases under various process conditions of interest. By making use of the basic thermodynamic properties heat capacity, reaction enthalpies, Gibbs free energies, FactSage proved to be extremely efficient for phase diagram calculations and determining phase stabilities. However, many different “styles” of visualising thermochemistry data can be found, which often complicates a direct comparison of obtained results with available literature. In common phase diagrams (e. g. the <b>iron-carbon</b> phase <b>diagram),</b> the concentration is plotted on the abscissa and the temperature represents the ordinate. Beside their frequent use for solid and liquid mixtures, it appears to be very uncommon to see such diagrams for the interaction between a gaseous phase and a solid material. Research in the field of metal-gas interactions often refers to phase stabilities, displayed in an Ellingham-Richardson style which uses an energy scale instead of (molar) composition. Although identical thermochemical values have been used, the results emphasise totally different parameter ranges of interest. Beside the frequent use of Ellingham-Richardson diagrams for high temperature applications, especially in steel industry and for tool hardening, this presentation emphasises on the visualisation and translation of thermochemistry data into common diagram styles. The presentation further draws the listener's attention to the many possibilities of thermochemical modelling in FactSage and helps to narrow the logical gap between different graphical representations of thermochemical data...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009. Materials {{in almost}} all {{components}} are subjected {{to some kind of}} loading that must be correctly predicted to produce reliable designs. The understanding of a material's properties significantly impacts appropriate selection for a structure. This kind of material characterization is also important in the development of improved or new materials for high strength and novel applications. There are numerous metallurgical variables (composition and process parameters) that influence the physical and mechanical properties of materials. The aim of this work has been to study the influence of microstructure on mechanical properties of steel, specifically the effect of grain sizes within solid phase mixtures. Parameters for simple models of the variation of material properties with grain size can be determined. These models can then be incorporated in the material data sets of Finite Element Analysis programs which will then allow for structural analysis with zones in a material having different grain sizes. The deformation and damage behaviour of EN 8 steel have been stUdied with emphasis on the effects of grain size on the elastic-plastic response of the material. For that purpose, EN 8 specimens with a range of microstructures (grain size and phase) were prepared by heat treatment The microstructural features were carefully characterized using two different experimental surface microscopy techniques; Light Optical Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope. The deformation and hardness characteristics have been studied with the help of tensile and hardness tests. The mechanical properties were determined as a function of microstructure (grain size and phase). The yield stress followed the classical Hall-Petch relation. The results indicated that tensile strength and hardness increases with decrease in grain size while elongation decreases. The main philosophy behind this research has been the study of the microstructure and information from the <b>iron-carbon</b> phase <b>diagram</b> together with numerical analysis of stress-strain data, in order, to understand the influence of grain size on mechanical behaviour of EN 8 steel. This combination was then used to make general conclusions on mechanical behaviour of EN 8 based on heat treatment history...|$|R
