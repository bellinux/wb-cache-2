25|$|Constant {{false alarm}} rate, {{a form of}} {{automatic}} gain control (AGC), is a method that relies on clutter returns far outnumbering echoes from targets of interest. The receiver's gain is automatically adjusted to maintain a constant level of overall visible clutter. While this does not help detect targets masked by stronger surrounding clutter, it <b>does</b> <b>help</b> to distinguish strong target sources. In the past, radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver. As radars evolved, AGC became computer-software controlled and affected the gain with greater granularity in specific detection cells.|$|E
25|$|Each {{phenotype}} {{is based}} upon the allelic variation within the individual genotype. However, several genetic events can influence a same phenotypic trait, and establishing genotype-to-phenotype relationships can thus be far from consensual with many enzymatic patterns. For instance, the influence of the CYP2D6*1/*4 allelic variant on the clinical outcome in patients treated with Tamoxifen remains debated today. In oncology, genes coding for DPD, UGT1A1, TPMT, CDA involved in the pharmacokinetics of 5-FU/capecitabine, irinotecan, 6-mercaptopurine and gemcitabine/cytarabine, respectively, have all been described as being highly polymorphic. A strong body of evidence suggests that patients affected by these genetic polymorphisms will experience severe/lethal toxicities upon drug intake, and that pre-therapeutic screening <b>does</b> <b>help</b> {{to reduce the risk of}} treatment-related toxicities through adaptive dosing strategies.|$|E

25|$|A {{criticism}} of LCEA {{is that it}} attempts to eliminate monetary cost analysis; that is replace the currency by which economic decisions are made with an energy currency. It has also been argued that energy efficiency is only one consideration in deciding which alternative process to employ, and {{that it should not}} be elevated to the only criterion for determining environmental acceptability; for example, simple energy analysis {{does not take into account}} the renewability of energy flows or the toxicity of waste products; however the life cycle assessment <b>does</b> <b>help</b> companies become more familiar with environmental properties and improve their environmental system. Incorporating Dynamic LCAs of renewable energy technologies (using sensitivity analyses to project future improvements in renewable systems and their share of the power grid) may help mitigate this criticism.|$|E
25|$|One of Abu Tir's most {{noticeable}} physical attributes and trademarks is his bright orange beard. The orange {{is actually a}} dyed substance called henna, a natural dyestuff, which needs to be applied periodically {{in order to maintain}} its lustrous colour. In an interview with the Israeli Channel 10 television Abu Tir stated that he had decided to dye his beard with henna because the prophet Muhammad had done so and also because it was a remedy for headaches and dandruff. Islam bans the use of black hair dyes; however, {{there is no mention of}} a ban on the use of other colours.

500|$|The anime {{series has}} been {{compared}} with a similar series that involved gender swapping—Rumiko Takahashi's Ranma ½. In a review at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews, the reviewer wrote, [...] " [...] rather aggravating to watch at times, but {{seems to have no}} problem raising smiles whenever it wants to, either. The characters, as they are, bring much of the believability of the show, despite the alien elements. It's very much down to earth and pleasant to look at, if nothing else. The rather soft and detailed art style <b>does</b> <b>help,</b> of course, as does the generally great animation quality." [...] The conclusion of the anime was positively reviewed by Erica Friedman, who is the president of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the anime's conclusion as [...] "so normal - so much like a thing that might have actually happened in real life...that it kind of just went under the radar. So - after all these years of watching crappy unresolved restart endings we FINALLY get a real ending and it's a yuri ending where the girl remains a girl and get the girl and...thud. Nothing." [...] The anime was given an overall score of 7/10 by Friedman.|$|E
500|$|Venous {{ultrasonography}} of {{the lower}} limbs is the most demanding of the medical complementary examinations. It {{is dependent on the}} examiner's expertise and training, and the interpretation of the results is subjective and reliant on an understanding of venous hemodynamics. [...] (A mapping <b>does</b> <b>help</b> the reproducibility and the inter-observer agreement of this examination). The examination is made even more difficult because there can be dilated veins without insufficiency, (by hyper-debit), and non dilated [...] but incompetent veins. Moreover, veins can be discretely incompetent in summer but then be normal in winter. Also, by definition of insufficiency, (insufficient blood flow) blood may be seen to flow freely in both directions, anterograde and retrograde between two valves. Another problem when dealing with the superficial venous system, is that venous anatomy is not constant; the position of veins can vary in different patients; also in the same patient the right lower limb is not identical to the left lower limb. As a further complication to the examination, where venous insufficiency is evidenced, the examination needs to be done with the probe in the transversal position but the mapping must be done showing the veins in their longitudinal aspect. This demands a rapid extrapolation by the physician from the transversal images seen to the longitudinal drawing needed. The dynamic maneuvers also need to be well executed. The need of a specialized training is mandatory which is a huge problem for many countries today.|$|E

2500|$|Sexual {{coercion}} {{has been}} observed in many species, including mammals, birds, insects, and fish. While sexual coercion <b>does</b> <b>help</b> increase male fitness, it is very often costly to females. However, {{in spite of these}} costs, a possible benefit to the females is a chance to test the stamina of the males, so that only those with [...] "good genes" [...] will father their offspring. Sexual coercion {{has been observed}} to have consequences, such as intersexual coevolution, speciation, and sexual dimorphism.|$|E
2500|$|Since Darwin, Wallace and Bates did {{not hold}} {{teaching}} posts at any stage of their adult careers (and Műller never returned from Brazil) the imbalance in Huxley's program went uncorrected. It is surely strange that Huxley's courses did not contain {{an account of the}} evidence collected by those naturalists of life in the tropics; evidence which they had found so convincing, and which caused their views on evolution by natural selection to be so similar. Desmond suggests that [...] " [...] had to be simple, synthetic and assimilable [...] it was to train teachers and had no other heuristic function". That must be part of the reason; indeed it <b>does</b> <b>help</b> to explain the stultifying nature of much school biology. But zoology as taught at all levels became far too much the product of one man.|$|E

[...] While the female cast [...] "provides a great contrast of looks" [...] according to ANN, [...] "the male characters, though easily distinguishable, stand out less." ...|$|E

The most recent test match at the stadium was between India and England in 2016, when nearly all wickets taken by spinners.
