5|$|The {{discoveries of}} the high-radii planets HAT-P-33b and HAT-P-32b, {{along with that}} of WASP-17b, contributed to the {{question}} of what factors, besides temperature, contribute to the large radii of these inflated planets.

5|$|Adult mecopterans {{are mostly}} scavengers, feeding on {{decaying}} vegetation {{and the soft}} bodies of dead invertebrates. Panorpa raid spider webs to feed on trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume pollen, nectar, midge larvae, carrion and moss fragments. Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in <b>hotter</b> climates, the adults may therefore be active and visible only for short periods of the year.|$|E

30|$|<b>Hot</b> {{is rarely}} used dysphemistically. A <b>hot</b> {{property}} is one highly regarded and desirable and therefore valuable (whether {{or not this}} is real estate or used of a starlet) of which one might exclaim <b>Hot</b> dog! Most figurative uses of <b>hot</b> derive from its literal use as something which generates heat and/or retains applied heat, as in the implied reference to blacksmithing in strike while the iron is hot—because the <b>hot</b> metal is malleable; hence ‘act when conditions are right’. Vigorous activity generates heat, hence the orthophemistic <b>hot</b> rod and <b>hot</b> licks in <b>hot</b> jazz and the euphemisms for sexual passion aroused in have the <b>hots</b> for that girl, she’s <b>hot</b> stuff. Most likely dysphemistic is I have a <b>hot</b> cock for her <b>hot</b> pants. It is possible that the rhyming Australian idiom <b>hot</b> to trot “ready and eager to get underway” is associated with sexual preparedness or more mundanely with the heat of a revved engine. It is usually at least mildly dysphemistic to describe someone as <b>hot</b> blooded “easily angered”, <b>hot</b> under the collar, or just plain <b>hot</b> “angry”. Because <b>hot</b> things burn, the <b>hot</b> seat was slang for the electric chair; however, the hyperbole to be in the <b>hot</b> seat often has much less fatal consequences in everyday use. To refer to stolen property as <b>hot</b> presumably derives from the risk of being figuratively burned if one is caught with it and prosecuted.|$|R

5|$|Banksia menziesii regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody lignotuber, or from epicormic buds on the trunk. It is {{generally}} only weakly serotinous {{in the southern}} part of its range, that is, it lacks a canopy seed bank as follicles on old flower spikes in the canopy release their seed after two years, but populations retain more seed as populations move north. Lower canopies and drier climates predispose to <b>hotter</b> fires that are more likely to kill plants and effect seed release, and thus facilitate seedling recruitment.|$|E
5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} are suitable for early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more suitable for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In <b>hotter</b> regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b is {{a planet}} that has 0.764 Jupiter masses and 1.827 Jupiter radii.

HAT-P-33b orbits its star at an average distance of 0.0503 AU, which is about 5% of the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This orbit is completed every 3.474474 days (83.39 hours).

40|$|Objectives: Design and {{estimate}} {{the impacts of}} a prevention program for part 1 violent crimes in micro-place crime <b>hot</b> spots. Methods: A longitudinal study of crime <b>hot</b> spots using 21 years of crime offense report data on part 1 violent crimes from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Based on kernel density smoothing for a definition of micro-place crime <b>hot</b> spots, we replicate past work {{on the existence of}} “chronic” <b>hot</b> spots, but then with such <b>hot</b> spots accounted for introduce “temporary” <b>hot</b> spots. Results: Chronic <b>hot</b> spots are good targets for prevention. They are easily identified and they tend to persist. Temporary <b>hot</b> spots, however, predominantly last only one month. Thus the common practice of identifying <b>hot</b> spots using a short time window of crime data and assuming that the resulting <b>hot</b> spots will persist is ineffective for temporary <b>hot</b> spots. Instead it is necessary to forecast the emergence of temporary <b>hot</b> spots to prevent their crimes. Over time chronic <b>hot</b> spots, while still important, have accounted for less crime while temporary <b>hot</b> spots have grown, accounting for a larger share. Chronic <b>hot</b> spots are relatively easy targets for police whereas temporary <b>hot</b> spots require forecasting methods not commonly in use by police. Conclusions: The paper estimates approximately a 10 to 20 percent reduction in part 1 violent crimes in Pittsburgh if the <b>hot</b> spot enforcement program proposed in this paper were implemented...|$|R
