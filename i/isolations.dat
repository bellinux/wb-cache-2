40|$|Objectives] Studying the {{influence}} of the system parameters of a quasi-zero stiffness isolator on vibration <b>isolation</b> performance can provide a key direction for the application of quasi-zero stiffness <b>isolation</b> in vibration <b>isolation</b> systems. [Methods] Based on a double layer vibration <b>isolation</b> system consisting of linear <b>isolation</b> and quasi-zero stiffness <b>isolation,</b> as well as an equivalent linear vibration <b>isolation</b> system with two degrees of freedom, dynamic models are separately established. Moreover, the average method is applied to derive the power transfer rate under the condition of two harmonic force excitation systems. It is proven that the double layer vibration <b>isolation</b> system has better vibration <b>isolation</b> performance than the equivalent linear vibration <b>isolation</b> system with two degrees of freedom, and a method for enhancing the vibration <b>isolation</b> effect of the double layer vibration <b>isolation</b> system is proposed. [Results] The results show that the power transfer rate of the double layer vibration <b>isolation</b> system is greater than 1 in the second order resonance frequency, which means that it has the effect of vibration <b>isolation</b> in the vicinity of resonance frequencies of the second order, which overcomes the shortcomings of the freedom linear vibration <b>isolation</b> system with two degrees of freedom. [Conclusions] The double layer vibration <b>isolation</b> system can improve vibration <b>isolation</b> performance by appropriately reducing the damping ratio, mass ratio and stiffness ratio, giving it better low frequency vibration <b>isolation</b> performance than the equivalent linear vibration <b>isolation</b> system...|$|R

2500|$|Globally, opium has {{gradually}} been superseded {{by a variety}} of purified, semi-synthetic, and synthetic opioids with progressively stronger effects, and by other general anesthetics. This process began in 1804, when Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sertürner first isolated morphine from the opium poppy. The process continued until 1817, when Sertürner published the isolation of pure morphine from opium after at least thirteen years of research and a nearly disastrous trial on himself and three boys. The great advantage of purified morphine was that a patient could be treated with a known dose—whereas with raw plant material, as Gabriel Fallopius once lamented, [...] "if soporifics are weak they do not help; if they are strong they are exceedingly dangerous." [...] Morphine was the first pharmaceutical isolated from a natural product, and this success encouraged the isolation of other alkaloids: by 1820, <b>isolations</b> of noscapine, strychnine, veratrine, colchicine, caffeine, and quinine were reported. Morphine sales began in 1827, by Heinrich Emanuel Merck of Darmstadt, and helped him expand his family pharmacy into the Merck KGaA pharmaceutical company.|$|E
60|$|Long {{before the}} {{beginnings}} of history, while even language was in its first beginnings--indeed as {{another aspect of the}} same process as the beginning of language--the first complete <b>isolations</b> that established race were breaking down again, the little pools of race were running together into less homogeneous lagoons and marshes of humanity, the first paths were being worn--war paths for the most part. Still differentiation would be largely at work. Without frequent intercourse, frequent interchange of women as the great factor in that intercourse, the tribes and bands of mankind would still go on separating, would develop dialectic and customary, if not physical and moral differences. It was no longer a case of pools perhaps, but they were still in lakes. There were as yet no open seas of mankind. With advancing civilization, with iron weapons and war discipline, with established paths and a social rule and presently with the coming of the horse, what one might call the areas of assimilation would increase in size. A stage would be reached when the only checks to transit of a sufficiently convenient sort to keep language uniform would be the sea or mountains or a broad river or--pure distance. And presently the rules of the game, so to speak, would be further altered and the unifications and <b>isolations</b> that were establishing themselves upset altogether and brought into novel conflict by {{the beginnings of}} navigation, whereby an impassable barrier became a highway.|$|E

60|$|At {{present this}} stream {{of thought and}} common {{understanding}} is not nearly so wide and deep as it might conceivably become, as it must become if indeed this present civilization is {{to be more than}} another false start. Our society [Footnote: Anticipations, Chapter III. Developing Social Elements.] has ceased to be homogeneous, and it has become a heterogeneous confusion without any secure common grounds of action, under the stress of its own material achievements. For the lack of a sufficient literature we specialize into inco-ordinated classes. A number of new social types are developing, ignorant of each other, ignorant almost of themselves, full of mutual suspicions and mutual misunderstandings, narrow, limited, and dangerously incapable of intelligent collective action in the face of crises. The medical man sees nothing beyond his profession; he misunderstands the artist, the divine, and the engineer. The engineer hates and despises the politician, the lawyer misses the aims of the medical man, the artist lives angrily in a stuffy little corner of pure technique; none of them read any general literature at all except perhaps a newspaper. Each thinks parochially in his own limits, and, except for his specialty, is an illiterate man. It is absolutely necessary to the progress of our civilization that these <b>isolations</b> should be overcome, that the community should become aware of itself collectively and should think as a whole. And {{the only thing that can}} overcome these <b>isolations</b> and put the mass of intelligent men upon a common basis of understanding, is an abundant and almost universally influential contemporary literature.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the last}} hundred years a novel {{development}} of material forces, and especially of means of communication, has done very much to break up the <b>isolations</b> in which nationality perfected its prejudices and so to render possible the extension and consolidation of such a world-wide culture as mediaeval Christendom and Islam foreshadowed. The first onset of these expansive developments has been marked in the world of mind by an expansion of political ideals--Comte's [...] "Western Republic" [...] (1848) was the first Utopia that involved the synthesis of numerous States--by the development of [...] "Imperialisms" [...] in the place of national policies, and by the search for a basis for wider political unions in racial traditions and linguistic affinities. Anglo-Saxonism, Pan-Germanism, and the like are such synthetic ideas. Until the eighties, the general tendency of progressive thought was at one with the older Christian tradition which ignored [...] "race," [...] and the aim of the expansive liberalism movement, so far as it had a clear aim, was to Europeanise the world, to extend the franchise to negroes, put Polynesians into trousers, and train the teeming myriads of India to appreciate the exquisite lilt of The Lady of the Lake.

60|$|The {{desire for}} {{absolute}} personal privacy is perhaps never {{a very strong}} or persistent craving. In {{the great majority of}} human beings, the gregarious instinct is sufficiently powerful to render any but the most temporary <b>isolations</b> not simply disagreeable, but painful. The savage has all the privacy he needs within the compass of his skull; like dogs and timid women, he prefers ill-treatment to desertion, and it is only a scarce and complex modern type that finds comfort and refreshment in quite lonely places and quite solitary occupations. Yet such there are, men who can neither sleep well nor think well, nor attain to a full perception of beautiful objects, who do not savour the best of existence until they are securely alone, {{and for the sake of}} these even it would be reasonable to draw some limits to the general right of free movement. But their particular need is only a special and exceptional aspect of an almost universal claim to privacy among modern people, not so much for the sake of isolation as for congenial companionship. We want to go apart from the great crowd, not so much to be alone as to be with those who appeal to us particularly and to whom we particularly appeal; we want to form households and societies with them, to give our individualities play in intercourse with them, and in the appointments and furnishings of that intercourse. We want gardens and enclosures and exclusive freedoms for our like and our choice, just as spacious as we can get them--and it is only the multitudinous uncongenial, anxious also for similar developments in some opposite direction, that checks this expansive movement of personal selection and necessitates a compromise on privacy.|$|E

60|$|We {{have seen}} that the {{essential}} process arising out {{of the growth of}} science and mechanism, and more particularly out of the still developing new facilities of locomotion and communication science has afforded, is the deliquescence of the social organizations of the past, and the synthesis of ampler and still ampler and more complicated and still more complicated social unities. The suggestion is powerful, the conclusion is hard to resist, that, through whatever disorders of danger and conflict, whatever centuries of misunderstanding and bloodshed, men may still have to pass, this process nevertheless aims finally, and will attain to the establishment of one world-state at peace within itself. In the economic sense, indeed, a world-state is already established. Even to-day we do all buy and sell in the same markets--albeit the owners of certain ancient rights levy their tolls here and there--and the Hindoo starves, the Italian feels the pinch, before the Germans or the English go short of bread. There is no real autonomy any more in the world, no simple right to an absolute independence such as formerly the Swiss could claim. The nations and boundaries of to-day do no more than mark claims to exemptions, privileges, and corners in the market--claims valid enough to those whose minds and souls are turned towards the past, but absurdities to those who look to the future as the end and justification of our present stresses. The claim to political liberty amounts, as a rule, to no more than the claim of a man to live in a parish without observing sanitary precautions or paying rates because he had an excellent great-grandfather. Against all these old <b>isolations,</b> these obsolescent particularisms, the forces of mechanical and scientific development fight, and fight irresistibly; and upon the general recognition of this conflict, upon the intelligence and courage with which its inflexible conditions are negotiated, depends very largely the amount of bloodshed and avoidable misery the coming years will hold.|$|E
