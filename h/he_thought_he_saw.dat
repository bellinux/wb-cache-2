5|$|When Virgil Earp {{learned that}} Wyatt {{was talking to}} the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop, he went there himself. Virgil testified {{afterward}} that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.|$|E

500|$|The agents then {{speak to}} an {{electric}} power company lineman named Roky Crikenson, who claims he witnessed the abduction of Chrissy and Harold, {{and then turned}} his eyewitness account into a movie screenplay entitled [...] "The Truth About Aliens." [...] He recounts a strange visit to his home {{from a pair of}} men in black, who told him that the UFO <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the night before was merely the planet Venus, and threatened to kill him if he told anyone otherwise. Roky's screenplay describes his meeting with the third alien (who calls himself Lord Kinbote), who took him {{to the center of the}} Earth and told Roky that he had a great mission for him. In telling Roky's version of events to Jose Chung, Scully explains that Roky suffers from a [...] "fantasy-prone personality." [...] Mulder, however, thinks that Roky's story contains some partial truths and decides to have Chrissy re-hypnotized. This time Chrissy claims that she was captured by the U.S. military, not aliens, and they brainwashed her into believing that she was abducted by aliens.|$|E
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> thus, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> colour {{creep into}} Juanna's pale face; then she sighed, opened her eyes, and sat up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{the place}} for a heavy fish," [...] {{reflected}} Arthur, and, even as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a five-pound carp rise nearly to the surface, in order to clear the obstruction of the wall, and sink silently into the depths.|$|R
60|$|There, not thirty yards away, was the {{drawbridge}} of {{the slave}} camp, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it tremble, {{as if it was}} about to fall. At his side were Otter and Juanna, and towards him, his hideous face red with blood, rushed the great Portugee, sabre aloft, and screaming imprecations.|$|R
500|$|When {{the agents}} track down Chantara, whose face is pixelated, {{she claims that}} her pimp {{attacked}} Ricky and fears that he will kill her. She pleads with the agents for protection. Mulder and Scully have Wetzel guard Chantara while they assist the police in the raid of a crack house. However, the two are drawn back outside when Wetzel [...] encounters the entity, wildly shooting at it. Inside a police car, the agents find Chantara with her neck broken. When Mulder questions Wetzel, he admits that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the [...] "wasp man", a monster his older brother told him about {{when he was a}} kid. Though other deputies express skepticism, Mulder finds flattened bullets; indicating they physically impacted something, though no trace is found of what they struck. Mulder formulates a theory that the entity changes its form to correspond with its victims' worst fears. Wetzel, Ricky, and Chantara all expressed fear shortly before their run-ins with the entity; it was visible to them, but not to others. The agents think that Steve and Edy may be the entity's next target because they were in the vicinity of Ricky's attack. They head to their house, only to find the couple {{in the middle of an}} argument. After Edy expresses fear of a separation from Steve, the couple reconciles. Based on this situation, Mulder proposes that the entity ignored Steve and Edy because they did not exhibit mortal fear.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, film {{director}} David Lynch was interviewed on Dutch television about Loose Change, {{to which he}} said that the film made him look at what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> that he now had questions and [...] "...no answers." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 24, 2001, USAMRIID {{scientist}} Peter Jahrling {{was summoned}} to the White House after he reported signs that silicon had been added to anthrax recovered from the letter addressed to Daschle. Silicon would make the anthrax more capable of penetrating the lungs. Seven years later, Jahrling told the Los Angeles Times on September 17, 2008, [...] "I believe I made an honest mistake", adding {{that he had been}} [...] "overly impressed" [...] by what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> under the microscope.|$|E
60|$|Legree stopped. He {{would have}} been ashamed to tell of it, but large drops of sweat stood on his forehead, his heart beat heavy and thick with fear; <b>he</b> even <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> {{something}} white rising and glimmering in the gloom before him, and shuddered to think what if the form of his dead mother should suddenly appear to him.|$|R
6000|$|When <b>he</b> arrived <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{everything}} <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> delightful and magnificent. Diamonds were as plentiful as pebbles, and {{the gold}} and silver, the beautiful dresses, the sweetmeats and pretty things that were everywhere quite amazed him; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> to himself: [...] "If the Princess consents to leave all this, and {{come with me to}} marry the King, he may think himself lucky!" ...|$|R
60|$|During the servant's {{explanation}} Barney {{had been}} casting {{about in his}} mind for some means of rescuing the princess without so great risk of detection, and as the plan of the secret passageway became clear to him <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a way to accomplish the thing with comparative safety {{in so far as}} detection was concerned.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the night}} of his death, Bell was hosting a {{bachelor}} party at Club Kalua, a strip club that was being investigated by undercover police over accusations that the owners fostered prostitution. The New York Post reported that Joseph Guzman had an argument with a man outside the bar, and threatened to get a gun. One of Bell's friends reportedly said, [...] "Yo, get my gun," [...] {{as they left the}} club. Thinking a shooting was about to take place, an African American plain-clothes officer named Gescard Isnora followed Bell and his companions. He alerted his backup team, who confronted Bell and his companions outside. According to Isnora, he [...] "held out his badge, identified himself as a police officer, and ordered the driver to stop". Instead, Bell accelerated the car, striking Isnora, and then collided with an unmarked police minivan. Isnora said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Guzman reach for a gun. He yelled a warning to the other policemen, and they opened fire on the car. Five policemen joined in, firing about 50 bullets into Bell's car.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} dark, but <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> some color in her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't hurt him, dear, {{unless you}} are obliged. Remember he is not responsible. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a ghost here the other day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prepare to mount-mount!" [...] cried Dunwoodie; {{the last}} word being {{repeated}} by Lawton {{in a tone that}} rang in the ears of Caesar, who stood at the open window of the cottage. The black recoiled in dismay, having lost all his confidence in Captain Lawton's timidity; for <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> yet <b>saw</b> him emerging from his cover and waving his sword on high.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Densham went on, [...] "he is immensely {{interested}} {{in some people}} who were at that stupid reception last night. He tried to get an introduction but he couldn't find any one who knew them, and he doesn't know the Princess well enough to ask her. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> you speaking to the man, so I promised that when I saw you I would ask about them." ...|$|R
60|$|Still {{there was}} silence, but <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her breast heave gently. Then {{he placed his}} hand, all {{trembling}} with the fierce emotion that throbbed along his veins, upon the palm that hung listless by her side, and gazed into her eyes. Still she neither spoke nor shrank, and, in the imperfect light, her face looked very pale, while her lovely eyes were dark and meaningless as those of one entranced.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a {{fluttering}} assent in the dimming eyes. The pulse {{under his}} fingers was as fine and {{small as a}} silk thread.|$|E
60|$|Now as <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> men {{and horses}} draw near, and one man, whose helm {{gleamed in the}} moonlight, bore {{something}} in his arms.|$|E
60|$|When {{at last he}} got up, with a shiver, {{to throw}} wood into the stove, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> how his object could be secured.|$|E
60|$|Radbourn {{went off}} with a {{peculiar}} smile, which left Bradley uncertain whether he was laughing at him or not. He began from that moment to overhaul his stock of phrases, {{to see if they}} were really shopworn and worthless. He was growing marvellously, his whole nature was now awake. <b>He</b> <b>thought,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>sawed</b> wood in the back alleys of the town, and at night he toiled at his books. Those were great days. New powers were swiftly burgeoning.|$|R
60|$|The {{one great}} cloud over Dave's {{life was the}} {{question}} of his parentage. He had been raised by those who knew practically nothing of his past, and when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> {{a chance to learn}} something about himself, he embraced that opportunity eagerly, even though it necessitated a long trip to the South Seas and a search among strange islands and still stranger natives. Dave makes the trip in a vessel belonging to the father of one of his school chums, and is accompanied by several of his friends. Not a few perils are encountered, and what the boys do under such circumstances I leave for the pages that follow to tell.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's all that, and {{liar and}} {{deceiver}} into the bargain," [...] thought Tolly Trevor, but Tolly did not speak; he only vented his feelings {{in a low}} chuckle, for <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> or <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> that the robber's career was about to receive a check. As the thought passed through his brain, however, he observed from the position in which he stood that Stalker-- for, as the reader has doubtless perceived, it was he--was working his hands about in a very soft slow, mysterious, and scarcely observable manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{antagonist}} {{risked his}} life to save mine," [...] Jimmy declared, with an angry flush, for <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> where the other's remarks led.|$|E
6000|$|... "Canny lad!" [...] she answered, with {{a mocking}} laugh. Kit felt embarrassed, for <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> what she meant. Janet Bell was {{something}} of a coquette.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> sympathy in Violet Hamilton's eyes, and {{her next}} {{observation}} {{made it clear}} that her mind was busy with the suggestion that he had conveyed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope--indeed, I am sure, Miss Halcombe--that you are mistaken," [...] {{said the}} schoolmaster. [...] "The matter {{begins and ends}} with the boy's own perversity and folly. <b>He</b> <b>saw,</b> or <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> a woman in white, {{yesterday}} evening, as he was passing the churchyard; and the figure, real or fancied, {{was standing by the}} marble cross, which he and every one else in Limmeridge knows to be the monument over Mrs. Fairlie's grave. These two circumstances are surely sufficient to have suggested to the boy himself the answer which has so naturally shocked you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Now that D'Hubert was {{an officer}} of a rank {{superior}} to his own, {{there could be no}} question of a duel. Neither could send nor receive a challenge without rendering himself amenable to a court-martial. It was not to be thought of. Lieutenant Feraud, who for many days now had experienced no real desire to meet Lieutenant D'Hubert arms in hand, chafed at the systematic injustice of fate. [...] "Does he think he will escape me in that way?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> indignantly. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> in it an intrigue, a conspiracy, a cowardly manoeuvre. That colonel knew what he was doing. He had hastened to recommend his pet for promotion. It was outrageous that a man should be able to avoid the consequences of his acts in such a dark and tortuous manner.|$|R
60|$|It was but {{a little}} way, the {{greatest}} width of that island scarce exceeding a furlong, and they walked gently. Herrick was like one in a dream. He had come there with a mind divided; come prepared to study that ambiguous and sneering mask, drag out the essential man from underneath, and act accordingly; decision being till then postponed. Iron cruelty, an iron insensibility to the suffering of others, the uncompromising pursuit of his own interests, cold culture, manners without humanity: these he had looked for, these <b>he</b> still <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw.</b> But to find the whole machine thus glow with the reverberation of religious zeal surprised him beyond words; and he laboured in vain, as he walked, to piece together into any kind of whole his odds and ends of knowledge--to adjust again into any kind of focus with itself his picture of the man beside him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought you'd jump at it," [...] she confessed, with a naivete {{he could}} not but question, for <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a roguish gleam in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure I'll help you. Anything you say goes," [...] {{answered}} Tom Shocker, readily. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> {{a chance}} of getting another dollar or two out of Nat.|$|E
60|$|Now, either God {{had given}} that knave an eagle's sight, or else, as she suggested, fear spurred his {{imagination}} and begot his certainty of what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E
60|$|In the {{earliest}} {{hours of the}} voyage <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> some faces of the great world, the world of wealth and fashion; but these afterward vanished, and left him to wonder where they hid themselves. He did not meet them even in going to and from his meals; he could only imagine them served in those palatial state-rooms whose interiors the stewards now and then rather obtruded upon the public. There were people whom he encountered in the promenades when he got up for the sunrise, and whom <b>he</b> never <b>saw</b> at other times; at midnight he met men prowling in the dark whom he never met by day. But none of these were people of the great world. Before six o'clock they were sometimes second-cabin passengers, whose barrier was then lifted {{for a little while}} to give them the freedom of the saloon promenade.|$|R
5000|$|After {{officers}} {{tried unsuccessfully}} to kick down {{the front door of}} the apartment building, two officers went to the back of the building, where they were let in by a first-floor tenant. Rather than waiting for backup to arrive, the officers went to the door of Graham's apartment, where they were let in by his grandmother. According to the NYPD, Graham and the officers spotted each other and Graham ran into a bathroom, where he allegedly tried to flush a small bag of marijuana down the toilet. Officer Haste stated that he then yelled, [...] "Show me your hands" [...] and [...] "Gun! Gun!"—alleging that <b>he</b> mistakenly <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a gun—before shooting Graham once in the upper chest. Graham was pronounced dead a short time later at nearby Montefiore Medical Center. [...] There was no confrontation or struggle between Graham and Officer Haste, and no weapon was ever recovered from the scene.|$|R
60|$|Latinus {{strongly}} {{disapproved of}} this proposal. He was weary {{of war and}} bloodshed, and wished that the conflict might wholly cease; and he urged that peace should be made with Æneas, and that his original design of giving him Lavinia for his wife should be carried into execution. For a moment Turnus seemed to hesitate, but in looking towards Lavinia who, with Amata her mother, was present at this consultation, <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> or <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> in the agitation which she manifested, proofs of her love for him, and indications of a wish on her part that he and not Æneas should win her for his bride.|$|R
