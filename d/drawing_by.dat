5|$|Aang's {{character}} was developed from a <b>drawing</b> <b>by</b> Bryan Konietzko, depicting a bald {{man with an}} arrowlike design on his head, which the artist developed into {{a picture of a}} child with a flying bison. Meanwhile, Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole, which he later combined with Konietzko's drawing.|$|E
5|$|Aposematic animals {{often have}} (honest) threat displays; edible prey {{sometimes}} have (bluffing) startle displays.

5|$|Isopogon anethifolius {{was among}} the plants {{collected}} by English botanist Joseph Banks and Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander on 5 May 1770 at Botany Bay during the first voyage of Captain James Cook.

5|$|For cover art, Bloomsbury chose painted art in {{a classic}} style of design, with the first cover a {{watercolour}} and pencil <b>drawing</b> <b>by</b> illustrator Thomas Taylor showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express, and a title in the font Cochin Bold. The first releases of the successive books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat more realistic, illustrating scenes from the books. These covers were created by first Cliff Wright and then Jason Cockroft.|$|E

An accompanying text cites elephant lore suggesting that elephants did not have knees and were unable to get up if they fell.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening and}} ending scenes were <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> Mizushima; the scene {{involving}} {{the debut of}} the film's villain was <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> Soichi Masui; the middle section of the film was <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> Shingo Kaneko; Edward Elric's return to his homeworld was <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> Masahiro Ando; action scenes were <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> Shinji Aramaki; and the battle between Wrath and Gluttony was <b>drawn</b> <b>by</b> Yutaka Nakamura. Mizushima was repeatedly harassed by the head employees at Aniplex to speed up work on the storyboards. The artwork for the film was produced once Kaneko was finished and cel-animation was used to produce several characters or items in the film. Seven hundred of the film's animated frames had to be redone with only two weeks to the film's release.|$|R
5|$|It {{was moved}} to its current {{location}} on St George's Street {{at the edge of}} the village, although the date when this was done is unclear. The site where the cross now stands was levelled in 1776 by workmen, paid by Henry Fownes Luttrell, and it may have been on this occasion that the cross was moved. An alternative local tradition is that it was moved in 1825, although a <b>drawing</b> <b>by</b> J. M. W. Turner made in 1811 suggests it was in its present position by then.|$|E
5|$|Ten Dollar Bill (also {{referred}} to as The Dollar Bill) is a 1956 proto-pop art lithographic <b>drawing</b> <b>by</b> Roy Lichtenstein. Considered to {{be a combination of}} Americana art and cubism, the work is {{referred to}} as the beginning to Lichtenstein's work on pop art. Twenty-five editions of the lithograph were made by Lichtenstein, which were exhibited at several galleries. The piece is based on the design for the ten-dollar bill and has influenced several of Lichtenstein's later works. The picture has received generally favorable reception from critics, and is considered to be one of the best artistic portrayals of currency.|$|E
5|$|Three-dimensional space can be {{represented}} convincingly in art, as in technical <b>drawing,</b> <b>by</b> means other than perspective. Oblique projections, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from {{the first or second}} centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the Ukiyo-e paintings of Torii Kiyonaga (1752â€“1815).|$|E

5|$|In December 1982 Jarrell was {{commissioned}} by Westinghouse Electric Company to create a three-hundred-foot mural in their Athens headquarters, to boost {{the morale of the}} employees. The mural {{was the first time he}} used a bricklayer's trowel in his work, a tool introduced to him by Adger Cowans. The Apple Birds and The Return of the Apple Birds, from 1983, show his dramatic use of the trowel. The paintings were inspired by a <b>drawing</b> <b>by</b> his daughter, Jennifer, at the age of two. The Apple Birds were drawn by and talked about by Jennifer as having apple-shaped heads with stems at the top, long arms and short bodies. Zigzags, geometric shapes and layers make up the environment that the Apple Birds live in on the canvas. The trowel is used throughout to create 3-D layers and overlaps.|$|E
5|$|The {{sources of}} the two {{illustrations}} of Sydney Cove and the Aboriginal group are not known. The ceramic colouring bears a general resemblance to contemporary Sydney Cove images which implies that an original watercolour or hand coloured engraving was used for copying rather than black and white images. In {{the case of the}} Library punchbowl, the depiction of Sydney Cove is most likely done from an engraving after a now lost <b>drawing</b> <b>by</b> Lewin, which may date to 1814. This Sydney Cove engraving appeared as a full-page illustration in the second edition of A Statistical, Historical and Political Description of New South Wales and its dependent settlements in Van Diemen's Land etc (London, 1820) by Wentworth, with a later, smaller, version as one of ten Port Jackson harbour views illustrated on Map of Part of New South Wales (London, 1825) by publisher and engraver, Joseph Cross. As Australia's first professional artist, Lewin produced many paintings for Macquarie and his senior officers. He also made a number of commissions for Riley. Lewin had a close association with Antill and both were part of Governor Macquarie's 50-strong excursion party to inspect land and the new road over the Blue Mountains from 25April to 19May 1815. The road had been built by convicts in 1814, after the first European crossing by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and Wentworth in May 1813.|$|E
