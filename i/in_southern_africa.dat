5|$|Malawi is {{a member}} of several {{international}} organisations including the Commonwealth, the UN and some of its child agencies, the IMF, the World Bank, the African Union and the World Health Organization. Malawi tends to view economic and political stability <b>in</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> as a necessity, and advocates peaceful solutions through negotiation. The country was the first <b>in</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> to receive peacekeeping training under the African Crisis Response Initiative.|$|E
5|$|C. t. taurinus (Burchell, 1823; Blue {{wildebeest}}, common wildebeest or brindled gnu) {{is found}} <b>in</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa.</b> Its range extends from Namibia and South Africa to Mozambique (north of the Orange River) and from southwestern Zambia (south of the Zambezi river) to southern Angola.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Malawian {{scientists}} had the third-largest output <b>in</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Africa,</b> {{in terms of}} articles catalogued in international journals. They published 322 articles in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index expanded) that year, almost triple the number in 2005 (116). Only South Africa (9,309) and the United Republic of Tanzania (770) published more <b>in</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Africa.</b> Malawian scientists publish more in mainstream journals – relative to GDP – {{than any other country}} of a similar population size. This is impressive, even if the country's publication density remains modest, with just 19 publications per million inhabitants catalogued in international journals in 2014. The average for sub-Saharan Africa is 20 publications per million inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|The serval is {{confined}} to Africa – it is rare in northern Africa and the Sahel, but widespread <b>in</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa,</b> where their range is reportedly expanding.

5|$|Southern Africa {{consists}} of many cave sites, {{most of which}} show very punctuated starts and stops in stone tool technology. Research <b>in</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> has been continuous and quite standardized, allowing for reliable comparisons between sites in the region. Much of the archaeological evidence for the origins of modern human behavior is traced back to sites in this region, including Blombos Cave, Howiesons Poort, Still Bay, and Pinnacle Point.|$|E
5|$|The Ixodidae {{contains}} over 700 {{species of}} hard ticks with a scutum or hard shield, which the Argasidae lack. The Argasidae contains about 200 species; the genera accepted as of 2010 are Antricola, Argas, Nothoaspis, Ornithodoros and Otobius. They have no scutum, and the capitulum (mouth and feeding parts) is concealed beneath the body. The family Nuttalliellidae contains {{only a single}} species, Nuttalliella namaqua, a tick found <b>in</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> from Tanzania to Namibia and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{black stork}} breeds between April and May in the Northern Hemisphere, with eggs usually laid in late April. <b>In</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa,</b> {{breeding}} {{takes place in}} the months between September and March, possibly to take advantage of abundant water prey rendered easier to catch as the rivers dry up and recede—from April and May in Zimbabwe, Botswana and northern South Africa, and as late as July further south.|$|E

5|$|The {{pink-backed pelican}} {{has a large}} {{population}} ranging over much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In the absence of substantial threats or evidence of declines across its range, its conservation status is assessed as being of Least Concern. Regional threats include the drainage of wetlands and increasing disturbance <b>in</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa.</b> The species is susceptible to bioaccumulation of toxins and {{to the destruction of}} nesting trees by logging.|$|E
5|$|The serval prefers {{areas with}} cover such as reeds and tall grasses and {{proximity}} to water bodies, such as wetlands and savannahs. It {{is rare in}} northern Africa and the Sahel, but widespread <b>in</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa.</b> The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the serval as least concern. It occurs in protected areas across its range, and hunting of servals is either prohibited or regulated in several countries.|$|E

5|$|Zimbabwe is a {{landlocked}} country <b>in</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa,</b> lying between latitudes 15° and 23°S, and longitudes 25° and 34°E.

The country's extreme east is mountainous, this area being known as the Eastern Highlands, with Mount Nyangani as the highest point at 2,592 m.|$|E
5|$|African {{elephants}} {{were listed}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2008, with no independent {{assessment of the}} conservation status of the two forms. In 1979, Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3million elephants, with a possible upper limit of 3.0million. By 1989, the population {{was estimated to be}} 609,000; with 277,000 in Central Africa, 110,000 in eastern Africa, 204,000 <b>in</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa,</b> and 19,000 in western Africa. About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends <b>in</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> were mixed, with anecdotal reports of losses in Zambia, Mozambique and Angola while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South Africa. Conversely, studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern Africa were increasing by an average annual rate of 4.0%. Due to the vast areas involved, assessing the total African elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork. The IUCN estimates a total of around 440,000 individuals for 2012.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. <b>In</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E

5|$|In a {{different}} study, tissue and bone samples of 32 lion specimens in museums were used. Results indicated that lions form phylogeographic groups, one each in North Africa / Asia, West Africa, eastern Sahel, south-eastern Africa and south-western Africa. Results of another phylogeographic {{study indicate that}} southeastern Ethiopia, western Somalia and northern Kenya are genetic admixture regions between lions from Central Africa and Southern Africa, and that lions {{in the northern part}} of Central Africa are genetically closer to lions in North and West Africa, and those in the southern part closer to lions <b>in</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Africa.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} which {{carnivores}} may have preyed on Massospondylus. Most of the theropods that have been discovered in rocks of Early Jurassic age <b>in</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa,</b> such as Coelophysis, were smaller than mid-sized sauropodomorphs like Massospondylus. These smaller predators have been postulated as using fast slashing attacks to wear down sauropodomorphs, which could have defended themselves with their large hand and foot claws. The 6-metre-(20ft-) long carnivorous theropod Dracovenator lived {{during the same period}} (Hettangian to Sinemurian stages) as Massospondylus and has also been found in the Elliot Formation of South Africa.|$|E
