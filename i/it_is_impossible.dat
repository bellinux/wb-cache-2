5|$|According to Celtic mythology scholar James MacKillop, {{because the}} calves of water bulls and {{ordinary}} cows might bring disaster to the herd, {{they are supposed}} to be killed at birth; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to kill them by drowning, so other methods have to be used. Conversely, stories published in 1937 by the clergyman George Sutherland suggest these hybrids are considered to be of superior quality to normal pedigree cattle in the far north of Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Eyre {{is thought}} to have been passing through the Toolinna Cove sand patch at the time of writing. B.epica and B.media are the only Banksia species that occur at that location, and both have a form and habit that accords with Eyre's description.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to judge}} the truth of these diary entries, but Reich's second daughter, the {{psychiatrist}} Lore Reich Rubin, told Christopher Turner that she believed Reich had {{been a victim of}} child sexual abuse, and that this explained his lifelong interest in sex and childhood sexuality.|$|E

5|$|Since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to entirely {{eliminate}} pest insects {{from the}} human food chain, insects are inadvertently present in many foods, especially grains. Food safety laws in many countries do not prohibit insect parts in food, but rather limit their quantity. According to cultural materialist anthropologist Marvin Harris, the eating of insects is taboo in cultures that have other protein sources such as fish or livestock.|$|E
5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E
5|$|About 260 {{models of}} lorry were produced, which were fitted with 35 types of engine, 20 {{different}} gearboxes, and 15 to 20 types of cabin. Many {{of the models}} were produced in small numbers, with 116 types only being represented by one or two units. Most of the differences came from special wheelbases that always needed approval from the authorities. In many cases, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> even for experts to identify different models and years of production. There were 66 types of bus chassis produced, {{and the number of}} different body types built on them by various coach builders and operators is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Certain quantum effects {{appear to}} be {{transmitted}} instantaneously and therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the quantum states of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in a superposition of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum state is observed, the other particle's quantum state is determined instantaneously (i.e., faster than light could travel from one particle to the other). However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to control which quantum state the first particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Cross {{features}} a diverse cast of 45 party members. Each character is outfitted with an innate Element affinity and three unique special abilities that are learned over time. If {{taken to the}} world opposite their own, characters react to their counterparts (if available). Many characters tie in to crucial plot events. Since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to obtain all 45 characters in one playthrough, players must replay the game to witness everything. Through use of the New Game+ feature, players can ultimately obtain all characters on one save file.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{other species}} are {{encountered}} only accidentally, or so rarely in Canadian territory that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to tell whether}} they are permanent resident. Most of these species are cetaceans, some generally poorly known: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), the dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and K. breviceps), Blainville's and True's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris and M. mirus), the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). The big free-tailed and evening bats (respectively Nyctinomops macrotis and Nycticeius humeralis), {{as well as the}} New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) are found mostly in areas south of the U.S.-Canada frontier, and occasionally in Canada.|$|E

5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to model}} forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction {{is caused by}} the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the Oatman {{family was}} ambushed {{by a group}} of Ɖo:lkabaya Yavapai (though many historians argue that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to know whether or not these were Yavapai, or some other tribe). Roys Oatman and his wife were killed, along with four of their children. The son, Lorenzo, was left for dead but survived, while sisters Olive and Mary Ann were later sold to Mojaves as slaves. The story was widely published, and {{increased}} White settlers' fears of attack in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|More tornadic {{damage was}} {{reported}} in southern Durham and Killingworth, with some homes severely damaged, {{but there were some}} minor injuries, one young woman in Killingworth was injured by shards of glass from a breaking window. Some sources insist that the Wallingford tornado dissipated a few miles west of the town, and this was an entirely separate tornado, but without a modern damage survey <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to tell. The parent storm finally moved out over the ocean around 8 PM.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in beak size {{may have}} affected behaviour. Such dimorphism is common in other parrots, for example in the palm cockatoo and the New Zealand kaka. In species where it occurs, the sexes prefer food of different sizes, the males use their beaks in rituals, or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing. Similarly, the large difference {{between male and female}} head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to determine how.|$|E
5|$|Soft tissue was {{apparently}} preserved with the specimen, but was subsequently removed during preparation. Covering the limbs {{and the rest}} of the body was a layer of smooth, multilayered calcite, which was originally interpreted as preservation of decaying skin. Additionally, an accumulation of sediment in the abdominal region may have represented gut contents, with both gastroliths and digested bones. However, since both samples of the alleged soft tissue are no longer available, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to verify these interpretations.|$|E
5|$|The Chittenango ovate amber snail is {{endemic to}} the Chittenango area of Madison County, New York, United States. There {{is only one}} {{population}} of this species at Chittenango Falls State Park in central New York, {{even though it was}} believed to have a broader range previously; based on fossil records, some authors argue that the distribution of this species may have been much wider in the past. In opposition to this, other authors argue that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>impossible</b> to identify this species based on fossil records, because they only allow for examination of shell features. Shell features of species in this particular family of snails are usually not very distinctive.|$|E
