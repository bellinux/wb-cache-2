Both the real Colbert and the character were raised in Charleston, South Carolina; both are the youngest of 11 children; both played Dungeons & Dragons as teenagers; and both are practicing Roman Catholics. Colbert's own interest in and knowledge of religion, science fiction, and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings story will often show through in the Report.

5|$|After {{exploring}} Daybreak Town and defeating several Heartless, {{the player}} is approached by the Foreteller, who tells them that defeating weaker Heartless {{is possible to}} do alone, but they will need others help to defeat more powerful opponents. The Foreteller also describes how many others are collecting light as well, though some may secretly be doing so to gain power instead of fighting the darkness, and the player must decide who to trust. Chirithy then encourages the player to explore other worlds and help rid them of the Heartless {{before it is too}} late. The player then visits the illusion future visions of Disney worlds, where they interact with the locals and help defeat the hordes of Heartless. The player is brought to each world under Chirithy's direction, and together the two search for the origin of the darkness. As the player succeeds in defeating the forces of evil, Chirithy begins to reveal the full extent of his knowledge regarding the war between light and darkness. Chirithy remembers being born <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> light, with his creator smiling upon him in the beginning. The creator would later vanish, but before doing so he renamed six of his followers and gave five of them a prophecy of the future. The five, later known as the Foretellers, were shocked to discover that the future ended with a great battle in which the light would be defeated and the eternal reign of darkness would begin. To save the future, the Foretellers began to use the hidden powers within the written copy of the prophecy known as the Book of Prophecies (which creates the future worlds that the players travel to). Through this book, the Foretellers projected the future into their era to grow more powerful and save the light from final defeat. The power retrieved from the future is manifested as the Cards the player gathers to grow stronger.|$|E

25|$|Here {{are some}} {{illustrations}} {{of the alternative}} accentuation: a word nykštỹs 3 is also commonly said nýkštis 1; zýlė 1 {{is also known as}} zylė̃ 3 in some dialects, but this form is used more narrowly and not shown here. Similarly, a word rýkštė 1 is also known as rykštė̃ 4; this is shown in the table. In a case of šálmas 3 – helmet, the variant šal̃mas 4 is also very common. The alternative forms are most usually present between the 1-3 and 2-4 accentuation patterns, same in the type of an accent. But there are also different cases, for example, rýkštė 1 and rykštė̃ 4. The fourth accentuation paradigm can be result of a shift of the third paradigm. The shift can happen following nivellation of the two accents, a loss of accentual contrast. In a case of nivellation of the start-firm and end-firm accents the distinction between the 3-4 and 1-2 loses its ground, because <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> the stress the 1 with the 2, the 3 with the 4 acentuation groups differ only in a few cases.|$|E

He elaborated that the controversy came from the use of assault weaponry <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> worship, one that plays host to a yearly candlelight vigil for victims of gun violence. He wrote that the [...] "jarring image of an American supersoldier spraying their church with bullets may indeed seem less like a meaningless violation of 'whiny dogma' than a sick joke." [...] He added that, the controversy, while [...] "ridiculous to Sony and the videogame community", demonstrates a growing awareness of religion in a [...] "virtual place", even among the [...] "severest critics of videogames".|$|E

500|$|When {{the episode}} {{originally}} aired in 1982, Fred Rothenberg of the Associated Press {{called it an}} introduction to a [...] "new wise-cracking comedy", [...] "a warm and wacky companion of a television show, a delightful place to spend idle time, [...] a five-star watering hole" [...] known as Cheers. Television and radio critic Mike Drew {{said it was not}} great but [...] "funnier [...] with cute lines [...] than" [...] any other sitcom, even those (like Archie Bunker's Place on TV and Duffy's Tavern on radio) set in bars. Fred L. Smith of The News and Courier found this episode similar to Taxi: [...] "Both are set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> business−Cheers at a , Taxi at a —both have a sensible guy and a pretty, preppy girl as main characters—Ted Danson and Shelley Long in Cheers and Judd Hirsch and Marilu Henner in Taxi—and both are wacky comedies."

500|$|As {{commanding}} officer, McCain {{relied upon}} a relatively unorthodox leadership style {{based upon the}} force of his personality. [...] He removed personnel he thought ineffective, and sought to improve morale and productivity by establishing an informal rapport with enlisted men. Dealing with limited post-Vietnam defense budgets and parts shortages, he was forceful in demanding that respect be given the female officers just beginning to arrive into the unit. [...] McCain's leadership abilities were credited with improving the unit's aircraft readiness; for the first time, all fifty of its aircraft were able to fly. Although some operational metrics declined during the period, the pilot safety improved to the point of having zero accidents. The squadron was awarded its first-ever Meritorious Unit Commendation, while McCain received a Meritorious Service Medal. McCain later stated that being commanding officer of VA-174 was the most rewarding assignment of his naval career. When his stint ended in July 1977, the change of command ceremony was attended by his father {{and the rest of his}} family, as well as some of his fellow POWs; speaker Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Jr. said that John had joined Jack and Slew McCain <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> honor in Navy tradition, a tribute that deeply moved McCain.|$|E

500|$|Critical receptions {{towards the}} music video were positive. Jillian Mapes of Billboard {{believed}} that the video is [...] "appropriately understated" [...] {{considering the fact that}} the song is all about making an apology. The Improper noticed that the video has [...] "the look and feel of a Hallmark movie and is almost as maudlin," [...] while Amos Barshad of the New York felt that the video was [...] "terrible." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV described the video as [...] "a bummer", writing [...] " [...] isn't just about a girl with her calendar permanently stuck on the twelfth month of the year. It's not just about feeling like a Lady Antebellum song. It's about getting stuck <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> romantic regret." [...] In a different perspective, Kyle Anderson of MTV argued that the music video puts Swift in a [...] "pantheon of modern classics" [...] with regards to its [...] "almost haunting visual sense" [...] which makes up for the inadequate narrative. Leah Collins of Dose.ca called the music video as [...] "dreamy and moody". Her points are echoed by Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, who deemed the video as [...] "kind of lovely", which corresponds with the melancholic yet regretful mood of the song. Joycelyn Vena of MTV noticed that the video is [...] "darker" [...] and [...] "somber", something that is not synonymous with Swift. Yet, The Oxonian Review considers Swift's [...] "listlessness, the bare trees, and snowy indoors" [...] in the music video attuned to the tenor of the song, achieved by [...] "mixing wide shots, medium close ups, and cut-ins of Ms Swift and her ex, matching their gazes across frames, and blurring focus tastefully." ...|$|E
500|$|In the volume, Stanton did {{not mention}} the Liberty Party's plank on woman {{suffrage}} pre-dating the Seneca Falls Convention by a month, and she did not describe the Worcester National Women's Rights Convention, organized by Stone and Davis in 1850, as the beginning of the women's rights movement. Rather, Stanton named the 1840 Anti-Slavery Convention in London as the birth of the [...] "movement for woman's suffrage, in both England and America". She positioned the Seneca Falls meeting as her own political debut, and characterized it as the beginning of the women's rights movement, calling it [...] "the greatest movement for human liberty recorded on the pages of history—a demand for freedom to one-half the entire race." [...] Stanton worked to enshrine the Declaration of Sentiments as a foundational treatise in a number of ways, {{not the least of which}} was by imbuing the small, three-legged tea table upon which the first draft of it was composed an importance similar to that of Thomas Jefferson's desk upon which he wrote the Declaration of Independence. The M'Clintocks gave Stanton the table, then Stanton gave it to Susan B. Anthony on the occasion of her 80th birthday, though Anthony had no part in the Seneca Falls meeting. In keeping with Stanton's promotion of the table as an iconic relic, women's rights activists put it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> honor at the head of the casket at the funeral of Susan B.

500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} seven episodes, Brian Lowry of Variety said, the season begins [...] "on an uneven note", {{comparing}} {{some of the early}} moments to the works of Sam Peckinpah, [...] "complete with slow-motion bullets and blood sprays. Stick with it, though, and the show blossoms, featuring a few terrific action sequences while introducing into this grim world seminal characters the Punisher and Elektra." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush felt {{the first seven}} episodes of the season seemed [...] "to have learned the best of both" [...] from season one and Jessica Jones, [...] "placing its most compelling imagery front and center straightaway, but still taking time to pick apart the characters beneath them, rather than shout platitudes about saving the city." [...] He also praised the castings of Bernthal and Yung as Punisher and Elektra, respectively, and enjoyed [...] "the improved spotlight" [...] for Foggy and Karen, given the reduction of Dawson saying, [...] "So many superhero series struggle to draw its supporting characters as compellingly as the action, and Daredevils particular blend of set piece and legal thriller feels inescapably original." [...] However, Fitzpatrick did note the series lacked the presence Vondie Curtis-Hall brought as Ben Urich in the first season. He concluded that the season's progression [...] "feels much cleaner" [...] than the first's, [...] "moving almost in acts more than back and forth victories...Even the aim feels that much more cohesive, to start <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> Matt, Foggy and Karen all confident in their new roles, but wrestling with the consequence of their choice to always help the helpless." [...] Merrill Barr of Forbes said, [...] "Daredevil season two is very much the same excellent show Daredevil season one was...but in the places it isn’t, it’s also very much improved". Barr praised Bernthal as the Punisher, and noted the reduction in the amount of [...] "thick blacks" [...] in the cinematography that the first season was criticized for.|$|E
