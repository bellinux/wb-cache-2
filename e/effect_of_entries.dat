40|$|The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> on {{consumer}} and total welfare are studied {{in a model}} of consumer search. Potential entrants differ in quality, with high-quality sellers being more likely to meet consumer needs. Contrary to the standard view in economics that more entry benefits consumers, we find that consumer welfare has an inverted-U relationship with entry cost, and free entry is excessive for both consumer and total welfare when entry cost is relatively low. We explain why these results may arise naturally in search markets due to the variety and quality <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> and discuss their business and policy implications. ...|$|R

While there exists much empirical evidence on the existence and persistence <b>of</b> the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> labour market <b>entry</b> conditions, little is known about their interaction with employees' mobility behaviour. Using German administrative data, this paper analyzes the determinants of job mobility, emphasizing the role of initial wage gaps. The analysis suggests that the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> conditions {{play an important role in}} explaining job transitions. Labour market entrants earning less than the average starting wage are more likely to change jobs, directly as well as indirectly. Moreover, labour market transitions tend to reduce the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> conditions, implying that job mobility operates as an adjustment mechanism that reduces the initial wage differences between workers...|$|R

I argue {{that differences in}} entry cost contribute to this pattern by affecting firms’ technology choice. Introducing technology choice into a standard heterogeneous-firm model, small differences in administrative entry cost can explain around one third of differences in total factor productivity. The productivity difference arises because the reduction in compe-tition due to higher entry costs reduces the incentive to adopt more advanced technologies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> into the market for a single {{commodity}} in which both sellers and buyers are permitted to interact strategically. With the inclusion of an additional seller, the market is quasi-competitive: the price falls and volume of trade increases, as expected. However, contrary to the conventional wisdom, existing sellers' payoffs may increase. The conditions under which entry by new sellers raises the equilibrium payoffs of existing sellers are derived. These depend in an intuitive way on the elasticity of a strategic analog of demand and the market share of existing sellers, and encompass entirely standard economic environments. Similar results are derived relating to the <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> additional buyers and the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> on both sides of the market are investigated...|$|R
