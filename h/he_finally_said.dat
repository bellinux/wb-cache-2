500|$|... "There isn't {{a team in}} the National League that's {{better than}} us. The pressure's back on them if you ask me. They were on paper {{the best team in}} the {{division}} last year and they were supposed to win, and they didn’t. One, there are four other teams in our division who are going to make sure that doesn't happen, and two, has anyone ever heard of plagiarism? [...] That was pretty good, especially coming from him. He's a quiet guy, so it was probably shocking when he said it. Not shocking in a bad way, like 'Wow, I can't believe he said that.' More like, 'Wow, <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> something because he's a leader on that team and you definitely need to be a vocal leader." ...|$|E
6000|$|Kelley {{considered}} for a breath or two; his brain was sluggish. [...] "Open the door, Rosie," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> and backed against the wall.|$|E
6000|$|He {{waited so}} long that I {{supposed}} it {{for the purpose of}} repudiating the assumption on which my action had been founded; but what <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> was: [...] "Do you mean now--here?" ...|$|E
60|$|Peter blinked very hard. He {{was trying}} to {{understand}} and <b>he</b> couldn't. <b>Finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> so.|$|R
25|$|Alexei Navalny, {{greeted with}} a ovation when <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> spoke, <b>said</b> there were enough people present at the protest to march to and overrun the Kremlin, but that they were {{committed}} to remaining peaceful, {{at least for the}} moment.|$|R
5000|$|Police {{testified that}} {{during the course of}} the interrogation, before <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> confessed, Peterson <b>said,</b> [...] "There is no white guy. I shot them all." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Swede wavered. [...] "Ay tank yes," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> and {{the last}} Rasmunsen saw of him his {{vocabulary}} was going to wreck in a vain effort to explain the mistake to the other fellows.|$|E
6000|$|Ralph {{appeared}} {{to allow that}} there was a good deal in this, and he surrendered to thought while his companion watched him askance. [...] "If I should invite Mr. Goodwood," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "it would be to quarrel with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{looks as}} {{if they wanted to}} know what there is below here," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> half to himself. [...] "I mistrusted them from the minute they got into the yawl without takin' the trouble to shove her bow off, an' if I ain't mistaken there'll be {{mischief}} done before this 'ere brig reaches port!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was silent}} for a time, staring at the ceiling. She held some water to his lips and <b>he</b> drank eagerly. <b>Finally</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> in a faint voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got to {{be getting}} home right away now," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally,</b> {{clicking}} his knife-blade half shut and open with his thumb.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Lapham. He drove along slowly. [...] "That's the place," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally,</b> {{stopping}} the mare and pointing with his whip.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is an {{adventure}} I {{would like to}} have," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> {{in a tone of}} enthusiasm. [...] "I can't understand why it shouldn't be possible to hit upon some hiding place within half a mile of the city, and on a stormy night, for instance, lug away precious metal enough to make ourselves rich." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have a good}} mind to {{stay with}} you," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "The idea that I have been where silver could be had for the labor of {{carrying}} it away, and didn't get any, makes me angry with myself. Now that Mr. Walters has concluded to try his hand at it I believe I'll do the same thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's this way, Hitchcock," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'm in {{the same}} boat with the rest. If three-score bucks have made up their mind to kill the girl, why, we can't help it. One rush, and we'd be wiped off the landscape. And what good'd that be? They'd still have the girl. There's no use in going against the customs of a people except you're in force." ...|$|E
6000|$|Deane did {{not answer}} him directly. [...] "By the way," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally,</b> [...] "wasn't there a murder {{committed}} {{in one of these}} rooms?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Steele, {{that was}} the second break of yours last night," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "If you come fooling round the ranch again there'll be hell!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Minnie," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally,</b> [...] "it pains {{me to tell}} you, but {{you married}} a fool. Only a fool would have gone {{overboard}} as I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|They were face to {{face again}} now, and she saw she had made his colour rise; {{it was as if}} he were still finding in her eyes the {{concrete}} image, the enacted scene, of her passage with Charlotte, which he was now hearing of for the first time and as to which it would have been natural he should question her further. His forbearance to do so would but mark, precisely, the complication of his fears. [...] "What she does like," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "is the way it has succeeded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll get {{something}} to do and earn money enough to go back on," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> to himself; [...] "that's all I'm fit for, just to work by the day for some other man; that's my size. I've failed in everything else I've ever undertaken. I've no business to interfere with a girl like Mary. She's too high class for a hobo like me; even if I had a ranch it would be playing it low down on a singer like her {{to ask her to}} go out there. It's no use; I'm worse than a failure--I'm in a hole, and the first thing I've got to do is to earn money enough to get out of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh then he saw, but he {{was lost}} in wonder and found himself embarrassed. This, he also saw, made her sorry for him, as if her allusion had been a mistake. It took him but a moment, however, to feel it hadn't been, much {{as it had been}} a surprise. After the first little shock of it her {{knowledge}} on the contrary began, even if rather strangely, to taste sweet to him. She was the only other person in the world then who would have it, and she had had it all these years, while the fact of his having so breathed his secret had unaccountably faded from him. No wonder they couldn't have met as if nothing had happened. [...] "I judge," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "that I know what you mean. Only I had strangely enough lost any sense of having taken you so far into my confidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|Josiah Crabtree {{glared at}} the girl, {{and then began to}} pace the floor impatiently. [...] "Dora, see here," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "Let us come to terms." ...|$|R
6000|$|Cruchot {{stroked his}} long moustaches reflectively. [...] "Well, well," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally,</b> {{with a flick}} of the whip at the off mule, [...] "so you don't know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I will," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "I'll {{start out}} and have the thing over at once. Which way {{do you intend to}} go--up or down?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh I see." [...] His {{friend had}} responded quickly, {{but for a}} minute said nothing more, and the great marble clock that gave the place {{the air of a}} club ticked louder in the stillness. Mr. Longdon waited with a benevolent want of mercy, yet with a look in his face that spoke of what {{depended}} for him--though indeed very far within--on the upshot of his patience. The hush between them, for that matter, became a conscious public measure of the young man's honesty. He evidently at last felt it as such, and there would have been for an observer of his handsome controlled face a study of some sharp things. [...] "I judge that you ask me for such an utterance," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "as very few persons at any time have the right to expect of a man. Think of the people--and very decent ones--to whom on so many a question one must only reply that it's none of their business." ...|$|E
5000|$|At that time, {{there was}} a man named Xu Shao who lived in Runan and was famous for his ability to {{evaluate}} a person's potentials and talents. Cao Cao paid him a visit in hopes of receiving an evaluation that would help him politically. At first, Xu Shao refused to make a statement; however, under persistent questioning, <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You would be a capable minister in peaceful times and an unscrupulous hero in chaotic times." [...] Cao Cao laughed and left. There are two other versions of this comment in other unofficial historical records.|$|E
50|$|As {{the spring}} of 1930 approached, Manwaring {{received}} a letter from the chairman of the Ricks Board of Education. President Romney had been granted a leave of absence and they wanted Manwaring to fill the position of Acting President. Hyrum received the impression that the assignment could lead to his elevation to be President. Although he felt an obligation because he was on leave from Ricks, Manwaring agonized over the decision. His studies were going well, the family had settled in to enjoy their new home and (most importantly) he was not at all sure the college would even survive. But <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> “yes” anyway.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see your}} little friends coming around the point," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "I suppose you must go. Put {{the rest of}} the goodies in your pocket." ...|$|R
5000|$|Scully {{said nothing}} {{for over a}} minute, {{allowing}} the pictures to tell the story. <b>Finally,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] In a year that has been so improbable... the impossible has happened! ...|$|R
6000|$|The Klondiker's face {{took on a}} contemptuous {{expression}} as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally,</b> [...] "I reckon there's nothin' in sight to prevent me takin' the dog right here an' now." ...|$|R
5000|$|One {{of master}} Gasan's monks visited the {{university}} in Tokyo. When he returned, he asked the master if he had ever read the Christian Bible. [...] "No," [...] Gasan replied, [...] "Please read some of it to me." [...] The monk opened the Bible to the Sermon on the Mount in St. Matthew, and began reading. After reading Christ's words about the lilies in the field, he paused. Master Gasan {{was silent for a}} long time. [...] "Yes," [...] <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Whoever uttered these words is an enlightened being. What you have read to me is the essence of everything I have been trying to teach you here!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Cam and Mitch {{argue about}} how they missed the date they wanted to book for their wedding and Cam accuses Mitch {{that if he was}} not {{hesitant}} they would get the date they wanted. The argument leads Gloria and Claire to admit that it took them some time until they come around to Jay and Phil, but they did eventually. Same goes with Joe who Jay was trying to make him say daddy all day and <b>he</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Jay". The whole discussion makes Jay {{to accept the fact that}} Manny tries to be with a girl that is out of his league and he wishes him good luck since she might also come around eventually.|$|E
5000|$|Then, Yun Seon-do, an {{influential}} Southerner, replied. He first {{said that the}} Etiquette and Ceremonial directly said that the death of sons who are not the eldest but inherit the line also require mourning robes for three years, and therefore that it was unnecessary {{to bring up the}} term seoja. He then said that it was illogical that a second son whose mother was not a concubine and who had inherited the father's line and become a king would never be a true inheritor of the line, and sarcastily asked if a king who was a second son was a [...] "false crown prince" [...] and a [...] "regent emperor", and if the second son could not [...] "reign as king to the descendants of the first son". <b>He</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> that the title of [...] "Crown Prince" [...] was equivalent to the eldest prince, and therefore Hyojong was the eldest son, whose death required a three-year robe. He then attacked Song Si-yeol's argument based on the impossibility of two eldest sons, saying that all that meant was that there could not be two eldest sons at the same time. He then attacked Song's claim that it was unnatural for the Queen Consort, of a higher rank than Hyojong, was to wear a mourning robe that children wore for parents by pointing out that it was just as unnatural for parents to wear three-year mourning robes at their eldest son's death. <b>He</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> that he was not a wise person and that it was natural for some contradictions to occur in his argument, but that if his argument was logical it was naturally true.|$|E
6000|$|Porportuk waited patiently, sipping {{from his}} glass and {{studying}} the double row of faces down the board. “It is no joke,” <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b> “My speech is well meant.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come!' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>finally.</b> 'Come on home.' 'I beg pardon,' she replied; 'I {{have agreed}} to go to supper with Mr. Harrington. Besides, there's no end of dances promised.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish {{we could}} get into Port Arthur at once," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>finally.</b> [...] "I shouldn't like {{anything}} better than to capture this Captain Barusky and liberate Ben." ...|$|R
