2500|$|Rian Thum {{explored}} {{the concepts of}} identity among the ancestors of the modern Uyghurs in Altishahr (the native Uyghur name for eastern Turkestan or southern Xinjiang) before {{the adoption of the}} name [...] "Uyghur" [...] in the 1930s, referring to them by the name [...] "Altishahri" [...] in his article Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism. Thum indicated that Altishahri Turkis did <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> they were a distinctive group separate from the Turkic Andijanis to their west, the nomadic Turkic Kirghiz, the nomadic Mongol Qalmaq, and the Han Chinese Khitay before they became known as Uyghurs. There was no single name used by them to refer to themselves, the various native names Altishahris used to refer to themselves were Altishahrlik (Altishahr person), yerlik (local), Turki, and Musulmān (Muslim), the term Musulmān in this situation did not signify religious connotations, because the Altishahris would exclude other Muslim peoples like the Kirghiz when referring to themselves as Musulmān. Dr. Laura J Newby has also noted that the sedentary Altishahri Turkic people felt themselves as a separate group from other Turkic Muslims since at least the 19th century.|$|E
60|$|Far, {{far away}} I have {{a memory of}} having lived, a smaller lad, by the tree- lined banks of a stream. And as the wagon jolts along, and I sway on the seat with my father, I {{continually}} return and dwell upon that pleasant water flowing between the trees. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> for an interminable period I have lived in a wagon and travelled on, ever on, with this present company.|$|E
6000|$|And {{what was}} her mind? Personally, {{she had come to}} like and approve Mr. Deyncourt the most, and to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> there was {{satisfaction}} in that to which he could lead her, while the better taste that had grown in her was sometimes offended, almost insulted, by Tom Brady's tendency to coarseness, and to treating her not as a lady, but as the Westhaven belle he had honoured with his attentions two years before. Yet she had an old kindness for him as her first love. And, moreover, he could give her eventually a title and very considerable wealth, a house in London, and all imaginable gaiety. While, as to Mr. Deyncourt, he was not poor and had expectations, but the utmost she could look to for him with confidence was Northmoor Vicarage after Mr. Woodman's time, and anywhere the dull, sober, hard-working life of a clergyman's wife! ...|$|E

60|$|But {{for that}} very reason he made his visit brief with his usual {{activity}} of imagination as to how his conduct might affect others, he shrank from what might seem like curiosity or the assumption of a right to know as much as he pleased of one to whom he had done a service. For example, {{he would have liked to}} hear her sing, but he would have felt the expression of such a wish to be rudeness in him--since she could not refuse, and he would all the while <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> she was being treated like one whose accomplishments were to be ready on demand. And whatever reverence could be shown to woman, he was bent on showing to this girl. Why? He gave himself several good reasons; but whatever one does with a strong unhesitating outflow of will has a store of motive that it would be hard to put into words. Some deeds seem little more than interjections which give vent to the long passion of a life.|$|E
6000|$|From {{this point}} I went through Covent Garden Market, and got astray in the city, so that I can give no clear account of my afternoon's wanderings. I passed through Holborn, however, and I {{think it was}} from that street that I passed through an archway (which I almost {{invariably}} do, when I see one), and found myself in a very spacious, gravelled square, surrounded on the four sides by a continuous edifice of dark brick, very plain, and of cold and stern aspect. This was Gray's Inn, all tenanted by a multitude of lawyers. Passing thence, I saw [...] "Furnival's Inn" [...] over another archway, but, being {{on the opposite side}} of the street, I did not go thither. In Holborn, still, I went through another arched entrance, over which was [...] "Staples Inn," [...] and here likewise seemed to be offices; but, in a court opening inwards from this, there was a surrounding seclusion of quiet dwelling-houses, with beautiful green shrubbery and grass-plots in the court, and a great many sunflowers in full bloom. The windows were open; it was a lovely summer afternoon, and I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> bees were humming in the court, though this may have been suggested by my fancy, because the sound would have been so well suited to the scene. A boy was reading at one of the windows. There was not a quieter spot in England than this, and it was very strange to have drifted into it so suddenly out of the bustle and rumble of Holborn; and to lose all this repose as suddenly, on passing through the arch of the outer court. In all the hundreds of years since London was built, it has not been able to sweep its roaring tide over that little island of quiet. In Holborn I saw the most antique-looking houses that I have yet met with in London, but none of very remarkable aspect.|$|E
6000|$|The {{theory of}} her stupidity, {{eventually}} embraced by her parents, corresponded {{with a great}} date in her small still life: the complete vision, private but final, of the strange office she filled. It was literally a moral revolution and accomplished {{in the depths of}} her nature. The stiff dolls on the dusky shelves began to move their arms and legs; old forms and phrases began to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> frightened her. She had a new feeling, the feeling of danger; on which a new remedy rose to meet it, the idea of an inner self or, in other words, of concealment. She puzzled out with imperfect signs, but with a prodigious spirit, that she had been a centre of hatred and a messenger of insult, and that everything was bad because she had been employed to make it so. Her parted lips locked themselves with the determination to be employed no longer. She would forget everything, she would repeat nothing, and when, as a tribute to the successful application of her system, she began to be called a little idiot, she tasted a pleasure new and keen. When therefore, as she grew older, her parents in turn announced before her that she had grown shockingly dull, it was not from any real contraction of her little stream of life. She spoiled their fun, but she practically added to her own. She saw more and more; she saw too much. It was Miss Overmore, her first governess, who on a momentous occasion had sown the seeds of secrecy; sown them not by anything she said, but by a mere roll of those fine eyes which Maisie already admired. Moddle had become at this time, after alternations of residence of which the child had no clear record, an image faintly embalmed in the remembrance of hungry disappearances from the nursery and distressful lapses in the alphabet, sad embarrassments, in particular, when invited to recognise something her nurse described as [...] "the important letter haitch." [...] Miss Overmore, however hungry, never disappeared: this marked her somehow as of higher rank, and the character was confirmed by a prettiness that Maisie supposed to be extraordinary. Mrs. Farange had described her as almost too pretty, and some one had asked what that mattered so long as Beale wasn't there. [...] "Beale or no Beale," [...] Maisie had heard her mother reply, [...] "I take her because she's a lady and yet awfully poor. Rather nice people, but there are seven sisters at home. What do people mean?" ...|$|E

60|$|He hesitated. It {{was not an}} {{ordinary}} conversation {{they were dealing with}} realities, and he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> vital issues were at stake.

When I saw Peter Straughan's script, only a first draft, I couldn't believe what I was reading. It was the best draft I had ever seen.

5000|$|... p.90: My {{guess is}} that {{it has to do with}} the fact that Einstein made the {{physical}} interpretation of the Lorentz transformation the basis for a remarkably clear and simple discussion of the electrodynamics of moving bodies, whereas Poincaré's remarks on the physical interpretation of Lorentz transformed quantities may have struck Lorentz as inconsequential philosophical asides in expositions that otherwise closely followed his own. I also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Lorentz found Einstein's physically very intuitive approach more appealing than Poincaré's rather abstract but mathematically more elegant approach.|$|E

60|$|Trevor had entirely {{left off}} {{inviting}} Alured to Spinney Lawn.

50|$|This {{effect is}} a kind of biased interpretation, in that objectively neutral or {{unfavorable}} evidence is interpreted to support existing beliefs. It is also related to biases in hypothesis-testing behavior. In judging whether two events, such as illness and bad weather, are correlated, people rely heavily on the number of positive-positive cases: in this example, instances of both pain and bad weather. They pay relatively little attention to the other kinds of observation (of no pain and/or good weather). This parallels the reliance on positive tests in hypothesis testing. It may also reflect selective recall, in that people may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> two events are correlated because it is easier to recall times when they happened together.|$|E
5000|$|The series {{follows a}} group of young female {{researchers}} at “News of the Week” in the revolutionary times of 1969. Women in the newsroom are relegated to low-level positions. Many researchers are more talented and better educated than their male counterparts (the reporters), and do writing that the reporters incorporate directly into their stories, yet are paid less. The women <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> they're paid a lot less, and during the series it emerges just how much lower their pay is. But also at issue is the fact that their writing is not recognized: on the rare occasions when a female researcher's writing is openly accepted (such as when a male reporter quit just before a deadline), the story is nonetheless published under the man's name only.|$|E
5000|$|In {{discussing}} the Divine Service, Lorraine S. Brugh and Gordon W. Lathrop write that [...] "Many Lutherans, {{in concert with}} many other Christians, think that the time of which Luther spoke has indeed come, and that the pastor should preside at the table facting the people, i.e., versus populum. The assembly needs to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> it is gathered around that table, sees and hears what happens there, has a promise of Christ clearly addressed to it, participates in the thanksgiving, and is made into a community through God's gift." [...] Thus, in the Lutheran Church, many altars are now built to be freestanding. In churches where the former altar attached to the wall cannot be moved, {{it has often been}} converted {{to be used as a}} credence table, as a [...] "significant new table is set up, closer to the people and standing free".|$|E
25|$|The average Boer {{nevertheless}} was not thirsty for war. Many did {{not look}} forward to fighting against fellow Christians and, by and large, fellow Christian Protestants. Many may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> overly optimistic <b>sense</b> of what the war would involve, imagining that victory could be won as easily as in the First South African War. Many, including many generals, also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> their cause was holy and just, and blessed by God.|$|R
60|$|Godfrey was silent.

40|$|Till We Have Faces {{is widely}} {{regarded}} by admirers of C. S. Lewis as his best work of fiction, and also the most enigmatic. While it is not obviously didactic, most readers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> a meaning lurks in it that cannot be ascertained by a conventional analysis of the plot, the observations of the narrator and her developing awareness of her own motives. It is argued here that Lewis, who was familiar with allegorical readings of the tale of Cupid and Psyche in Apuleius and with at least some later imitations, may have been sufficiently influenced by these precedents to conceive his own tale as a partial allegory, in which Orual represents the fleshly or somatic element in humanity, sharing both in the labours of the soul and in its ultimate redemption...|$|E
