500|$|On September 28, the Mets {{came into}} Philadelphia for a three-game {{series against the}} Phillies. The Mets were [...] games out of first with six games left: three against the Phillies and the last three against the first-place Cardinals. They had an {{opportunity}} to win the division and were playing the Phillies, against whom they had a season record of 12–3. The Mets won the opener, 1–0, to move within two games back with five remaining to play. However, the Phillies effectively ended their season on September 29. As the Cardinals swept a doubleheader from the Montréal Expos, the Phillies' Don Carman pitched a complete-game one-hitter, facing only 28 batters to shut out the Mets. After the game, Mets manager Davey Johnson said, [...] "How does it <b>feel</b> <b>now?</b> Empty? Not yet. But we need to get help. When you play 162 games and you're eliminated, then you feel empty. And sick." [...] He promised reporters, [...] "We're going to win tomorrow night.". The following night, Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden struck out 10, and left after pitching nine innings with the score tied at three runs each, but the Phillies' Luis Aguayo won the game with a 10th-inning pinch-hit home run off of Orosco, clinching at least a tie for first place in the division for the Cardinals.|$|E

Ultimately, she questioned the Court's entire approach: [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>now</b> that you men could have done much good had you perhaps had a little less sense of justice and a little more of the spirit of Jesus in your hearts." [...] Wolff's father asked the Dean to recognize that helping his son to reform was more important than punishment: [...] "I am taking the liberty of appealing to you, not in your official capacity, but as a man, to do what you can to assist him. You know all are subject to mistakes, and the blessing is in those who can aid and advise in correcting and saving rather than otherwise." ...|$|E

[...] Speaking of the types of records she was making, in a separate interview with Rap-Up, Norwood compared her album to previous records. [...] "It’s just gonna be a different album, but of course expressing the love that I <b>feel</b> <b>now</b> and the struggles and different situations that I’ve gone through in the past,... My music always tends to be the soundtrack to my life and definitely inspired by what I see other people go through as well—gritty, edgy, different."
