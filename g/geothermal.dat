5|$|According to the <b>Geothermal</b> Energy Association (GEA) {{installed}} <b>geothermal</b> {{capacity in}} the United States grew by 5%, or 147.05 MW, ce the last annual survey in March 2012. This increase came from seven <b>geothermal</b> projects that began production in 2012. GEA also revised its 2011 estimate of installed capacity upward by 128 MW, bringing current installed U.S. <b>geothermal</b> capacity to 3,386 MW.|$|E
5|$|Currently <b>geothermal</b> power heats 89% of {{the houses}} in Iceland and over 54% of the primary energy used in Iceland comes from <b>geothermal</b> sources. <b>Geothermal</b> power is used for many things in Iceland. 57.4% of the energy is used for space heat, 25% is used for electricity, and the {{remaining}} amount is used in many miscellaneous areas: swimming pools, fish farms, and greenhouses, for example.|$|E
5|$|Direct <b>geothermal</b> {{heating systems}} contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This {{parasitic}} load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of <b>geothermal</b> heating may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a <b>geothermal</b> heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct <b>geothermal</b> heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E
5|$|From hot springs, <b>geothermal</b> {{energy has}} been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for {{electricity}} generation. Worldwide, 11,700 megawatts (MW) of <b>geothermal</b> power is online in 2013. An additional 28 gigawatts of direct <b>geothermal</b> heating capacity is installed for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination and agricultural applications as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geothermal</b> (ground source) {{heat pumps}} {{represented}} an estimated 30 GWth of installed capacity {{at the end}} of 2008, with other direct uses of <b>geothermal</b> heat (i.e., for space heating, agricultural drying and other uses) reaching an estimated 15 GWth. , at least 76 countries use direct <b>geothermal</b> energy in some form.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geothermal</b> {{activity}} and the emission of volcanic gases are ongoing, and the volcano has been prospected {{for the possibility of}} obtaining <b>geothermal</b> energy. The <b>geothermal</b> activity has resulted in widespread rock alteration and the formation of sulfur deposits, which were mentioned in a 1909 report and later mined. Koh-i-Sultan also has deposits of other minerals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geothermal</b> {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} {{and stored in}} the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. The <b>geothermal</b> energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The <b>geothermal</b> gradient, which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective <b>geothermal</b> originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geothermal</b> {{energy is}} the second most used form of {{renewable}} energy in Russia but represents less than 1% of the total energy production. The first <b>geothermal</b> power plant in Russia was built at Pauzhetka, Kamchatka, in 1966, with a capacity of 5MW. The total <b>geothermal</b> installed capacity in 2005 was 79MW, with 50MW coming from a plant at Verkhne-Mutnovsky. Russia is currently developing a 100MW plant at Mutnovsky and a 50MW plant in Kaliningrad. Most <b>geothermal</b> resources are currently used for heating settlements in the North Caucasus and Kamchatka. Half of the <b>geothermal</b> production is used to heat homes and industrial buildings, one third is used to heat greenhouses and 13% is used for industrial processes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geothermal</b> {{power is}} also {{considered}} to be sustainable thanks to its power to sustain the Earth’s intricate ecosystems. By using <b>geothermal</b> sources of energy present generations of humans will not endanger the capability of future generations {{to use their own}} resources to the same amount that those energy sources are presently used. Further, due to its low emissions <b>geothermal</b> energy is considered to have excellent potential for mitigation of global warming.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geothermal</b> {{power plants}} can operate 24hours per day, {{providing}} baseload capacity. Estimates {{for the world}} potential capacity for <b>geothermal</b> power generation vary widely, ranging from 40 GW by 2020 {{to as much as}} 6,000 GW.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the United States led {{the world}} in <b>geothermal</b> {{electricity}} production with 3,086 MW of installed capacity from 77 power plants. The largest group of <b>geothermal</b> power plants {{in the world is}} located at The Geysers, a <b>geothermal</b> field in California. The Philippines is the second highest producer, with 1,904 MW of capacity online. <b>Geothermal</b> power makes up approximately 27% of Philippine electricity generation.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{renewable}} energy, primarily <b>geothermal</b> and hydroelectric power, generated 40.1% of New Zealand's {{gross energy}} supply. <b>Geothermal</b> power alone accounted for 22% of New Zealand's energy in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, Sergei Shmatko, Russia's energy minister, {{stated that}} Russia and Iceland would work {{together}} to develop Kamchatka's <b>geothermal</b> energy sources. Russia is also investigating foreign investment possibilities for developing <b>geothermal</b> energy in the Kuril Islands.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{demand for}} {{electricity}} {{led to the}} consideration of <b>geothermal</b> power as a generating source. Prince Piero Ginori Conti tested the first <b>geothermal</b> power generator on 4 July 1904, at the same Larderello dry steam field where <b>geothermal</b> acid extraction began. It successfully lit four light bulbs. Later, in 1911, the world's first commercial <b>geothermal</b> power plant was built there. It was the world's only industrial producer of <b>geothermal</b> electricity until New Zealand built a plant in 1958. In 2012, it produced some 594 megawatts.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the first}} <b>geothermal</b> power station {{to be built in}} Tibet and is the largest <b>geothermal</b> steam power plant in China.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the legal}} issues raised by <b>geothermal</b> energy {{resources}} include questions of ownership and allocation of the resource, the grant of exploration permits, exploitation rights, royalties, {{and the extent to}} which <b>geothermal</b> energy issues have been recognized in existing planning and environmental laws. Other questions concern overlap between <b>geothermal</b> and mineral or petroleum tenements. Broader issues concern the extent to which the legal framework for encouragement of renewable energy assists in encouraging <b>geothermal</b> industry innovation and development.|$|E

5|$|The main use of <b>geothermal</b> {{energy is}} for space heating, {{with the heat}} being {{distributed}} to buildings through extensive district-heating systems. About 85% of all houses in Iceland are heated with <b>geothermal</b> energy.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 270petajoules(PJ) of <b>geothermal</b> heating {{was used}} in 2004. More than half went for space heating, and another third for heated pools. The {{remainder}} supported industrial and agricultural applications. Global installed capacity was 28GW, but capacity factors tend to be low (30% on average) since heat is mostly needed in winter. Some 88PJ for space heating was extracted by an estimated 1.3million <b>geothermal</b> heat pumps with a total capacity of 15 GW.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of the thermal fluid indicate that there is shallow-seated magmatic activity not far below the <b>geothermal</b> field.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{volcanic}} {{nature of the}} islands, mineral deposits are abundant. The country is estimated to have the second-largest gold deposits after South Africa {{and one of the}} largest copper deposits in the world. It is also rich in nickel, chromite, and zinc. Despite this, poor management, high population density, and environmental consciousness have resulted in these mineral resources remaining largely untapped. <b>Geothermal</b> energy is a product of volcanic activity that the Philippines has harnessed more successfully. The Philippines is the world's second-biggest <b>geothermal</b> producer behind the United States, with 18% of the country's electricity needs being met by <b>geothermal</b> power.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geothermal</b> {{electric}} {{plants were}} traditionally built {{exclusively on the}} edges of tectonic plates where high temperature <b>geothermal</b> resources are available near the surface. The development of binary cycle power plants and improvements in drilling and extraction technology enable enhanced <b>geothermal</b> systems over a much greater geographical range. Demonstration projects are operational in Landau-Pfalz, Germany, and Soultz-sous-Forêts, France, while an earlier effort in Basel, Switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes. Other demonstration projects are under construction in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geothermal</b> power {{capacity}} grew from around 1 GW in 1975 to almost 10 GW in 2008. The United States {{is the world}} leader in terms of installed capacity, representing 3.1 GW. Other countries with significant installed capacity include the Philippines (1.9 GW), Indonesia (1.2 GW), Mexico (1.0 GW), Italy (0.8 GW), Iceland (0.6 GW), Japan (0.5 GW), and New Zealand (0.5 GW). In some countries, <b>geothermal</b> power accounts for a significant share of the total electricity supply, {{such as in the}} Philippines, where <b>geothermal</b> represented 17 percent of the total power mix at the end of 2008.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geothermal</b> {{power is}} cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and {{environmentally}} friendly, but {{has historically been}} limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. <b>Geothermal</b> wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geothermal</b> {{power is}} highly scalable: from a rural village to an entire city.|$|E

5|$|Hot {{springs and}} other <b>geothermal</b> manifestations are {{widespread}} in Iran {{and using them}} to gain <b>geothermal</b> energy has been studied; {{according to a report}} of 2002 hot springs at that time were mainly used for therapeutic purposes and bathing. A report in 2002 indicated that Taftan may be a feasible place to install a binary cycle power plant at Taftan.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, America's first {{district}} heating system in Boise, Idaho was powered directly by <b>geothermal</b> energy, and was copied in Klamath Falls, Oregon in 1900. The first known {{building in the}} world to utilize <b>geothermal</b> energy as its primary heat source was the Hot Lake Hotel in Union County, Oregon, whose construction was completed in 1907. A deep <b>geothermal</b> well was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in 1926, and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time. Charlie Lieb developed the first downhole heat exchanger in 1930 to heat his house. Steam and hot water from geysers began heating homes in Iceland starting in 1943.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to dissolved gases, hot water from <b>geothermal</b> sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic {{elements such as}} mercury, arsenic, boron, and antimony. These chemicals precipitate as the water cools, and can cause environmental damage if released. The modern practice of injecting cooled <b>geothermal</b> fluids back into the Earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental risk.|$|E

5|$|The International <b>Geothermal</b> Association (IGA) has {{reported}} that 10,715 megawatts (MW) of <b>geothermal</b> power in 24 countries is online, which was expected to generate 67,246 GWh of electricity in 2010. This represents a 20% increase in online capacity since 2005. IGA projects growth to 18,500 MW by 2015, due to the projects presently under consideration, often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resources.|$|E
