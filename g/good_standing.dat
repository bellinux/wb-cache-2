5|$|McKinley's <b>good</b> <b>standing</b> {{with labor}} became useful that year as he campaigned for the Republican {{nomination}} for Ohio's 17th congressional district. Delegates {{to the county}} conventions thought he could attract blue-collar voters, and in August 1876, McKinley was nominated.

McKinley's victory came at a personal cost: his income as a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer.|$|E
