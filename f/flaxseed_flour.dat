Significant reduction in the spread factor of the cookies was observed. Addition of the <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> restricted the spread of the cookies...|$|E
40|$|Flaxseed {{has been}} widely studied around the world; its {{incorporation}} into products habitually consumed by human populations has been stimulated due to its unique nutritional value. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the chemical composition of Brazilian flaxseed, to analyze the stability of lipids present in whole <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> (WFF) or partially defatted <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> (DFF) stored under several temperatures, and to investigate the effect of bread making on a product containing flaxseed. Whole <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> presented (g. 100 g- 1) 25. 7 of insoluble fiber, 10. 7 of soluble fiber, 38. 9 of lipids, and 2. 65 of lignan. Defatted <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> presented 65 % less lipids, 36 % more fiber and 56 % more lignan than whole <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour.</b> The fatty acid profile was maintained in the defatted <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour,</b> and it presented a stable composition during storage under ambient temperature, refrigeration, and freezing. The fatty acid profile was similar in the bread containing defatted <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> after dough development, baking, and storage at room temperature or refrigerated. After baking, 89 % of the lignan content was kept in bread. Results show that Brazilian flaxseed has an interesting chemical composition, and that defatted flaxseed, by-product of lipid extraction, presents a good stability to grind and storage under several temperatures. Thus, defatted <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> can be incorporated in bread, increasing its nutritional and functional value...|$|E

40|$|Consumers {{have become}} very {{conscious}} about their nutrition and well being due to changes in their socio-economic lifestyle and rapid urbanization. Therefore, development of technology for production of low cost and functional meat products is urgently required. One such approach is innovative restructuring technology in which binding of meat pieces still remains the main challenge and extension of product is generally associated with poor binding and texture. Thus, {{the present study was}} envisaged as an attempt to solve this problem by the incorporation of <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> (FF) as bind enhancing agent. The FF was used at three different levels viz., 0. 5 %, 1 %, and 1. 5 % to replace lean meat in pre-standardized restructured mutton chops formulation. The products were subjected to analysis for physico-chemical, sensory and textural properties. Cooking yield, moisture percentage and fat percentage increased with increase in the level of incorporation of FF, however, protein percent and pH decreased with increase in the level of incorporation. Shear force value of product incorporated with 1. 5 % FF was significantly higher (p< 0. 01) than control and product containing 0. 5 % FF level. Among the sensory attributes, product with 1 % <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> showed significantly higher values (p< 0. 05) for general appearance, binding, texture and overall acceptability. Hardness showed significant increasing (p< 0. 01) values with increasing levels of incorporation of <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour,</b> however all other parameters of texture profile analysis showed a decreasing trend. On the basis of sensory scores and physico-chemical properties, the optimum incorporation level of FF was adjudged as 1 %. Products incorporated with optimum level of <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> (1 %) were also assessed for water activity and microbiological quality during the storage period of 15 days. It was found that the extended restructured product could be safely stored under refrigeration (4 °C± 1 °C) in low density polyethylene (LDPE) pouches for 15 days without marked deterioration in sensory and microbiological quality.

40|$|Human {{consumption}} of flaxseed is increasing {{due to its}} health benefit properties and extrusion processes can enhance its nutritional quality. Extruded flaxseed meal (EFM) obtained in a pilot plant was characterized and incorporated in flour mixes and cereal-based bars to demonstrate its nutritious usefulness. Amino acid content was not affected by extrusion and, despite lysine was the limitating amino acid, the chemical score (CS) was 83 %. Thiamin and riboflavin decreased slightly as consequence of extrusion, phytic acid did not change and trypsin inhibitor activity was undetectable. Proximate composition and nutritional quality determined by biological and chemical indexes were compared among EFM, flour mixes (FM) and cereal bars (CB). They presented high protein levels (26, 20 and 17 %, respectively), good biological value (BV) (80, 79 and 65, respectively), acceptable true protein digestibility (TD) (73, 79 and 78, respectively), and high dietary fiber (33, 20. 5 and 18 %, respectively).

40|$|Abstract. For centuries, cereals {{have been}} major food stuffs used {{all around the}} world; because of that, there are many {{different}} kinds of breads produced from different types of flours. Despite the variety of flours available, there are still many challenges to produce ingredients which maximize nutrient components, and with which healthier breads and other products can be produced. As studies have shown, traditional wheat flour has some nutritional deficiencies (although {{this is a matter of}} perspective), which depend on the level of consumption. Additionally, gluten intolerance and Celiac disease are growing problems. The nutritional value of breads can be enhanced through the use of a variety of alternative flours. The objective of this study is to review and discuss alternatives to traditional wheat flour, with an emphasis on improved nutritional characteristics. Oat, for instance, has been used to improve the protein and fiber content of bread. Fortification of breads with soybean flour can also dramatically improve their protein quality. Barley, <b>flaxseed,</b> and rye <b>flours</b> can be used to increase the amount of dietary fiber in breads. Dietary fiber can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{was carried out}} to evaluate the acceptability of flaxseed utilization in the baked products. Microwave roasting reduced the cyanogenic glycosides content of flaxseed thus making it fit for human consumption. The partial defattening of flaxseed resulted in the improvement of chemical constituents of flaxseed meal. The flaxseed flours (partially defatted and full fat) supplemented wheat flour significantly improved the chemical composition (ash, crude fat, crude fiber and crude protein) and mineral contents of the composite flours. The chemical constituents remained statistically unchanged during the 60 days of storage studies thus indicating good storage conditions. The mixing time and peak height percentages of the composite flours reduced significantly by the supplementation of <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> into wheat flour. The scores assigned to all the sensory parameters of chapattis and breads affected significantly with the variation in levels of flaxseed supplementation in wheat flours. The scores for overall acceptability, aroma and taste of chapattis decreased when prepared and tested at 0, 30 and 60 days of flours storage. The scores assigned to all {{the internal and external}} sensory attributes of breads decreased by increasing the level of flaxseed supplementation in straight grade flour. The 16 % defatted and 12 % full fat flaxseed flours were found the maximum acceptable levels for replacement in chapattis, while in breads 12 % replacements of both flaxseed flours resulted in acceptable product. Total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibers, essential amino acid contents and linolenic acid content of chapattis and breads are improved substantially due to the supplementation of partially defatted <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> or full fat <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> into wheat flour. True digestibility, NPU, BV and PER of chapattis and breads improved by the supplementation of <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour.</b> The highest values of TD (84. 6), PER (1. 87), NPU (54. 65) and BV (64. 6) were recorded in rats group fed on diets prepared from chapattis containing 16 % partially defatted <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> (PDF). Total cholesterol, glucose, LDL-C and triglyceride contents in rats’ serum decreased due to inclusion of flaxseed supplemented chapattis and breads in their diets. The concentration of HDL improved in the serum of rats fed on diets prepared from flaxseed supplemented chapattis and breads. The diets based on chapattis supplemented with 16 % PDF contributed to reduce the serum glucose of rats by 18. 16 %, cholesterol by 15. 33 %, triglycerides by 7. 45 % and LDL by 18. 26 %.

As modificaÃÃes mais significativas na composiÃÃo dos biscoitos foram verificadas nos teores de lipÃdios e proteÃnas. Todos os {{crackers}} com adiÃÃo de farinha de linhaÃa apresentaram-se mais escuros que o CSL. A aceitabilidade dos crackers foi avaliada por 96 provadores, quanto Ã aparÃncia, cor, sabor, textura, aceitaÃÃo geral, intenÃÃo de compra e escala do ideal para dureza. Houve diferenÃa significativa (p< 0, 05) para todos os atributos, entre as formulaÃÃes, com exceÃÃo das formulaÃÃes CSL e CL 20. Os resultados de intenÃÃo de compra sugeriram que os consumidores tiveram maior interesse na aquisiÃÃo dos crackers com adiÃÃo de 15 % de farinha de linhaÃa. A adiÃÃo de farinha de linhaÃa provocou aumento significativo nos teores de proteÃnas, sais minerais e fibras, tornando os biscoitos em um produto com alto teor de fibra alimentar. In {{the last}} decade the consumption of flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) is increasing and awaking the interest of many searchers because it contains functional compounds as alphalinolenic acid, lignans and fibers related to its beneficial potential for health. Several studies confirmed the benefits of food enriched with flaxseed in prevention and treatment of several diseases as vascular disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, lupus, symptoms of menopause and post menopause, constipation, etc. The purpose of this work was to develop biscuits like cracker, added 10 %, 15 % and 20 % of <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> (CL 10, CL 15 and CL 20) from the formulation without addition of <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> (CSL) and evaluate its physical, chemical, instrumental, rheological and sensory characteristics. The <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> provoked significant changes in rheology of dough, improving the thickness, length and width parameters of crackers. The Tuckey test showed that the humidity of sample CL 10 didnât differ to the level (p< 0, 5) of crackers CSL, CL 15 and CL 20, however the CSL cracker differed of CL 15 and CL 20 crackers. The most meaningful changes {{in the composition of}} crackers were verified in lipids and protein content.

40|$|Summary. The optimal {{parameters}} of milling and fractionation of flaxseeds were substantiated. It {{was found that}} the hull fraction with the highest content of lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside SDG was obtained when flaxseeds were grinded using a rotatory impact continuous operation mill at the rotation 1380 - 1640 rpm. Studies have shown that with the increasing of the rotor speed the number of unbriken seeds decreased. However, {{due to the fact that}} the shells are crushed more, they become more difficult to separate from the cotyledons. For identification and quantification of SDG the HPLC-MS method was used. It is found that the optimum separation membranes and cotyledon fraction occurs at sifting milled seeds sequentially through the sieves having meshes of 1 and 0. 5 mm. The technology of industrial production of lignans-containing fraction and flour on the basis of flaxseeds processing were proposed. This technology includes milling flaxseeds at the rotation 1380 - 1640 rpm, with subsequent 2 % silicon dioxide addition and stepwise sieving using sieves with the mesh size 2 mm. To use a fraction membranes high in lignans as raw material for biologically active additives to food it needed additional enforcement-ground to a size not more than 0. 4 mm (technological features of capsulation).

This happening due the public knowledge of these productâs benefits. The flaxseed (Linum usitatissimun L.) has been considerated a functional ingredient of great importance. This importance is due its functional combinations such as linolenic acid, lignans and fibers that are potentially beneficial to our health. Several researches evidence the positive effects of adding flaxseed to the food to the combat and prevention of many diseases, for example: cancer, constipation, menopause, disease cardiovascular, among others. The passion fruit flour has demonstrated its ability to reduce the bad cholesterol (LDL) and to increase the good cholesterol (HDL). Therefore, the passion fruit flour has been pointed out as an auxiliary in the treatment of diabetes and weight reduction. Thus, this research work has the purpose of developing bread with functional characteristics. We have formulated four experiments. The first one, the standard bread (FP), without the addition of flaxseed and passion fruit flour.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIBACKGROUND: Flaxseed is an {{important}} source of lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) and its aglycone, secoisolariciresinol (SECO). These phenolic compounds can be metabolized to the mammalian lignans enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone (EL) by human intestinal microflora. Flaxseed lignans are known for their potential health benefits, which are attributed to their antioxidant and phytoestrogenic properties. The focus {{of this study was to}} determine the bioaccessibility of plant and mammalian lignans in whole flaxseed (WF) and <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> (FF) throughout the entire digestive process. Moreover, themetabolic activity of intestinalmicroflora was evaluated. RESULTS: A single-batch in vitro simulation of the digestive process was performed, including fermentation by the intestinal microflora in the colon. Bioaccessibility was calculated as (free lignan) /(total lignan). In digested WF, the bioaccessibility values of SECO, ED and EL were 0. 75 %, 1. 56 % and 1. 23 %, respectively. Conversely, in digested FF, the bioaccessibility values of SDG, ED and EL were 2. 06 %, 2. 72 % and 1. 04 %, respectively. The anaerobic count and short-chain fatty acids indicate that bacteria survival and carbohydrate fermentation occurred. CONCLUSION: The contents of both SDG and ED were significantly higher in digested FF than in digestedWF. FF facilitated the action of intestinal bacteria to release SDG andmetabolize ED.

40|$|Flaxseed is {{the richest}} plant {{source of the}} lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). In flaxseed, SDG exists in an {{oligomeric}} structure with 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl glutaric acid (HMGA) forming a phenolic complex together with p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid glucosides and herbacetin diglucoside (HDG). Epidemiological and animal studies indicate protective effects of flaxseed and SDG towards hormone-dependent cancers and cardiovascular diseases, and reducing effect toward cholesterol levels in blood. Knowledge about the structural features and properties of the phenolic complex are required to further understand bioavailability, bioconversion and bioactivity of flaxseed lignans in humans and animals, the biosynthesis in flaxseed, as well as if it may affect technology and quality of food products containing flaxseed or the phenolic complex. A new fast and simple high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed for analysing secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), p-coumaric acid glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside, based on direct hydrolysis of defatted <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> using alkali. Variations in SDG, p-coumaric acid glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside content were reported in flaxseed samples and bread products containing flaxseed.

Foi elaborado um delineamento de misturas com diferentes mesclas de farinha pré-gelatinizada de arroz e linhaça, farinha de arroz e farinha de linhaça desengordurada e as características de cozimento (tempo ótimo de cozimento, aumento de massa, perda de sólidos) e perfil de textura (firmeza e pegajosidade) foram analisadas por meio de diagramas triangulares de mistura. Observou-se que a adição de 20 g de farinha de linhaça em 80 g de farinha de arroz elevou (p> 0, 05) os valores de cinzas, proteínas, lipídios, fibra alimentar total, solúvel e insolúvel e diminuiu o valor energético total e de carboidratos em relação à farinha de arroz. Ocorreu aumento do índice de solubilidade e absorção de água e capacidade de absorção de óleo após extrusão. Os maiores valores de índice de solubilidade [21, 36 g (100 g) - 1] e absorção de água [10, 23 g de gel (g de matéria seca) - 1]e menores de capacidade de absorção em óleo [2, 18 g de gel (g de matéria seca) - 1] foram encontrados nas maiores umidades e menores temperaturas de extrusão estudadas. Os parâmetros de cor também foram afetados pelas condições do processo, tornando as farinhas mais escuras (diminuição de L*), com maior tendência para os tons de vermelho e amarelo (aumento de a* e b*).

The highest values of solubility index [21. 36 g (100 g) - 1] and water absorption [10. 23 g of gel (g dry mass) - 1] and lower oil absorption capacity [2. 18 g of gel (g dry mass) - 1] were found in higher humidity and lower extrusion temperatures studied. The color parameters were also affected by process conditions, making the darker flour (decrease of L *), with a tendency to various shades of red and yellow (increased a * and b *). The rice flour, flax and mixed rice and raw linseed differed (p < 0. 05) compared to the pasta characteristics. The addition of flaxseed meal decreased the peak viscosity, final viscosity and the tendency to retrogradation of rice – flaxseed blend compared with rice flour. The pre-gelatinized flours showed an increase in viscosity at cold and viscosity breakdown, while there was a decrease in peak viscosity, final viscosity and tendency to retrograde compared to rice – flaxseed blend, rice and <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour,</b> indicating that the process extrusion affects the characteristics of the pre-gelatinized flour. The ideal condition for the production of pre-gelatinized flour for pasta production is at a temperature of 111. 3 ° C and humidity in 18. 8 g (100 g) - 1. All experimental formulations of pasta are within the limits of quality for mass increase and loss of solids. Quality parameters of cooking, it was observed that the pasta is more desirable one with intermediate levels of pre-gelatinized flour [43 g (100 g) - 1], rice [47 g (100 g) - 1], and linseed [10 g (100 g) - 1], which may be characterized as food source of fiber.

Hidrolisados protéicos de diferentes fontes têm sido estudados por seu potencial antioxidante. A atuação antioxidante da proteína, na maioria das vezes, encontra-se limitada devido à conformação espacial, que concentra resíduos capazes de neutralizar radicais livres no {{interior}} da molécula, dificultando o acesso das espécies reativas aos centros nucleofílicos. A hidrólise da proteína contribui para aumentar a exposição desses resíduos de aminoácidos, aumentando sua atuação como antioxidante. Compostos fenólicos podem estar presentes em hidrolisados proteicos de origem vegetal, devido a sua associação com as proteínas. Métodos {{in vitro}} que simulam as condições do trato gastrointestinal permitem estudar como a digestão pode interferir na atividade antioxidante de peptídeos e compostos fenólicos. O presente trabalho tem como objetivos obter hidrolisados proteicos com capacidade antioxidante a partir da farinha de linhaça e avaliar o efeito da digestão in vitro pode interferir nessa atividade. A farinha de linhaça marrom foi desengordurada, obtendo-se a farinha de linhaça marrom desengordurada (FLMD). O concentrado proteico de linhaça (CPL) foi obtido a partir da FLMD por extração alcalina e precipitação no ponto isoelétrico seguida de neutralização. Para obtenção dos hidrolisados proteicos (HPL), a partir do CPL, com Alcalase, foi realizado um delineamento composto central rotacional (DCCR) 2 ². As variáveis independentes foram pH que variou entre 7, 5 a 9, 5 e relação enzima: substrato (E:S) que variou de 1 : 150 a 1 : 30. As variáveis dependentes foram grau de hidrólise (GH), teor de substâncias redutoras do reagente de Folin-Ciocalteau e atividade antioxidante, determinada por FRAP e ORAC. Teor de substâncias redutoras e atividade antioxidante foram avaliados a partir dos extratos aquosos e metanólico (metanol 70 %). Os hidrolisados de maior atividade antioxidante, a FLMD e o CPL foram submetidos à digestão in vitro, simulando as condições da digestão gastrintestinal. As amostras antes e após a digestão in vitro foram caracterizadas por eletroforese em sistema SDS-PAGE Tricina e por cromatografia liquida de alta eficiência de fase reversa (HPLC- RP). O teor de substâncias redutoras e da atividade antioxidante das amostras FLMD, CPL e HPL foram avaliados antes e após a digestão in vitro. As condições ótimas para obtenção de HPL de maior GH (21, 0 %) são pH entre 7, 5 e 8, 0 e E:S entre 1 : 60 e 1 : 30, indicando que a faixa de pH ótimo da enzima e a alta E:S favorecem maior hidrólise do CPL. Para obtenção de HPL com maior teor de substâncias redutoras para os extratos aquoso (24 mg EAG/ g HPL) e metanólico (20 mg EAG/ g HPL) as condições ótimas são pH ~ 8, 5 /E:S 1 : 30. Este resultado parece estar relacionado à liberação de compostos fenólicos ligados a proteína e também de peptídeos durante a hidrólise. Açúcares e aminoácidos aromáticos presentes no hidrolisado podem interferir na reação e superestimar o teor de fenóis dos HPL. A maior atividade antioxidante determinada pelo método de FRAP para o extrato aquoso (42 mg SF/ g HPL) se dá nas condições de pH ~ 9, 5 /E:S ~ 1 : 150 e para o extrato metanólico (40 mg SF/ g HPL) pH entre 8, 5 e 9, 0 /E:S entre 1 : 90 a 1 : 150. Para o método de ORAC, as condições ótimas para maior atividade antioxidante no extrato aquoso (300 µmol TE/ g HPL) são pH entre 7, 5 a 9, 5 /E:S ~ 1 : 30 ou ~ 1 : 150 e para o extrato metanólico (330 µmol TE/ g HPL) são pH ~ 8, 5 /E:S entre 1 : 150 e 1 : 30. Os hidrolisados de maior atividade antioxidante foram os obtidos em pH 8, 5 /E:S 1 : 90, e em pH 9, 2 /E:S 1 : 133 denominados HPL 0 e HPL 3, respectivamente. Para a FLMD, CPL e os hidrolisados, após a digestão in vitro, observou-se que o teor de substâncias redutoras totais aumentou (9 a 20 vezes) para todas as amostras. O teor de substâncias redutoras do CPL (~ 24 mg EAG/ g amostra), em ambos os extratos, após a digestão in vitro se igualou ao teor dos hidrolisados (~ 23 mg EAG/ g amostra). Este resultado sugere que tanto a hidrólise com Alcalase quanto o processo digestório liberam compostos redutores, dentre eles fenólicos da proteína de linhaça. A atividade antioxidante dos extratos de FLMD e CPL, determinada por FRAP, também aumentou (de 3 a 10 vezes) após a digestão, mas não se igualou à atividade antioxidante dos hidrolisados (48 mg SF/g amostra). No entanto, o CPL apresentou atividade antioxidante determinada por ORAC semelhante à dos hidrolisados no extrato aquoso (~ 420, 24 µmol TE/ g amostra) e 10 % maior que o encontrado para os hidrolisados (~ 365 µmol TE/ g amostra) no extrato metanólico. Após a digestão in vitro, os hidrolisados apresentaram a maior atividade antioxidante medida por FRAP (50 mg SF/ g amostra), e o CPL, a maior atividade determinada pelo método de ORAC (~ 430 µmol TE/ g amostra). Estes resultados sugerem o processo digestório é tão ou mais eficiente que a Alcalase em liberar os compostos com atividade redutora no CPL. Uma vez que a metodologia de determinação da atividade antioxidante por ORAC tem maior proximidade com o mecanismo de oxirredução que ocorre in vivo, esses resultados sugerem o uso do CPL como melhor produto protéico da linhaça com maior potencial antioxidante para a formulação de nutracêuticos e alimentos funcionaisAbstract: There are several evidences which indicate {{the role of}} free radicals {{on a series of}} pathological conditions, including aging, cancer, multiple sclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Hydrolysates from different sources have been studied because of their antioxidant potential. The antioxidant activity of the protein, in most cases, is limited due to their conformation, which concentrates residues capable of neutralize free radicals in the molecule¿s core, hampering the access of the reactive species to nucleophilic sites. The protein hydrolysis contributes to increasing the exposure of these amino acid residues, increasing their role as antioxidants. Phenolic compounds may also be present in vegetable protein hydrolysates because of their association with proteins. In vitro methods that simulate the conditions of the gastrointestinal digestion are an important way to evaluate how the digestion affects the antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds and peptides. This study aims at obtaining hydrolysates with antioxidant capacity from defatted <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> and evaluate the effect of the in vitro digestion on this activity. The brown <b>flaxseed</b> <b>flour</b> was defatted, resulting in the brown defatted flaxseed meal (BDFM). The flaxseed protein concentrate (FPC) was obtained from the BDFM by alkaline extraction and precipitation at the isoelectric point followed by neutralization. To obtain the flaxseed protein hydrolysates (FPL), using FPC and Alcalase, a central composite rotational design (DCCR) was performed. The independent variables were pH ranging from 7. 5 to 9. 5 and enzyme: substrate ratio (E: S) that ranged from 1 : 150 to 1 : 30. The dependent variables were the degree of hydrolysis (DH), total phenolic content and antioxidant activity, determined by FRAP and ORAC. Phenolic and antioxidant activity were evaluated from the aqueous and methanol (70 % methanol). The hydrolysates with the highest antioxidant activity, the CPL FLMD were submitted to the in vitro digestion. The samples obtained before and after the in vitro digestion were characterized by electrophoresis SDS-PAGE- tricine and HPLC. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of FLMD, CPL and HPL were evaluated before and after in vitro digestion. The optimum conditions to obtain HPL with the highest GDH (21. 0 %) are pH (7. 5 - 8) and E:S ratio (1 : 60 - 1 : 30), which indicates that the Alcalase optimum pH and highest E:S ratio collaborates to highest hydrolysis of CPL. To obtain HPL with higher content of Folin-Ciocalteau reducing compounds content in aqueous (EAG 24 mg / g HPL) and methanol (20 mg EAG / g HPL) extracts, the optimum conditions were pH ~ 8. 5 / E: S 1 : 30. This result seems {{to be related to the}} release of phenolic compounds bound to protein and also of peptides during hydrolysis. The highest antioxidant activity determined by the FRAP method in the aqueous extract (42 mg SF / g HPL) occurs under pH ~ 9. 5 / E: S ~ 1 : 150 and the methanol extract (40 mg SF / g HPL) pH 8. 5 - 9. 0 / E: S 1 : 90 - 1 : 150. For the ORAC method, optimum conditions for increased antioxidant activity in aqueous extract (300 µmol TE / g HPL) are pH 7. 5 - 9. 5 / E: S ~ 1 : 30 or 1 : 150 and the methanol extract (330 µmol TE / g HPL) are pH ~ 8. 5 / E: S 1 : 30 - 1 : 150. The hydrolysates with the highest antioxidant activities were obtained at pH 8. 5 / E: S 1 : 90, and at pH 9. 2 / E: S 1 : 133 denominated HPL) and HPL 3, respectively. For FLMD, CPL and hydrolysates, after in vitro digestion, the content increased (9 - 20 times) for all samples. The Folin-Ciocalteau reducing capacity of the CPL (EAG ~ 24 mg / g sample) in both extracts after in vitro digestion equaled the content of hydrolysates (EAG ~ 23 mg / g sample). This result suggests that both hydrolysis with Alcalase and the digestion process are able to release phenolic compounds from the flaxseed products. The antioxidant activity of extracts of FLMD, CPL determined by FRAP, also increased (from 3 to 10 times) after digestion, but did not reached the antioxidant activity of hydrolysates (48 mg SF / g sample). However, when the activity was determined by ORAC, the FPC showed value similar to the hydrolysates, measured on the aqueous extract (~ 420. 24 µmol TE / g sample) and 10 % higher than on the methanol extract (~ 365 µmol TE / g sample). After in vitro digestion, hydrolysates showed the highest antioxidant activity measured by FRAP (SF 50 mg / g sample), and the FPC, the highest activity determined by ORAC method (~ 430 micromol TE / g sample). These results suggest that digestive process are equally or more effective than Alcalase in releasing peptides and phenolic compounds present in the FPC. Since the methodology for determining the antioxidant activity by ORAC utilizes a biologically relevant radical source, these results suggest the use of FPC as the best protein product of flaxseed with potential antioxidant in the formulation of nutraceuticals and functional food...|$|E
