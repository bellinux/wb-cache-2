5|$|The {{presence}} of foreign residents in Cortina d'Ampezzo <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> recent phenomenon, accounting {{for only a}} small number of inhabitants in what in any case <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> small town. There are 298 resident foreigners in the town, representing 4.9% of the total population. This compares with 7.0% in the town Belluno, 6.4% in the entire province of Belluno, and 10.2% in the Veneto region.|$|E

5|$|Carbon is ordinarily {{classified}} as a nonmetal but has some metallic properties and is occasionally {{classified as}} a metalloid. Hexagonal graphitic carbon (graphite) is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> good electrical conductor. Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer comprises carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice arrangement. The layers are stacked together and held loosely by van der Waals forces and delocalized valence electrons.|$|E
5|$|Ferrite (α-iron) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> {{soft metal}} that can {{dissolve}} {{only a small}} concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910°C). Austenite (γ-iron) is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146°C). This form of iron {{is used in the}} type of stainless steel used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} {{applications}} gas metal {{arc welding}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> simple welding process to learn requiring no more than a week or two to master basic welding technique. Even when welding is performed by well-trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors. All GMAW is dangerous, though perhaps less so than some other welding methods, such as shielded metal arc welding.|$|E

5|$|Selenium, and {{possibly}} boron, silicon, arsenic and tellurium, plus the organogen elements are sometimes categorized together as other nonmetals, as they fall outside the halogens and noble gases. The first {{five of these}} (Se; B, Si, As, Te) differ from the organogens: none are universally required for life; arsenic is notoriously poisonous; and tellurium hydride <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> strong, rather than weak, acidic hydride.|$|E
5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> recent {{subfield}} of sociology, compared to more traditional subfields such as sociology of work, sociology of the family, and sociology of education: it saw {{most of its}} development {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. Until then, leisure had often been seen as a relatively unimportant, minor feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.|$|E

The species is known to develop mycorrhizal associations with Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> common and widely distributed species in North America. The mushroom {{has been found in}} boreal forests and high-elevation forests of the Southern Appalachians, associated with the tree genera Picea, Abies, and Pinus. In California, it has been noted to commonly co-occur with L.fragilis, L.rubrilacteus, Russula emetica, and R.cremoricolor.|$|E
5|$|When {{dissolved}} in water, iron(III) chloride undergoes hydrolysis and gives off heat in an exothermic reaction. The resulting brown, acidic, and corrosive solution {{is used as}} a flocculant in sewage treatment and drinking water production, and as an etchant for copper-based metals in printed circuit boards. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> strong Lewis acid, and it {{is used as a}} catalyst in organic synthesis.|$|E
5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect it when searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, has only been observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related, suggesting that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> recent innovation.|$|E

5|$|NGC 1664 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> large open cluster, with a {{diameter}} of 18 arcminutes, and moderately bright, with a magnitude of 7.6, comparable to several other open clusters in Auriga. One open cluster with a similar magnitude is NGC 1778, with a magnitude of 7.7. This small cluster has {{a diameter}} of 7 arcminutes and contains 25 stars. NGC 1857, a small cluster, is slightly brighter at magnitude 7.0. It has {{a diameter of}} 6 arcminutes and contains 40 stars, making it far more concentrated than the similar-sized NGC 1778. Far dimmer than the other open clusters is NGC 2126 at magnitude 10.2. Despite its dimness, NGC 2126 is as concentrated as NGC 1857, having 40 stars in a diameter of 6 arcminutes.|$|E
5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too large to store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> common cause of program errors. Such overflow bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which {{are less likely to be}} used in validation tests. One especially notable such error was the Y2K bug, where overflow errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> inactive {{species that}} spends {{long periods of}} time buried motionless in sediment. It feeds primarily on polychaete worms (particularly those of the family Maldanidae) and crustaceans (including amphipods, decapods, and tanaids). Nematodes and sipunculids may also be consumed on rare occasions. Juvenile rays consume polychaetes and crustaceans in roughly equal proportions, while adults consume mostly polychaetes. This dietary shift may reflect increasing experience with age, as polychaetes are burrowing animals and thus more difficult to locate and capture than crustaceans. Like other members of its family, the Tasmanian numbfish can defend itself with a modest electric shock. Its predators include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). The tapeworm Anthobothrium hickmani is a parasite of this species.|$|E

5|$|The black-throated gray warbler breeds in open {{coniferous}} {{and mixed}} forest with a brushy understory, in dry open oak forests, and in chaparral and other scrubland. It is particularly associated with pinyon pines, junipers, and oaks. It migrates {{to the south}} late in the fall, returning north in mid-spring. While migrating, it forages in any woodland or scrub it passes through. In its wintering grounds, it occurs in dry woodland and tall scrub. Though its status is not well known, {{it does not appear}} to be seriously threatened by habitat destruction or other human activities, unlike many migratory warblers. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> common bird, among the most common in some localities. Because it is common and not in rapid decline, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The common {{thresher}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> robust shark with a torpedo-shaped {{trunk and}} a short, broad head. The dorsal {{profile of the}} head curves evenly down to the pointed, conical snout. The eyes are moderately large and lack nictitating membranes. The small mouth is arched and, unlike in other thresher sharks, has furrows at the corners. There are 32-53 upper and 25-50 lower tooth rows; the teeth are small, triangular, and smooth-edged, lacking lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with {{the fourth and fifth}} pairs located over the pectoral fin bases.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia inflorescences {{attract a}} variety of birds to the garden. Tough enough {{to be used as}} a street plant in parts of Sydney, B.ericifolia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> easy plant to grow in the {{conditions}} it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, like most eastern banksias As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia ericifolia is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high pH. This can happen especially where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
