40|$|The article {{deals with}} the notion of danger in {{criminal}} law, which forms a basis for the legislator to construct dogmatic figures that serve the purpose of penalization of behaviour which is preliminary <b>to</b> <b>infringement</b> of intangible assets. Danger is a phenomenon that exists in objective reality (there is or there is not a certain phenomenon). However, for full characteristics of danger, a subject’s assessment of the phenomenon is indispensable, which leads to a conclusion that danger is a subjective phenomenon. Danger is a phenomenon connected with existing probability of infringement of intangible assets. This probability must exceed a certain threshold of intensification (e. g. it must be substantial or high). It is not important for the existence of danger whether there has been an infringement of an intangible asset or not (an infringement can occur, but does not have <b>to).</b> <b>Infringement</b> of an intangible asset does not have to follow previous danger, and danger does not have <b>to</b> result in <b>infringement</b> of an intangible asset...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} reports from 1935 {{to the present}} {{addressing}} administrative and judicial decision making about Patents Act 1990 (Cth) patents. In particular the article addresses the review of examination (and modified examination), opposition, re-examination and revocation (including as a cross-claim <b>to</b> <b>infringement)</b> decisions under the Act and whether the Commissioner of Patents' decisions {{should be subject to}} "merits review" by a generalist administrative tribunal. The article concludes that the role of the Federal Court in dealing with revocation as a cross-claim <b>to</b> <b>infringement</b> proceedings (exercising judicial powers) needs to be resolved. However, considerable potential to minimise the cost, complexity, timeliness, and uncertainty of outcomes of patent decisions exists in changes to the Commissioner's practices in examining patent applications and the statutory framework for reconsidering the Commissioner's decisions.
