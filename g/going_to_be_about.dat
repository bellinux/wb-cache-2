500|$|Senior writer Maurice Hurley {{left at the}} end {{of season}} two, and Michael I. Wagner was brought onto the show by {{executive}} producer Rick Berman. Wagner's tenure was brief, lasting three weeks, and he recommended Michael Piller to replace him. Wagner and Piller had previously worked together on the 1988 American television series Probe. Piller's agent had advised him not to join Star Trek as he would be [...] "pigeon-holed as a freelance writer", but he ignored the advice. He would also look at leaving {{at the end of}} the season, but stayed after Berman and show creator Gene Roddenberry convinced him. Piller wrote the episode that opened the season, [...] "" [...] and took over as executive producer from [...] "The Bonding" [...] onwards. He explained to the writing staff that there was two requirements for every episode, saying that [...] "every episode is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> a character's growth.

500|$|Continuing {{the stories}} about the {{characters}} living in Newport Beach, California, the second season would be [...] "no longer about Ryan's past; now it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> Ryan's future", said Josh Schwartz, The O.C.s creator. Schwartz added that this season would [...] "slow down the storytelling a little bit (...) and evolve the characters". The focus of the series was on the romantic developments between Ryan and Marissa, and Seth and Summer, while Sandy and Kirsten face choices that could ruin their 20-year marriage, Julie's past comes back to haunt her, and Ryan's ex-con brother Trey gives living in Newport a try. The season was released on DVD as a seven-disc boxed set under the title The O.C.: The Complete Second Season on August 23, 2005 by Warner Bros. Home Video. On September 7, 2008 the season became available to purchase for registered users of the US iTunes Store. In the United Kingdom the season premiered January 11, 2005 on Channel 4. In Canada the season aired on CTV Television Network and in Australia it was broadcast by Network Ten.|$|E
500|$|Development on Secret of Evermore {{began in}} early 1994 at Square Soft, the Redmond, Washington {{office of the}} Japanese parent company Square. The concept of a boy {{traveling}} with his dog through a world based on cheesy B movies was dictated from overseas, whereupon Square Soft began work on the detailed storyline. This resulted in popular culture references and dialog that are distinctly American for a mainstream console RPG. The game's associate producer and writer, George Sinfield, decided that making such references would be familiar to American players. The working title for the game was [...] "Vex and the Mezmers." [...] Producer Alan Weiss originally had {{the concept of a}} group of magic users who [...] "could tell dream stories and transport the listeners into the experience, virtually. During one of these storytelling sessions, Vex got trapped in one of these worlds and started to corrupt the dreams. The game was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> finding Vex and defeating him." [...] But when George Sinfield asked the name be changed, the studio had a naming competition which resulted in Secret of Evermore.|$|E

According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> that woman, you know when you have that moment when you realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video.

500|$|The Wrath of Khan {{features}} several recurring themes, including death, resurrection, {{and growing}} old. Upon writing his script, Meyer hit upon {{a link between}} Spock's death {{and the age of}} the characters. [...] "This {{was going to be a}} story in which Spock died, so it was going to be a story about death, and it was only a short hop, skip, and a jump to realize that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> old age and friendship," [...] Meyer said. [...] "I don't think that any of [...] scripts were about old age, friendship, and death." [...] In keeping with the theme of death and rebirth symbolized by Spock's sacrifice and the Genesis Device, Meyer wanted to call the film The Undiscovered Country, in reference to Prince Hamlet's description of death in William Shakespeare's Hamlet, but the title was changed during editing without his knowledge. Meyer disliked Wrath of Khan, but it was chosen because the preferred Vengeance of Khan conflicted with Lucasfilm's forthcoming Revenge of the Jedi (renamed Return of the Jedi late in production).|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry Wilmore, making it his first and only writing {{contribution}} to the series. Wilmore had previously guest starred in the series as Mr. Brown, the diversity instructor who gives a presentation to the office in the first season episode [...] "Diversity Day". The episode was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> [...] "weight loss" [...] and {{be one of the}} very first episodes of the second season aired. However, after [...] "The Dundies" [...] and [...] "The Fire", series creator and developer Greg Daniels decided to hold the episode off and combine it with elements of [...] "The Client". When [...] "Performance Review" [...] was being formulated, Wilmore had [...] "four different ideas that were scrunched together to make an episode". One of the ideas was on a card that said [...] "Thursday Friday". After inquiring about the meaning, Wilmore loved the idea and noted that it [...] "would be great" [...] in the episode and a [...] "real funny thing to pull on Dwight". Originally, the episode contained a subplot wherein Pam attempts to get a new chair approved by Michael. The scenes, in fact, were shot, but were never aired.|$|E

[...] Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, [...] "Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> if he executed his power fairly...

2500|$|The {{second season}} of The O.C. {{continues}} {{to follow the}} tumultuous romantic relationships between Ryan and Marissa, Seth and Summer, and Sandy and Kirsten. Josh Schwartz, the show's creator, stated that in Season 2, the show would [...] "no longer be about Ryan's past; now it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> Ryan's future," [...] and that this season would [...] "slow down the storytelling a little bit ... and evolve the characters." [...] For example, the story closely follows Ryan in his advanced physics class, where tension is created between him and another student, Lindsay, who presumes that Ryan will be useless as a lab partner, who thus prevents him from contributing to the work that must be submitted. Ryan's character begins to grow when he stands up to Lindsay and convinces her {{to allow him to}} contribute, forcing them to work together to complete the assignment. They later become involved romantically, creating extreme complications and relational shifts amongst the now [...] "Cooper-Nichol" [...] family. The Bait Shop becomes a prominent social destination for the teenage characters. A number of recurring characters are introduced, such as D.J., Lindsay Gardner, Zach Stevens, and Alex Kelly, with whom the main characters form a variety of relationships. Ryan's brother, Trey Atwood, gets out of jail and threatens to bring Ryan's old life into his new one. Sandy and Kirsten also face new conflicts after drifting apart during the summer. Season 2 ends with Marissa shooting Trey after Ryan confronts him for attempting to sexually assault Marissa.|$|E
2500|$|... "Kim" [...] was {{the first}} song the rapper {{recorded}} for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote [...] "Kim" [...] {{at a time in}} which {{he and his wife were}} separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. [...] " [...] The song [...] "Stan" [...] was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's [...] "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for [...] "Stan" [...] differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: [...] "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about.</b> [...] " [...] Dido later heard [...] "Stan" [...] and enjoyed it, and observed, [...] "I got this letter out of the blue one day.
