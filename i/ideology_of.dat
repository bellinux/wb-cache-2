5|$|A {{political}} party {{known as the}} South Indian Libertarian Federation (commonly referred to as Justice Party) was founded in 1916, principally to oppose {{the economic and political}} power of the Brahmin groups. The party's goal was to render social justice to the non-Brahmin groups. To gain the support of the masses, non-Brahmin politicians began propagating an <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> equality among non-Brahmin castes. Brahmanical priesthood and Sanskritic social class-value hierarchy were blamed for the existence of inequalities among non-Brahmin caste groups.|$|E

50|$|These {{movements}} largely distanced {{themselves from}} political parties, {{or tried to}} cut across the <b>ideologies</b> <b>of</b> the political parties.

5|$|Another {{element in}} the <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> the party was a populist fight against the {{political}} establishment, often manifested through political scandals which flourished in 1990s Belgium; including corruption, food and even pedophile scandals. These included the Agusta scandal and the Marc Dutroux affair. The usual suspects were politicians in the three traditional party families; especially the francophone parties.|$|E
5|$|John Ralston Saul {{expressed}} the view in The Unconscious Civilization that in contemporary developed nations {{many people have}} acquiesced in turning over their {{sense of right and}} wrong, their critical conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> the free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.|$|E
5|$|Largely {{concerned}} with gender issues, Midas {{comments on the}} definitions of femininity and masculinity {{in the early nineteenth}} century and the developing <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> separate spheres which encouraged women to restrict themselves to domestic affairs and men to political affairs. Part of the Romantic interest in rewriting classical myths, Midas focuses on challenging patriarchy and satirising the unbounded accumulation of wealth.|$|E

5|$|Most generally, State Shinto {{refers to}} any use of Shinto {{practices}} {{incorporated into the}} national ideology during the Meiji period starting in 1868. It {{is often described as}} any state-supported, Shinto-inspired ideology or practice intended to inspire national integration, unity, and loyalty. State Shinto is also understood to refer to the state rituals and <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> Emperor-worship, which was not a traditional emphasis of Shinto — of the 124 Japanese emperors, only 20 have dedicated shrines.|$|E
5|$|Periyar was {{a radical}} {{advocate}} of anti-Brahmanism. Periyar's <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> anti-Brahmanism is quite often confused as being anti-Brahmin. Brahmanism is accepting social inequality based on birth. Even a non-Brahmin who supports inequality based on caste {{was seen as}} a supporter of brahmanism. Periyar called on both Brahmins and non-Brahmins to shun brahmanism.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> Nazism brought {{together}} elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics, and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism {{with the goal}} of obtaining more Lebensraum (living space) for the Germanic people. Nazi Germany attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or kill the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the Aryan master race.|$|E

5|$|While Baird {{had been}} {{associated}} with red tories such as Timbrell and Beatty, he became associated with the conservative <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> the Mike Harris-led Ontario PC party upon entering provincial politics. He was first elected to the Ontario legislature in 1995, defeating Liberal incumbent Hans Daigeler in the Ottawa-area riding of Nepean. The youngest member of the legislature, Baird was appointed parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Labour on July 13, 1995.|$|E
5|$|After {{violations}} of the 1933 Reichskonkordat between the Church and Nazi Germany, Pope Pius XI issued the 1937 encyclical Mit brennender Sorge which publicly condemned the Nazis' persecution of the Church and their <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> neopaganism and racial superiority. The Church condemned the 1939 invasion of Poland that started World War II and other subsequent wartime Nazi invasions. Thousands of Catholic priests, nuns and brothers were imprisoned and murdered throughout the countries occupied by the Nazis, including Saints Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein. While Pope Pius XII has been credited with helping to save {{hundreds of thousands of}} Jews in the Holocaust, the Church has also been accused of encouraging centuries of antisemitism and not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the newly}} formed BJP was {{technically}} distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> Gandhian Socialism. This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984. The assassination of Indira Gandhi {{a few months earlier}} resulted in a wave of support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.|$|E

50|$|Immediately {{below the}} British, were the mulattoes, a mixed-race group {{resulting}} from unions between, generally, white European males and enslaved African women, {{many of which}} took place in the years before the expansion of enslaved African population. Mulattoes were lighter in shade than the masses of Africans. Some white fathers had their sons educated or trained in crafts. They sometimes benefited them in other ways, which {{led to the development of}} a separate class. Mulattoes gradually distinguished themselves from the masses of enslaved Africans. They developed complex <b>ideologies</b> <b>of</b> shade to legitimate their claims to higher status. These <b>ideologies</b> <b>of</b> shade paralleled in many ways British <b>ideologies</b> <b>of</b> white supremacy.|$|R

5|$|Back in the 1980s, the <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> Hezbollah was {{described}} as radical. It {{is presented in the}} 1985 manifesto. The first objective was fighting against American and Israeli imperialism, freedom of the occupied Southern Lebanon and all other occupied territories. The second objective was to gather all Muslims in the concept of ummah; then Lebanon would continue the 1979 Revolution of Iran. It also declared it would protect all Lebanese communities except the ones which collaborated with Israel, and supported all national movements—Muslim or non-Muslim—throughout the world. The Ideology has been changed, and today Hezbollah is a left-wing political entity focused on social injustice.|$|E
5|$|Christensen {{was born}} as Else Oscher in 1913 in Esbjerg, western Denmark. She became a {{professional}} handweaver and in 1933 moved to Copenhagen. There, she embraced anarcho-syndicalism {{and became a}} follower of the anarcho-syndicalist ideologue Christian Christensen. Exposed to the various competing radical groups on both the far right and far left, she came under the increasing influence of the Strasserite wing within the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark (DNSAP), a group which had embraced the Nazi <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> Germany's Nazi Party. In 1937 she married the woodcarver and unionist Aage Alex Christensen, who had served as the top lieutenant of the DNSAP leader Cay Lembcke. The Christensens became associated with the Strasserite National Bolshevik faction of the party, but Aage {{was part of the}} faction ousted when Fritz Clausen seized control.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1567), the native Chinese <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> Daoism was fully {{sponsored}} at the Ming court, while Tibetan Vajrayana and even Chinese Buddhism were ignored or suppressed. Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people.|$|E

5|$|Izsha is a zerg advisor {{in service}} to Sarah Kerrigan. She is a unique type of zerg; one of a kind. Izsha exemplifies a {{midpoint}} for Kerrigan, standing between Kerrigan's cold rationality and the feral nature of the Swarm. She harkens back to the <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> the Overmind, but is still a rational individual. In earlier times, Kerrigan used her to store her thoughts and plans. On at least one occasion she entrusted Izsha {{with a plan to}} infest a planet using the hyper-evolutionary virus through its water supply. Izsha reunited with Kerrigan following the latter's de-infestation and subsequent return to the Swarm. She served as an advisor, recalling memories from Kerrigan's time as the Queen of Blades, and helping her to reclaim the Swarm while remaining attached to her queen's leviathan.|$|E
5|$|Lassie themes {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} boys and their dogs with the show helping to shape the viewer's understanding of mid-twentieth century American boyhood. Lassie {{was associated with the}} wholesome family values of its period but some parents' groups monitoring television content found cliffhanger plots showing children in danger too intense for very young viewers and objected to some of Timmy's actions which were believed to encourage children to disobey parents. However, Lassie was consistently depicted as caring, nurturing, and responsible with a commitment to family and community, often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs. She was the perfect 'mother' within the American <b>ideology</b> <b>of</b> the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Legalized {{discrimination}} against Jews in Germany began {{immediately after the}} Nazi seizure of power in January 1933.
