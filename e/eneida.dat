Since 2000, the potential causes of amphibian declines in Puerto Rico have been studied, and a synergistic interaction between climate change (increased dry periods) and disease (chytridiomycosis) have been proposed as an explanation for the patterns observed. Recovery efforts for Peltophryne lemur include a captivebreeding program, reintroductions island-wide educational outreach, protection and restoration of existing habitat, and the creation of new breeding ponds. Among reptiles, the first conservation efforts to protect Epicrates inornatus were limited to trying to halt collection and hunting. However, current strategies to preserve the boa include gathering basic biological information, habitat conservation, and educational outreach. Recent efforts for the conservation of Trachemys s. stejnegeri combine three research approaches to clarify the status of local populations: a mark-recapture-release study, field monitoring of reproductive activity (i. e., nocturnal patrolling to identify nesting activity), and field assessment of the potential impact of introduced species, particularly identification of predatory species and exotic turtles. Recovery initiatives for Cyclura stejnegeri include management of invasive mammals, a headstart program for hatchling iguanas, and the assessment of the etiology of a condition causing blindness in adult iguanas. A reforestation project aimed at recovering a local herpetofaunal assemblage after disturbances in a limestone valley in northern Puerto Rico is discussed. As population sizes of common colonizers such as Eleutherodactylus and Anolis increased, larger forest-interior and predatory species like Epicrates inornatus, Alsophis portoricensis and Anolis cuvieri followed. Finally, the Mona Island marine turtle monitoring program is discussed and compared to other similar programs in Puerto Rico. As these and other similar conservation efforts provide scientifically based management recommendations, we hope to succeed in conserving the diverse herpetofauna that characterizes Puerto Rico...|$|R

50|$|Eneida's coquí (Eleutherodactylus eneidae) is {{a species}} of coquí, a small variety of frog endemic to the main island of Puerto Rico and its archipelago. Known as coquí de <b>Eneida</b> in Puerto Rico, this {{amphibian}} is mainly terrestrial. Its average adult size is from 1.0 to 1.2 inches. It {{has a number of}} small warts located across its back and eyelids. Its main color is a light tone of greenish or grayish brown with a yellow tint on its underbelly. They often have a pair of light colored concave lines located on their backs. Their eyes are golden or green colored, generally dark colored with black venal reticulation. Its habitat is located in mountains that are 1,000 to 3,000 feet above sea level. This species seems to have suffered a population reduction, in the process disappearing from areas formerly considered its natural habitat. The reason behind this reduction is under study, and Eneida's coquí has been designated an endangered species until the cause is discovered. This population decrease is not considered to be linked with the loss of its habitat, which has prevented the protection of its habitat.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the group}} {{came into being}} {{during the period of}} Romanticism, it {{retained}} the predominant interests and features of that movement - an interest in folklore and history and a striving for Pan-Slavic unity. Its Slavophilism was noticeable in the use of Old Slavic pseudonyms: Ruslan by Shashkevych, Dalibor by Vahylevych, and Yaroslav by Holovatsky. The group founders as well as other young people united around them were engaged in collecting folk oral literature, studying the history of Ukraine, and writing their own verses and treatises. They emulated the Ukrainians under Russian rule, and were especially influenced by Ivan Kotliarevsky's <b>Eneida</b> (Aeneid). The members of the group maintained that the [...] "Ruthenians" [...] of Galicia, Bukovyna, and Transcarpathia were all part of one Ukrainian people who had their own language, culture, and history. The great importance of their literary collection, Rusalka Dnistrova (The Dniester Nymph, 1836), was in that it was written in the spoken Ukrainian and not in the [...] "learned" [...] yazychiye; it thus initiated the use of vernacular Ukrainian language for literature in the Ukrainian lands in the Habsburg Empire. Because of their populist and national views, the group members suffered harassment by the conservative Ukrainian clergy and Austrian authorities.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{fragmentation}} of the Brazilian modernist movement after the Revolution of 1930, Eugênia went on to defend along with Alvaro Moreyra, Pagú and Oswald de Andrade, leftist positions, actively participating in the Aliança Nacional Libertadora (National Liberation Alliance), consequently being persecuted by the Vargas government. Influenced by Carlos Lacerda, Eugênia and Alvaro affiliate themselves to the Communist Party of Brazil (PCB), and in May 1935 she joined the group of founders of the União Feminina do Brasil (Women's Union of Brazil), an organization promoted by women members or sympathizers of the PCB. Her house at that time had become a meeting place for bohemians and intellectuals, and among the many attendees were Di Cavalcanti, Vinicius de Morais, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Graciliano Ramos and Jorge Amado. In November 1935, after the Communist Conspiracy movement, Eugênia was detained and accused of involvement with the PCB. She remained about four months in the House of Detention on Frei Caneca street, where she shared the cell no. 4 with communist militant Olga Benário Prestes, Maria Werneck de Castro, Nise da Silveira, Armanda Álvaro Alberto and <b>Eneida</b> de Moraes. She was released for lack of evidence {{on the morning of}} February 1, 1936. She then returned to political activism, engaging herself, among other activities, in a campaign for the release of Anita Leocadia, Olga Benário's baby who was born after her deportation to a concentration camp in Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany. In 1937, Álvaro presented to the theater department commission of the Ministry of Education and Culture his plan for the organization of a [...] "Brazilian Dramatic Company", which was approved.

C, a memória da divinização de César se fazia presente, lançando também a expectativa sobre a consecratio do próprio Imperador. No poema épico, o prenúncio da apoteose de Augusto surge na mesma profecia em que Júpiter assegura a Vênus a acolhida de seu filho, Enéias, entre os imortais (VIRGÍLIO, <b>Eneida,</b> I. 259 - 289). Este tema reaparece nas Metamorfoses de Ovídio cujas linhas finais do livro XV retratam a transformação de Júlio César em astro – sidus - e mencionam o dia em que o Princeps deverá receber, nos céus, as preces de seus governados (OVÍDIO, Metamorfoses, XV. 745 - 879). Tendo em vista a instituição do culto imperial, problematizaremos nas obras mencionadas as relações entre mito, memória e poder no Principado. Abstract: By {{the time}} the Aeneid was composed, between the years 29 and 19 BC, {{the memory of the}} divinization of Caesar was present, {{throwing}} the expectation on the Consecratio the Emperor himself. In the epic poem, the harbinger of the apotheosis of Augustus appears in the same prophecy that Jupiter ensures to Venus the reception of her son, Aeneas, among the immortals (VIRGIL, Aeneid, I. 259 - 289). This theme reappears in Ovid's Metamorphoses whose final lines of the fifteenth book portrays the transformation of Julius Caesar in astro - Sidus - and mention the date on which the Princeps should receive in heaven, the prayers of the governed (OVID. Metamorphoses, XV. 745 - 879). In view of the institution of imperial cult, we will investigate in the works listed the relationship between myth, memory and power in the Principate...|$|E
