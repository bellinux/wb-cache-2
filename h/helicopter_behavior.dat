40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{co-design}} of a Networked Control System (NCS). The simulation of a 4 -rotor helicopter using Matlab/Simulink is used as benchmark. The control law of this system is non linear and its observer uses data provided by an Inertial Measurement Unit. The controller and the rotors are interconnected by a Switched Ethernet network. The objective {{of this paper is}} firstly to analyze the effects of perturbations induced by the network on the helicopter control. Secondly, the goal is to tune the levels of Classification of Services (CoS) defined in such a network to minimize the impact of communications on the <b>helicopter</b> <b>behavior.</b> The network is simulated thanks to the TrueTime toolbox. A new TrueTime model enabling to represent the concept of CoS has been developed for achieving this stud...|$|E

40|$|We {{report in}} this paper the {{development}} of a real-time software system for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) helicopter, which consists of an embedded computer onboard and a ground station served by a laptop. The software system for the onboard computer performs multiple tasks including data acquisition and measurement, servo driving, automatic flight control implementation, communications and data logging. The system for the ground station gives a flexible graphical interface monitoring the real-time status of the UAV helicopter. We present the frameworks and structures of the onboard and ground station systems. The onboard system employs a framework of multiple task threads with each thread being assigned to perform a specific task. Management and time scheduling for task threads together with the detailed implementation of automatic flight control laws are the main focuses of the onboard software system. A behavior-based architecture is designed to address task scheduling and event disposal for automatic control. A hierarchical and componential structure is developed to integrate multiple control laws and perform various <b>helicopter</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The ground station software system employs a two-layer framework, i. e., data transferring in background and data visualization in foreground. A variety of views are developed to display in-flight data received from the UAV helicopter in different forms including a 3 D monitoring panel, which displays real-time data in 3 D on the ground station.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{investigating the}} system identification of helicopter rotor dynamics are described. The identification {{makes use of}} a two-pass procedure that estimates the rotor dynamic states prior to estimation of the dynamic equation parameters. Estimation of the rotor states is made possible through use of the predictive information contained in blade-mounted accelerometers combined with a specialized processing scheme utilizing these signals. Descriptions of the experimental hardware and the system identification technique are given, as well as implementation issues for using the procedure on other similarly instrumented rotor blades. Finally, comparisons with other identification techniques using the same data are presented. It is demonstrated that the approach is an attractive one for measurement of a <b>helicopter</b> rotor's dynamic <b>behavior...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis uses Multi-Agent System {{modeling}} {{to develop}} a simulation of tactical helicopter performance while conducting armed reconnaissance. It focuses on creating a model to support planning for the Test and Evaluation phas of the Comanche helicopter acquisition cycle. The model serves as an initial simulation laboratory for scenario planning, requirements forecasting, and platform comparison analyses. The model implements adaptive tactical movement with agent sensory and weaponry system characteristics. Agents are able to determine their movement direction and paths based on their perceived environment, attributes, and movement personalities. The model incorporates a three-dimensional aspect to properly simulate aerial reconnaissance. An integrated Graphical User Interface enables the user to create environments, instantiate agent propensities and attributes, set simulation parameters, and analyze statistical output. The resulting model demonstrates the ability to represent <b>helicopter</b> reconnaissance <b>behavior.</b> It captures simulation summary statistics that illustrate enemy performance, helicopter performance, and logistical requirements. The model establishes an initial simulation tool to further explore Comanche operational requirements and planning foi its Test and Evaluation phase. 14. SUBJECT TERMS 15.

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, a neuro-fuzzy system {{identification}} using measured {{input and output}} data are carried out. A model-free learning from “examples ” methodology is developed to train a neuro-fuzzy model of a smallsize helicopter. The helicopter model is obtained and tuned using training data gathered while a teacher operates the helicopter. Behavior-based model architecture is used, with each behavior implemented as a hybrid neurofuzzy model. The neural network structure learns {{the parameters of the}} fuzzy membership functions and finally the fuzzy-based model works alone. The neuro-fuzzy architecture and the helicopter hardware system used to measure the sensors and command data are also described. The methodology has been successfully applied in the behavior-based model of a radio control model <b>helicopter.</b> The identified <b>behavior</b> model can be used in the position control also based on the neuro-fuzzy theory.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find a way to measure {{helicopter}} parenting that directly reflects its conceptual definition that has been established by Cline and Fay (1990). Literature has pointed to several parenting dimensions that constitute helicopter parenting (Kins 2 ̆ 6 Soenens, 2013; Klein 2 ̆ 6 Pierce, 2009). Rather than looking at helicopter parenting as a qualitatively distinct approach to parenting, this study attempted to show that parenting dimensions established in existing literature are what constitutes helicopter parenting. Helicopter parenting should be looked at as falling on an extreme end of the spectrum of different parenting dimensions. A total of 500 participants were recruited for this study, 353 of which were retained with a majority identifying as Caucasian and female. Specifically, measures of parental overprotection, care, psychological control, behavioral control, involvement, responsiveness, autonomy support, and a separate measure that has been created to look at helicopter parenting were used to evaluate participants’ reported experience of parenting behaviors. Measures of coping efficacy, interpersonal dependency, and psychological well-being were used to evaluate outcomes associated with helicopter parenting. The results indicated that the proposed measure of helicopter parenting was found to be both a reliable and valid measure of this phenomenon. The study supported the multidimensional aspect of the proposed measure and further suggests that <b>helicopter</b> parenting <b>behaviors</b> should be looked at separately in regards to outcomes associated with this phenomenon...|$|R
