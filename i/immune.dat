5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the <b>immune</b> system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the <b>immune</b> system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific <b>immune</b> receptors and elicit an <b>immune</b> response.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of the <b>immune</b> {{system can}} result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the <b>immune</b> system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either {{be the result of}} a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive <b>immune</b> system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects of the <b>immune</b> system.|$|E
5|$|Foods rich {{in certain}} fatty acids may foster a healthy <b>immune</b> system. Likewise, fetal {{undernourishment}} {{can cause a}} lifelong impairment of the <b>immune</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Engineers, artillerymen, musicians, {{drill and}} weapons instructors, {{military}} police, carpenters, hunters and medical staff {{were among the}} multiple specialized jobs <b>immunes</b> provided for the Roman army. <b>Immunes</b> also received better pay than the regular troops.|$|R
5000|$|Rankers with {{specialist}} {{skills were}} classed as milites <b>immunes</b> ("exempt soldiers"), {{meaning that they}} were exempt from the normal duties of their fellow-soldiers {{so that they could}} practice their trade. A legion would contain over 600 <b>immunes.</b> Over 100 specialist jobs are attested, including the all-important blacksmiths (fabri), among whom the scutarii ("shield-men"), probably smiths that specialised in weapons manufacture or repair, and other craftsmen who worked in the fabrica; carpentarii ("wagon-makers/repairers", or, generally, [...] "carpenters"); capsarii (wound-dressers) and seplasiarii ("ointment-men"), medical orderlies who worked in the valetudinarium (hospital in a legionary fortress) or hospitium (auxiliary fort hospital); balniator (bath attendant); and cervesarius (beer-brewer). It is uncertain, however, whether the latter two jobs were held by milites <b>immunes</b> or by civilians working for the unit on contract. <b>Immunes</b> were on the same pay-scale as other rankers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Immunes</b> took up {{the trades}} and skills of engineers, field medics, carpenters, and craftsmen. However, they were also fully trained and would be {{expected}} to fight in the infantry or cavalry if necessary. The discentes were probably exempted, like the <b>immunes,</b> from standard combat and camp duties since their main occupation would have been time-consuming technical training.|$|R
5|$|Helper T cells {{regulate}} {{both the}} innate and adaptive <b>immune</b> responses and help determine which <b>immune</b> responses the body makes {{to a particular}} pathogen. These cells have no cytotoxic activity and do not kill infected cells or clear pathogens directly. They instead control the <b>immune</b> response by directing other cells to perform these tasks.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} <b>immune</b> system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate <b>immune</b> responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the <b>immune</b> system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of normal <b>immune</b> response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the <b>immune</b> system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The <b>immune</b> system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving {{an arm of the}} <b>immune</b> system known as humoral immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E
5000|$|The {{epilogue}} {{reveals the}} Flare was deliberately engineered and {{released by the}} government {{as a form of}} population control after the sun flares, believing it kills quickly and it stops spreading after a while, but escalated beyond control, and WICKED was unable to find a cure. The Chancellor realized the <b>Immunes</b> were their only hope from the beginning; as such, she enacts a plan with Brenda and Jorge to send the <b>Immunes</b> through a flat trans. While {{the rest of the world}} will crumble, the remaining <b>Immunes</b> will rebuild society and restore the human race. This, she claims, is the reason [...] "WICKED is good." ...|$|R

5000|$|CDR Chandler and the Nathan Jamess next {{opponents are}} {{a group of}} natural <b>Immunes</b> led by former Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander Sean Ramsey (Brían F. OByrne), who have taken command of the [...] HMS Achilles. The <b>Immunes</b> have also brainwashed the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Jeffrey Michener (Mark Moses), who is the sole {{surviving}} member of the Cabinet of the United States & Presidential Line of Succession.|$|R
5|$|In the {{framework}} of the <b>immune</b> network theory, CDRs are also called idiotypes. According to <b>immune</b> network theory, the adaptive <b>immune</b> system is regulated by interactions between idiotypes.|$|E
5|$|Like chondrostean fish, {{the major}} <b>immune</b> tissues of bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the {{anterior}} kidney), which houses many different <b>immune</b> cells. In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered <b>immune</b> areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian <b>immune</b> system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes {{are believed to}} reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus. In 2006, a lymphatic system {{similar to that in}} mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the zebrafish. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen.|$|E
5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the <b>immune</b> system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an <b>immune</b> response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the <b>immune</b> system, {{as well as its}} inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the <b>immune</b> system mankind has developed.|$|E

She has never been seen in the series, but Thomas is saved from a fatal brain experiment by a note from chancellor Paige. She states that a cure for the Flare virus will never be found and that the <b>Immunes</b> are humanity's last hope to restore the dying world, but WICKED's actions of sending them for Trials are threatening that hope, and she disagreed with {{the fact that they were}} being killed. She promises Thomas a paradise for the <b>Immunes,</b> staging his attempt to rescue hundreds of <b>Immunes</b> from the Maze. In every epilogue of the three books, there's an e-mail which she write to her associates.|$|R
5000|$|Ballistarii (singular ballistarius) were artillerymen of the Roman army {{who handled}} ballistae. They were classed as <b>immunes,</b> exempt from fatigue duty of entrenching or building.|$|R
5|$|MFGM {{bioactive}} protein components, including the glycoproteins lactadherin, MUC-1, and butyrophilin, {{have been shown}} in preclinical studies to affect <b>immune</b> response. These components influence the <b>immune</b> system by several mechanisms, including interference with microbe adhesion to intestinal epithelia, bacteriocidal action, support of beneficial microbiota, and modulation of {{other parts of the}} <b>immune</b> system.|$|E
5|$|Polyclonal B cell {{response}} {{is a natural}} mode of <b>immune</b> response exhibited by the adaptive <b>immune</b> system of mammals. It ensures that a single antigen is recognized and attacked through its overlapping parts, called epitopes, by multiple clones of B cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{cells of}} the {{adaptive}} <b>immune</b> system are special types of leukocytes, called lymphocytes. B cells and T cells are the major types of lymphocytes and are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. B cells {{are involved in the}} humoral <b>immune</b> response, whereas T cells are involved in cell-mediated <b>immune</b> response.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas {{wakes up}} to find himself not dead after all and finds a note from Chancellor Paige, leader of WICKED; it reveals they already have enough {{resources}} to build the blueprint for the cure from the Trials and his brain is not needed, but that some WICKED staff {{did not believe in}} the violence that WICKED was causing for a cure. It also reveals the location of the <b>Immunes</b> the Right Arm [...] "sold" [...] to WICKED to gain access, and a [...] "safe place" [...] where Thomas should take them all. Thomas and his friends re-enter the Maze to find WICKED's captured <b>Immunes.</b> They quickly learn the Right Arm does not intend to occupy WICKED headquarters; they intend to destroy it. Explosions rock the Maze, while chunks of debris come crashing down, killing some <b>Immunes</b> within. The Grievers come out of where they were stored, but Teresa shows Thomas how to manually shut them down.|$|R

5|$|The <b>immune</b> {{response}} can {{be manipulated}} to suppress unwanted responses resulting from autoimmunity, allergy, and transplant rejection, and to stimulate protective responses against pathogens that largely elude the <b>immune</b> system (see immunization) or cancer.|$|E
5|$|The <b>immune</b> {{system is}} {{affected}} by sleep and rest, and sleep deprivation is detrimental to <b>immune</b> function. Complex feedback loops involving cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α produced in response to infection, appear to {{also play a role}} in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Thus the <b>immune</b> response to infection may result in changes to the sleep cycle, including an increase in slow-wave sleep relative to REM sleep.|$|E
5|$|The <b>immune</b> system protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate <b>immune</b> system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate <b>immune</b> systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive <b>immune</b> system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the <b>immune</b> system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive <b>immune</b> system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E

5|$|Viral {{infections in}} animals provoke an <b>immune</b> {{response}} that usually eliminates the infecting virus. <b>Immune</b> responses {{can also be}} produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. However, some viruses including those that cause AIDS and viral hepatitis evade these <b>immune</b> responses and result in chronic infections. Antibiotics {{have no effect on}} viruses, but several antiviral drugs have been developed.|$|E
5|$|While {{the cause}} of Crohn's disease is unknown it is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of environmental, <b>immune</b> and bacterial factors in genetically susceptible individuals. It results in a chronic inflammatory disorder, in which the body's <b>immune</b> system attacks the gastrointestinal tract possibly directed at microbial antigens. While Crohn's is an <b>immune</b> related disease, it {{does not appear to be}} an autoimmune disease (in that the <b>immune</b> system is not being triggered by the body itself). The exact underlying <b>immune</b> problem is not clear; however, it may be an immunodeficiency state. About half of the overall risk is related to genetics with more than 70 genes found to be involved.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{polyclonal}} response confers advantages on the <b>immune</b> system, in particular, greater {{probability of}} reacting against pathogens, it also increases chances of developing certain autoimmune diseases {{resulting from the}} reaction of the <b>immune</b> system against native molecules produced within the host.|$|E
