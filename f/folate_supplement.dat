40|$|Abstract Background: High {{intensity}} {{training can}} lead to lower the appetite. So, {{the purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effect of folate supplementation on ghrelin level of stomach and insulin level of serum in male wistar rats during 10 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT). Materials and Methods: Twenty seven male Wistar rats (weight= 203. 94 ± 27. 34 gr, Age: 9 weeks) after one week familiarization, were randomly divided into four groups: control (n= 6), folate supplementation (n= 6), (HIIT) (n= 7) and HIIT+ <b>folate</b> <b>supplement</b> (n= 8). HIIT training protocol started with 30 m/min running on treadmill for 1 min with 10 reps and 2 min active rest at the first week and reached to 75 - 80 m/min for 1 min with 7 reps and 3 min active rest at last 3 weeks. Acylated ghrelin level of stomach tissue and serum level of insulin were assayed by ELISA kit. Results: The results of Kruskal-vallis analysis showed that the ghrelin level of stomach was increased significantly (p= 0. 001) in folate+HIIT in compare with HIIT group. Also, insulin level of serum was decreased significantly (p= 0. 001) in folate +HIIT in compare with control and HIIT groups. Conclusion: Based on our results, folate supplementation during high intensity interval training, increased the ghrelin of stomach and decreased the insulin level of serum. So, it seems that folate supplementation can prevent from losing appetite in athletes who train with high intensity training with interval type. ...|$|E
40|$|The risk {{of having}} an {{offspring}} with neural tube defect is negatively correlated with early pregnancy maternal folate levels. Thalassaemia carriers often have subnormal folate levels. We postulate that their offspring may be at increased {{risk of having}} neural tube defect. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1961 Chinese women referred to a tertiary centre for prenatal diagnosis between January 1997 and August 1998. Women with a mean corpuscular volume greater than 80 fl were assumed not to be α-thalassaemia- 1 or β-thalassaemia heterozygotes. α- and β-thalassaemia heterozygotes were diagnosed by haemoglobin studies. Of the 1961 women studied, pregnancy outcome was not available in 20 and thalassaemia screening was not available in 109 and these {{were excluded from the}} final analysis. Two-hundred-and-six women were α-thalassaemia- 1 heterozygotes, 102 women were β-thalassaemia heterozygotes and one woman had HbE disease. Three α-thalassaemia carriers and one β-thalassaemia carrier had a pregnancy affected by anencephaly (odds = 1 : 76). In the 1523 non-carriers, five pregnancies were affected by spina bifida (odds = 1 : 304). The odds ratio (95 per cent confidence interval) for neural tube defects in the α- and β-thalassaemia carriers was 3. 99 (1. 07 to 14. 94; p < 0. 05, Chi-square test). Because of the small number of affected pregnancies studied, the finding needs to be substantiated by a larger series. If the increased risk is genuine, women need to be screened for thalassaemia before conception and the thalassaemia carriers should be given periconceptional <b>folate</b> <b>supplement</b> to reduce the occurrence of neural tube defects. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In this study we have hypothesized that dietary folate supplementation of the low-protein diet will improve maternal vascular function and also restore offspring cardiovascular function. Pregnant Wistar rats were fed either a control (18 % casein) or protein-restricted (9 % casein) diet +/- 5 mg/kg <b>folate</b> <b>supplement.</b> Function of isolated maternal uterine artery and small mesenteric arteries from adult male offspring was assessed, systolic blood pressure recorded, and offspring thoracic aorta levels of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase mRNA measured. In the uterine artery of late pregnancy dams, vasodilatation to vascular endothelial growth factor was attenuated in the protein-restricted group but restored with folate supplementation, as was isoprenaline-induced vasodilatation (P< 0. 05). In male offspring, protein restriction during pregnancy led to raised systolic blood pressure (P< 0. 01), impaired acetylcholine-induced vasodilatation (P< 0. 01), and reduced levels of endothelial NO synthase mRNA (P< 0. 05). Maternal folate supplementation during pregnancy prevented this elevated systolic blood pressure associated with a protein restriction diet. With folate supplementation, endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and endothelial NO synthase mRNA levels {{were not significantly different}} from either the control or protein-restricted groups. Maternal folate supplementation of the control diet had no effect on blood pressure or vasodilatation. This study supports the hypothesis that folate status in pregnancy can influence fetal development and, thus, the risks of cardiovascular disease in the next generation.

Methods and results: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted among 81 obese women (weight range: 65 - 110 kg) aged 18 - 40 year old diagnosed with PCOS. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups receiving: (1) Folate- 1 : 1 mg/day <b>folate</b> <b>supplements</b> (n = 27); (2) Folate- 5 : 5 mg/day <b>folate</b> <b>supplements</b> (n = 27), and (3) placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Low folate {{status and}} {{elevated}} plasma homocysteine {{are associated with}} increased risk of neural tube defects and cardiovascular disease. Homocysteine responses to folate {{may be influenced by}} genetic variants in folate metabolism. OBJECTIVE: We determined the effect of folate-enhancing dietary interventions on plasma folate and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) with respect to the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 C [...] >T genotype. DESIGN: A total of 126 healthy subjects (42 TT, 42 CT, and 42 CC genotypes) completed 3 dietary interventions (4 mo each) in random order: 1) exclusion diet (avoidance of folic acid-fortified foods and ingestion of a placebo daily), 2) folate-rich diet (increased intake of fortified and naturally folate-rich foods to achieve 400 microg folate/d), and 3) supplement (exclusion diet plus a <b>folate</b> <b>supplement</b> of 400 microg/d). RESULTS: Plasma folate was higher (P < or = 0. 001) and plasma tHcy lower (P < or = 0. 001) after the folate-rich and supplement interventions than after the exclusion diet. Plasma folate was significantly greater after supplementation than after the folate-rich diet, but {{there was no significant difference}} in tHcy concentration (P = 0. 72). TT homozygotes had higher plasma tHcy (14. 5 compared with 8. 9 micromol/L, P < or = 0. 001) and lower plasma folate (14. 8 compared with 19. 0 nmol/L, P < or = 0. 01) than did subjects with the CC genotype after the exclusion diet. CT heterozygotes had intermediate concentrations. The trend toward higher tHcy in TT homozygotes persisted throughout the study but was less marked with increasing folate intake (TT compared with CC after supplementation, P = 0. 097). CONCLUSIONS: A folate-rich diet including folic acid-fortified foods or low-dose supplements effectively increases folate status. TT homozygotes require higher folate intakes than do individuals with the CT or CC genotype to achieve similar tHcy concentrations but are responsive to folate intervention...|$|E
40|$|Background: Folate is {{critical}} for cell division, a major feature of in utero development. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is required to convert the folic acid used in supplements and for food fortification and the dihydrofolate produced by thymidylate synthase during DNA synthesis to the reduced folate forms used by the cell. Objective: We aimed {{to determine whether a}} common, recently discovered deletion polymorphism in the DHFR gene is a risk factor for preterm delivery or low birth weight. Design: We studied 324 pregnant women from Camden, NJ. Folate intake was computed from <b>folate</b> <b>supplement</b> intake plus the mean of two 24 -h recalls completed during the course of pregnancy. Genomic DNA was extracted from the women’s leukocytes and genotyped. Results: Women with a deletion allele had a significantly greater risk of preterm delivery [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) : 3. 0; 95 % CI: 1. 0, 8. 8; P 0. 05] than did those without a deletion allele. Women with both a DHFR deletion allele and low folate intake (400 g/d from diet plus supplements) had a significantly greater risk of pre-term delivery (AOR: 5. 5; 95 % CI: 1. 5, 20. 4; P 0. 01) and a sig-nificantly greater risk of having an infant with a low birth weight (AOR: 8. 3; 95 % CI: 1. 8, 38. 6; P 0. 01) than did women without a deletion allele and with a folate intake 400 g/d. Conclusions: The DHFR 19 –base pair deletion allele may be a risk factor for preterm delivery. In the presence of low dietary folate, the allele may also be a risk factor for low birth weight.

The Effect of Adding Vitamin B 12 on Fe Folate Supplementation in Increasing Hemoglobin Level Among Post Caesarian Section Patients at RSU PKU Muhammadiyah Delanggu, Klaten. A Thesis for The Masters Program in Nutrition, Postgraduate Program, Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta. 2009 Caesaria {{section is}} an {{important}} cause of maternal bleeding at delivery. Post caesarian section bleeding leads to anemia among lactating women that subsequently can {{affect the quality of}} mothers’ milk and maternal fatigue. The anemia problem stems from not only iron deficiency but also folic acid and vitamin B 12 deficiencies. This study aimed to determine the effect of adding vitamin B 12 on Fe folate supplementation in increasing hemoglobin level among post caesarian section women. This study was a double blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT). The target population was post birth delivery mothers who underwent caesarean section. The source population was post birth delivery mothers who underwent caesarian section at RSU PKU Muhammadiyah Delanggu, Klaten, Jawa Tengah. Sixteen post caesarian section mothers received Fe <b>Folate</b> <b>supplement,</b> while other 16 post caesarian section mothers received Fe Folate and vitamin B 12 for 60 days. The outcome variable was hemoglobin level (g/L) measured twice, before and after treatment. Confounding factors under consideration were age, intakes of iron, vitamin B 12, protein, energy, and folate, respectively during the study. The effectiveness of adding B 12 was analyzed by t test, using SPSS version 16. The analysis results showed {{no significant difference in the}} mean increase of Hb between mothers who received and who did not receive vitamin 12 supplementation (p= 0. 369). This study concludes that adding vitamin B 12 on Fe Folate supplementation is not effective in further increasing the hemoglobin level among post birth delivery mothers who underwent caesarean section.

40|$|Folate {{and vitamin}} B 12 {{deficiency}} {{have been associated}} with neurological and neuropsyhiatric disorders. Moreover, the coenzymes formed from folic acid are instrumental in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine and this reaction requires vitamin B 12 as a cofactor. Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for vascular diseases, such as heart disease and stroke. Objective: To examine folate, vitamin B 12 and serum homocysteine levels in patients with chronic migraine and medication-overuse headache, compared to migraine patients. Methods: We analysed serum vitamins levels in 170 patients with chronic migraine and medication-overuse headache (MOH) (mean age 54 years) and in 50 patients suffering from migraine without aura (mean age 43 years). Homocysteine serum levels were available only for 118 MOH patients (mean age 52 years). Diagnosis were made according to ICHD-II criteria. All patients have been referred to the Headache Centre of Modena University Hospital. Venous blood samples were drawn in the morning, after an overnight fast. Serum vitamins and homocysteine levels were measured by immunometric techniques (folate: ion capture immuno assay, ICIA; vitamin B 12 : microparticles enzyme immuno assay, MEIA; homocysteine: fluorescence polarized immuno assay) at our laboratory. Results: Folate levels below the reference range (4 - 20 ng/ml) were found significantly more frequently in MOH patients (27 %) than in migraine patients (12 %) (P < 0. 05, Chi-square test). A similar proportion of patients of the two groups had vitamin B 12 lower than the references values (200 - 900 pg/ml). Homocysteinemia higher than the reference range (< 20 umol/l for subjects over 60 years; < 13 umol/l for subjects below 60 years) was found significantly more frequently in MOH patients (15 %) than in migraine patients (2 %) (P < 0. 05, Chi-square test). Conclusions: The low folate and high homocysteine levels that we detected in many MOH patients could contribute to the numerous medical and psychiatric comorbidities which have been reported in patients suffering from this disorder. Our results suggest that the assessment of folate, and homocysteine levels should be considered in MOH patients since <b>folate</b> <b>supplement</b> could help to improve their complex condition...|$|E

Univariate analyses revealed those subjects on beta-blocker therapy (n = 12) had lower fibrinogen concentrations than those not on these medications (n = 28) (277. 7 16. 7 vs. 316. 1 10. 9 mg/dl, respectively, p = 0. 04). A trend existed for those on beta-blockade to also have lower Hcy concentrations (8. 3 0. 66 vs 9. 7 0. 43 µmol/L, respectively, p = 0. 058). Subjects in the upper tertile of physical activity had significantly lower fibrinogen concentrations than those in the lower tertile (274. 7 38 mg/dl vs. 320. 2 63, respectively, p = 0. 05). Homocysteine concentration was found to be positively associated with age (p = 0. 0008). No significant associations were established with multivariate analyses among fibrinogen, Hcy, physical activity, age, BMI, B-vitamin and <b>folate</b> <b>supplements,</b> beta-blocker therapy, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, and TC/HDL ratio. These results support the hypothesis that hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for CAD. Future studies should consider the favorable effects of beta-blockade, which may be a confounding factor, on Hcy and fibrinogen concentrations. Knowledge of associations may contribute toward understanding of the pathogenesis of CAD. ii...|$|R
40|$|Micronutrient {{fortified}} flour (MFF), supplementary food rations and micronutrient (MN) supplements {{may prevent}} deficiencies among pregnant women. Objectives of cross-sectional surveys in 2004 (n = 533) and 2006 (n = 515) were {{to assess the}} impact of new food rations (flour, oil) and supplements on MN status by trimester of pregnancy in the Maela refugee camp. Hemoglobin, iron status, zinc, retinol, β-carotene and tryptophan decreased, while α-/γ-tocopherol and 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (5 -MTHF) increased from first to third trimester. In 2006, mean zinc and α-tocopherol for each trimester was significantly higher than in 2004. The weeks of supplemented thiamine and folic acid were positively correlated with thiamine diphosphate (TDP) and 5 -MTHF, but not for ferrous sulfate as iron deficiency was observed in 38. 5 % of third-trimester women. Frequent consumption of fish paste and owning a garden or animal were associated with significantly higher iron status, retinol, β-carotene, and 5 -MTHF. In conclusion, MFF and supplementary oil were most likely to explain improved zinc and α-tocopherol status, while thiamine and <b>folate</b> <b>supplements</b> ensured high TDP and 5 -MTHF in late pregnancy. MN supplements, MN-rich staple food, small gardens, and programs to improve iron compliance are promising strategies to prevent MN deficiencies during pregnancy in vulnerable populations...|$|R
40|$|Mild hyperhomocysteinaemia is a {{major risk}} factor for {{vascular}} disease and neural tube defects (NTDs), conferring an approximately three-fold relative risk for each condition. It has several possible causes: heterozygosity for rare loss of function mutations in the genes for 5, 10 -methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) or cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS); dietary insufficiency of vitamin co-factors B 6, B 12 or folates; or homozygosity for a common ‘thermolabile' mutation in the MTHFR gene which has also been associated with vascular disease and NTDs. We quantified {{the contribution of the}} thermolabile mutation to the hyperhomocysteinaemic phenotype in a working male population (625 individuals). Serum folate and vitamin B 12 concentrations were also measured and their relationship with homocysteine status and MTHFR genotype assessed. The homozygous thermolabile genotype occurred in 48. 4, 35. 5, and 23. 4 % of the top 5, 10, and 20 % of individuals (respectively) ranked by plasma homocysteine levels, compared with a frequency of 11. 5 % in the study population as a whole, establishing that the mutation {{is a major}} determinant of homocysteine levels at {{the upper end of the}} range. Serum folate concentrations also varied with genotype, being lowest in thermolabile homozygotes. The MTHFR thermolabile genotype should be considered when population studies are designed to determine the effective homocysteine-lowering dose of dietary <b>folate</b> <b>supplements,</b> and when prophylactic doses of folate are recommended for individual...|$|R
40|$|Background: Anemia is a {{frequent}} complication among HIV-infected persons and is associated with faster disease progression and mortality. Objective: We examined the effect of multivitamin supplementation on hemoglobin concentrations {{and the risk of}} anemia among HIV-infected pregnant women and their children. Design: HIV- 19 ̆ 6 infected pregnant women (n = 3 D 1078) from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were enrolled in a double-blind trial and provided daily supplements of preformed vitamin A and -carotene, multivitamins (vitamins B, C, and E), preformed vitamin A and -carotene + multivitamins, or placebo. All women received iron and <b>folate</b> <b>supplements</b> only during pregnancy according to local standard of care. The median follow-up time for hemoglobin measurement for mothers was 57. 3 mo [interquartile range (IQR) : 28. 69 ̆ 666. 8] and for children it was 28. 0 mo (IQR: 5. 39 ̆ 641. 7). Results: During the whole period, hemoglobin concentrations among women who received multivitamins were 0. 33 g/dL higher than among women who did not receive multivitamins (P = 3 D 0. 07). Compared with placebo, multivitamin supplementation resulted in a hemoglobin increase of 0. 59 g/dL during the first 2 y after enrollment (P = 3 D 0. 0002). Compared with placebo, the children born to mothers who received multivitamins had a reduced risk of anemia. In this group, the risk of macrocytic anemia was 63...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: Periconceptional folate supplementation {{prevents}} neural tube {{defects and}} possibly congenital heart defects (CHD) as well. The search for candidate genes {{involved in the}} folate metabolism includes the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 C > T polymorphism. We studied the association between MTHFR 677 C > T variants and CHD risk. The interaction with periconceptional folate supplementation was also investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: A case-control study and a family-based transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) were conducted to explore this association. In 133 triads, the TDT revealed no association of the fetal 677 T allele {{with the development of}} a heart defect. In 158 mothers with a CHD-affected child, the maternal MTHFR 677 CT and TT genotypes in combination with no use of periconceptional <b>folate</b> <b>supplements</b> were associated with, respectively, a three-fold (OR 3. 3 95 % CI 1. 46 - 7. 32) and six-fold (OR 6. 3 95 % CI 2. 32 - 17. 27) increased risk for conotruncal heart defects in offspring. In a case-only study, the interaction between periconceptional folate supplementation and maternal MTHFR genotype was significant (P = 0. 012). CONCLUSION: The maternal MTHFR 677 C > T variants are a risk factor for CHD in offspring, confined to conotruncal heart defects. A gene-environment interaction between maternal MTFHR 677 CT and TT genotypes with periconceptional folate supplementation was observed. These findings provide a mechanism of the protective role of folate and support the thesis that periconceptional folate supplementation might prevent CHD...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPericonceptional supplementation of {{folic acid}} to the diet {{of women is}} {{considered}} a great success for a public health intervention. Higher folate status, either by supplementation, or via the mandatory fortification of grain products in the United States, has led to significant reduction {{in the incidence of}} neural tube defects. Besides birth defects, folate deficiency has been linked to a variety of morbidities, most notably to increased risk for cancer. However, recent evidence suggests that excess folate may be detrimental — for birth defect incidence or in the progression of cancer. How folate mediates beneficial or detrimental effects is not well understood. It is also unknown what molecular responses are elicited in women taking <b>folate</b> <b>supplements,</b> and thus experience a bolus of folate on top of the status achieved by fortification. To characterize the response to a periconceptional regimen of supplementation with folinic acid, we performed gene expression profiling experiments on uterus tissue of pregnant mice with either wildtype alleles or targeted disruption at the folate receptor 4 locus. We observed that, depending on the genetic background, folinic acid supplementation affects expression of genes that contribute to lipid metabolism, protein synthesis, mitochondrial function, cell cycle, and cell activation. The extent of the response is strongly modulated by the genetic background. Finally, we provide evidence that folinic acid supplementation in the mutant paradigm affects histone methylation status, a potential mechanism of gene regulation in this model...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPregnancies {{in women}} with {{epilepsy}} are high risk and need careful management by both the medical and obstetric teams due to the increased incidence of complications and adverse outcomes of pregnancy. By the time a pregnant woman with epilepsy presents, the foetus is virtually fully formed and the opportunity for altering drug treatment has passed. Women need to be counselled and told to seek advice about their anticonvulsant therapy should they wish to become pregnant. All major anticonvulsant drugs are teratogenic but the main risk to the developing foetus appears to be when the mother is on polytherapy especially if sodium valproate forms part of the combination. <b>Folate</b> <b>supplements</b> (5 mg) before conception are advisable. There {{appears to be a}} minor but significant increased risk of maternal complications {{in women with}} epilepsy such as hyperemesis gravidarum, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, vaginal bleeding and premature labour. In the majority of women seizure control will not alter during pregnancy. Oral vitamin K should be given to the mother receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs. Post-natal infant development: there is an increased risk of prematurity (9 – 11 %), stillbirth, neonatal and perinatal death, haemorrhagic disease of the newborn, low Apgar scores and low birth weight (7 – 10 %). Breast feeding: virtually all the anticonvulsant drugs are excreted in breast milk in low concentrations. Feeding difficulties, irritability and lethargy can occur. However, the benefits of breast feeding usually far outweigh any minor risks to the baby...|$|R

They will get benefits from folate suplementaion as recomended. This is a prospective case control study conducted at the Police Teaching Hospital and Abuanjja Chest hospital from March 2005 to February 2006 In this study 20 patients suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, 20 patients with reuhmatoid arthritis,and 5 healthy controls were studied. Special selection criteria were considered for the patients as diagnosed with clinical history, examinations, and laboratory methods for conformation of diagnosis The study concluded that inspite of existance of anemia of chronic disease in 42. 5 %; only 2. 5 % (one patient) had a low serum folate, and 2 2. 5 % (9 patients) with borderline serum folate. The study recommended that a large prospective study is needed to give a better idea of folate status in chronic disease, and that red cell folate is to be estimated as it is a better parameter of folate status than serum folate. It was also recommended to do serum ferritin and homocystine to know they are deficient & if so, the effect of that on the haematological state of these patients.

40|$|Homocysteine (Hcy) is {{recognised}} as a {{risk factor}} for IHD. Serum Hcy is negatively correlated with serum folate levels, the main sources of which are fruits, vegetables and legumes. The present case–control study was designed {{to examine the relationship between}} serum Hcy levels and IHD and to assess the role of dietary factors in the southern Mediterranean population of Crete, Greece. Serum Hcy, folate, vitamin B 12, creatinine and glucose levels and a full lipid profile were measured in 152 patients with established IHD, median age 64 (range 33 – 77) years, and 152 healthy control subjects, age- and sex-matched. Dietary data were assessed using a 3 d food intake record. Compared with controls, patients with IHD had significantly higher daily intakes of vitamin B 12 and MUFA and significantly lower intakes of carbohydrate, fibre, folate, cholesterol, n- 3 fatty acids and total trans unsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, patients had sig-nificantly higher serum Hcy, vitamin B 12 and creatinine levels, but significantly lower folate. Serum folate concentrations in both groups had a significant positive correlation with dietary fibre consumption and a significant inverse correlation with vitamin B 12 intake. IHD patients should be encouraged to increase their daily dietary intake of fibre, folate and n- 3 fatty acids, which are significant components of the traditional Cretan Mediterranean diet. Where dietary folate intake is inadequate, <b>folate</b> <b>supplements</b> are recommended to reduce elevated Hcy levels.

40|$|Objectives : To {{investigate}} uptake and {{provision of}} antenatal care (ANC) {{services in the}} Uzazi Bora project: a demonstration-intervention project for Safe Motherhood and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Kenya. Methods : Data were extracted from antenatal clinic, laboratory and maternity ward registers of all pregnant women attending ANC from January 2004 until September 2006 at three antenatal clinics in Mombasa and two in rural Kwale district of Coast Province, Kenya (n = 25 364). Multiple logistic and proportional odds logistic regression analyses assessed changes over time, and determinants of the frequency and timing of ANC visits, uptake of HIV testing, and provision of iron sulphate, folate and single-dose nevirapine (sd-NVP). Results : About half of women in rural and urban settings (52. 2 % and 49. 2 %, respectively) attended antenatal clinics only once. Lower parity, urban setting, older age and having received iron sulphate and <b>folate</b> <b>supplements</b> during the first ANC visit were independent predictors of more frequent visits. The first ANC visit occurred after 28 weeks of pregnancy for 30 % (5894 / 19 432) of women. By mid- 2006, provision of nevirapine to HIV-positive women had increased from 32. 5 % and 11. 7 % in rural and urban clinics, to 67. 0 % and 74. 6 %, respectively. Equally marked improvements were observed in the uptake of HIV testing {{and the provision of}} iron sulphate and folate. Conclusion : Provision of ANC services, including sd-NVP, increased markedly over time. While further improvements in quality are necessary, particular attention is needed to implement evidence-based interventions to alter ANC utilization patterns. Encouragingly, improved provision of basic essential obstetric care may increase attendance...|$|R

Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among 60 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. They were all overweight in the age range 40 - 85 years. Participants were randomly divided into 2 groups: group A (n = 30) received 5 mg <b>folate</b> <b>supplements</b> and group B (n = 30) received placebo for 12 weeks. Results: Folate supplementation resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} maximum levels of left CIMT (- 0. 05 Â± 0. 13 vs. + 0. 02 Â± 0. 11 mm, p = 0. 01) compared with the placebo. Changes in fasting plasma glucose (- 2. 2 Â± 37. 5 vs. + 30. 2 Â± 65. 8 mg/dl, p = 0. 02), serum insulin concentration (- 2. 0 Â± 10. 7 vs. + 3. 0 Â± 7. 6 Î¼IU/ml, p = 0. 04) and homeostasis of assessment-estimated insulin resistance (- 0. 6 Â± 2. 3 vs. + 0. 9 Â± 2. 3, p = 0. 01) in supplemented patients were significantly different from those of patients in the placebo group. Changes in serum triglycerides (p = 0. 04), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p = 0. 001), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (p = 0. 01) and plasma nitric oxide concentrations (p < 0. 001) were significantly different between the supplemented patients and placebo group.
