500|$|The Robert Bolt play A Man For All Seasons {{focuses on}} the {{conscience}} of Catholic lawyer Thomas More in his struggle with King Henry VIII ("the loyal subject is more bounden to be loyal to his conscience than to any other thing"). George Orwell wrote his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four on the isolated island of Jura, Scotland to describe how a man (Winston Smith) attempts to develop critical conscience in a totalitarian state which watches every action {{of the people and}} manipulates their thinking with a mixture of propaganda, endless war and thought control through language control (double think and newspeak) to the point where prisoners look up to and even love their torturers. In the Ministry of Love, Winston's torturer (O'Brien) states: [...] "You are imagining that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>called</b> human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable".|$|E
2500|$|A common {{summary of}} his {{argument}} is that meaning is use—words are not defined by reference to the objects they designate, nor by the mental representations one might associate with them, but by how they are used. For example, this means {{there is no need}} to postulate that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>called</b> good that exists independently of any good deed. This anthropological perspective contrasts with Platonic realism and with Gottlob Frege's notions of sense and reference. This argument has been labeled by some authors as [...] "anthropological holism." ...|$|E

When they re-emerged after the First World War, compounded with the example of the Bolsheviks in winning a revolution, a longing for the conditions which had transpired during the war was a major motivation for fascism.|$|R

50|$|A {{possible}} reformation would <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>called</b> the post-qualifications applications system (PQA), where applicants {{apply to}} university after they receive their results. It {{has been argued}} that this would be fairer to applicants, especially those from lower-income families whose results were thought to be under-predicted. However, a more recent UCAS report shows that although the reliability of predicted grades declines in step with family income, this can still lead to an over-prediction effect for lower income groups. Just 45% of predicted grades are accurate - 47% are over-predictions and 9% under-predictions. A recent UCAS consultation rejected the implementation of PQA following opposition from universities, schools and awarding bodies.|$|R

A duplex chain running in an oil bath led finally to a rigid shaft, at each end of which were the two rear wheels. Thanks to this elaborate power transfer, the engine-gearbox unit was both free of tension and well soundproofed in its linkage to the rear axle.|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{arguing that}} alcohol {{problems}} {{are in a}} large part attributable to social learning theory, Heather still recognises the role of genetics as an influencing risk factor for developing alcohol dependence. However whilst some people may have a genetic predisposition, there are {{a wide range of}} socio-psychological factors that also significantly influence risk of dependency, rendering disease model thinking simplistic and flawed. In the 2007 interview with the Addiction Journal, Nick Heather stated he was [...] "depressed by the resurgence of thenotion of there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>called</b> ‘alcoholism’ which is a brain disease", which has [...] "held us back from a proper understanding of alcohol problems and how they may be resolved in all kinds of ways".|$|E
5000|$|One {{significant}} problem from source tagging <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>called</b> [...] "tag pollution" [...] caused when non-deactivated tags carried around by customers cause unwanted alarms, decreasing the effectiveness {{and integrity of}} the EAS system. The problem is that no store {{has more than one}} system. Therefore, if a store actually has an anti-shoplifting system to deactivate a label they will only deactivate the one that is part of their system. If a store does not use an EAS system, they will not deactivate any tags at all. This is often the reason why people trigger an alarm entering a store, which can cause great frustration for both customers and staff. The problem is most evident in shopping malls where customers wander between stores.|$|E

5000|$|... “Levato {{is himself}} an avant-garde poet whose work draws on {{cinematic}} and documentary techniques—in his own words, “engages subject matter through disruption of content and form, fragmentation of narrative and radical juxtaposition of visual and textual elements.” His poems, truly products of postmodern culture, sample: they collect, cut and redistribute pieces of other poems into new configurations. One long work, “Aurora,” makes a fragmented, haunting dialogue {{of pieces of}} Robert Browning’s and Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s poems. A significant part of Levato’s work <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>called</b> cinépoetry, a kind of collaged videographic poetry that does with footage what his other work does with language.
