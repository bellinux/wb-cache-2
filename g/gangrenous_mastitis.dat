To do that, 20 clinically <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis</b> diagnosed and 20 healthy ewes, all from the same flock in a local ewes unit were used as material. Blood samples were kept in test tube containing the disodium salt of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as anticoagulant for plasma MDA and erythrocyte GSH-Px analysis and in vacutainer tube for biochemical analyses from the jugular vein. The following measurements were performed in blood serum: glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, total protein, albumin, sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), calcium (Ca), total bilirubin, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), urea and creatinine in an autoanalyzer. Erythrocyte GSH-Px activities and plasma MDA levels {{were found to be}} significantly higher in the ewes with <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis</b> than healthy ewes.

40|$|International audienceLeucotoxins are {{regarded}} as virulence factors of Staphylococcus aureus, but data supporting their importance in infection are scarce. Experimental infections of the mammary glands of six goats with a leucotoxin-producing strain were used to investigate in vivo production of leucotoxin. Leucotoxin M/F' was monitored in milk as well as antibodies to LukM/F' in serum and milk. Leucotoxin antigen was detected by ELISA in milk samples of two goats. The appearance of neutrophils in these samples showed similarity with the altered appearance of neutrophils incubated with purified LukM/F' leucotoxin. Leucotoxic activity {{was found in the}} milk samples of these two goats, in particular those of the only goat which developed <b>gangrenous</b> (necrotic) <b>mastitis,</b> and this activity was inhibited by antibodies to LukM/F'. Increases in specific antibody titers occurred in the serum and milk of infected goats, and neutralizing titers increased in serum. The results indicate that the lukM and lukF' genes were functional in vivo, and actively transcribed and translated in the course of mammary infection. These results suggest that LukM/F' can interfere with neutrophil defense activities during infection, and they prompt further studies to investigate the contribution of leucotoxins to staphylococcal mastitis...|$|R

40|$|International audienceStaphylococcus aureus {{mastitis}} in {{dairy sheep}} ranges from subclinical mastitis to lethal <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis.</b> Neither the S. aureus virulence factors nor the host-factors or the epidemiological events {{contributing to the}} different outcomes are known. In a field study in a dairy sheep farm over 21 months, sixteen natural isolates of S. aureus were collected from six subclinical mastitis cases, one lethal <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis</b> case, nasal carriage from eight ewes, and one isolate from ambient air in the milking room. A genomic comparison of two strains, one responsible for subclinical mastitis and one for lethal <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis,</b> was performed using multi-strain DNA microarrays. Multiple typing techniques (pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis, multiple-locus variable-number, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA, spa typing and sas typing) were used to characterise the remaining isolates and to follow {{the persistence of the}} gangrenous isolate in ewes nares. Our results showed that the two strains were genetically closely related and they shared 3 615 identical predicted open reading frames (ORF). However, the <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis</b> isolate carried variant versions of several genes (sdrD, clfA-B, sasA, sasB, sasD, sasI, and splE) and was missing fnbB and a prophage.

40|$|Background: Staphylococcus aureus {{is a major}} {{agent of}} {{mastitis}} in ruminants worldwide. Symptoms observed in ewe S. aureus intramammary infections (IMI) {{are very different from}} one case to another: IMI ranges from subclinical mastitis to lethal <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis.</b> Neither the S. aureus nor the host - factors contributing to the different outcomes are known. Objectives: Identify differences between S. aureus strains implied in the acuteness of IMI. Methods: Two S. aureus strains isolated from subclinical mastitis (O 46) and <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis</b> (O 11) were compared by using PFGE, MLST, Micro - array, spa type, s as type, SNP, MLVA type, and RAPD. Proteomic profiles of these strains were also compared. After growth in iron depleted RPMI with low oxygen, conditions that mimic IMI context, cell wall, cytoplasmic and secreted proteins were extracted and ran on 2 D gels. Results: O 11 and O 46 were genetically closely related. They had identical PFGE patterns (OV/OV', the main pattern in South East of France), were in the same MLST cluster. They shared 3615 identical targets using a pangenomic microarray. The core genes, the core variable genes, and the mobile genetic elements were essentially the same in both strains. The major differences were in spa type, sdrD, splE, fnbB, and the presence of the prophage genes (SAS 0897, SAR 1558, SAR 0940, SAR 2100, SACOL 0343). RAPD show ed the presence of an unknown gene SAB 1979 in O 11. Comparative proteomic revealed over secretion of some proteins (hlg, isdB,hly, lukF - PV, lukM, enolase) by O 11. Conclusions: Absence of a prophage as well as surface protein variants were associated with enhanced virulence. Differences can either be explained by over expression of some virulence factors. This study shows that IMI acuteness can partly be explained by strain genetic content. The impact of host factors on ewe susceptibility to IMIs still remains to be determined...|$|E

Accuteness of the disease vary from subclinical mastitis to <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis.</b> The origin of such a variability depends on both S. aureus virulence and host susceptibility and is not clearly established yet [...] Objective: Identify differences found in S. aureus strains inducing mastites with diverse acuteness {{in order to identify}} staphylococcal virulence markers. Method: Genome sequences of two S. aureus strains isolated from <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis</b> (O 11) and subclinical mastitis (O 46) were obtained (Illumina). Both strains were grown in vitro in conditions mimicking a mastitis context, and their gene expression profile and proteome were analyzed and compared using comparative genomic hybridization and 2 D gel electrophoresis. Results: O 11 and O 46 are genotypically and genetically closely related. Proteomic analysis of the two strains nevertheless revealed clear differences, notably in the exoprotein patterns (higher production of toxins such as lukM/F’-PV, alpha hemolysine, and glycolytic enzymes like enolase or adhesion proteins by O 11 strain compared to O 46). The genome sequence of the 2 strains allowed the identification of an additional phage in O 46 strain, SNPs (1189 synonymous in 487 ORFs and 1104 non synonymous in 680 ORFs in the core genome) and indels (~ 80) in both strains. SNPs are scattered on the chromosome and involve all the functional categories including virulence factors, some of which harbor several SNPs. Transcriptomic analysis allowed to link genome and proteome data and explained some of the differences observed between the two strains. Conclusions Altogether, these results show that differences in terms of pathogenicity in S. aureus mastitis isolates can be correlated to gene content and, mainly, to the strain capability to express and produce virulence factors. Some genes were found specifically present or overexpressed in one strain or the other and could be involved to the differences observed in the mastitis acuteness. They would thus be interesting markers to characterize virulence potential of S. aureus strains isolated from ewe mastitis...|$|E

Serological proteome analysis (SERPA) was used to examine protein samples prepared from culture supernatants of S. aureus strains originally isolated from <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis</b> and nasal carriage (O 11) or subclinical mastitis (O 46) and to compare patterns of immune-reactive proteins. These staphylococcal proteins were revealed by sera obtained from ewes suffering from S. aureus mastitis and by sera obtained from healthy nulliparous ewes (i. e. no lactation and no mastitis or other symptoms) that were nasally colonized by S. aureus.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the treatments and discusses the cost {{effectiveness of a}} Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) device on a <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis</b> case. Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland found mainly in lactating females. Coliforms (Escherichia coli), Staphylococcus spp (Staphylococcus aureus) and, to a lesser extent, Streptococcus spp are the most commonly isolated organisms in bitches. The bitch can be presented because of local signs of inflammation, puppies failing to thrive or even severe septic shock. While more common in ruminants, <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis</b> is rare in the bitch. It is mostly due to Staphylococcus aureus, a gram positive and catalase positive bacteria producing alpha hemolysin. This toxin binds to ADAM 10, a transmembrane protein, forming pores in the cell membrane, causing an acute inflammation via intracellular calcium flow, leading to severe oedema, necrosis and gangrene. Loss of skin integrity also comes from the cleavage of E-cadherin by ADAM 10 after its toxin-mediated activation. A 8. 7 kg, 3 -year-old neutered female Sheltie farm dog was referred to the Veterinary Clinic of the University of Liège for suspicion of septic peritonitis after an ovariohysterectomy on 4 dead puppies 36 hours earlier. They died during long lasting dystocia. Amoxicillin-acid clavulanic and enrofloxacin antibiotherapy had been initiated during surgery. The dog was in decompensated septic shock. The surgical wound was not reactive and no sign of peritonitis was seen by abdominal ultrasonography. The right inguinal and the two most caudal left mammary glands were swollen, crackling with a patchy blue discoloration. An acute fulminant mastitis with gangrenous involvement and sepsis was diagnosed. Fluids and continuous rate infusion of norepinephrine and dobutamine were administered to control severe hypotension. Metronidazole was added since Clostridium spp could not be excluded. Debridement was started {{as soon as the}} arterial pressure was stabilised and the wound was disinfected with hydrogen peroxyde for the 3 first days. While hydrogen peroxyde is indicated for catalase negative infections, the already started antibiotherapy prevented bacterial identification and sensitivity determination. Alginate-honey patches replaced wet to dry bandages after 4 days. After 7 days of progressive debridement, the wound was 15 cm long, 13 cm wide and 1. 2 cm deep. A NPWT device was placed under anaesthesia after extensive debridement. It was kept in place for one week with one renewal after 2 days under slight sedation. The wound was then surgically closed. Cutaneous sutures were removed 10 days later as cicatrization was satisfactory. NPWT is indicated in open wound management, for infection control and for stimulating granulation tissue production prior to reconstruction. It increases contraction in deep, three dimensional wounds. Closure rate is significantly shorter with NPWT than with standard wet to dry bandages. Cost of NPWT is comparable to standard bandages but more comfortable for the patient. Standards bandages require daily changes, sometimes for several weeks and under repeated anaesthesias, which may be debilitating for the patient and expensive for the owner. Conversely, NPWT is changed only once and allows earlier surgical closure of the wound. The main complication is vacuum loss, which is surgeon’s experience dependant...|$|E

40|$|Cette {{publication}} est également parue dans la revue "Journal of Animal Science", Vol. 89, E-Suppl. 1. Staphylococcus aureus is a {{major cause}} of mastitis in ruminants. In ewe mastitis, symptoms range from subclinical to <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis.</b> S. aureus factors or host-factors contributing to the different outcomes are not completely elucidated. In this study, experimental mastitis was induced on primiparous ewes using two S. aureus strains, isolated from gangrenous (strain O 11) or subclinical (strain O 46) mastitis. Strains induced drastically distinct clinical symptoms when tested in ewe and mice experimental mastitis. Notably, they reproduced mild (O 46) or severe (O 11) mastitis in ewes. Ewe sera were used to identify staphylococcal immunoreactive proteins commonly or differentially produced during infections of variable severity and to define core and accessory seroproteomes. Such SERological Proteome Analysis (SERPA) allowed the identification of 89 immunoreactive proteins, of which only 52 (58. 4 %) were previously identified as immunogenic proteins in other staphylococcal infections. Among the 89 proteins identified, 74 appear to constitute the core seroproteome. Among the 15 remaining proteins defining the accessory seroproteome, 12 were specific for strain O 11, 3 were specific for O 46. Distribution of one protein specific for each mastitis severity was investigated in ten other strains isolated from subclinical or clinical mastitis. We report {{here for the first time}} the identification of staphylococcal immunogenic proteins common or specific to S. aureus strains responsible for mild or severe mastitis.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} in ruminant mastitis. Staphylococcal mastitis in ovine hosts {{is remarkably}} variable in terms of acuteness and ranges from subclinical to <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis.</b> S. aureus factors involved in such variations are still poorly documented. This study aimed at identifying the staphylococcal factors responsible for the acuteness of the infection. Two S. aureus strains, isolated from gangrenous (O 11) or subclinical (O 46) ewe mastitis, were selected for this work. Despite a close phylogenetic relationship, these strains were shown to reproducibly induce severe (O 11) or mild (O 46) symptoms in experimental ewe mastitis. Several omic approaches were combined to compare these two strains. Both strains were fully sequenced and their transcriptome and proteome were analyzed in culture conditions mimicking mastitis context. Results showed that dramatic differences between O 11 and O 46 rely {{on their ability to}} adapt to and to express their virulence in a mammary context rather than in their gene content. This study highlights differences in the expression of genes related to mobile genetic elements (especially prophages), the expression of genes involved in iron acquisition and metabolism, of transcriptional factors (SigmaB and SigmaS) and in exoprotein production. Serological Proteome Analysis (SERPA) showed that most of these exoproteins are indeed produced during mastitis. Analysis of 10 other S. aureus strains, focused on two of these exoproteins –SspB and a protein of unknown function- showed SspB is produced only in strains isolated from severe mastitis and the protein of unknown function in strains isolated from subclinical mastitis. The exact role of the genes identified here (exoproteins, mobile genetic elements, iron metabolism and acquisition) in the infection and in mastitis acuteness remains to be determined. Finally, we showed that O 11 is transformable and can thus be subjected to mutagenesis. The genes identified here represent excellent candidates for targeted studies of the molecular basis of S. aureus pathogenesis in ruminant mastitis...|$|E
40|$|S. aureus {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{pathogens}} involved in ruminant mastitis worldwide. The severity of staphylococcal infection is highly variable, ranging from subclinical to <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis.</b> This talk will present an in-depth characterization of S. aureus mastitis isolates to identify bacterial factors putatively involved in severity of mastitis infection and to reveal staphylococcal proteins that are produced during the infection of the mammary gland. We employed genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to comprehensively compare two clonally related S. aureus strains that were responsible for severe (strain O 11) and milder (strain O 46) mastitis in ewes, respectively. Variation in the content of mobile genetic elements, iron acquisition and metabolism, transcriptional regulation and exoprotein production was observed. In particular, O 11 produced relatively high levels of exoproteins, including toxins and proteases known to be important in virulence. A characteristic we observed in other S. aureus strains isolated from clinical mastitis cases. In parallel, experimental mastitis were induced on primiparous ewes using O 11 and O 46. Strains induced mastitis with drastically distinct clinical symptoms when tested in ewe and mice experimental infections. Notably, they reproduced mild (O 46) or severe (O 11) mastitis in ewes. Ewe sera were sampled and used to identify staphylococcal immunoreactive proteins commonly or differentially produced during infections of variable severity and to define core and accessory seroproteomes. Such SERological Proteome Analysis (SERPA) allowed the identification of 89 immunoreactive proteins, of which only 52 (58. 4 %) had previously been identified as immunogenic proteins in other staphylococcal infections. Our data are consistent with a dose-dependant role of some staphylococcal factors in the hypervirulence of strains isolated from severe mastitis. Mobile genetic elements, transcriptional regulators, exoproteins and iron acquisition pathways constitute good targets for further research to define the underlying mechanisms of mastitis severity. These findings open avenues in S. aureus mastitis studies as some of these proteins, expressed in vivo, are likely to account in part for the success of S. aureus as a pathogen of the ruminant mammary gland...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in certain area at Khartoum State from (May/ 2006 - April/ 2008) to determine the causative agent of bovine mastitis and the susceptibility of different isolates to different antibiotics use for treatment of bovine mastitis. The total number of dairy cows, which were examined in 34 investigated farms, equals about 500. The thirty-four dairy farms were examined at the University, Eltebna, Elhalfaia, Elsamrab, Shambat, Hilat kuku and Falasteen farms. Samples were taken according to owner′s complain from apparent clinical cases of mastitis. Hundred milk samples were collected a septically from 41 cows suffering from mastitis. All these cows were examined by visual inspection and palpation of mammarygland and supramammary lymph nodes. The result as follows: 55 % acute mastitis, 44 % chronic mastitis and 1 % <b>gangrenous</b> <b>mastitis.</b> First test was applied in field for pH detection by using indicator paper, in positive reaction the spot was changed from yellow to green or bluish green that means the pH increased dueto decrease of casein and lactose and increase chloride and carbonate. The samples were taken from apparent clinical cases in sterilebottles for culture, isolation and identification of the causative agentsin all cases. The samples were cultured on MacConkey′s agar and Blood agar and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours and then purified by further subculturing. Smears were prepared and stained with Gram´s stain to detect colour, shape and spores if the later was present. The tests were applied as follows: Primary tests: These classified into: 1 - Stained smear. 2 - Motility. 3 - Oxidase. 4 - Catalase. 5 - Oxidation Fermentation. 6 - Glucose fermentation. The isolated genera were as follows: 74 % Bacillusspp., 24 % Staphylococcusspp., 1 % Corynebacteriumspp. and 1 % Klebsiellaspp. After that the secondary tests were applied for isolated genera to identify the species, the results were as follows: 31 % Bacillus coagulans, 11 % B. cereus, 9 % B. subtilis, 9 % B. licheniformis, 4 % B. circulans, 2 % B. lentus, 3 % B. mycoides, 3 %B. amyloliquefaciens, 2 % B. megaterium, 16 % Staphylococcus aureus, 8 % Staphylococcus hyicus, 1 % Corynebacterium spp. and 1 % Klebsiellaspp. Lastly, the sensitivity test was applied using different antibiotics were as follows: Chloramphenicol, Ciprofloxacin, Gentamycin, Tetracycline, Piperacillin/ Tazobactam, Pefloxacin, Amikacin, Ofloxacin, Co-Trimoxazole, Ceftizoxime, Cefotaxime and Ampicillin/ Sulbactam.
