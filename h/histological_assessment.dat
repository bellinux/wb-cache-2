Both conventional T(1) - and T(2) -weighted imaging and dynamic, contrast-enhanced T(2) *-weighted imaging were performed on 34 mice at different stages of tumor development. MRI measurements of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were compared to <b>histological</b> <b>assessments</b> of microvascular density (MVD). Enhancement on postcontrast T(1) -weighted images was compared to <b>histological</b> <b>assessments</b> of Evan's blue extravasation. Conventional T(2) -weighted and postcontrast T(1) -weighted images demonstrated tumor growth characteristics consistent with previous descriptions of GL 261 glioma. Furthermore, measurements of rCBV from MRI data were in good agreement with histological measurements of MVD from the same tumors. Postcontrast enhancement on T(1) -weighted images was observed at all stages of GL 261 glioma progression, even before evidence of angiogenesis, indicating that the mechanism of conventional contrast enhancement in MRI does not require neovascularization. These results provide quantitative support for MRI approaches currently used to assess human brain tumors, and form the basis for future studies of angiogenesis in genetically engineered mouse brain tumor models...|$|R

40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is a major}} cause of {{persistent}} disabilities such as sleep-wake disorders (SWD). However, rodent studies of SWD after TBI are scarce due to lack of appropriate TBI models reproducing acceleration-deceleration forces and compatible with electroencephalography/myography (EEG/EMG) -based recordings of vigilance states. We therefore adapted Marmarou's impact acceleration model to allow for compatibility with EEG-headset implantation. Following implantation of EEG/EMG electrodes, we induced closed TBI by a frontal, angular hit with a weight-drop device (44 rats, weight 2500 g, fall height 25 cm). Subsequently, we tested our model's usefulness for long-term studies on a behavioral, electrophysiological and histological level. Neurological, motor and memory deficits were assessed with the neurological severity score, open field, and novel object recognition tests, respectively. EEG/EMG recordings were performed in both SHAM (n= 7) and TBI (n= 7) rats before and 1, 7 and 28 days after trauma to evaluate sleep-wake proportions and posttraumatic implant stability. <b>Histological</b> <b>assessments</b> included hematoxylin and eosin staining for parenchymal damage and hemorrhage and amyloid precursor protein staining for diffuse axonal damage. All rats survived TBI without major neurological or motor deficits. Memory function was impaired after TBI at weeks 1, 2, 3 and recovered at week 4. EEG implants were stable for at least 1 month and enabled qualitative and quantitative sleep analyses. <b>Histological</b> <b>assessments</b> revealed no major bleedings or necrosis but intense diffuse axonal damage following TBI. In conclusion, this approach fulfills major preconditions for experimental TBI models and offers a possibility to electrophysiologically study behavioral states before and after trauma...|$|R

Methods Cross-sectional evaluation of dyspeptic subjects undergoing upper digestive endoscopy, including collection of biopsy specimens from the greater curvature of the antrum for assessment of H. pylori infection by histopathological study and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), from Portugal (n = 106) and Mozambique (n = 102) following the same standardized protocol. Results In the Portuguese sample the prevalence of infection was 95. 3 % by <b>histological</b> <b>assessment</b> and 98. 1 % by PCR. In the Mozambican sample the prevalence was 63. 7 % and 93. 1 %, respectively. Among those classified as infected by PCR, the sensitivity of <b>histological</b> <b>assessment</b> was 96. 2 % among the Portuguese and 66. 3 % among the Mozambican. Among those testing positive by both methods, 5. 0 % of the Portuguese and 20. 6 % of the Mozambican had mild density of colonization. Conclusions This study shows a lower sensitivity of <b>histological</b> <b>assessment</b> of H. pylori infection in Mozambican dyspeptic patients compared to the Portuguese, which {{may be explained by}} differences in the density of colonization, and may contribute to explain the heterogeneity in prevalence estimates across African settings. </p...|$|E

Male Sprague–Dawley rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (62 mg/kg).

40|$|Oxidative stress {{reflects}} an imbalance between {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) and antioxidants, which has been reported as an early unifying event {{in the development and}} progression of various diseases and as a direct and mechanistic indicator of treatment response. However, highly reactive and shortlived nature of ROS and antioxidant limited conventional detection agents, which are influenced by many interfering factors. Here, we present a two-photon sensing platform for in vivo dual imaging of oxidative stress at the single cell-level resolution. This sensing platform consists of three probes, which combine the turn-on fluorescent transition-metal complex with different specific responsive groups for glutathione (GSH), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl). By combining fluorescence intensity imaging and fluorescence lifetime imaging, these probes totally remove any possibility of crosstalk from in vivo environmental or instrumental factors, and enable accurate localization and measurement of the changes in ROS and GSH within the liver.
