Millard {{has said that he}} initially wrote the songs on the album as poems and then the band worked on the music, meaning the band didn't think much about the overall length of the songs. MercyMe further developed the sound of the album by looking to the work of The Beatles for inspiration.|$|E

Since its release, stand-alone {{copies of the}} games and the guitar controller have been released, including both RedOctane and third-party controllers from TAC and Nyko. MadCatz, another controller company that has produced guitar controllers, was set to initially {{be part of the}} game's development, creating a version of the game for the Xbox, but had to pull out due to a lawsuit by Komani; MadCatz's Darrel Richardson stated they had to pay $300,000 to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> contract with RedOctane.|$|E

25|$|The {{third wave}} also {{encountered}} severe flak, losing 6 aircraft. The troop carriers still made an accurate drop, placing 94 of 132 sticks on {{or close to}} the drop zone, {{but part of the}} DZ was covered by pre-registered German machine gun and mortar fire that inflicted heavy casualties before many troops could <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> chutes. Among the killed were two of the three battalion commanders and the executive officer (XO) of the 3rd Battalion, 506th PIR.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that the intense {{arrangement}} of the song owes much to their desire to be the most memorable band on the multi-act tours of the U.K. they were booked on in the early days. The repeating guitar riff and Burdon's screaming vocals did seem to ensure that of all the bands a crowd might see, the Animals were the group that people couldn't stop talking about and the song the one they couldn't <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads.|$|E

Ryan got in via the driver's door. Surpisingly, Pauline Jeziorski refused {{to get out of the}} car. She was persuaded by Ryan to get out, only to go back in the car to get her handbag. Paterson, realising Ryan was armed, returned inside the prison to get a rifle.|$|E

25|$|Lava {{flows in}} the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province {{are among the}} least hazardous, even though they can be {{enormously}} destructive to property in their path. This is because lava generally moves slowly enough for people to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way, though this {{is dependent on the}} viscosity of the lava. Lava flows typically have secondary hazards, including the destruction of buildings and ejection of volcanic gases. Forest fires started by lava flows are also a possibility in this part of Canada. The typical lava fountains in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province are commonly associated with lava flows, but these do not normally reach heights more than a few hundred metres. Therefore, the dangers caused by lava fountains are only adjacent to the erupting volcano.|$|E
25|$|In {{northern}} Italy, meanwhile, Catinat {{marched on}} Rivoli (with reinforcements from the Rhine and Catalan fronts), forcing the Duke of Savoy {{to abandon the}} siege and bombardment of Pinerolo (25 September – 1 October) before withdrawing to protect his rear. The resultant Battle of Marsaglia on 4 October 1693 ended in a resounding French victory. Turin now lay open to attack but further manpower and supply difficulties prevented Catinat from exploiting his gain, and all the French could <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> victory was renewed breathing-space to restock {{what was left of}} Pinerolo. Elsewhere, Noailles secured the valuable sea port of Rosas in Catalonia on 9 June before withdrawing into Roussillon. When his opponent, Medina-Sidonia, abandoned plans to besiege Bellver, both sides entered winter quarters. Meanwhile, the French navy achieved victory in its final fleet action of the war. On 27 June Tourville's combined Brest and Toulon squadrons ambushed the Smyrna convoy (a fleet of between 200–400 Allied merchant vessels travelling under escort to the Mediterranean) as it rounded Cape St. Vincent. The Allies lost approximately 90 merchantmen with a value of some 30 million livres.|$|E
25|$|Hart's {{imminent}} move to WCW {{created a}} tense situation, {{as he had}} won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1997 from The Undertaker. Hart's WCW contract was scheduled to begin on December 5, {{one month after the}} WWF's annual Survivor Series event, which was to be held in Montreal. Shawn Michaels, the leader of the emerging stable D-Generation X had been booked into a main event title match with Hart. McMahon, anxious for Hart to give up the title, sought Hart's consent to job to Michaels. Hart didn't want to give up the title to a member of The Kliq (which included Michaels, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Hunter Hearst Helmsley and Sean Waltman), apparently standing up {{for the rest of the}} locker room. As part of their rivalry storyline, Michaels had repeatedly performed acts insulting the Canadian flag and Canadian fans, which had also upset Hart. Wrestling fans also knew of Hart's long-standing personal difficulty with Michaels—Hart had been angered at Michaels' forfeiture of the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in February 1997, which ruined plans for a Hart–Michaels rematch at WrestleMania 13 where Michaels was expected to lose the title to him. Hart also believed that Michaels had faked a knee injury and talked about major surgery just to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> planned match. While Michaels denied rumors that he did not want to lose to Hart, and indeed Hart wound up winning the title shortly after Michaels relinquished it, Hart felt certain that Michaels would not have offered a loss in return if he had been staying with the WWF. The two had been involved in a real fight after Michaels implied that Hart was having an affair with WWF valet Sunny. The recent storyline rivalry had also seen Michaels make insulting remarks about Hart's father Stu Hart, which had left Bret and others in the Hart family upset. McMahon's offering of an estimated $3 million contract to Hart in 1996 had reportedly also upset Michaels.|$|E

[...] Although he noted a [...] "lack of so-called substance", David Amidon of PopMatters viewed that the mixtape's release helped materialize [...] "the positive influence of the internet on {{the next generation of}} hip-hop". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times cited its two singles as [...] "among the year's best hip-hop songs." ...|$|E
500|$|The route {{towards the}} hustings between the special constables was narrow, {{and as the}} inexperienced horses were thrust further and further into the crowd they reared and plunged as people tried to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way. The arrest warrant {{had been given to}} the Deputy Constable, Joseph Nadin, who {{followed}} behind the yeomanry. As the cavalry pushed towards the speakers' stand they became stuck in the crowd, and in panic started to hack about them with their sabres. On his arrival at the stand Nadin arrested Hunt, Johnson and a number of others including John Tyas, the reporter from The Times. Their mission to execute the arrest warrant having been achieved, the yeomanry set about destroying the banners and flags on the stand. According to Tyas, the yeomanry then attempted to reach flags in the crowd [...] "cutting most indiscriminately to the right and to the left to get at them" [...] – only then (said Tyas) were brickbats thrown at the military: [...] "From this point the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry lost all command of temper".|$|E
500|$|On {{realizing that}} NBC was {{switching}} {{away from the}} game, Goodman said to Lindemann by phone, [...] "Where the hell has our football game gone?" [...] During the station break which began with the network announcement, Goodman called a BOC phone to which only he knew the number and which {{was not part of}} NBC's CIrcle-7 exchange (which blew a fuse 26 times in an hour). When Cline answered it, Goodman ordered him {{to go back to the}} game. Although Cline knew there was no way to reconnect the feed, he promised to do the best he could. By the time the game ended at 7:07, thousands of viewers were calling the network to complain about missing the end of the football game. Others called newspapers, television stations, even the New York City Police Department, both to seek the final score, and simply to vent. Humorist Art Buchwald wrote [...] "Men who wouldn't <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> chairs in an earthquake rushed to the phone to scream obscenities [...]" [...] As people learned of the outcome, some became upset because Ridlehuber's touchdown meant the Raiders had won by more than the point spread of 7, and bets thought to be won were now lost. In Oakland, Gowdy and DeRogatis left the broadcast booth to tell Ellis that the final two minutes were the most exciting they had ever seen. Ellis replied, [...] "It's too bad America didn't see it." [...] Realizing that the original call had been lost, Ellis had the two sportscasters re-create their descriptions of the two Raider touchdowns on tape.|$|E

The Golani Brigade pushed in using Achzarit armored personnel carriers and armored bulldozers to clear away barricades. The Golani Brigade engaged the Palestinians in heavy street combat, forcing many to withdraw to {{the western part of}} the Casbah, where they were attacked by the Paratroopers Brigade. The Palestinians in the Casbah were deployed in small squads, consisting of two to four men, with each squad in charge of a sector.
