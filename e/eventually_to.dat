5|$|In March 2006, a {{visit to}} India led to renewed ties between the two countries, {{reversing}} decades of U.S. policy. The visit focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy and counter-terrorism cooperation, discussions that would lead <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement.|$|E
5|$|The Rynek Underground museum, {{under the}} main square, is an evocative modern display of Kraków's 1000+ {{years of history}} though its streets, {{activities}} and artifacts. This followed the massively extended excavations which started {{in a small way}} in 2005 and, as more and more was found, ran on <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> 2010.|$|E

5|$|The {{armed forces}} {{continued}} to expand after the 1977-8 war. The army expanded to 96,000 in 1980, of which combat forces made up 60,000. Thereafter the army grew to 115,000 and <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> 123,000 by 1984/85.|$|E
5|$|The initial National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} {{predicted that}} Katrina would begin turning northward after landfall, <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> hit the Florida Panhandle approximately {{three to four}} days later. Katrina, however, continued a westerly and west-southwesterly track, which eventually shifted the forecast track westward to New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|The {{story line}} took on many forms during production. His {{original}} idea featured a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters that he {{drew in a}} book as a child coming back to bother him as an adult. Each monster represented a fear he had, and conquering those fears caused the monsters <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> disappear.|$|E

5|$|A further twelve bodies, pending {{refinements}} {{of knowledge}} regarding their physical properties, were possible candidates {{to join the}} list under this definition. Some objects in this second list were more likely <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> be adopted as 'planets' than others. Despite what had been claimed in the media, the proposal did not necessarily leave the Solar System with only twelve planets. Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna and Eris, has said that at least 53 known bodies in the Solar System probably fit the definition, and that a complete survey would probably reveal more than 200.|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebellion}} {{at the start}} of the 19th century led to the rise of the progressive Sultan Mahmud II and <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> the Tanzimat period, which produced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the city. Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this period, and Istanbul was connected to the rest of the European railway network in the 1880s. Modern facilities, such as a water supply network, electricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Istanbul over the following decades, although later than to other European cities. The modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the third}} legend, a white horse of the Prince of Lhasa had wandered into Monpa region. People, who {{went in search of}} the horse, found the horse grazing at the present {{location}} of the monastery. The people of the area then worshipped the horse and the location where it was found and venerated it every year. <b>Eventually,</b> <b>to</b> honour the sacred site, the Tawang Monastery was built at the site.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the great}} success of the Troilus, the love story was popular as a free {{standing}} tale to be retold by English-language writers throughout the 15th and 16th centuries and into the 17th century. The theme was treated either seriously or in burlesque. For many authors, true Troilus, false Cresseid and pandering Pandarus became ideal types <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> be referred to together as such in Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Cascioferro {{never went}} to any school. When still young, Cascioferro married a teacher from Bisacquino, Brigida Giaccone, who {{instructed}} him {{how to read and}} write. He was inducted into the Mafia in the 1880s. He worked as a revenue collector as a young adult, using the position as a cover to carry out his protection racket. His criminal record began with an assault in 1884 and progressed through extortion, arson, and menacing, and <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> the kidnapping of the 19-year-old Baroness Clorinda Peritelli di Valpetrosa in June 1898, for which he received a three-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|From 1749 to the 1760s, Fort Chambray {{was built}} on the island of Gozo. It was {{intended}} to be a new fortified city like Valletta, and <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> replace the Cittadella as the island's capital. This was unsuccessful, and eventually only the fort was built. It saw some action during the French occupation of 1798, but its importance eventually diminished. It was converted into a hospital in the 19th century. In the 1990s, the interior of the fort began to be redeveloped, but the outer bastions and some barracks remain intact.|$|E

5|$|Gravitationally induced {{irregularities}} in Uranus's observed orbit led <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> {{the discovery of}} Neptune in 1846, and presumed {{irregularities in}} Neptune's orbit subsequently led to a search which did not find the perturbing object (it was later {{found to be a}} mathematical artefact caused by an overestimation of Neptune's mass) but did find Pluto in 1930. Initially believed to be roughly the mass of the Earth, observation gradually shrank Pluto's estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large; far too small to have influenced Neptune's orbit at all. In 1989, Voyager 2 determined the irregularities to be due to an overestimation of Neptune's mass.|$|E
5|$|Huaca de la Luna {{in what is}} now {{northern}} Peru is a large adobe temple {{built by}} the Moche people. The building went through a series of construction phases, growing <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> a height of about , with three main platforms, four plazas and many smaller rooms and enclosures. The walls were covered by striking multi-colored murals and freizes; those visible today date from about 400–610 AD.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the ferret-legging record {{stood at}} 40 seconds. A few years later, the record {{had risen to}} over one minute, and <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> 90 minutes. In 1977, Edward Simpkins from the Isle of Wight set the new world record of five hours and ten minutes, {{although}} he only had one ferret in his trousers during the first four hours and two for the last seventy minutes. Simpkins sustained two large bites during his record-breaking attempt, but continued {{to play a game}} of darts undeterred.|$|E
50|$|On Nyah's world, the {{emancipation}} {{of the women}} <b>eventually</b> led <b>to</b> open warfare between the sexes. The females won, usurping {{the political power of}} the men.

5|$|In 293, emperor Diocletian {{created a}} new {{administrative}} system (the tetrarchy), to guarantee security in all endangered regions of his Empire. He associated himself with a co-emperor (Augustus), and each co-emperor then adopted a young colleague given the title of Caesar, to share in their rule and <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> succeed the senior partner. The tetrarchy collapsed, however, in 313 {{and a few years}} later Constantine I reunited the two administrative divisions of the Empire as sole Augustus.|$|E
5|$|James Croll (1821–90) {{developed}} {{a theory of}} climate change based on changes in the Earth's orbit. Born near Perth, he was self-educated and his interest in science led to his becoming appointed as a janitor in the museum at the Andersonian College and Museum, Glasgow in 1859. His 1864 paper On the Physical Cause of the Changes of Climate during Glacial Epochs led to {{a position in the}} Edinburgh office of the Geological Survey of Scotland, as keeper of maps and correspondence, where Sir Archibald Geikie, encouraged his research. He was <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> become a Fellow of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{three out}} of the serial's twelve episodes have been recovered. 16mm copies of episodes 5 and 10 were {{returned}} in the early 1980s, under unclear circumstances (with rumour claiming they {{were found in the}} basement of a Mormon church). Episode 2 was returned in 2004 by former BBC engineer Francis Watson. He had come across the film in the 1970s, while clearing a projector testing room at the BBC's Ealing Studios. Instead of disposing of the film as instructed, he brought it home – <b>eventually</b> <b>to</b> return it to the Corporation when he realised the value of the material.|$|E

50|$|Hyperthyroidism due {{to certain}} types of {{thyroiditis}} can <b>eventually</b> lead <b>to</b> hypothyroidism (a lack of thyroid hormone), as the thyroid gland is damaged. Also, radioiodine treatment of Graves' disease often <b>eventually</b> leads <b>to</b> hypothyroidism. Such hypothyroidism may be treated by regular thyroid hormone testing and oral thyroid hormone supplementation.|$|R
