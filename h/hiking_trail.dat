5|$|The Long Path <b>hiking</b> <b>trail</b> follows in {{the woods}} closely {{alongside}} NY293 near its southern terminus. Since truck traffic cannot use US6, truck drivers may use NY293 to reach US9W.|$|E
5|$|The river affords {{some of the}} few {{remaining}} open spaces in Westchester County. Near Ardsley and Dobbs Ferry, the river passes through V. E. Macy Park, popular for picnicking and fishing in Woodlands Lake. Butternut Ridge Park contains Tarrytown Lakes and a <b>hiking</b> <b>trail.</b>|$|E
5|$|A geology party, {{headed by}} Manasseh Cutler, named the {{mountain}} in 1784. The Crawford Path, the oldest mountain <b>hiking</b> <b>trail</b> in the United States, was laid out in 1819 as a bridle path from Crawford Notch to the summit {{and has been in}} use ever since. Ethan Allen Crawford built a house on the summit in 1821, which lasted until a storm in 1826.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hiking</b> <b>Trails.</b> There {{are many}} marked <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> leading from parking lots in the {{surrounding}} forest that are easily accessible and frequently used.|$|R
50|$|Mount Fromme also {{contains}} a few <b>hiking</b> <b>trails.</b> Some trails are shared biking and <b>hiking</b> <b>trails.</b> Some <b>hiking</b> only <b>trails</b> include St.Georges which connects the Baden Powell Trail with Mountain Highway just before the seventh switchback, and Per Gynt which connects the seventh switchback to past the eighth.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{includes}} a Visitors' Centre and the Diepkloof Farm Museum. The reserve can be explored on foot using {{several of the}} day and overnight <b>hiking</b> <b>trails.</b> The overnight <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> are especially recommended.|$|R
5|$|Around 1939, the old aqueduct, {{which was}} now a popular <b>hiking</b> <b>trail,</b> started {{becoming}} a popular route with cyclists. Soon after, there was a proposal to redevelop the trail as a bike path. This proposal never came to fruition, although in the mid-1970s, the city built a separate bike path along Mosholu Parkway, the Bronx River Parkway, and Pelham Parkway between Jerome Avenue and Pelham Bay Park.|$|E
5|$|Ithan Valley Park is a 19-acre {{park that}} is {{adjacent}} to the creek. It contains a <b>hiking</b> <b>trail</b> and has fishing opportunities. Radnor Valley Country Club is a golf course that borders the creek. Formerly crossing the creek, it was redesigned in 1968 to run north-south along the creek due to construction of Interstate 476.|$|E
5|$|Anderson's efforts helped spark renewed {{interest}} in the trail, and Avery (who led the charge after Perkins’ death in 1932) {{was able to bring}} other states on board. Upon taking over the ATC, Avery adopted the more practical goal of building a simple <b>hiking</b> <b>trail.</b> He and MacKaye clashed over the ATC's response to a major commercial development along the trail's path; MacKaye left the organization, while Avery was willing to simply reroute the trail. Avery reigned as Chairman of the ATC from 1932 to 1952 (he died that same year).|$|E
5000|$|It {{includes}} 11.2 mi of <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> and 11.5 mi {{of public}} forest access roads. The <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> {{are part of}} the main North Country Trail and Onondaga Branch of the Finger Lakes Trail.|$|R

50|$|Long {{known for}} its walking and <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> of varying degrees of difficulty, the {{mountain}} air and ambiance attracts guests year round from around the world. Gstaad is also {{known for its}} ski and cross-country slopes and winter <b>hiking</b> <b>trails.</b>|$|R
5|$|Prospect Mountain {{originally}} {{had to use}} an incline railway car to access {{the house at the}} top where people could dance and eat. Construction on the railway began in January 1895 and cost $120,000 total. Construction was finished six months later, with the railway opening on June15, 1895. After failing financially, the railway system ceased operation in 1903. The area was bought and soon donated to the State of New York. The nearby <b>hiking</b> <b>trail</b> that heads up towards the mountaintop is part of the old railway.|$|E
5|$|Urban sprawl, air {{and water}} pollution, noise, light pollution, {{and a range of}} habitat {{restricted}} by human infrastructure put stress on the park's mammals and other animals, but the most serious immediate threat to them is roadkill. About 50,000 vertebrates a year die on the park's roads when they are hit by a vehicle. The RMD has few roads, but Picture Rocks Road, an east–west commuter highway crossing the TMD, is highly dangerous to wildlife. Attempts in 2002 to convert it to a <b>hiking</b> <b>trail</b> failed after the proposal met with stiff public resistance.|$|E
5|$|From there, NY454 {{turns to}} the southeast, {{intersecting}} with NY111 (Wheeler Road) and narrowing to two lanes. After turning further to the south, the highway intersects with CR67, the former alignment of the Long Island Motor Parkway. Here, NY454 returns to four lanes and meets the Long Island Expressway (Interstate495) and its frontage roads. The route enters the village of Islandia and enters a large commercial district, where the route intersects with CR100 (Old Nichols Road). After crossing the Long Island Rail Road, NY454 enters Connetquot River State Park, bends {{to the east and}} traverses the park. Crossing over the Connetquot River, the arterial crosses a <b>hiking</b> <b>trail</b> and soon leaves the park.|$|E
50|$|There are 13 mi of <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> in Mohican State Park, plus an {{additional}} 32 mi of <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> {{in the adjacent}} State Forest. The designated mountain bike trails and bridle paths are also available for the hiker to use.|$|R
50|$|There {{are a few}} Class 4 <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> {{around the}} base of the mountain, {{including}} the Lower Portals, and Cronan Creek Trails.A free iPhone GPS App is available to aid hikers in keeping to <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> within Mt Barney National Park.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a basic}} walk-in campground, over 12 mi of <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> and 6 mi of bridle paths. The horse {{trails are}} east of US 17 and the <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> (and most of the park) is west of US 17.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to flood damage, hurricane-force winds downed trees and power lines over large areas and many homes were damaged to varying degrees. An estimated 50,000residences were left without {{electricity in the}} region. The small coastal community of South East Bight sustained {{some of the most}} significant wind damage where entire fishing sheds were hurled into the air. Along the East Coast <b>hiking</b> <b>trail,</b> an estimated 5,000 trees were downed. In all, losses from the hurricane were placed at $200million, ranking it as the costliest cyclone in Newfoundland history. In terms of its overall impact, Igor was regarded as the worst storm of tropical origin to hit Newfoundland since 1935.|$|E
5|$|In Lillesand, the {{right-of-way}} {{has been}} converted to a road around the city center, although parts have been converted to a pedestrian path. Other parts have been reverted to agricultural land. From Storemyr, the route went through a forest, and has become an overgrown forestry road. From Eikeland to Tveite, the line {{has been converted}} to a <b>hiking</b> <b>trail.</b> At Birkleland, there are few remains of the line, although when leaving the village, part of the line {{is used as a}} pathway. Further along, the route is disused, but fenced in. The station buildings at Tveite and Flaksvand have been kept, the building at Lillesand has been preserved, while the station at Birkeland was dismounted because it was {{in the way of a}} new road.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania {{released}} $700,000 {{to design}} repairs {{on the remaining}} towers and plan development of the new park facilities in June 2005. In late 2005, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) put forward an $8million proposal for a new observation deck and visitors' center, with plans to allow access to the bridge and a <b>hiking</b> <b>trail</b> giving views of the fallen towers. The Kinzua Sky Walk was opened on September 15, 2011 in a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Sky Walk consists of a pedestrian walkway to an observation deck with a glass floor {{at the end of}} the bridge that allows views of the bridge and the valley directly below. The walkway cost $4.3million to construct, but is estimated to bring in $11.5million in tourism revenue for the region.|$|E

50|$|There are 15 <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> {{available}} for both day hikes and overnight backpack camping, the longest being the 56 km Liberty Lake trail. Resource issues {{have led the}} park to close some <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> in recent years such as the former Luxton Lake Trail.|$|R

5|$|While {{the initial}} lease with Darlington {{confined}} {{the park to}} between the railroad and the north bank of the Loyalhanna Creek, permission was later granted for construction of a bridge across the river, allowing expansion to {{the south in the}} mid-1880s. Three lakes, Woodland, St. Clair, and Bouquet, were dug between 1880 and 1896. In 1896, the park added a T.M. Harton Company steam carousel {{in the center of the}} park. The Pittsburgh-based company was a major manufacturer of carousels and roller coasters. By the end of the 19th century, attractions at the park included a bicycle track around Lake Bouquet, a <b>hiking</b> <b>trail</b> on the lake's island, fishing in the Loyalhanna Creek, rowboating, and many walks and gardens. The park had dining halls, auditoriums, pavilions, a boathouse, an amphitheater, a bandstand, and athletic facilities.|$|E
5|$|Ski touring {{takes place}} off-piste {{and outside of}} ski resorts. Tours may extend over {{multiple}} days. Typically, skis, bindings, and boots allow for free movement of the heel to enable a walking pace, as with Nordic disciplines and unlike Alpine skiing. Ski touring's subgenre ski mountaineering involves independently navigating and route finding through potential avalanche terrain and often requires familiarity with meteorology along with skiing skills. Ski touring can be faster and easier than summer hiking in some terrain, allowing for traverses and ascents that would be harder in the summer. Skis {{can also be used}} to access backcountry alpine climbing routes when snow is off the technical route, but still covers the <b>hiking</b> <b>trail.</b> In some countries, organizations maintain a network of huts for use by cross-country skiers in wintertime. For example, the Norwegian Trekking Association maintains over 400 huts stretching across thousands of kilometres of trails which hikers can use in the summer and skiers in the winter.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire, {{despite its}} {{relatively}} small size, {{is home to}} nine local public parks. Spring Lake Park, which is centered on an eponymous lake and sports a small beachhead, hosts Lincolnshire's festivities during the Fourth of July. North Park, a major sporting field and nature reserve in northeastern Lincolnshire, collaborates with Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103 to meet both the growing need for youth sports teams and extra recreational public park space; School District 103 also collaborated with the village of Lincolnshire to create an educational nature center called Rivershire Park, which is located in southeastern Lincolnshire. The nature center runs programs to educate district students and other visitors about the local ecology, alongside the natural fauna and flora of the Lake County area, and Memorial Park is a rest stop for pedestrians and cyclists traversing eastern Lincolnshire; Florsheim Nature Preserve, which sports an unusually high Floristic Quality Index rating, is shelter to endangered and threatened species of flora rarely found elsewhere in the county. Whytegate Park, an athletic complex overshadowed by nearby North Park, sports several sports courts and a fitness course, and Balzer Park {{is home to a}} short <b>hiking</b> <b>trail</b> and sports facilities. Lincolnshire's other two parks, Bicentennial Park and Olde Mill Park, are little more than playgrounds for local children.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are also}} 17.3 mi of <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> in the park, {{but these are}} seen as poor quality by hiking enthusiasts as their use by equestrian traffic has made the <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> like [...] "a plow had chattered down them".

5000|$|The park {{is better}} {{renowned for its}} {{extensive}} network of <b>hiking</b> <b>trails.</b> Nearly 26 mi of <b>hiking</b> <b>trails</b> wind through the terrain in the park, ranging in difficulty from a simple walk to moderately challenging. The most commonly used is the Waterfall trail, a 0.9 mi walk that culminates in a narrow canyon featuring a seasonal waterfall. Bicycling and horseback riding are permitted {{on many of the}} trails. In addition to the network of <b>hiking</b> <b>trails,</b> the 10 mi competitive track is designed for [...] "high speeds, challenging one's skills, and racing".|$|R
