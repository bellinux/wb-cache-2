5|$|Toscanini {{returned}} to La Scala in 1921 and remained in charge there until 1929, presenting Falstaff in every season. He took {{the work to}} <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria</b> in the late 1920s and the 1930s, conducting it in Vienna, Berlin and at three successive Salzburg Festivals. Among those inspired by Toscanini's performances were Herbert von Karajan and Georg Solti, who were among his répétiteurs at Salzburg. Toscanini's younger colleague Tullio Serafin continued to present the work in <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria</b> after Toscanini refused to perform there because of his loathing of the Nazi regime.|$|E
5|$|Academic Andrew Price-Smith {{has made}} the {{argument}} that the virus helped tip {{the balance of power in}} the later days of the war towards the Allied cause. He provides data that the viral waves hit the Central Powers before they hit the Allied powers, and that both morbidity and mortality in <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria</b> were considerably higher than in Britain and France.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution, much of modern-day <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria</b> were part of the Holy Roman Empire which had become a loose federation of kingdoms, principalities, free cities, bishoprics and other fiefdoms, each with its own system of measurement, though in most cases such system were loosely derived from the Carolingian system instituted by Charlemagne a thousand years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Following the Allies' May 1945 victory, the Soviets {{effectively}} occupied Central and Eastern Europe, while strong US and Western {{allied forces}} remained in Western Europe.

5|$|Most of the Germans {{responsible}} for {{the operation of the}} camp were captured and brought to trial. Several were extradited to Yugoslavia and executed. Camp commander Herbert Andorfer and his deputy Edgar Enge were arrested in the 1960s after many years of hiding. Both were given short prison sentences in West <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria,</b> respectively, though Enge never served any time given his old age and poor health.|$|E

Although banned in <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria,</b> SS reenacting groups thrive elsewhere, including in Europe and North America. In the United States alone, {{by the end of}} the 1990s there were 20 Waffen-SS reenactment groups, out of approximately 40 groups dedicated to German World War II units. In contrast, during that time there were 21 groups dedicated to the American units of the same era.|$|E

5|$|The {{declaration}} {{represented the}} first public support for Zionism by a major political power – its publication galvanized Zionism, which finally had obtained an official charter. In addition to its publication in major newspapers, leaflets were circulated throughout Jewish communities. These leaflets were airdropped over Jewish communities in <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria,</b> {{as well as the}} Pale of Settlement, which had been given to the Central Powers following the Russian withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria,</b> in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was going on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|From its {{beginnings}} in the 1930s, ski flying has developed its own distinct history and {{given rise to}} all of the sport's world records. The first hill designed specifically for ski flying was built in Slovenia in 1934, after which both <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria</b> built their own hills in 1950. This was followed by Norway in 1966, the United States in 1970, and the Czech Republic in 1980. From the 1960s to 1980s, a friendly rivalry between the European venues saw world records being set regularly, together with hill upgrades and evolutions in technique to fly longer distances.|$|E

5|$|The Allied powers {{organised}} {{war crimes}} trials, {{beginning with the}} Nuremberg trials, held from November 1945 to October 1946, of 23 top Nazi officials. They were charged with four counts—conspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity—in violation of international laws governing warfare. All but three of the defendants were found guilty and twelve were sentenced to death. The victorious Allies outlawed the NSDAP and its subsidiary organisations. The display or use of Nazi symbolism such as flags, swastikas or greetings is illegal in <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria</b> and other restrictions, mainly on public display, apply in various countries. See Swastika § Post–World War II stigmatization for details.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{campaign}} against the Catholic Church, hundreds of monasteries in <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria</b> were confiscated by the Gestapo and their occupants were expelled. In 1941 the Catholic Bishop of Münster, August von Galen, publicly protested against this persecution and against Action T4, the Nazi non-voluntary euthanasia programme under which the mentally ill, physically deformed, and incurably sick were to be killed. In a series of sermons that received international attention, he criticised the programme as illegal and immoral. His sermons led to a widespread protest movement among church leaders, the strongest protest against a Nazi policy up until that point. Bormann and others called for Galen to be hanged, but Hitler and Goebbels concluded that Galen's death would only {{be viewed as a}} martyrdom and lead to further unrest. Hitler decided {{to deal with the issue}} when the war was over.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1914, Beebe's {{pheasant}} monograph {{was essentially}} complete in manuscript. While the text was written by Beebe, the illustrations were provided by several artists: Robert Bruce Horsfall, who had accompanied Beebe on the expedition, painted the environmental scenes for the illustrations' backgrounds, while the pheasants themselves were painted by other artists including George Edward Lodge, Charles R. Knight, and Louis Agassiz Fuertes. Due to the elaborate nature of the book's color artwork, no American publisher was considered capable of reproducing it. The publisher which Beebe chose for his work was George Witherby and Sons of London, {{as a result of}} their success publishing the artwork of John James Audubon. The reproduction of the illustrations themselves was to be handled by several companies in <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria.</b> Reproductions of the illustrations were in the process of being printed when World War I began, holding up the completion of the project for the next four years.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Moser {{enrolled}} at the University of Innsbruck, taking classes in botany, zoology, geology, physics and chemistry. At this time, Austria was {{under the control of}} Nazi Germany and did not exist as an independent state. Moser became an authorised mushroom controller and instructor, and it was officially requested that he attend mycological seminars around <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria.</b> At these seminars, he met a number of prominent mycologists, including Ernst Thirring. Thirring showed Moser some of the issues surrounding the large genus Cortinarius, which remained an interest {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1943, aged 19 and after only three terms at Innsbruck, his studies were interrupted so he could perform military service. Having shown earlier promise in languages, he was trained as an interpreter, then sent to the Balkan Peninsula. He continued to show an active interest in mycology, collecting and identifying mushrooms and reading Rolf Singer's Das System der Agaricales.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{a modern}} soprano {{clarinet}} is equipped with numerous tone holes of which seven (six front, one back) are covered with the fingertips, and the rest are opened or closed using a set of keys. These tone holes let the player produce every note of the chromatic scale. On alto and larger clarinets, and a few soprano clarinets, key-covered holes replace some or all finger holes. The most common system of keys was named the Boehm system by its designer Hyacinthe Klosé in honour of flute designer Theobald Boehm, {{but it is not}} the same as the Boehm system used on flutes. The other main system of keys is called the Oehler system and is used mostly in <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> <b>Austria</b> (see History). The related Albert system is used by some jazz, klezmer, and eastern European folk musicians. The Albert and Oehler systems are both based on the early Mueller system.|$|E
