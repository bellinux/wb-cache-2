500|$|Quatermass 2 {{received}} mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} film “all good grisly fun, {{if this is}} the sort of thing you enjoy”. The reviewer in The Times remarked that “the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue. [...] At the end a detective says: “How am I going to make a report on all this?” <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way”.|$|E

6000|$|Her plea, swift, voiced in music, and {{illustrated}} by her pale face, glowing eyes, and sensitive lips, powerfully affected him. He towered over her in savage silence for a little while, then with effort he said: [...] "I don't see how I can do anything to you, for <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way--I mean I didn't believe in my mother's business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Later than that," [...] said Mrs. Challenger. [...] "As late {{as eight}} o'clock <b>I</b> {{distinctly}} <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> choking at my throat which {{came at the}} outset." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> but, {{in view of}} Sara Ray's tears, {{admit it}} I would not; so I sat in grum silence while the other tongues wagged.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> {{distance}} between my godmother and myself {{so much more}} after <b>the</b> birthday, and <b>felt</b> so sensible of filling a place in her house which {{ought to have been}} empty, that I found her more difficult of approach, though I was fervently grateful to her in my heart, than ever. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way towards my school companions; <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way towards Mrs. Rachael, who was a widow; and oh, towards her daughter, of whom she was proud, who came to see her once a fortnight! I was very retired and quiet, and tried to be very diligent.|$|R
60|$|But I {{understand}} how Swinburne felt {{when confronted by}} {{the image of the}} carven Christ, and, perplexed by the contrast between its claims and its consequences, he said his strange farewell to it, hastily indeed, but not without regret, not even really without respect. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> myself when I looked for the last time on the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
60|$|We landed, but it warn't as {{interesting}} as I {{thought it was going}} to be, because we couldn't find the place where they went in to git the treasure. Still, it was plenty interesting enough, just to see the mere hill itself where such a wonderful thing happened. Jim said he wou'dn't 'a' missed it for three dollars, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way.|$|E
60|$|That {{day about}} noon I looked {{back down the}} long gravel and greasewood slope which we had ascended and I saw the borax-mill now only a smoky blot on the desert floor. When we reached the pass between the Black Mountains and the Funeral Mountains we left the road, and were soon lost to the works of man. How strange a gladness, a relief! Something dropped away from me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> subtle change in Nielsen. For one thing he stopped talking, except an {{occasional}} word to the mules.|$|E
6000|$|JOHNNY. I nearly screamed when I {{saved my}} first German from living. <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> again. They say {{the human race}} {{has got to go}} on, but I say they've first got to prove that the human race wants to. Would you rather be alive or dead? ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{was news}} with a vengeance, and <b>I</b> no longer <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> desire to punch Jim's head which {{had come over}} me {{when he first came}} aboard with what I {{believed}} was a cock and bull story.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said as much. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{very much}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way when I was your age. And you like our prospects?... Well, you've thought things out. Neale, the {{building}} of the U. P. will be hell!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} that {{it was at the}} beginning of the month. The misfortunes which have since brought me so low had not then fallen on me; and yet, as I stood looking at you, I had the strangest prevision of calamity that was to come. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> absolute reliance on your power to help me that I felt when I first dreamed of you in Scotland. And I did the same familiar things. I laid my hand on your bosom. I said to you: 'Remember me. Come to me.' I even wrote--" ...|$|E

[...] "I have struck many a blow myself, but never have <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> ease of mind that of right belongs {{to a man who}} follows his reason, after slaying even a fawn when there was no call for his meat or hide, as I have felt at leaving a Mingo unburied in the woods, when following the trade of open and honest warfare." ...|$|E
60|$|And yet I found Colonel Ingram {{situated}} {{the same}} as the unlettered mechanics. He was not a free agent. He, too, was bound upon the wheel. I shall never forget the change in him when I mentioned Jackson's case. His smiling good nature vanished like a ghost. A sudden, frightful expression distorted his well-bred face. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> alarm that I had felt when James Smith broke out. But Colonel Ingram did not curse. That was the slight difference that was left between the workingman and him. He was famed as a wit, but he had no wit now. And, unconsciously, this way and that he glanced for avenues of escape. But he was trapped amid the palms and rubber trees.|$|E
60|$|It {{struck me}} the moment I {{finished}} speaking that this comparison {{was not quite}} right somehow; {{but he did not}} ask me to explain: he had evidently ceased to pay any attention to what I said. The girl looked at me with an expression of pity, not to say contempt, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time ashamed and vexed. This served to rouse a kind of dogged spirit in me, and I returned to the subject once more.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yet doubtless I don't {{estimate}} fairly {{the difficulties}} and hardships {{as they appear}} {{to the man who}} has never left England, and is not used to knocking about. <b>I</b> should have <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> years ago but for the thought of being with the Primate, at least I suppose so.|$|R
60|$|That {{seemed to}} satisfy them all. They couldn't {{get away from}} it. It {{seemed to me that}} from now on the thing was a walk-over. And <b>I</b> think George <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> for, when old Marshall asked him if he had had breakfast, he said he had not, went below, and pitched in as if he hadn't a care in the world.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> I {{picked up}} the candle and lit it, and then a most fearful thing happened. The old man picked himself up, and {{suddenly}} collapsed into a chair {{and began to cry}} like a child. Of course, I could see it was only the Artistic Temperament, but still, believe me, it was devilish unpleasant. I looked at old Bill. Old Bill looked at me. We shut the door quick, and after that we didn't know what to do. I saw Bill look at the sideboard, and I knew what he was looking for. But we had taken the siphon upstairs, and his ideas of first-aid stopped short at squirting soda-water. We just waited, and presently old Yeardsley switched off, sat up, and began talking with a rush.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was so struck," [...] {{the passage}} ran, [...] "by {{the grace and}} {{distinction}} of Miss Gwilt's manners that I took an opportunity, when {{she was out of}} the room, of asking how she first came to be governess. 'In the usual way,' I was told. 'A sad family misfortune, in which she behaved nobly. She is a very sensitive person, and shrinks from speaking of it among strangers--a natural reluctance which I have always felt it a matter of delicacy to respect.' Hearing this, of course, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> delicacy on my side. It was no part of my duty to intrude on the poor thing's private sorrows; my only business was to do what I have now done, to make sure that I was engaging a capable and respectable governess to instruct my grandchild." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were a few}} watery blinks of {{sunshine}} out of doors, and whenever these came through the old painted windows, {{some of the more}} vivid colors were faintly thrown upon the pavement of the cathedral,--very faintly, it is true; for, in the first place, the sunshine was not brilliant; and painted glass, too, fades {{in the course of the}} ages, perhaps, like all man's other works. There were two or three windows of modern manufacture, and far more magnificent, as to brightness of color and material beauty, than the ancient ones; but yet they looked vulgar, glaring, and impertinent in comparison, because such revivals or imitations of a long-disused art cannot have the good faith and earnestness of the originals. Indeed, in the very coloring, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> difference as between heart's blood and a scarlet dye. It is a pity, however, that the old windows cannot be washed, both inside and out, for now they have the dust of centuries upon them.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the slow}} one. It's another {{personal}} one. Again, not naming names, it's {{about someone who}} helped me through a lot and <b>I</b> thought she <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way that <b>I</b> did and then she really let me down. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, it was good that she did, because it was that final push to me figuring out myself. The lyrics are pretty self-explanatory".|$|R
6000|$|I {{was more}} fogged than ever. And not only fogged--wounded and resentful. I {{remember}} {{reading a book}} where a girl [...] "suddenly fled from the room, afraid to stay for fear dreadful things would come tumbling from her lips; determined {{that she would not}} remain another day in this house to be insulted and misunderstood." [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> much about <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|R
6000|$|When Shultz stalked up to {{the plate}} I shut my eyes a moment, and so still was it that the field and stands might have been empty. Yet, though I tried, I could not keep my eyes closed. I opened them to watch the Rube. <b>I</b> knew Spears <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as <b>I,</b> for he was blowing like a {{porpoise}} and muttering to himself: [...] "Mebee the Rube won't last an' I've no one to put in!" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{happened}} {{several times}} before I became so aroused that I determined to catch one of these fish or die. I fished and fished. I went {{to sleep in a}} camp-chair and absolutely ruined my reputation as an ardent fisherman. One afternoon, just after I had made a cast, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> old strange vibration of my line. I was not proof against it and I jerked. Lo! I hooked a fish that made a savage rush, pulled my bass-rod out of shape, and took all my line before I could stop him. Then he swept from side to side. I reeled him in, only to have him run out again and again and yet again. I knew I had a heavy fish. I expected him to break my line. I handled him gingerly. Imagine my amaze to beach a little fish that weighed scarcely more than two pounds! But it was a bonefish--a glistening mother-of-pearl bonefish. Somehow the obsession of these bonefishermen began to be less puzzling to me. Sam saw me catch this bonefish, and he was as amazed as I was at the gameness and speed and strength of so small a fish.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am afraid}} I cannot convey the {{peculiar}} sensations of time travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There {{is a feeling}} exactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless headlong motion! <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and I {{had come into the}} open air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous color like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.|$|E
60|$|After every means {{had been}} uselessly {{exhausted}} to persuade Marble from his design, it only remained {{to do all}} we could to make him comfortable and secure. Of enemies, there was no danger, and care was not necessary for defence. We got together, however, some of the timber, planks and other materials, that were remaining at the shipyard, and built him a cabin, that offered much better shelter against the tropical storms that sometimes prevailed, than any tent could yield. We made this cabin as wide as a plank is long, or twelve feet, and some five or six feet longer. It was well sided and tightly roofed, having three windows and a door. The lights of the wreck supplied the first, and her cabin-door the last. We had hinges, and everything that was necessary to keep things in their place. There was no chimney required, fire being unnecessary for warmth in that climate; but the French had brought their camboose from the wreck, and this we placed under a proper covering at {{a short distance from}} the hut, the strength of one man being insufficient to move it. We also enclosed, by means of ropes, and posts made of the ribs of the wreck, a plot of ground of two acres in extent, where the land was the richest and unshaded, so as to prevent the pigs from injuring the vegetables; and, poor Marble knowing little of gardening, I had a melancholy pleasure in seeing the whole piece dug, or rather hoed up, and sown and planted myself, before we sailed. We put in corn, potatoes, peas, beans, lettuce, radishes, and several other things, of which we found the seeds in the French garden. We took pains, moreover, to transport from the wreck, many articles that it was thought might prove of use, though they were too heavy for Marble to handle. As there were near forty of us, all busy in this way for three or four days, we effected a great deal, and may be said to have got the island in order. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> interest in the duty, that I should in bestowing a child for life.|$|E

5000|$|... • Bonaparte: The {{narrator of}} this story. It’s not {{clear from the}} story the {{relationship}} between Bonaparte and the author, but given O’Connor’s role in the I.R.A some comparisons may well be drawn. Bonaparte has the responsibility of telling a terrible and chilling story about a war of independence. These stories are {{a testament to the}} butchery and futility of war. The last paragraph of the story best describes the effect this episode had on both Bonaparte and Noble. Communicating on what happened in the bog to the old lady without saying what they did, the description by Noble by the little patch of bog stiffening into it, and Bonaparte “very lost and lonely like a child, a stray in the snow. And anything that happened to me afterwards, <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> about again." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{took the}} {{sleeping}} draught which you had so kindly given me, {{but for a}} long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind. All of them connected with death, and vampires, with blood, and pain, and trouble." [...] Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly, [...] "Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this. You will find it in my diary which I shall show you later. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence. I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me. Beside the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist, or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared, stood a tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of the others. The waxen face, the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line, the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between, and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was paralyzed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he spoke to Jonathan.|$|E
