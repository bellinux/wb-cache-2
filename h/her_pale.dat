500|$|Herman Bang's {{novel was}} {{inspired}} by an incident in 1883 when he was passing through Skørping Station {{in the north of}} Jutland. He noticed a young woman at the window who, <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> face couched in her hands, stared after his departing train. In the introduction to Stille Eksistenser he explains: [...] "For the rest of the journey, I could see the woman's face between the flowers. Her look was not quite one of longing — longing would have perhaps fluttered to death by breaking its wings in such tight confines — just a quite resignation, a waning sorrow. And when the train had slid by, she would be peering out with the same look over Egnens Lyng — over the dreary plain." ...|$|E
500|$|The Nightmare likely {{influenced}} Mary Shelley in a {{scene from}} her famous Gothic novel Frankenstein (1818). Shelley would have been familiar with the painting; her parents, Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin, knew Fuseli. The iconic imagery associated with the Creature's murder of the protagonist Victor's wife seems to draw from the canvas: [...] "She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down, and <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> and distorted features half covered by hair." [...] The novel and Fuseli's biography share a parallel theme: just as Fuseli's incubus is infused with the artist's emotions in seeing Landholdt marry another man, Shelley's monster promises to get revenge on Victor {{on the night of}} his wedding. Like Frankenstein's monster, Fuseli's demon symbolically seeks to forestall a marriage.|$|E
500|$|The {{influence}} of van Eyck {{can be seen}} in the delicate rendering of the textures and details of the dress, trimmings and adornments. <b>Her</b> <b>pale</b> skin and strong bone structure is strongly van Eyckian, and recalls the male sitter in his Arnolfini Portrait. But in other ways Christus abandons the developments made by van Eyck and Robert Campin. He reduces the emphasis on volume of those artists, in favour of an elongation of form; [...] the narrow, slight upper body and head are, according to the art historian Robert Suckale, [...] "heightened by the V-shaped neckline of the ermine and the cylindrical hat." [...] Further, while the first generation of Early Netherlandish painters benefited from the patronage of the newly emerging middle class, secularising portraiture, and removing it from the preserve of royalty, Christus renders the girl as aristocratic, haughty, sophisticated, and exquisitely dressed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nell! Do you hear? Pedro's {{fighting}} the bear," [...] burst out Bo. <b>Her</b> face <b>paled,</b> <b>her</b> eyes flashed like blue steel. [...] "The bear 'll kill him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, nor {{to those}} who have no {{complexion}} to lose," [...] she cried, with a triumphant look at the two maidens, who certainly had not the lilies nor the roses that she believed herself to have, though, in truth, her imprudences had left <b>her</b> <b>paler</b> and less pretty than at Winchester.|$|R
60|$|In an hour she returned. Her {{lips were}} firm set, <b>her</b> cheeks <b>pale,</b> <b>her</b> eyes red with weeping. She {{said nothing to}} her mother, who for her part did not seem {{inclined}} to allude again to the matter.|$|R
500|$|Virginia was {{described}} as having dark hair and violet eyes, with skin so pale it was called [...] "pure white", causing a [...] "bad complexion that spoiled her looks". One visitor to the Poe family noted that [...] "the rose-tint upon her cheek was too bright", possibly a symptom of her illness. Another visitor in Fordham wrote, [...] "Mrs. Poe looked very young; she had large black eyes, and a pearly whiteness of complexion, which was a perfect pallor. <b>Her</b> <b>pale</b> face, her brilliant eyes, and her raven hair gave her an unearthly look." [...] That unearthly look was mentioned by others who suggested it made her look not quite human. William Gowans, who once lodged with the family, described Virginia as a woman of [...] "matchless beauty and loveliness, her eye could match that of any houri, and her face defy the genius of a Canova to imitate". She {{might have been a}} little plump. Many contemporary accounts as well as modern biographers remark on her childlike appearance even {{in the last years of}} her life.|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} was photographed by Björk's former boyfriend, the French {{director}} Stéphane Sednaoui. It shows the singer {{standing in a}} London street, <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> skin and dark hair contrasting with the vivid colours of the Japanese-inspired signs behind her. An earlier shoot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino was scrapped; it would later appear in a 1995 article for The Face, in which Björk explained: [...] "It cost £24,000. But now I know what I want. OK, I admit it, [...] I'm a pop star"! In the original cover picture, Björk was surrounded by silver balls, but she scrapped the cover in favour of something [...] "more poppy". Designer Paul White of Me Company—who had been a frequent collaborator since The Sugarcubes—"surrounded her with giant postcards to represent communication with friends and family". Me Company designed the artwork, while Martin Gardiner modelled the lotus flower used in the album's booklet and packaging. The jacket Björk wears, shown on the cover, was inspired by Royal Mail airmail envelopes, referencing the album's title. It was specially crafted from envelope paper called Tyvek by designer Hussein Chalayan. Björk {{was a friend of}} Chalayan and an admirer of his designs, modelling for him in September 1995. The jacket is displayed under glass at Hard Rock Reykjavík, and was part of a 2015 MoMA retrospective on the singer, titled Björk. Vice has identified the airmail jacket look as one the [...] "ultimate fashion moments" [...] of Björk's career.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{different}} verses were written, but the Edge advocated {{those with}} a [...] "nursery rhyme feel", such as [...] "Johnny, take a walk with your sister in the moon / Let <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> light in to fill up the room." [...] He also composed the chorus' reassuring line, [...] "It's all right / It's all right / It's all right," [...] wanting to prove a point since no prior U2 song contained the line.|$|E
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} looking up, {{he found}} <b>her</b> strangely <b>pale</b> and quivering.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is Cliff!" [...] {{she cried}} out. [...] "He's on our trail!" [...] And {{into her face}} came a look of alarm. <b>Her</b> lips <b>paled,</b> <b>her</b> eyes widened. [...] "He's mad--he's dangerous! Leave him to me," [...] she added, in a low, tense voice.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} {{movement}} at the further end of the room. A curtain was drawn back and Isabel Worth came slowly towards them. She stood there, the curtains {{on either side of}} <b>her,</b> ghastly <b>pale,</b> <b>her</b> hands clasped in front of her, twitching nervously.|$|R
2500|$|From {{the next}} room, {{the sound of}} the {{orchestra}} is heard and the guests move there to dance. After a series of severe coughs and almost fainting, Violetta begins to feel dizzy and asks her guests to go ahead and to leave her to rest until she recovers. While the guests dance in the next room, Violetta looks at <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> face in her mirror. Alfredo enters and expresses his concern for her fragile health, later declaring his love for her (Alfredo, Violetta: Un dì, felice, eterea – [...] "One day, happy and ethereal"). At first, she rejects him because his love means nothing to her, but there is something about Alfredo that touches her heart. He is about to leave when she gives him a flower, telling him to return it when it has wilted, which will be the very next day.|$|E
2500|$|Hunt {{began writing}} in 1985, {{and her first}} book was her autobiography, Real Life: The Story of a Survivor (1986). She found {{the process of writing}} more {{difficult}} than she expected, but did not stop there, continuing in 1996 with another autobiography, Repossessing Ernestine: A Granddaughter Uncovers the Secret History of Her American Family, about her search for her father's mother Ernestine who was placed in an asylum for nearly 50 years. After Hunt's father committed suicide when she was twelve years old, Hunt's contact with her father's family was sporadic. Hunt tracked down her father's father Blair Hunt shortly before he died in 1978 to find him living sedately in a seedy part of town with his companion of 60 years. Hunt discovered that her grandfather had been a public school administrator and a leading member of Memphis's black community. Blair Hunt talked about his [...] "poor dear sick wife" [...] who he had [...] "put away" [...] many years before. Hunt discovered that her father's mother, Ernestine, had been born in 1896 as a free black and that she grew up in Memphis, [...] "an intelligent, remarkably beautiful young woman who excelled in school and was greatly envied for <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> skin, blue eyes and blonde hair." [...] Hunt tracked her grandmother down to a rundown nursing home, and although Hunt was unable to discover why Ernestine spent 50 years behind bars, Hunt wrote that the reasons may have {{had more to do with}} racism and sexism than insanity.|$|E
2500|$|She {{had been}} buried over 2,400 {{years ago in a}} casket {{fashioned}} from the hollowed-out trunk of a Siberian larch tree. On the outside of the casket were stylized images of deer and snow leopards carved in leather. Shortly after burial the grave had apparently been flooded by freezing rain, and the entire contents of the burial chamber had remained frozen in permafrost. Six horses wearing elaborate harnesses had been sacrificed and lay {{to the north of the}} chamber. The maiden's well-preserved body, carefully embalmed with peat and bark, was arranged to lie on her side as if asleep. She was young, and her hair was shaven off but wearing a wig and tall hat; she had been 167 cm (5 feet 6inches) tall. Even the animal style tattoos were preserved on <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> skin: creatures with horns that develop into flowered forms. Her coffin was made large enough to accommodate the high felt headdress she was wearing, which was decorated with swans and gold-covered carved cats. She was clad in a long crimson and white striped woolen skirt and white felt stockings. Her yellow blouse was originally thought to be made of wild [...] "tussah" [...] silk but closer examination of the fibers indicate the material is not Chinese but was a wild silk which came from somewhere else, perhaps India. Near her coffin was a vessel made of yak horn, and dishes containing gifts of coriander seeds: [...] all of which suggest that the Pazyryk trade routes stretched across vast areas of Iran. Similar dishes in other tombs were thought to have held Cannabis sativa, [...] confirming a practice described by Herodotus but after tests the mixture was found to be coriander seeds, probably used to disguise the smell of the body.|$|E

60|$|He stopped, as <b>her</b> face <b>paled</b> again, and <b>her</b> hands dropped heavily at her side.|$|R
60|$|Jeanne stood {{a little}} apart. She avoided the Princess' hands. She stood upon the soft turf {{with her hands}} clasped, <b>her</b> cheeks very <b>pale,</b> <b>her</b> eyes bright with some inward excitement.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} in a streak of sunlight; <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> cheeks flushed; <b>her</b> <b>pale,</b> half-opened lips red; her eyes, in their setting of short black lashes, wide and mutinous; her young round bosom heaving {{as if she had}} been running.|$|E
60|$|Another {{moment and}} Elizabeth was at hand, horror written on <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> face.|$|E
60|$|She started erect, and {{he could}} see <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> face glow with joy.|$|E
60|$|Lady Bellamy {{could bear}} it no longer. She sprang up from <b>her</b> chair, <b>pale</b> with anger.|$|R
6000|$|Her sight was dizzy, <b>her</b> cheek <b>pale,</b> <b>her</b> breath {{seemed to}} have deserted her. She looked up to heaven, she looked down upon the letter, and then she covered it with a {{thousand}} kisses; then, making a vigorous effort to collect herself, she read its strange and sweet contents:-- ...|$|R
5000|$|The term sesquimorphism (the Latin numeral prefix sesqui- means one-and-one-half, so {{halfway between}} mono- (one) and di- (two)) has been {{proposed}} for bird species in which [...] "both sexes have basically the same plumage pattern, though the female is clearly distinguishable by reason of <b>her</b> <b>paler</b> or washed-out colour". [...] Examples include Cape sparrow (Passer melanurus), rufous sparrow (subspecies P. motinensis motinensis), and saxaul sparrow (P. ammodendri).|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him breathlessly. Anger turned <b>her</b> <b>pale.</b> She reached for the cord.|$|E
60|$|Nehushta {{glanced at}} her mistress, now fast asleep, <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> face resting on her arm.|$|E
60|$|She swayed {{as if her}} {{strength}} were failing her, and again <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> lips moved.|$|E

60|$|Marie Antoinette {{listened in}} {{increasing}} horror and anger. A flush crept into <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Her voice, <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> face, her intense eyes, and her tense contralto voice {{softened}} his resentment.|$|E
60|$|She paused, {{and a deep}} blush, partly of shame, partly of wrath, suffused <b>her</b> <b>pale</b> cheeks.|$|E
60|$|She rode away, {{looking back}} smiling and kissing her hand, but Eleanor's eyes grew wide and <b>her</b> cheeks <b>pale.</b>|$|R
60|$|Was it his fancy, or {{was there}} a gleam of {{satisfaction}} about <b>her</b> still, <b>pale</b> face? He went on.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the last}} time that ever Aleck was afraid of a margin; at least afraid enough to let it break <b>her</b> sleep and <b>pale</b> <b>her</b> cheek to the extent that this first {{experience}} in that line had done.|$|R
