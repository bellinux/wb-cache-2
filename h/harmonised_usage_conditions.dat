This paper introduces a new model for SoC estimation given instantaneous measurements of current and voltage using a Switching Markov State-Space Model.

40|$|Abstract: With the {{diversity}} of <b>usage</b> <b>conditions</b> affecting the consumption of multimedia content, the adaptation of dynamic and interactive multimedia presentations is essential. The challenge consists in allowing a multimedia presentation to adapt in all its dimensions: spatially, temporally and interactively, without lessening its attractiveness and still giving the author the control over adapted versions. Additionally, the authoring of adaptable content should not increase the complexity of authoring. To address this challenge, we propose to transpose the concept of scalability {{to the world of}} multimedia documents by introducing the so-called Scalable MSTI model. In this paper, we show the properties of this model and how, from an authoring point of view, scalable multimedia documents can be created to address a wide range of <b>usage</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

Within this study X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been performed on nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cells subjected to vibration. This study found that vibration causes the removal of the selectively-formed surface film created during a cell’s first cycles and replaces it with the surface film from electrolyte decomposition. The surface films formed by vibration are composed of much higher concentrations of organic electrolyte decomposition products than the film from the control cell. The impact of this chemical mechanism is an increased level of cell degradation. This is exhibited in increased capacity fade and cell impedance. This is the first study presented within the academic literature which has identified an electro-mechanical mechanism responsible for the performance degradation in lithium-ion cells from vibration...|$|R

Bayesian optimal design is a method of decision theory under uncertainty, which uses historical data and expert information to find the optimal test plan. Different expected utility functions can be selected as objectives. This paper presents a method for Bayesian optimal design of ADT, based on the inverse Gaussian process and considering three objectives for the optimization: relative entropy, quadratic loss function, and Bayesian D-optimality. The Markov chain Monte Carlo and the surface fitting methods are used to obtain the optimal plan. By sensitivity analysis and a proposed efficiency factor, the Bayesian D-optimality is identified as the most robust and appropriate objective for Bayesian optimization of ADT.
