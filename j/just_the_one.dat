25|$|Bresnan was {{selected}} as the first seamer for the opening test against the West Indies, but he suffered disappointment, ending the match with <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> wicket. He was also dismissed for a duck in his only innings, although England {{went on to win the}} match. He retained his place in the second test, taking eight wickets in the match and taking 4–37 in the second innings. He also chipped in with a useful 39 not out. With the series won, England made several changes for the final Test, although Bresnan kept his place and opened the bowling. Bresnan took 4–34 in the first ODI, but was less successful in the second match, taking <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> wicket.|$|E

25|$|Three {{years later}} he turned out in a List A match for Dorset in the 1st round of the 2004 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy against Buckinghamshire which was played in 2003.

25|$|He debuted for Pakistan aged 22 in March 1993, playing both ODI and Test cricket in {{a tour of}} the Caribbean.

While at Gillingham, he had played 178 matches and scored 10 goals. A move to Southern League side Romford followed in December 1971, before moves to Hitchin Town and Dunstable Town.

25|$|His cricket {{career began}} {{over seven years}} after he played his last VFL game and he was aged 36 {{when he made his}} {{first-class}} debut against Tasmania. The Victorian opening pair in the first innings of Fred Baring and Basil Onyons were also league footballers, as was their wicket-keeper Stuart King. Ellis came in at three and made <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> run before being dismissed. He made amends in the second innings with a century. His even hundred allowed Victoria to chase their fourth innings target of 182 with five wickets in hand.|$|E

His debut for Devon came against the Surrey Second XI in 1926, with Jennings playing Devon from 1926 to 1933. Starting in 1935, Jennings began umpiring in the Minor Counties Championship, standing in 87 matches between 1935 and 1962.

25|$|An opening batsman, Davie {{made his}} {{first-class}} {{debut in the}} 1921/22 summer, for Tasmania against Victoria at Launceston. He scored 56 in both innings and also claimed the wicket of Clarrie Grimmett. Victoria's wicket-keeper in that match, Jim Atkinson, played in the VFL and had also been Davie's opponent {{when he made his}} league debut. Davie played another first-class match a year later and then did not make another appearance until 1927, this time a Sheffield Shield fixture for Victoria. It was his final match and he finished his cricket career with 179 runs at 35.80 and <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> wicket at a total cost of 167 runs.|$|E

Unlike the semi-final series, scoring started immediately in the championship series, with South Australia scoring {{in the top of}} the first inning: Jeremy Cresswell singled and then advanced to third when Stefan Welch reached on a throwing error by catcher Grant Karlsen. Michael Collins and Ryan Murphy each walked in consecutive plate appearances, advancing Cresswell to score the first run. Before the inning could be closed out, Welch scored on a wild pitch to extend South Australia's lead to two.|$|E
25|$|Alex Loudon rebuilt well, however, {{with just}} 20 of his 73 runs coming in boundaries, while his first partner Jonathan Trott failed to hit any runs and {{probably}} did the team a favour when he edged a ball from Robert Joseph - cousin of West Indies batsman Sylvester Joseph - behind, gone for 10 off 40 balls. The wicket {{looked like it}} was the first of a collapse, however, as Tony Frost departed shortly afterwards with Warwickshire on 62 for 6. However, Trevor Penney made 42 - including <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> four - in a 77-run partnership with Loudon, and Dougie Brown made an unbeaten 16 at the end to lead Warwickshire home with five balls to spare.|$|E

In contrast to the established ceremonies of religious or registry office authorities, in celebrant ceremonies many decisions about the content are chosen by the couple. Therefore, the civil celebrant has come to be defined as a professionally trained ceremony-provider who works in accordance with the wishes of the client couple. The task may be like an architect who is charged with designing a dream home for a couple who need expert help. In this sense the celebrant is not <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who performs the ceremony according to law, but its facilitator, the couple's adviser, the resource person, the co-creator of the ceremony, and the rehearsal-director.|$|E
25|$|Through {{most of the}} Victorian era until {{towards the}} end, the lapels were cut {{separately}} and sewn on later, apparently because it made the lapel roll more elegantly. The revers {{from the inside of}} the coat wrapped over to the front, creating a small triangle of silk, while the outer half was cut from two strips of the body fabric. This was a feature of double-breasted frock coats used on all such coats, but morning and dress coats, which had previously followed this practice, began to be made with attached lapels (wholecut) around the end of the Edwardian era. Through the Victorian era, a row of decorative button holes was created down the lapel edge, but by Edwardian period these were reduced down to <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> lapel boutonnière button hole.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} their Spring training schedule {{two days}} prior, the Atlanta Braves began their season on Opening Day as the guests for the New York Mets home opener at Citi Field on April 5. Tommy Hanson, making the first Opening Day {{start of his}} career, faced Mets ace Johan Santana, who was making his first Major League appearance since September 2010. The first game proved {{to be dominated by}} defense and pitching. In the bottom of the sixth, Mets third baseman David Wright singled home center fielder Andrés Torres to give the Mets a 1–0 advantage, which would end up being the final score of the game. Hanson took the loss, giving up <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> earned run in five plus innings of work. Kris Medlen and Jonny Venters followed with three scoreless innings in relief, but the offense could never find the scoreboard.
