5|$|The opening {{sequence}} where {{soccer is}} portrayed as the most boring sport imaginable was intended to show that soccer was more boring on television than live, but both Michels and Groening enjoy the game. The referee at the game is a caricature of the janitor at Film Roman, who supplied director Pete Michels with <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> soccer information he needed to design the episode. Pelé also makes an appearance at the match, although he is voiced by Hank Azaria.|$|E
5|$|While other {{companies}} marketed directly to foreign air forces, {{as part of}} the FX program, the F-5G could only be marketed by the State Department. Under this policy umbrella, Northrop had to submit <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> marketing material to government review, which could take months. The State Department had no interest in selling the FX; from its perspective it was one aircraft among many, leading to a lackadaisical approach, and led to complaints from Northrop that the government was not promoting the F-20 enough.|$|E
5|$|Kamohoali'i is {{the best}} known and revered of the shark gods, he was the older and favored brother of Pele, and helped and journeyed with her to Hawaii. He was able to assume all human and fish forms. A summit cliff on the crater of Kilauea {{is one of his}} most sacred spots. At one point he had a heiau (temple or shrine) {{dedicated}} to him on <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> land that jutted into the ocean on the island of Molokai. Kamohoali'i was an ancestral god, not a human who became a shark and banned the eating of humans after eating one herself. In Fijian mythology, Dakuwaqa was a shark god who was the eater of lost souls.|$|E

5|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the difficulties Mulder and Scully have with dealing with the Native American population, stemming from the experience of the locals with the FBI at the Wounded Knee incident in 1973. Goodensnake's sister Gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death. Despite these misgivings, the agents find a seeming ally in Sheriff Charles Tskany, who permits Scully to make a cursory examination of Goodensnake's body, but forbids a full autopsy. They discover that he had elongated canines, similar to those of an animal, and bears long-healed scars similar to those borne by Lyle. After parting ways with the Sheriff, Scully asks Mulder why it seems he is expecting <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> evidence they have come across. Mulder informs Scully that forty years previously there was a similar incident in the area, which was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover and became the FBI's first X-File case.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of Egypt was already well developed before Ibn Tulun's arrival, {{with a number}} of departments (dīwāns) responsible for the collection of the land tax, the supervision of the post, the public granaries (dīwān al-ahrāʿ), the Nile Delta lands (dīwān asfal al-arḍ), and possibly a privy purse (dīwān al-khaṣṣ) for the governor's personal use. A chancery (dīwān al-inshāʾ) possibly also already existed, or else was established under Ibn Tulun, when he remodelled the Egyptian administration after the Abbasid central government. Most of the officials employed by Ibn Tulun were like him trained in the caliphal court at Samarra. Ibn Tulun's chancellor was the capable Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Abd al-Kan (died 891), while other important positions in the administration were held by the four Banu al-Muhajir brothers and Ibn al-Daya. Al-Balawi also reports several anecdotes about Ibn Tulun's extensive use of spies and his own ability to uncover spies sent against him, and claims that the chancery was established so that Ibn Tulun could check up on <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> correspondence with the caliphal court.|$|E

25|$|Beatrix's {{constitutional}} duties included those typically {{accorded to}} a head of state; this includes having to sign <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> legislation before it becomes law, formally appointing various officials, receiving and accrediting ambassadors, and awarding honours and medals, among others. Outside of these constitutional duties, her other informal roles included being the highest representative of the kingdom internationally {{and to be a}} unifying figure locally.|$|E
50|$|Also of {{historical}} note {{was that the}} operating system (OSIRIS), applications, development tools, and <b>every</b> other <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> BiiN software was written exclusively in Ada — perhaps the largest non-military use of that programming language.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the broad}} {{public support for}} the bill, some federal {{departmental}} staff initially opposed the bill suggesting it could cost up to $384 million to upgrade all of Canada's lighthouses to heritage standards. Supporters of the bill called these numbers inflated, pointing out that it assumes that <b>every</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> navigational equipment in the country, including hundreds of steel towers and floating buoys, would be designated whereas even the strongest proponents only anticipate the nomination of a select number of landmark lighthouses. They also noted that the bill leaves control of the number of designations, and any associated, costs, with the minister.|$|R
25|$|Sun Quan {{eventually}} {{discovered the}} truth, understood {{the gravity of}} the situation, and had Lü Yi removed from office and executed. Throughout this entire saga, Bu Zhi wrote to Sun Quan numerous times, recommending him to rehabilitate Lü Yi's victims and defending those who were wrongly accused. Sun Quan, however, did not accept <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> advice from Bu Zhi. Nevertheless, Bu Zhi's efforts ultimately saved many officials from doom.|$|E
25|$|In August 1913, Jupiters trials almost ended {{before they}} began. While {{underway}} off the coaling station in Tiburon, California {{in preparation for}} its shakedown cruise, Jupiter took evasive action to avoid an accidental collision with a passing submarine. During the sudden maneuver, a fuse on the main electrical panel blew, shutting down <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> machinery on the ship, including its steering. With only four minutes before the ship would run aground, Robinson restored power; Jupiter got underway with 30 seconds to spare.|$|E
25|$|Robert Boyle (1627–1691) {{pioneered the}} {{scientific}} method in chemical investigations. He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> relevant data. Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, {{the position of the}} Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant. This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of Lavoisier and John Dalton.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} {{scale is}} a system whereby financial criminal penalties (fines) in legislation have maximum levels set against a standard scale.

50|$|Any {{invisible}} ink {{can be made}} visible by someone who is sufficiently determined, but the limitation is generally time available {{and the fact that}} one cannot apply hours of effort to <b>every</b> single <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> paper.

25|$|Almost <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> metal is an alloy of {{one type}} or another. Copper, aluminium, and other base metals are {{occasionally}} alloyed with beryllium, {{which is a}} highly toxic metal. When a metal like this is welded or cut, high concentrations of toxic beryllium fumes are released. Long-term exposure to beryllium may result in shortness of breath, chronic cough, and significant weight loss, accompanied by fatigue and general weakness. Other alloying elements such as arsenic, manganese, silver, and aluminium can cause sickness {{to those who are}} exposed.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} to the forensic work, detectives were also tracing the origin of <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> luggage that had been checked onto PA 103, either in London or through the Interline baggage system. Interline baggage is baggage checked onto a flight in one location and automatically routed by the airline to other locations. It is the weak link in airline security, because provided it is tagged correctly a bag not properly x-rayed by a low-risk airline in a low-risk airport may be routed without further checks through several other airports to high-risk airlines.|$|E
25|$|The {{main focus}} of the Nong Shu written by Wang was the realm of Chinese agriculture. His book listed and {{described}} an enormous catalogue of agricultural tools and implements {{used in the past}} and in his own day. Furthermore, Wang incorporated a systematic usage of illustrated pictures in his book to accompany <b>every</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> farming equipment described. Wang also created an agricultural calendrical diagram {{in the form of a}} circle, which included the Heavenly Stems, the Earthly Branches, the four seasons, twelve months, twenty-four solar terms, seventy-two five-day periods, with each sequence of agricultural tasks and the natural phenomena which signal for their necessity, stellar configurations, phenology, and the sequence of agricultural production.|$|E
