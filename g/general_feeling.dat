5|$|In 2004, Middle Temple {{proposed}} {{selling the}} Molyneux globes, valued at over £1million, {{to create a}} scholarship fund for the education and training of needy would-be barristers. Its members eventually decided by a large majority against such a move. There was also a <b>general</b> <b>feeling</b> that the globes should be made more accessible to those wishing to see them.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the revolt}} was also fuelled by a <b>general</b> <b>feeling</b> of discontent and humiliation at the {{failures}} of the Angeloi, especially in terms of foreign policy. This much is evident from the— albeit embellished— account of the eyewitness Nicholas Mesarites, whereby John Komnenos's supporters proclaimed that henceforth everything would go well for Romania, that her enemies would be vanquished, and that the kings of all the earth would come to pay homage to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} BZP are largely similar to {{amphetamine}}s, with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts {{were unable to}} distinguish between dextroamphetamine and BZP administered intravenously. Users report alertness, euphoria and a <b>general</b> <b>feeling</b> of well being. The perception of certain sensations such as taste, colour or music may be subjectively enhanced. The average duration is longer than that of dextroamphetamine, typically lasting 4–6 hours with reports as long as 8 hours depending on the dose. A recent study has shown that mixtures of BZP with other piperazine drugs such as TFMPP share certain pharmacodynamic traits with MDMA.|$|E

5|$|There {{has also}} been a <b>general</b> <b>feeling</b> of a shift in the {{creative}} attribution of Peking-opera works. The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps following the lead of the West, Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright centered model. Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{warnings}} given by Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup, {{commander of the}} ROK 1st Infantry Division, a <b>general</b> <b>feeling</b> of optimism about {{the outcome of the}} war prevented {{the warnings}} from being taken seriously. With the fighting reached a stalemate at Unsan, General Walton Walker of the Eighth United States Army ordered the US 8th Cavalry Regiment of the US 1st Cavalry Division to resume offensives north by relieving the ROK 12th Regiment. By the time the US 8th Cavalry Regiment reached Unsan on 29 October, the ROK 11th Infantry Regiment of the ROK 1st Infantry Division was also pulling out of Unsan. At the same time, the Chinese had destroyed the ROK 6th Infantry Division on the east of Unsan. Unsan had now became a northern salient in the UN line containing only the US 8th Cavalry Regiment and the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment.|$|E

25|$|General somatic {{sensations of}} a hallucinatory nature are {{experienced}} {{when an individual}} feels that their body is being mutilated, i.e. twisted, torn, or disembowelled.

25|$|The Union forces {{suffered}} 76 casualties, with 18 killed, including Maj. Winthrop and Lt. John T. Greble, {{the first}} regular army officer {{killed in the}} war. The Confederates suffered only eight casualties, with one killed. Although Magruder subsequently withdrew to Yorktown and his defensive line along the Warwick River, he had won a propaganda victory and local Union forces attempted no further significant advance until the Peninsula Campaign of 1862. While small in comparison to many later battles, Big Bethel attracted considerable press coverage and exaggerated importance because of the newness {{of the war and}} the <b>general</b> <b>feeling</b> the war would be short.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle {{outlined}} a programme of further nationalisations {{and a new}} economic plan which were passed, but a further row came when the Communists demanded a 20% reduction in the military budget. Refusing to 'rule by compromise', de Gaulle once more threatened to resign. There was a <b>general</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that he was trying}} to blackmail the assembly into complete subservience by threatening to withdraw his personal prestige which he insisted was what alone kept the ruling coalition together. Although the MRP managed to broker a compromise which saw the budget approved with amendments, it was little more than a stop-gap measure.|$|E

50|$|Even though 1936 Olympics {{were to be}} held in the {{neighboring}} capital, not everyonein Poland favored the idea of National Team's participation in this event.

25|$|Danish {{public opinion}} {{generally}} backed the new government, particularly {{after the fall}} of France in June 1940. There was a <b>general</b> <b>feeling</b> that the unpleasant reality of German occupation must be confronted in the most realistic way possible, given the international situation. Politicians realized {{that they would have to}} try hard to maintain Denmark's privileged position by presenting a united front to the German authorities, so all of the mainstream democratic parties formed a new government together. Parliament and the government agreed to work closely together. Though the effect of this was close to the creation of a one-party state, it remained a representative government.|$|E
25|$|Thirty years before, Henry III had deposed three claimants to the papacy, {{and thereby}} {{rendered}} an acknowledged {{service to the}} Church. When Henry IV tried to copy this procedure he was less successful, as he lacked {{the support of the}} people. In Germany there was a rapid and <b>general</b> <b>feeling</b> in favor of Gregory, and the princes took the opportunity to carry out their anti-regal policy under the cloak of respect for the papal decision. When at Whitsun the king proposed to discuss the measures to be taken against Gregory VII in a council of his nobles, only a few made their appearance; the Saxons snatched at the golden opportunity for renewing their rebellion, and the anti-royalist party grew in strength from month to month.|$|E

25|$|An {{estimate}} of the mortality rate for the modern bubonic plague, following the introduction of antibiotics, is 11%, {{although it may be}} higher in underdeveloped regions. Symptoms of the disease include fever of , headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a <b>general</b> <b>feeling</b> of malaise. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 per cent die within eight days. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 per cent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright red. Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time {{for the development of the}} enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.|$|E
25|$|Half {{of women}} with gonorrhea do not have symptoms, whereas others have vaginal discharge, lower {{abdominal}} pain, or pain with sexual intercourse associated with inflammation of the uterine cervix. Most infected men with symptoms have inflammation of the penile urethra associated with a burning sensation during urination and discharge from the penis. In men, discharge with or without burning occurs in half of all cases and {{is the most common}} symptom of the infection. Men and women can acquire gonorrhea of the throat from performing oral sex on an infected partner, usually a male partner. Such infection does not produce symptoms in 90% of cases, and produces a sore throat in the remaining 10%. In advanced cases, gonorrhea may cause a <b>general</b> <b>feeling</b> of tiredness similar to other infections. It is also possible for an individual to have an allergic reaction to the bacteria, in which case any appearing symptoms will be greatly intensified.|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. com??? Copyright Springer [Full text {{of this article is}} not available in the UHRA]The union voting intention literature shows that many nonunion employees who indicate that they think unions are instrumental in increasing wages, benefits, and working conditions would vote against forming a union. Although American workers have often been characterized as pragmatic with regard to their support for unions, the ???disconnect??? between union beliefs and union voting intentions just described suggests that more subtle forces are at work. In this paper, it is shown empirically that union instrumentality is a limited predictor of union voting intentions for a recent national cross-section of workers. Rather, more <b>general</b> <b>feelings</b> toward unions and employers are primary. These accounted for {{a large portion of the}} variance in union voting intentions, with <b>general</b> <b>feelings</b> towards unions by far the most critical predictor. A concluding section discusses whether the results may reflect changes in union power and changes in employee views of unions. Areas for future research are discussed...|$|R

500|$|For many decades, {{consciousness}} as {{a research}} topic was avoided {{by the majority of}} mainstream scientists, because of a <b>general</b> <b>feeling</b> that a phenomenon defined in subjective terms could not properly be studied using objective experimental methods. [...] In 1975 George Mandler published an influential psychological study which distinguished between slow, serial, and limited conscious processes and fast, parallel and extensive unconscious ones. Starting in the 1980s, an expanding community of neuroscientists and psychologists have associated themselves with a field called Consciousness Studies, giving rise to a stream of experimental work published in books, journals such as Consciousness and Cognition, , and the Journal of Consciousness Studies, along with regular conferences organized by groups such as the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness.|$|E
