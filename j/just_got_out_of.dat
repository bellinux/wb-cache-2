500|$|After divorcing Ike in 1978, Tina abstained {{from serious}} {{relationships}} {{for a long}} time, as she set on bringing her career back on track. In 1986 she said, [...] "People {{have to realize that}} I <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a very difficult marriage. I'm not the type of woman who needs to jump back into another. I liked my freedom when I got out of that one. I've had a few love affairs, but nothing important." ...|$|E
500|$|Back in Scranton, Jim and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} named the {{reluctant}} heads of the Party Planning Committee by Michael due to previous fights between Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Angela (Angela Kinsey). Jim and Dwight prove terrible at the job, especially when an upset Kelly (Mindy Kaling) chastises them for forgetting her birthday. They {{try to make it}} up to her by throwing a party but they do a poor job, choosing horrible decorations and forgetting Kelly's age. Dwight reads her file and learns Kelly spent time in juvenile hall, but is disappointed to learn it does not affect her job performance. Meanwhile, Andy (Ed Helms) finds himself attracted to Julia, a female potential client who is talking with Stanley (Leslie David Baker). Andy repeatedly acts awkwardly in front of Julia, and accidentally sets off her car alarm while trying to look inside and find out what music she likes. Andy admits his attraction to her to Stanley, who then gives the potential client over to Andy in exchange for two of his clients. [...] After walking her out to the car, Andy tries to kiss her, but is immediately rebuked. Andy apologizes and mentions that he <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a relationship. The client claims she also <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a relationship and Andy starts feeling a connection, but she still rejects him and he loses the account.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the rowdiness of the fans, and {{the fact}} that many {{families}} began sitting in the more affordable bleachers, alcoholic beverages were banned from the bleachers in 2000. Yankees Program Vendor Ted Banks commented that [...] "There wasn't any special reason for that, it <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand. Those people used to get wild when Jose Canseco played for the A's. A few people threw things at Ken Griffey Jr." ...|$|E

2500|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{occurs when}} the abuser believes that abuse is acceptable, justified, or unlikely to be reported. [...] It may produce intergenerational cycles of abuse in children and other family members, who may feel that such violence is acceptable or condoned. Very few people recognize themselves as abusers or victims because they may consider their experiences as family disputes that <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control. Awareness, perception, definition and documentation of domestic violence differs widely from country to country. Domestic violence often happens {{in the context of}} forced or child marriage.|$|E
2500|$|George {{did some}} work {{on what would}} {{eventually}} become Down on the Farm but then [...] declared that Little Feat had disbanded. In an interview with Bill Flanagan (for the book Written in My Soul) conducted eleven days before his death, George {{made it clear that}} he felt the demise of Little Feat was due to his having allowed the band to be run democratically, with the result that Payne and, to a lesser extent, Barrere, had a presence as songwriters and in production which was disproportionate to their abilities. George was particularly scathing about Payne's attempts at jazz/fusion, citing an instance when Payne jammed with Weather Report on a TV show and dropped [...] "into one of his 'Day at the Dog Races'. I <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> there as fast as I could. It was embarrassing". In the same interview, George stated that he planned to reunite Little Feat without Payne and Barrère.|$|E
5000|$|Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave a {{negative}} review, and {{compared it to}} Taylor Swift's [...] "You Belong with Me". [...] "I didn’t sit in when this was made or anything, {{but it sounds like}} it passed through so many levels of self-consciousness that most of the personality <b>just</b> <b>got</b> rubbed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the mix at some point, leaving behind a flimsy song and a recycled production." ...|$|R

50|$|Three years later, Furre {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of Sosialistisk Folkeparti, which got two seats in the {{parliament}} after the 1961 election.

50|$|Hamilton {{saw that}} an {{appointing}} power of an executive {{was a very}} huge decision {{not only for the}} Senate but for the entirety of the United States. Hamilton saw that without this article the United States could fall back into what they had <b>just</b> <b>got</b> themselves <b>out</b> <b>of,</b> a tyranny. A President with absolute appointing power would send them back to a feel of when the King of England had control over the United States. However, having it vice versa with the President not having less appointing power than the Senate, would cause more arguments than needed to run a smooth operating government. Hamilton's conclusion was based on his two ideas. The President with his judgement can appoint a qualified person to the Senate and {{it is up to the}} Senate to see if they are the right vote or not.|$|R

I threw my eye over him as he advanced with a peculiar rolling gait, and formed certain conclusions. A drunkard who has once been a gentleman, I reflected to myself, for there was something peculiarly dissolute in his appearance, also one who has {{had to do with}} the sea, a diagnosis which proved very accurate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Got {{away from}} me?" [...] John repeated, {{in a tone}} of utter disgust.

60|$|It {{wanted a}} quarter to eight when they reached Cadogan Place. Nicholas began to fear that no one might be {{stirring}} at that early hour, when he was relieved {{by the sight of}} a female servant, employed in cleaning the door-steps.

Now she’s using the men and treating them badly...she's never felt settled. Her mother died, her father was abusive and she doesn't even know him. She's never felt like she's fitted in. Clare's 'mystery' is brought about by her looking for that father figure and needing that kind of attention, which then leads her into preying on the men of Walford. That's how she makes her money. Her forté is finding men with money and using her assets to entice them and rip them off..." ...|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Lander, {{when she}} had {{refreshed}} herself with the fan, seemed to get a fresh grip of her theme, and she told Clementina all abort Mr. Lander's last sickness. It had been so short that it gave her no time to try the climate of Colorado upon him, which she now felt sure would have brought him right up; and she had remembered, when too late, {{to give him a}} liver-medicine of her own, though it did not appear that it was his liver which was affected; that was the strange part of it. But, brief as his sickness was, he had felt that it was to be his last, and had solemnly talked over her future with her, which he seemed to think would be lonely. He had not named Clementina, but Mrs. Lander had known well enough what he meant; and now she wished to ask her, and her father and mother, how they would all like Clementina to come and spend the winter with her at Boston first, and then further South, and wherever she should happen to go. She apologized for not having come sooner upon this errand; she had resolved upon it as soon as Mr. Lander was gone, but she had been sick herself, and had only <b>just</b> now <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed.|$|R
60|$|The morning {{succeeding}} {{the day of}} {{the dinner}} at the Hall, Mrs. Wilson, with all her nieces and her nephew, availed herself of the fineness of the weather to walk to the rectory, where they were all in the habit of making informal and friendly visits.

25|$|Throughout {{the nineteenth}} century the French {{educational}} system struggled over the separation of Church and State. After losing control of the public education system, the Catholic Church sought to establish its own branch of education and found in Cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally. He lent his prestige and knowledge to the École Normale Écclésiastique, a school in Paris run by Jesuits, for training teachers for their colleges. He also {{took part in the}} founding of the Institut Catholique. The purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of Catholic university education in France. These activities did not make Cauchy popular with his colleagues who, on the whole, supported the Enlightenment ideals of the French Revolution. When a chair of mathematics became vacant at the Collège de France in 1843, Cauchy applied for it, but <b>got</b> <b>just</b> three <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 45 votes.|$|R
