During their meeting, <b>the</b> pair arranged <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>to</b> become an informant in exchange for a full pardon of his previous crimes. Wallace supposedly assured <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> that he would be [...] "scot free with a pardon in your pocket for all your misdeeds."

In the meantime, Wallace had resigned from his duties as territorial governor on March 9, 1881, and was waiting for a new political appointment.|$|R
