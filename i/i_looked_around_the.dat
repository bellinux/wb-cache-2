[...] Illinois Speaker of the House Michael Madigan reacted by saying, [...] "He is a star...For Barack, the sky's the limit," [...] while Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said, [...] "He hit a grand slam home run." [...] Senate President Emil Jones responded, [...] "It was such a moving speech that I had tears in my eyes...It was electrifying. When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room, all across the people were so emotional, tears in their eyes. They're crying. A great individual, a great Illinoisan." [...] Governor Rod Blagojevich stated, [...] "After the speech last night, I would think {{that even if he}} had an opponent, he might get 100 percent of the vote." [...] Former Illinois Senator Carol Moseley Braun said, [...] "Obama {{represents}} the best of what we brought from our generation...he represents a kind of division within the Democratic Party. It's not the old left." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The white man’s lodges for the Great Spirit, whose pinnacles {{reach the}} sky, and which have stood for more seasons than the red man reckon, all struck me with terrible wonder. And the Great Spirit speaks to me {{sometimes}} since I have been here. [...] When I {{was in the}} Great Spirit Lodge (Westminster Abbey) where the kings are buried, I laid my face upon my hands. [...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy. [...] Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw {{in a blaze of}} light the girls with wings and they beckoned me. [...] And I was so certain that what I saw was that, I called out to my young men who were with me ‘Come and see what this is,’ and the young men replied, “You have been dreaming.’ But what I saw was true, for when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> great lodge afterwards, I saw on the walls the same girls with wings as I saw in my dreams. [...] Our people will wonder at these things, when we return to the Native Reservation and tell them what we have seen.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Referring to Israel, Leno said, [...] "It is {{the only}} {{democracy}} in <b>the</b> Middle East. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Middle East, and I see people being stoned to death because they are gay, and women being not allowed to drive or not allowed to vote. And here is this one little paradise in the Middle East where freedom reigns {{and there is a}} democracy, you vote people in, you vote people out." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> others. Harry beamed approval, Johnston nodded indifferently, and I felt {{a thrill}} of {{satisfaction}} as I {{turned to the}} railroad autocrat.|$|R
60|$|I was so {{worked up}} over my {{discovery}} that I left the forecastle without taking {{the trouble to}} don the clothing Lowell had pointed out to me. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> deck, and seeing the boatswain at the bow, hastened towards him.|$|E
60|$|But these {{reflections}} now seldom obtruded upon me; I gave {{myself up}} to the passing hour, and if ever disagreeable thoughts arose in my mind, I drove them away. When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> verdant recess in which I was buried, and gazed {{up to the}} summits of the lofty eminence that hemmed me in, I was well disposed to think that I was in the “Happy Valley,” and that beyond those heights there was nought but a world of care and anxiety.|$|E
60|$|The day was {{chill and}} rainy. We {{went into the}} back room, where a fire burned, in a little stove. A {{customer}} came, and Peter left me alone for a while. Presently I felt a new feeling stealing over me--a sense of beautiful calm and content, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> place. There were rows of shining rosewood caskets, black palls, trestles, hearse plumes, mourning streamers, and all the paraphernalia of the solemn trade. Here was peace, order, silence, the abode of grave and dignified reflections. Here, {{on the brink of}} life, was a little niche pervaded by the spirit of eternal rest.|$|E

As yet, the {{circumstance}} seems to have escaped our host's notice. Ah! what is that I see?" [...] he added, rising suddenly to his feet. [...] "My host, you are acquitted. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table here at which I am invited to seat myself, and I perceive nothing but a few stumpy pens and unappetising blotting-paper. By chance I lift my eyes. I see the parting of the curtains yonder, and behold!" ...|$|R

60|$|Arthur {{went off}} with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy's face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay quite still, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room {{to see that}} all was as it should be. I {{could see that the}} Professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic. The whole of the window sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silk {{handkerchief}} which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come into my den," [...] he said, {{and lifting}} me gently by {{the seat of}} my pantaloons he carried me up stairs and {{deposited}} me, before I could apologize, on the sofa. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room. It was a bachelor's apartment, characteristically furnished in {{the taste of the}} proprietor. A few claymores and battle-axes were ranged against the wall, and a culverin, captured by Sir Ralph Heavystone, occupied the corner, {{the other end of the}} room being taken up by a light battery. Foils, boxing-gloves, saddles, and fishing-poles lay around carelessly. A small pile of billets-doux lay upon a silver salver. The man was not an anchorite, nor yet a Sir Galahad.|$|E
6000|$|It {{must have}} been about this time that the Annual Meeting of the Institute took place. I recall Howells {{presiding}} with timidity and very evident embarrassment {{when it came to}} the duty of putting certain resolutions to vote. He seemed sad and old that night--indeed as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table, I was startled to find how many of the men I had considered [...] "among the younger writers" [...] were gray and haggard. Mabie, Page, Hopkinson Smith, Gilder and Stedman--all were older than I had remembered them. Edward MacDowell, who was sitting beside me, remarked upon the change, and I replied, [...] "Yes, you and I are young only by contrast. To Frank Norris and Stewart White, we are already veterans." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{report of}} a rifle, {{discharged}} near at hand, awakened me, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> to see <b>the</b> scout reloading his rifle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Adieu! my friend. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{familiar}} cabin, {{and miss}} your gentle faces. I feel as Jason might have felt, {{alone on the}} deck of the Argo when his companions were ashore, except that I know of no Circean influences to mar their destiny. In examining the state-rooms to see if my orders for the complete restoration of passengers' property had been carried out, I allowed myself to look into yours. Lying alone, forgotten and overlooked, I saw a peculiar jet hair-pin which I think I have observed in the coils of your tresses. May I venture to keep this gentle instrument as a reminder of the superior intellect it has so often crowned? Adieu, my friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a funny thing, mister," [...] {{announced}} the auto-stage driver. [...] "You see, {{after we left}} Stockbridge I didn't have nobody in but that man. He paid me the fare to this place before I started. Then when we was about half-way here <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> in <b>the</b> back of the stage and, by gum! he was gone." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room once more. Again I {{realized}} {{the difference between}} this gathering of well-dressed {{men and women and}} any similar gathering which I had seen in Paris. The faces of all somehow lacked that tiredness of expression which seems to be the heritage of those who drink the cup of pleasure without spice, simply because the hand of Fate presses it to their lips. These people had found something else. Were they not, after all, a little to be envied? They must know what it was to feel the throb of life, to test the true flavor of its luxuries when there was no certainty of the morrow. I felt the fascination, felt it almost in my blood, as I looked around.|$|E
6000|$|The {{following}} day he watched while the carpenter and I worked at putting my study into shape. Ever since the fire {{two years before}} its ceiling had needed repair, and even now I was but half-hearted in its restoration. As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> square, bare, ugly room and thought of the spacious libraries of Longfellow, Lowell and Holmes, I realized my almost hopeless situation. I was only a literary camper after all. My life was not here--it couldn't be here so far from all that makes a writer's life worth while. [...] "Soon {{for the sake of}} the children I must take them from this pleasant rut," [...] I said to Zulime. [...] "It is true an author can make himself felt from any place, but why do it at a disadvantage? If it were not for Father, I would establish our winter home in New York, which has the effect of increasing my power as well as my happiness." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room {{on other}} pictures, either to divert my attention, or {{to see whether}} the same effect would be {{produced}} by them. Some of them were grim enough to produce the effect, if the mere grimness of the painting produced it--no such thing. My eye passed over them all with perfect indifference, but the moment it reverted to this visage over the fire-place, it was as if an electric shock darted through me. The other pictures were dim and faded; but this one protruded from a plain black ground in the strongest relief, and with wonderful truth of coloring. The expression was that of agony--the agony of intense bodily pain; but a menace scowled upon the brow, and a few sprinklings of blood added to its ghastliness. Yet it was not all these characteristics--it was some horror of the mind, some inscrutable antipathy awakened by this picture, which harrowed up my feelings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are we {{to leave}} all our {{belongings}} here?" [...] <b>I</b> asked, <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> scanty store of furniture, the greater portion of which {{my father had}} made.|$|R
5000|$|Well, it’s the {{production}} software program, basically. The people at Babygrande {{were asking for}} a name. <b>I</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> house, or the studio, and {{trying to come up}} with something, and I may have even been reading the actual Pro Tools manual and just went with that, and it works great with the album.

40|$|It is a {{pleasure}} to welcome you to the 13 th Great Plains Wildlife Damage Workshop. It has been 24 years since the 1 st Great Plains Workshop was held in Manhattan, Kansas, in December 1973. Attendance has varied throughout the years; focus of the workshop has changed and has evolved to where it is today. As <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room, <b>I</b> still {{see a lot of}} interest. I still get a lot of calls about wildlife damage control, and I realize there is a great need to share the information that each of us has about wildlife damage control. That is the purpose of these types of venues. I believe a great workshop has been prepared for us. I think this workshop will be a success primarily because you are here and you are willing to participate in {{what we are trying to}} do...|$|R
60|$|I {{put out the}} light, {{and tried}} to force myself to sleep;--all in vain! The fire gleaming up a little, threw an {{uncertain}} light about the room, leaving, however, {{the region of the}} picture in deep shadow. What, thought I, if this be the chamber about which mine host spoke as having a mystery reigning over it?--I had taken his words merely as spoken in jest; might they have a real import? <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> faintly lighted apartment had all the qualifications requisite for a haunted chamber. It began in my infected imagination to assume strange appearances. The old portraits turned paler and paler, and blacker and blacker; the streaks of light and shadow thrown among the quaint old articles of furniture, gave them singular shapes and characters. There was a huge dark clothes-press of antique form, gorgeous in brass and lustrous with wax, that began to grow oppressive to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Environment," [...] said Hetty. [...] "That's {{what did}} it. When I {{first went to}} New York I was very young. A {{newspaper}} man took me out to dinner {{and asked me to}} have a cocktail. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> tables and saw other girls drinking cocktails, so I took one. That was where I turned into the rocky road. People get careless around the newspaper offices. They work under a constant nervous strain and find that drink steadies them--for a time. By and by they disappear; others take their places, and they are never heard of again except in the police courts. I knew a girl, society editor of a big paper, who drew her five thousand a year, at one time. She got the cocktail habit and a week or so ago I paid her fine for getting pinched while intoxicated. She was in rags and hadn't a red cent. That set me thinking, and when Tommy fired me from his paper and said the best he could do was to get me a job in the country, it seemed as if my chance to turn over a new leaf had arrived. I've turned it," [...] she added, with a pathetic sigh; [...] "but whether it'll stay turned, or not, is a question for the puzzle page." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{focus of}} Sssh.com is on {{chemistry}} and mutual pleasure, {{with women in}} strong character roles taking {{control of their own}} pleasure. Founder Angie Rowntree said, “I launched Sssh.com in 1999, for a very simple reason: When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> web at all the different porn sites, and looked around the adult video market at all the different titles and series, I didn’t see much which would appeal to women.” ...|$|E

60|$|The {{reception}} room seemed a mile square, {{because there was}} nothing in it except some rows of books, on unpainted white-pine bookshelves, a cracked marble-top table, a rag rug, a hairless horsehair sofa and two or three chairs. Yes, there was a picture on the wall, a colored crayon drawing of a cluster of pansies. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> for <b>the</b> portrait of Andrew Jackson and the pinecone hanging basket but they were not there.|$|R
60|$|For myself, I can say this: {{that when}} <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at <b>the</b> mass of men--five {{thousand}} strong I have since heard--, and saw them wrangling over this trifling matter or that, openly disputing some command, or boldly leaving an assigned {{position to take}} up one which pleased them better, I had more fear of what might come to us through the cowardice or ignorance of our own people, than regarding {{the ability of the}} enemy to cut us up.|$|R

5000|$|Liz Carpenter was Johnson's press secretary. According to Liz Carpenter's account, {{the press}} {{coverage}} of Bashir's visit was beginning to turn ugly. The vice president visited with several press representatives and convinced them in his trademark fashion to shape {{the nature of the}} coverage to avoid an embarrassing incident. One of the things that had been reported was that Bashir might not know about silverware. She reported that the problem was addressed in an interesting fashion. She says, [...] "When we dined together, we had a menu that made it possible {{for all of us to}} eat with our fingers, such as fried chicken, stuffed celery, deviled eggs, potato chips. On one such occasion during a visit to Dallas, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table and saw the presidents of four banks and Neiman-Marcus all eating with their fingers to make the camel driver feel at home." ...|$|E
