25|$|When I am in my painting, I'm {{not aware}} of what I'm doing. It is only after a sort of 'get acquainted' period that I see what I have been about. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> of making changes, {{destroying}} the image, etc., because the painting has {{a life of its}} own. I try to let it come through. It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the result is a mess. Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well.|$|E
25|$|The ship or wharf rat {{has contributed}} to the {{extinction}} of many species of wildlife including birds, small mammals, reptiles, invertebrates, and plants, especially on islands. True rats are omnivorous and capable of eating a wide range of plant and animal foods. True rats have a very high birth rate. When introduced to a new area, they quickly reproduce {{to take advantage of the}} new food supply. In particular, they prey on the eggs and young of forest birds, which on isolated islands often have no other predators and thus <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> of predators. Some experts believe that rats are to blame for between 40 percent and 60 percent of all seabird and reptile extinctions, with 90 percent of those occurring on islands. Thus man has indirectly caused the extinction of many species by accidentally introducing rats to new areas.|$|E

During a trip to Lake Biel, Hański went to arrange lunch, leaving his wife and Balzac alone. In the shade of a large oak tree, they kissed and exchanged vows of patience and fidelity. She told him of the family's plan to visit Geneva for Christmas; Balzac agreed to visit {{before the end of the}} year. Before he left Nauchâtel, she sent a passionate letter to his hotel: [...] "Villain! Did you not see in my eyes all that I longed for?

[...] Her health began to {{deteriorate}} not long after her final screen appearance, and she was hospitalized in March 1993 for exhaustion. In the winter of 1996, she was hospitalized with pneumonia. By 1997, she had become very weak, was speaking and eating very little, and it was feared she would die. She showed signs of dementia in her final years. In May 2003, an aggressive tumor was found in Hepburn's neck. The decision was made not to medically intervene, and she died on June 29, 2003, a month after her 96th birthday at the Hepburn family home in Fenwick, Connecticut. She was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford. Hepburn requested that there be no memorial service.|$|E

But whether there be a God and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal soul or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth, or believe that those will be better off in a future state who have lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and which are to them rather a matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction.|$|E

Brooks' criticism is that Shock and Awe tactics are essentially a relic of Cold War strategies for fighting the Soviet Union in the Fulda Gap of West Germany, and are not effective for combating guerrilla fighters in protracted insurgencies. Particularly, Brooks' point is that the entire concept of shock and awe is rendered moot when one is facing enemy combatants who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>fear</b> of death, be they zombies, kamikaze pilots, or suicide bombers.|$|E
