5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} {{to belong to a}} stellar association called the Castor Moving Group. However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain. This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All members of the group are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound.

5|$|In vertebrates, alpha-latrotoxin {{produces}} {{its effect}} through destabilisation of cell membranes and degranulation of nerve terminals, resulting in excessive release of neurotransmitters, namely acetylcholine, norepinephrine and GABA. Excess neurotransmitter activity leads to clinical manifestations of envenomation, although the precise mechanisms {{are not well}} understood. Acetylcholine release accounts for neuromuscular manifestations, and norepinephrine release accounts for the cardiovascular manifestations. Female redbacks <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of around 0.08–0.10mg of venom, and experiments indicate that the median lethal dose (LD50) for mice at room temperature is 10–20% of this quantity (0.27–0.91mg/kg based on {{the mass of the}} mice used), but that it is considerably more deadly for mice kept at lower or higher temperatures.

5|$|When the {{luminosity}} of a TypeII supernova is plotted over {{a period}} of time, it shows a characteristic rise to a peak brightness followed by a decline. These light curves <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> decay rate of 0.008magnitudes per day; much lower than the decay rate for TypeIa supernovae. Type II are sub-divided into two classes, depending on the shape of the light curve. The light curve for a TypeII-L supernova shows a steady (linear) decline following the peak brightness. By contrast, the light curve of a TypeII-P supernova has a distinctive flat stretch (called a plateau) during the decline; representing a period where the luminosity decays at a slower rate. The net luminosity decay rate is lower, at 0.0075magnitudes per day for TypeII-P, compared to 0.012magnitudes per day for TypeII-L.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} resolve {{the problem of the}} {{excessive}} growth of phumdis that affects the lake ecosystem and local community, a study sponsored by the IndiaCanada Environment Facility was undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) to examine efficient ways of converting phumdis into briquettes as fodder and fuel pellets, which could be used to meet both energy demands within the region. Two options for the biomass conversion were studied. The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and crude protein content, but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% de-oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was densified to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> calorific value of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with ash content of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E
