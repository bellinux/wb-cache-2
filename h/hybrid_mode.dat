The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in <b>hybrid</b> <b>mode</b> with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E

25|$|The {{pre-production}} Prius Plug-in uses {{three different}} batteries, two to provide all-electric drive {{and a third}} battery engages when the first two are depleted, allowing the car to operate in <b>hybrid</b> <b>mode,</b> like a regular 50-mpg Prius. According to Toyota, when the vehicle starts, the plug-in operates in all-electric mode, drawing electrical power directly from the first battery pack. When its charge is depleted, it disconnects from the circuit and the second pack engages and supplies electrical energy to the motor. When the second pack is depleted again it disconnects from the circuit and the system defaults to conventional <b>hybrid</b> <b>mode,</b> using the main battery as the sole electrical power source.

Toyota decided to include a selectable electric driving mode (EV mode), allowing drivers to conserve energy for use in those places where EV mode is more efficient, such as city driving.

This paper considers a linear coupled coastal and deep interior-ocean model in the idealized context of a homogeneous two-dimensional cylindrical ocean with a rigid lid and axisymmetric step shelf topography. Both a semianalytical mode-matching approach and brute-force finite-element numerics {{have been used to}} analyze the linear dynamics. It is shown that hybrid planetary ?-plane Rossby and topographic shelf modes emerge. The structure of these inviscid modes is clarified by considering their frequency dependence on shelf break radius, by contrasting the evolution of <b>hybrid</b> <b>modes</b> to the evolution of pure shelf and pure ?-plane Rossby modes (considering streamfunction fields and particle paths), and by showing solutions of the initial value problem.
