500|$|The Apollo 16 mission {{launched}} from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 12:54 PM EST on April 16, 1972. The launch was nominal; the crew experienced vibration {{similar to that}} of previous crews. The first and second stages of the Saturn V rocket performed nominally; the spacecraft entered orbit around Earth just under 12 minutes after lift-off. After reaching orbit, the crew spent time adapting to the zero-gravity environment and preparing the spacecraft for Trans Lunar Injection (TLI), the burn of the third-stage rocket that would propel them to the Moon. In Earth orbit, the crew faced minor technical issues, including a potential problem with the environmental control system and the S-IVB third stage's attitude control system, but eventually resolved or compensated for them as they prepared to depart towards the Moon. After two orbits, the rocket's third stage reignited for just over five minutes, propelling the craft towards the Moon at about [...] Six minutes after the burn of the S-IVB, the Command/Service Module, containing the crew, separated from the rocket and traveled for [...] before turning around and retrieving the Lunar Module from inside the expended rocket stage. The maneuver, known as transposition, went smoothly and the LM was extracted from the S-IVB. Following transposition and docking, the crew noticed the exterior surface of the Lunar Module was giving off particles from a spot where the LM's skin appeared torn or shredded; at one point, Duke estimated they were seeing about five to ten particles per second. The crew entered the Lunar Module through the <b>docking</b> <b>tunnel</b> connecting it with the Command Module to inspect its systems, at which time they did not spot any major issues. Once on course towards the Moon, the crew put the spacecraft into a rotisserie [...] "barbecue" [...] mode in which the craft rotated along its long axis three times per hour to ensure even heat distribution about the spacecraft from the Sun. After further preparing the craft for the voyage, the crew began the first sleep period of the mission just under 15 hours after launch.|$|E

A tower that sat on top of the capsule would contain a <b>docking</b> <b>tunnel</b> as well as the capsule's rocket engines, again similar to the Apollo configuration. The tower would be jettisoned just before reentry. Landing would be via deceleration parachutes and air bags.|$|E
50|$|In 1910 the Erie Railroad {{replaced}} the Long <b>Dock</b> <b>Tunnel</b> with the Erie Cut, though primarily {{for use by}} passenger trains. Erie freight trains continued to use the tunnel as do freight railroads to this day.|$|R

50|$|The {{components}} of the ELS were housed around the forward <b>docking</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The forward compartment was separated from the central by a bulkhead and was divided into four 90-degree wedges. The ELS consisted of two drogue parachutes with mortars, three main parachutes, three pilot parachutes to deploy the mains, three inflation bags for uprighting the capsule if necessary, a sea recovery cable, a dye marker, and a swimmer umbilical.|$|E
50|$|The Command Module was a {{truncated}} cone (frustum) 10 ft tall with {{a diameter of}} 12 ft across the base. The forward compartment contained two reaction control engines, the <b>docking</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and {{the components of the}} Earth Landing System. The inner pressure vessel housed the crew accommodations, equipment bays, controls and displays, and many spacecraft systems. The last section, the aft compartment, contained 10 reaction control engines and their related propellant tanks, fresh water tanks, and the CSM umbilical cables.|$|E
50|$|After {{the initial}} capture and {{stabilization}} of the vehicles, the probe {{was capable of}} exerting a closing force of 1,000 lbf kN to draw the vehicles together. This force was generated by gas pressure acting on the center piston within the probe cylinder. Piston retraction compressed the probe and interface seals and actuated the 12 automatic ring latches which were located radially around the inner surface of the CSM docking ring. The latches were manually re-cocked in the <b>docking</b> <b>tunnel</b> by an astronaut after each hard docking event (lunar missions required two dockings).|$|E
50|$|The last {{trains to}} the {{terminal}} ran in 1957. The line was abandoned that year. The adjacent <b>tunnel</b> (the Long <b>Dock</b> <b>Tunnel)</b> from the mid-19th century that the Erie Cut replaced is used for freight, and is being restored as part of Liberty Corridor Project {{as an extension of}} National Docks Secondary line.|$|R
5000|$|...The Long <b>Dock</b> <b>Tunnel</b> is {{a freight}} rail tunnel in Jersey City, New Jersey {{that is part}} of the North Jersey Shared Assets Area and used by CSX Transportation on the National Docks Secondary. The single track (formerly dual track) tunnel runs through Bergen Hill, a section of the lower New Jersey Palisades in Hudson County.|$|R

50|$|The forward docking hatch {{was mounted}} {{at the top}} of the <b>docking</b> <b>tunnel.</b> It was 30 in in {{diameter}} and weighed 80 lb. It was constructed from two machined rings that were weld-joined to a brazed honeycomb panel. The exterior side was covered with a 0.5 in of insulation and a layer of aluminum foil. It was latched in six places and operated by a pump handle. The hatch contained a valve in its center, used to equalize the pressure between the tunnel and the CM so the hatch could be removed.|$|E
5000|$|The forward {{compartment}} was {{the area}} outside the inner pressure shell {{in the nose}} of the capsule, located around the forward <b>docking</b> <b>tunnel</b> and covered by the forward heat shield. The compartment was divided into four 90-degree segments which contained Earth Ianding equipment (all the parachutes, recovery antennas and beacon light, and sea recovery sling), two reaction control engines, and the forward heat shield release mechanism. [...] At about 25,000 feet during reentry, the forward heat shield was jettisoned to expose the Earth landing equipment and permit deployment of the parachutes.|$|E
50|$|From inside Endeavour, Canadian Mission Specialist Marc Garneau {{used the}} Canadarm {{to remove the}} P6 truss from the payload bay, {{maneuvering}} it into an overnight park position to warm its components. Mission Specialists Joseph Tanner and Carlos Noriega moved through Endeavours <b>docking</b> <b>tunnel</b> and opened the hatch to the ISS docking port to leave supplies and computer hardware on the doorstep of the Station. On flight day 4, the Expedition 1 Commander William Shepherd, Pilot Yuri Gidzenko and Flight Engineer Sergei Krikalev - entered the Unity Module {{for the first time}} and retrieved the items left for them.|$|E
50|$|At CP Nave, the River Line {{junction}}ed {{with the}} National Docks Secondary, which still runs {{south on the}} east side of the Hudson Palisades, with the Nave-Croxton Running Track running west through the old Erie Railroad's Long <b>Dock</b> <b>Tunnel.</b> The junction only allowed trains coming to/from the south on the National Docks to continue to/from the north on the River Line.|$|R
25|$|Also {{involved}} with the NJRR was the Morris and Essex Railroad (M), later the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad's (DL) main line. On October 21, 1836 the NJRR agreed to carry M traffic between Newark and Jersey City, beginning November 19. A new alignment meeting the NJRR in Harrison opened August 5, 1854. On October 14, 1863, the M began using the Long <b>Dock</b> <b>Tunnel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The southernmost part leased {{from the}} Erie Railroad's as their {{original}} terminus, {{which had been}} built as the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad. which accessed Erie's Long <b>Dock</b> <b>Tunnel</b> and Pavonia Terminal. The NJ Midland {{also served as a}} terminus for the Montclair Railway, which later became the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway. The lease provide access south to the PRR at Marion Junction.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the actual}} landing, a {{combination}} of thrust from residual pressure in the <b>docking</b> <b>tunnel</b> that connected the Lunar Module with the Command Module in orbit, and an imperfect understanding of the Moon's uneven gravitational field, resulted in navigation errors which pushed the powered descent initiation point about 3 mi, and thus the computer-targeted landing spot about 4 mi, downrange (west) of the planned target. The automated targeting system was taking Eagle toward what Armstrong described as a [...] "football-field sized crater, {{with a large number}} of big boulders and rocks for about one or two crater diameters around it", which he avoided by assuming manual control and flying a bit further downrange. Thus the landing was still within the target ellipse.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the cruise}} to the Moon, Apollo astronauts had two [...] "rooms" [...] {{to choose from}} - the Command Module (CM) or the Lunar Module (LM). This {{can be seen in}} the film Apollo 13 where the three astronauts were forced to use the LM as an {{emergency}} life boat. Passage between the two modules was possible through a pressurized <b>docking</b> <b>tunnel,</b> a major advantage over the Soviet design, which required donning a spacesuit to switch modules. The Command Module featured five windows made of three thick panes of glass. The two inner panes, made of aluminosilicate, ensured no cabin air leaked into space. The outer pane served as a debris shield and part of the heat shield needed for atmospheric reentry. The CM was a sophisticated spacecraft with all the systems required for successful flight but with an interior volume of 6.17 m3 could be considered cramped for three astronauts. [...] It had its design weaknesses such as no toilet (astronauts used much-hated 'relief tubes' and fecal bags). The coming of the space station would bring effective life support systems with waste management and water reclamation technologies.|$|E
50|$|Early on, it {{was decided}} to use the lunar orbit {{rendezvous}} method, using a smaller Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) to ferry two of the men between lunar orbit and the surface. The reduction in mass allowed the lunar mission to be launched with a single Saturn V. Since significant development work had started on the design, {{it was decided}} to continue with the existing design as Block I, while a Block II version capable of rendezvous with the LEM would be developed in parallel. Besides addition of a <b>docking</b> <b>tunnel</b> and probe, Block II would employ equipment improvements based on lessons learned from the Block I design. Block I would be used for unmanned test flights and a limited number of Earth orbit manned flights. Though the service propulsion engine was now bigger than required, its design was not changed since significant development was already in progress; however, the propellant tanks were downsized slightly to reflect the modified fuel requirement. Based on astronaut preference, the Block II CM would replace the two-piece plug door hatch cover, chosen to avoid an accidental hatch opening such as had happened on Gus Grissom's Mercury-Redstone 4 flight, with a one-piece, outward-opening hatch to make egress easier {{at the end of the}} mission.|$|E
50|$|In 1836, the Morris and Essex Railroad {{established}} a right-of-way {{from the west}} at Orange to Newark, from where it used the New Jersey Rail Road at Centre Street to cross the river and travel east to its terminal at Paulus Hook on the waterfront in Jersey City. By1855 it built its own bridge across the Passaic. By the early 1860s, the railroad had {{established a}}lignment across the Kearny Meadows and began using the Long <b>Dock</b> <b>Tunnel</b> to Hoboken.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} end of Palisade Avenue begins at Newark Avenue, {{just east of the}} Hudson County Courthouse, running between the historic Jersey City High School and the 1942 Hudson Gardens Housing project. It soon crosses over Bergen Arches and Long <b>Dock</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> (both of which served the Erie Railroad's Pavonia Terminal) and the Divided Highway (connecting the Pulaski Skyway and the Holland Tunnel). At this point, the avenue enters Jersey City Heights and passes Christ Hospital.|$|R
2500|$|There are, in the United Kingdom, {{a number}} of {{miscellaneous}} constabularies. These are not operated, regulated or funded by the Home Office, although they are fully authorised (by Act of Parliament) establishments. In general they provide the policing for ports, <b>docks,</b> <b>tunnels,</b> or other particular institutions. Although these forces tend to require high standards of training and accountability, which closely mirror those of the Home Office police forces, they are usually much smaller in terms of personnel, and therefore utilise fewer of the 'standard' ranks.|$|R

As it was not due to arrive in lunar orbit until flight day four, flight days two and three were largely preparatory days, consisting of spacecraft maintenance and scientific research. On day two, the crew performed an electrophoresis experiment, also performed on Apollo 14, in which they attempted to prove the higher purity of particle migrations in the zero-gravity environment. The remainder of day two included a two-second mid-course correction burn performed by the Command/Service Module's Service Propulsion System engine to tweak the spacecraft's trajectory. Later in the day, the astronauts entered the Lunar Module {{for the second time in}} the mission to further inspect the landing craft's systems. The crew reported they had observed additional paint peeling from a portion of the LM's outer aluminum skin. Despite this, the crew discovered that the spacecraft's systems were performing nominally. Following the LM inspection, the crew reviewed checklists and procedures for the following days in anticipation of their arrival and the Lunar Orbit Insertion burn. Command Module Pilot Mattingly reported a [...] "gimbal lock" [...] warning light, indicating the craft was not reporting an attitude. Mattingly alleviated this by realigning the guidance system using the Sun and Moon. At the end of day two, Apollo 16 was about 140000 nmi km away from Earth.|$|E

50|$|After the {{construction}} of the Albert Dock, with the same problem envisaged on the route to Silvertown, in 1878 the railway built the 600 m cut and cover Connaught Tunnel (also known as the Silvertown <b>Tunnel</b> or Albert <b>Dock</b> <b>Tunnel),</b> at the new dock's entrance; it emerges on the eastern side just short of the old Tate & Lyle factory. In 1935, after it was discovered that larger ships entering the docks were scraping the roof of the tunnel, an iron casing was placed along the section under the dock.|$|R
