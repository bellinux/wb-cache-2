5|$|Though he was {{initially}} unsure whether <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> university, Fox's mother {{convinced him to}} enrol at Simon Fraser University, where he studied kinesiology as a stepping stone to becoming a physical education teacher. He tried out for the junior varsity basketball team, earning a spot ahead of more talented players due to his determination.|$|E
5|$|He {{graduated}} from Hall High School with a National Merit Scholarship. He helped take their swim {{team to the}} state championship, filling in for a sick teammate by swimming two legs of a relay. Clark has often repeated the anecdote that he decided <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> West Point after meeting a cadet with glasses who told Clark (who wore glasses as well) that one did not need perfect vision to attend West Point as Clark had thought. Clark applied, and he was accepted on April 24, 1962.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, Pasternak {{was finally}} granted {{permission}} {{to visit the}} soldiers at the front. He bore up well, considering the hardships of the journey (he had a weak leg from an old injury), and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the most dangerous places. He read his poetry and talked extensively with the active and injured troops.|$|E

25|$|Ashworth {{decided that}} <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Annapolis like his brother. He sat {{and passed the}} {{examinations}} for an appointment from his local Congressman, but did not secure one of the Congressman's two appointments. However, in August 1929, he was informed {{that one of the}} Congressman's appointments had been rejected for defective teeth. Ashworth then entered Annapolis. He graduated 134th in the class of 1933, and was commissioned as an ensign.|$|E
25|$|The RCMP on October 23 {{released}} security video showing Zehaf-Bibeau's movements {{across the}} Parliament Hill precinct. They also announced that Zehaf-Bibeau {{was not one}} of 93 suspected extremists on a RCMP high-risk traveller list, though email written by Zehaf-Bibeau had been found on a computer belonging to an unnamed individual charged with terrorism offences. At this meeting, RCMP Commissioner Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau's mother had told the RCMP that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Syria, but she denied this, stating that, in a recorded interview, she had told the RCMP that he had wanted to go to Saudi Arabia.|$|E

In France he {{enrolled}} in a class at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, the French national art school, but he found the experience unsatisfying. Minor {{spent the rest of}} his time in Paris studying art on his own and taking part in the left wing labor movement through the Socialist Party of France. Minor returned to the United States in 1914, just prior to the outbreak of World War I.|$|E
25|$|After {{ensuring}} that the letter would reach its destination, the king announced that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Porto. He met with an advising council, the officials {{and part of the}} escort. The commander João Agnelo Velez Caldeira Castelo Branco and the chief officer João Jorge Moreira de Sá opposed the opinion of the monarch, claiming that if Porto turned them away, they would not have enough fuel to reach a different anchorage. Despite the insistence of D. Manuel II, the chief officer argued that they carried on board the whole royal family, so his main duty was to save their lives. In the end, the chosen port was Gibraltar. Once there, the king found out that Porto had also joined the republican cause. D. Manuel sent orders that the ship, being legally the Portuguese State's property, be returned to Lisbon. The deposed king would live out {{the rest of his life}} in exile.|$|E
25|$|Regarded as a five-star recruit by {{both the}} Rivals.com and Scout.com {{recruiting}} networks, Peterson was listed as the No. 1 running back and overall prospect in the Class of 2004 by Rivals.com. After considering schools such as Texas, Texas A, UCLA, Arkansas, and Miami (FL), he decided that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a school where {{he could be a}} difference-maker in a national championship run and narrowed his choices down to USC and Oklahoma. Concluding his high school football career at the annual U.S. Army All-American Bowl, he led the West squad with 95 yards on nine carries and scored two touchdowns, and announced at the game that he would attend college at the University of Oklahoma. Following his senior season, he was awarded the Hall Trophy as the U. S. Army National Player of the Year. In addition, he was named the top high school player by College Football News and Rivals.com.|$|E

According to Van Miller, [...] "Jack's a skier, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Denver and play for the Broncos. He hated the thought of coming to Buffalo." [...] In Buffalo, he would become known for his love of reading {{a broad range of}} books including those by Henry Thoreau, which led to chidings from Saban.|$|E
500|$|... "What More Can I Give" [...] {{was also}} {{intended}} to be released as a charity single to aid the Kosovar refugees who had been forced out of their home during the Kosovo War (1998–1999). Jackson revealed his intentions for the release {{in an interview with}} the British tabloid newspaper the Daily Mirror. The pop singer stated that television footage of the war upset him and that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Yugoslavia to hug every one of the suffering children. Like before, however, the song failed to gain a release as a single and was not considered good enough for inclusion on Jackson's 2001 Invincible album.|$|E
500|$|Cornwallis {{was first}} {{considered}} for a posting to India during the ministry of the Earl of Shelburne {{in the spring of}} 1782. [...] Shelburne asked Cornwallis if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> India as governor general, an idea Cornwallis viewed with favour, as it provided employment without risking his parole status. However, Shelburne was a weak leader, and was turned out of power in early 1783, replaced by a coalition government dominated by men Cornwallis (and King George) disliked, Charles James Fox and Lord North. [...] Cornwallis, who normally avoided politics (in spite of holding a seat in the House of Lords), became more vocal in opposition to the Fox-North ministry, hoping his support would be repaid by the next government.|$|E

500|$|He {{occupied}} {{himself in}} linguistic study, and had already, during his residence at Dinapur, {{been engaged in}} revising the sheets of his Hindustani version of the New Testament. He now translated {{the whole of the}} New Testament into Urdu also, and into Persian twice. He translated the Psalms into Persian, the Gospels into Judaeo-Persic, and the Book of Common Prayer into Urdu, in spite of ill-health and [...] "the pride, pedantry and fury of his chief munshi Sabat." [...] Ordered by the doctors to take a sea voyage, he obtained leave to go to Persia and correct his Persian New Testament. From there, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Arabia, and there compose an Arabic version. On 1 October 1810, having seen his work at Cawnpore rewarded on the previous day by the opening of a church, he left for Calcutta, from where he sailed on 7 January 1811 for Bombay. The ship reached port on his thirtieth birthday.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 4 p.m. on September 18, Dannemann told Police Sergeant John Shaw: [...] "We went {{to sleep}} about 7 a.m. When I woke up at eleven his face was covered in vomit, and he was breathing noisily. I sent for an ambulance, and {{he was taken to}} hospital. I also noticed that ten of my sleeping tablets were missing." [...] In a statement given to P. Weyell of the coroner's office on September 24, she said: I made a sandwich and we talked until about 7 a.m. He then said that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep. He took some tablets, and we went to bed. I woke up about 11:00 a.m., and saw that Jimi's face was covered in vomit. I tried to wake him but could not. I called an ambulance and he was taken to the hospital in Kensington... Prior to going with him to the hospital, I checked my supply of Vesparax sleeping tablets and found that nine of them were missing.|$|E
500|$|His work, {{including}} the New Orleans postcards, had attracted admirers, who, {{in addition to}} Smith, helped {{him to get a}} job with the San Francisco Chronicle in 1892. [...] While there, he attracted reader attention for his ability to draw animals. [...] He resigned in April 1893 because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Chicago and see the World's Columbian Exposition, and his contacts secured him a position with the Chicago Herald. [...] At the Herald, one of his jobs was to illustrate the horse races at Washington Park. [...] He was dismissed from the Herald, and in one account ascribed his dismissal to going every day to visit and sketch the Arabian horses on exhibit at the World's Fair. [...] However, more likely, the poor economy {{and the end of the}} fair caused the Herald to lay him off, and Davenport suggested as much in a 1905 interview. While at the Daily Herald, he married Daisy Moor, who traveled from her home in San Francisco's to Chicago in order to marry him.|$|E

500|$|Friday was {{watched by}} other clubs {{throughout}} November and December 1976, but although he performed well in some games, including a 1–1 draw away at Crystal Palace on 6 November {{in which he}} scored his team's only goal, he was poor in others. After being marked {{out of the game}} during Reading's 4–0 loss away against Mansfield Town on 8 November, he was substituted. [...] "Coincidence or not", wrote the Evening Post, [...] "when Friday left, so did half a dozen managers and scouts". Friday was so angry at his team's performance that he broke into the Mansfield dressing room and defecated in the team bath. Reading's asking price stood at £50,000, and the first transfer offer came from Second Division side Cardiff City around mid-December. Cardiff boss Jimmy Andrews bid £28,000, half of his offer a year before, which Reading's directors accepted, wanting the troublesome player off their hands as quickly as possible. Friday was reluctant to go to the Welsh club, saying that it was too far from home, that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a First Division team and that he wanted more money than was being offered; however, when Hurley told him that unless he went to Cardiff he would be released, he agreed and travelled to Wales on 30 December 1976.|$|E

I took this to mean he wanted to throw the girls off the bridge because he had spoken about this before. There are some bridges on the way to Sydney on the Hume Highway which have great drops." ...|$|E
