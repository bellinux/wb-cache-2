40|$|From its {{beginnings}} in the mid-twentieth century, American Studies {{as a discipline}} has been concerned with the processes of migration and Americanization, the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>nationhood,</b> and foreign empire-building; since the 1970 s the “New” Americanists have illuminated the complex and pervasive {{ways in which the}} ideology of Anglo-Saxon supremacy has structured U. S. national identity through patterns of immigration (and restrictions on entry to the U. S. by certain national and ethnic groups) and the discourses that name ethnic immigrant groups. This line of inquiry has taken American Studies out of the realm of domestic U. S. concerns and into the field of transnational cultural studies. In the U. S. context, transnationalism is often construed as the study of U. S. imperialism in its various guises: cultural, economic, political, and military. The relevance of the postcolonial is hard to miss. This essay addresses the role that Postcolonial Studies has to play in the re-routing of American Studies away from its nationalist roots. Postcolonialism offers an intellectual perspective that is necessarily cross-national and comparative; thus, postcolonial scholars have developed strategies for discussing issues and concepts such as exile, displacement, diaspora, migration, nationhood, and hybridity that enable us to cut through the pervasive and obfuscating American ideology of white supremacy to see what is at stake when we study the nation on its own terms...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates antifascism and {{resistance}} to Nazi occupation in Luxembourg, France, Belgium and Germany. This analysis is done from a transnational perspective. Luxembourg is at {{the centre of the}} study, but the adjoining regions of its neighbouring countries which, together with the Grand Duchy, form the ‘Grande Région’, will be analysed in detail as well. Moreover, the post-war years are included in this study to examine the impact of the resistance after the war. While comparative and transnational studies of this subject have been attempted before, {{this will be the first}} time Luxembourg has been not only included in such a study but is at the centre of one. Moreover, the inclusion of the pre- and post-war eras will add to the understanding of the continuity of the resistance, which has been depicted as an isolated movement which suddenly occurred in 1940 and disappeared in 1945. The thesis is divided into three major parts. The first part covers the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> in Luxembourg, and the transnational connections between the Grand Duchy and its neighbours until 1918. It looks at the importance of antifascism in Luxembourg from 1922 until 1939, by focusing on the Communist Party of Luxembourg, and on Italian immigrant communities. The second part deals with national experiences of occupation in Luxembourg, Belgium and France and with regional commonalities, and focuses on transnational connections within the resistance. The third part of the thesis contains the analysis of the postwar era, and of the resistance’s impact on it. It investigates the political inheritance of the resistance as well as the post-war malaise in the countries in questions, to then zoom in on Luxembourg for a detailed analysis of the depiction of transnational and national resistance in the media in the post-war years.

40|$|The rise of {{nationalism}} {{in the early}} twentieth century, in the build-up to the world wars, was contemporaneous with unprecedented upheavals in literature, particularly the advent of modernism. Then, ethno-symbolic nationalism was theorized by Anthony D. Smith. This approach relies on the myths, memories, symbols and values of a nation to try to surpass the divergence and “polarization between primordialism and modernism” (Özkirimli, 2000, p. 168). It also enables readers to perceive the importance of memories, myths and symbols and makes them realize the common roots and backgrounds that lead to the affinity and cohesion of nation-members. Studies such as The Ethnic Origins of Nations (1986), Nation and Ethnoscape (1997), The Nation in History (2000) and The Antiquity Of Nations (2000), all emphasized the historical/cultural images, myths, symbols and memories of each nation as opposed to the modernist nationalists or primordialsits - who accentuate the concept of the nation-state or geography. This recent ethno-symbolic approach created new possibilities on the analysis of literary studies. Having been adopted by many theorists to refine the concept {{of nationalism}} and analyse the process of the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>nationhood,</b> the ethno-symbolic approach has been chiefly involved with political theory. It is very rarely discussed or applied in the field of art and literature. Building on the literature from the birth of modernism (Joyce and Jamalzadeh) and later modernism (Woolf and Hedayat), my thesis aims to take the ethno-symbolic nationalism and apply it to literary texts from the early twentieth century to explore the creation and critique of national identities through literature. It also aims to critique literary scholars’ traditional understanding of nationalism. Texts like The Blind Owl, Between the Acts, Dubliners and Once Upon A Time are made up of images, symbols, myths and figurative events that subject traditional nationalisms to ethno-symbolic critiqu...|$|E
40|$|Putting a green {{twist on}} an old Marxist formula, this ecomaterialist study of {{mobility}} in the Shakespearean history play aims to “follow the energy. ” The chorographical scope of the Second Henriad reflects the growing sophistication of transportation networks in sixteenth-century Britain. Although road-building {{played a crucial role}} in the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> modern <b>nationhood,</b> Shakespeare reminds us that the movement of goods and persons was literally fueled by oats and other crops, the availability of which was subject to the vagaries of the English climate. As a player who was part of the vagrant economy and the son of a provincial Ale-taster who would have helped regulate energy costs, Shakespeare would have been well aware of the nation’s growing reliance on affordable fodder. Composed during a period of dire scarcity triggered by the Little Ice Age, Shakespeare’s 1 Henry IV traces a link between political and ecological instability. Its subversion of chivalric heroism initiates a corresponding interrogation of the horse’s role in a postchivalric society, raising prescient questions about the ethics of transportation. In the context of a late Elizabethan energy crisis exacerbated by surging demand for fuel due to a boom in personal transit, the insistent critiques of Hotspur’s and Falstaff’s overreliance on horse-power pack an ecocritical punch...|$|R

It also builds on the social identity approach by including the role of ethnic identification as a moderator. Findings indicate {{that there is a}} directly negative effect of national identification on the endorsement of Kurdish minority rights, but that amongst both groups civic conceptions <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> decrease this negative effect. Among Turks, it was similarly found that ethnic conceptions <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> decrease the negative association between national identification and endorsement of minority rights. Among Kurds, ethnic and civic conceptions <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> did not moderate this relationship, indicating that research on more extensive interpretations <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> among minority group members in assimilationist societies is needed.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} young people’s constructions <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> in Mauritius. In 2008, the Mauritian government {{instituted a}} Truth and Justice Commission (TJC), {{set up to}} investigate the consequences of slavery and indentured labour. Through the Truth and Justice Commission, the Mauritian government indicated its desire to achieve social justice and national unity. Drawing on developments in studies of national identification practices in the 21 st Century, this thesis addresses the question of young Mauritian’s locally and globally informed identification practices and asks how their unofficial narratives <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> challenge, or divert, or relate to official state narratives <b>of</b> <b>nationhood.</b> The basis <b>of</b> the study emerges from data collected from 132 participants during fieldwork in multiple fieldsites from May to September 2010 as well as research on Mauritian youth on-line from 2011 - 2014. The advent of the TJC offers an ideal moment to evaluate the dynamics of post-colonial nation-building and nationhood in a selfstyled multi-cultural state. Nationhood, does not exist apriori to the constructions of narratives of the nation, thus the stories told about the nation, imagine the nation into being. By situating the Truth and Justice Commission and other official state narratives alongside young people’s narratives, I argue that contemporary narratives <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> in Mauritius represent an intergenerational struggle to define {{the meaning of the}} past in the present and consequently outline the future. Reflecting on the ideas and socio-economic and political processes that induce national consciousness, I argue that young people’s narratives of everyday lived experiences are vital for an interpretation <b>of</b> how <b>nationhood</b> is produced in everyday life. The cultural projects of young people – often rendered as liminal or marginal – offer a critical vantage point from where to read constructions <b>of</b> <b>nationhood.</b> Far from being growing pains or childish games, young people’s identity making practices are what Sherry B. Ortner has called “serious games. ” This research suggests that official state government narratives <b>of</b> multicultural <b>nationhood</b> in Mauritius narrowly define national identification along communal loyalties, overlooking the dynamism of interculturality and transnationalism in daily practice on the island. Although communalism and rigid colonial interpretations of ethnicity attempt to police and limit the possibilities of alternative modes of being in Mauritius, young people’s identification practices question, challenge, and threaten to disrupt official discourses of ethnic identification in Mauritius Scholarly investigations of young peoples’ lived experiences <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> extend theoretical and methodological frames for the study of nationalized subjects and deepen the understanding of the construction of national consciousness. The construction <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> always involves narratives of some sort – scholarship on this area has usually focused on official state narratives from social theorists, state governments, and state elites. I argue for the importance of considering subjectivity and lived experience in conceptions <b>of</b> <b>nationhood.</b> In contemporary post-colonial societies, young people are the numerical majority, however, their voices are seldom represented in theories and narratives <b>of</b> <b>nationhood.</b> Whilst young people may appear in state policies (especially education) and official narratives {{about the future of the}} nation, their creative imagining and reimagining of narratives of selfhood is often ignored. I examine how young people increasingly are aware of their transnational connections, through participation in transnational youth cultures, and they are consequently increasingly multi-lingual and multicultural. Fixed notions of ethnic identification and discourses of trauma are not at the forefront of young people’s identification of selfhood, rather their ability to take advantage of their multiply situated identification processes allows them new means to evade and transform these narratives. Their identification of selfhood is characterised by a greater degree of dynamism than previous generations had access to, and thus they do not only identify themselves through officially sanctioned national forms of identification. Loyalty to nationhood is thus less predictable, and young people represent a potential threat to the continuation of older forms <b>of</b> <b>nationhood.</b> While official narratives <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> may manipulate ethnic and racial cleavages to secure old loyalties, not all young people are persuaded by these notion...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim to}} join feminist critiques of nationalism, arguing that beyond {{understanding}} nations as imagined communities (Anderson 1983 : 6), the symbolic construction of gender {{must also be considered}} in the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> those communities. We argue that the metaphor of an ‘imagined family’ or ‘filial community’ is a more useful concept towards understanding the links between gender and nationhood in four ways as family relations: 1) provide a clear, hierarchical structure, 2) prescribe social roles and responsibilities, 3) are linked to positive affective connotations and 4) reify social phenomena as biologically determined. In order to empirically substantiate our claim, we will explore the prevalence and use of family metaphors in a key symbol <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> discourses <b>of</b> <b>nationhood.</b> Through a qualitative analysis of national anthems as ‘mnemonics of national identity’, we demonstrate the widespread presence of family metaphors, discussing how they reproduce ideas of family and gender. Finally, we discuss how the ‘imagined family’ as present in anthems and other forms of national representation could inform future studies of nationalism and national politics.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} analyze the Turkish nation-building process during the early Republican period (1920 - 1938). In doing this, the {{substantive}} {{focus will be on}} three main dimensions [...] language, education, and citizenship [...] with particular emphasis on the rhetoric and actions of the political elite. By looking at language, education, and citizenship policies, and their formulations, the present analysis will make three main propositions: First, and in contrast to the existing literature on nations and nation-building, it will be demonstrated that the process of Turkish nation-building was neither a smooth nor an automatic process. Moreover, during the period under analysis, there were competing definitions <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> which were taken up, and discussed by the political elite. The final conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> [...] which took an assimilationist form with an ethnic understanding attached to it [...] was formed over time. At times, the process was wrought with tensions as illustrated by the heated debates among the political elite. Second, the present analysis will seek to bring together two different ways of looking at nation formation. More specifically, the analysis will attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} those works which only underline the role of ideas in the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> nations, and those which emphasize the role of structural forces. By paying attention to the "voices" (and actions) of the political elite, this study will demonstrate that it is not only ideas, nor is it only structural forces that matter. Rather, the crystallization of the contents <b>of</b> Turkish <b>nationhood</b> illustrates the interplay of ideological as well as geopolitical and political forces. Third, a detailed analysis of the trajectory of Turkish nation-building and the formulation <b>of</b> Turkish <b>nationhood</b> reveals the complexity of this process. The existing literature on Turkey tends to treat the Kemalist era as an undifferentiated whole. The present work will remain critical to such an outlook. Instead, and by looking at the shifting conceptualizations <b>of</b> <b>nationhood,</b> it will seek to demonstrate the complexity and contingent nature of the Turkish nation-building process...|$|R
40|$|The current thesis {{aimed to}} {{contribute}} to a national psychology for Canada by examining majority group (i. e., English Canadians) representations <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> and national identity as they relate to the cultural diversity comprising the nation. This dissertation took a macro-level approach to examine the content of English Canadians‘ representations, situating the research within a theoretical framework consisting of two families of existing social psychological theories of social representations (i. e., Social Representations Theory; Moscovici, 1961; and Social Representations of History; Liu & Hilton, 2005) and social identity (i. e., Social Identity Theory; Tajfel & Turner, 1979; and Self-Categorization Theory; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell, 1987). A multi-method approach using a mix of qualitative and quantitative techniques was employed to examine societal- and individual-level representations <b>of</b> Canadian <b>nationhood</b> and identity. The thesis had three major goals: 1) To determine the content <b>of</b> Canadian <b>nationhood</b> and identity; 2) To investigate if minority groups (i. e., French Canadians, Aboriginal peoples, and newer immigrants and their descendants) are included in and/or excluded from English Canadians‘ representations <b>of</b> Canadian <b>nationhood</b> and identity; and 3) To examine whether individuals‘ representations reflected government and mass media representations. The dissertation begins by reviewing existing literature on the content <b>of</b> Canadian <b>nationhood,</b> identity and diversity, providing an interpretive analysis using the guiding social psychological theories. Three empirical studies follow, which examined different aspects <b>of</b> representations <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> and identity. Study 1 used Critical Discourse Analysis (van Dijk, 1993) to investigate English Canadian print media representations <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> and identity by analysing the media response to two events concerned with the integration and accommodation of religious and cultural minorities, and immigrants. Study 2 examined ordinary citizens‘ representations of Canadian history through the use of survey methods. Study 3 examined implicit and explicit associations between ethnicity and Canadian nationhood. The findings revealed that governmental, media and individuals‘ representations <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> and identity were highly similar to one another, allowing us to advance a model of the content of Canadian identity. It was found that cultural groups are incorporated in English Canadians‘ representations <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> and identity in different ways from each other, depending on the context. It was shown that French Canadians represent a non-negligible component <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> and identity, but that they are sometimes reluctantly included in representations when they make demands on the majority. Aboriginal peoples are symbolically represented in English Canadians‘ representations of Canadian history, but are almost entirely absent from discussions of present day society and diversity. Newer immigrants and their descendants are sometimes included in present day representations <b>of</b> Canadian <b>nationhood</b> and identity, but are absent from historical representations. The Enlightenment Values of equality, freedom, democracy and reason (Michael, 2000) emerged as a crucial component <b>of</b> Canadian <b>nationhood</b> and identity, and this research suggests that they may represent why French Canadians are included in representations, as well as the key that newer immigrants and their descendants need to use to achieve inclusion (or conversely, warrant exclusion if they violate these values). Over all it was found that multiculturalism is not in itself a Canadian value, as has previously been suggested (Adams, 2007; Kymlicka, 2003), but it is instead a respect for the Enlightenment Values and an accommodation of diversity within these values that English Canadians treasure. Potential limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed. The thesis concludes with a consideration of how the results can be applied to increase the inclusion of minority groups in the majority group‘s conceptions <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> and identity. This work should serve as a launching point for discussions between the cultural groups about inclusion and exclusion...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article aims at {{sketching}} {{a synthetic}} and original approach to decrypt the process <b>of</b> the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> national identities. The theoretical framework proposed tries to combine different perspectives <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> (‘from above’ versus ‘from below’, constructivist versus performative and so on), which {{may appear to}} be contradictory but can be actually complete each other in a heuristic and novel way. The process <b>of</b> <b>nationhood</b> is explained within two major interactions. The first refers to the relationship between the materiality and practices of everyday life, on the one hand, and the engendered representations and symbolic patterns, on the other hand; the second focuses on the inputs provided by communication systems and the motivations/strategies of the social agents. The first dimension refers to the referential aspect of national identity, while the second dimension raises the issue of power (the role of institutions, devices and strategies) underlying its formation. This model also aims at establishing a research agenda for the study of national identities in all their complexities and dimensions. An example is presented to showcase its heuristic value.
