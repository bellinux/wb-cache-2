I have always thought it a great feather in Roden's cap that he should be so closely connected,--more than closely, I may say,--with your noble family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well; I see you're {{out with}} me for the tiff we had this morning. He's angry now, Father John, <b>just</b> through my <b>telling</b> <b>him</b> he couldn't count all the money he'd {{received}} this week." ...|$|R
