40|$|A {{stochastic}} <b>key</b> <b>block</b> {{method is}} {{developed for the}} analysis of complex blocky rock masses containing non-persistent joint sets. A robust block generation program is developed to model the non-persistent discontinuities. Various uncertainties of geological and geometrical parameters of the discontinuities are considered and Monte Carlo simulations of <b>key</b> <b>blocks</b> are performed. Based on the present analysis, progressive failure of a rock mass can be evaluated in a stochastic manner and the statistics of the <b>key</b> <b>blocks</b> including the total number and volume, the maximum and mean volume, shape and failure mechanism, etc. can be assessed. This approach is applied to a hypothetical horseshoe shaped tunnel in a highly fractured rock mass. Three scenarios with varying mean discontinuity size are analyzed to consider size effect on the predicted <b>blocks</b> and <b>key</b> <b>blocks.</b> It is shown quantitatively that a persistent discontinuity network assumption causes over-fragmentation of predicted <b>blocks,</b> overestimation of <b>key</b> <b>blocks,</b> and underestimation of the largest <b>key</b> <b>block</b> volume compared with non-persistent ones. More realistic representation of the discontinuities by considering the non-persistence is important to give out more reliable failure estimation of fractured rock mass. In addition, a case study application to a slope at the right bank of the Jinping I hydropower station has been conducted. <b>Key</b> <b>block</b> statistics is also helpful in support design...|$|R

The search of movable and <b>key</b> <b>blocks</b> of surrounding rock mass for underground powerhouse is implemented, the combinations of discontinuous faces and sliding faces, the location and the parameter of stability of movable and <b>key</b> <b>blocks</b> are obtained by used of the method of stereographic projection and vector analysis of the block theory. It is shown that the numbers of movable and <b>key</b> <b>blocks</b> in the location of downriver right side wall and vault are larger than those in other location owing to numerous discontinuous faces, and the faults of F 34 and F 33 play a main role in the stability of movable and <b>key</b> <b>blocks.</b> The guidance for excavation and reinforce of underground caverns is provided...|$|R
40|$|The {{system of}} {{discontinuities}} that transverses a rock mass delimits rock blocks of many sizes, shapes and positions in a surficial excavation. By using the block theory, {{it is possible}} to determine the most critical of these isolated masses, which are denoted as <b>key</b> <b>blocks.</b> After identifying the potential <b>key</b> <b>blocks,</b> their shapes and volumes can be computed with the input of the spacing of each discontinuity. In this paper, a sliding equilibrium stability analysis is performed with the friction of each discontinuity, the gravity force, the sliding direction and rock bolt support for the potential <b>key</b> <b>blocks</b> calculated from the study of some typical examples and field cases...|$|R
40|$|An {{extended}} <b>key</b> <b>block</b> {{method for}} rock mass stability analysis is proposed {{by considering the}} force effect of <b>key</b> <b>blocks</b> in later batches to the first batch which is exposed at rock mass surfaces. Through a realistic numerical representation of a three-dimensional rock mass, different batches of <b>key</b> <b>blocks</b> are searched {{by means of a}} progressive failure process. A force transfer algorithm is developed to consider the interactions of the <b>key</b> <b>blocks</b> in different batches. The calculated sliding forces in the first batch which consider the later batches&# 039; effect will lead to a better design of rock supports. After selection of a reinforcement scheme, the stability of the reinforced rock mass is re-assessed. Those larger instable blocks formed by inside blocks with anchored surface blocks are checked out. It is found that the two-step check of a reinforcement scheme, i. e. (1) safety check of the bolted individual blocks; (2) safety check of the bolted block groups is more effective. Results show that the proposed rock support design method is more realistic and rational for the reinforcement of blocky rock mass...|$|R

40|$|The jointed {{surrounding}} rock mass {{stability is}} of utmost importance to integral stability during the construction and long-term safety operation of the underground caverns in hydropower stations. The <b>key</b> <b>blocks</b> {{play a significant role}} in the integral stability of the jointed surrounding rock mass, therefore it is critical to determine the location, size, and failure mode of random <b>key</b> <b>blocks.</b> This paper proposes an improved method combining the traditional <b>key</b> <b>block</b> theory (KBT) and the force transfer algorithm to accurately calculate the safety factors of probabilistic <b>key</b> <b>blocks</b> in the surrounding rock mass. The force transfer algorithm can consider the interactions between the internal blocks. After the probabilistic characteristics of the joint fissures are obtained, the stereographic projection method is employed to determine the locations of dangerous joints. Then the vector analysis method is used to search the random blocks, determine the sliding directions of random blocks, and calculate the block sizes and safety factors near the free surface of the underground cavern, which can be used to comprehensively evaluate the surrounding rock mass stability. The above numerical results have provided powerful guidance for developing a reinforcement system for the surrounding rock mass...|$|R

Firstly, the density distribution and <b>key</b> <b>block</b> features of a document image are defined and extracted based on documents’ print-core.

40|$|Brain disease {{including}} any {{conditions or}} disabilities {{that affect the}} brain is fast becoming {{a leading cause of}} death. The traditional diagnostic methods of brain disease are time-consuming, inconvenient and non-patient friendly. As more and more individuals undergo examinations to determine if they suffer from any form of brain disease, developing noninvasive, efficient, and patient friendly detection systems will be beneficial. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel noninvasive brain disease detection system based on the analysis of facial colors. The system consists of four components. A facial image is first captured through a specialized sensor, where four facial <b>key</b> <b>blocks</b> are next located automatically from the various facial regions. Color features are extracted from each block to form a feature vector for classification via the Probabilistic Collaborative based Classifier. To thoroughly test the system and its performance, seven facial <b>key</b> <b>block</b> combinations were experimented. The best result was achieved using the second facial <b>key</b> <b>block,</b> where it showed that the Probabilistic Collaborative based Classifier is the most suitable. The overall performance of the proposed system achieves an accuracy − 95 %, a sensitivity − 94. 33 %, a specificity − 95. 67 %, and an average processing time (for one sample) of < 1 min at brain disease detection...|$|R
