40|$|Abstract. Safety {{evacuation}} {{design is}} a key content for building fire safety design. In this paper, we apply the CAFE model to conduct an one-exit room simulation. And then we establish the regression equation of exit flow rate considering the factors of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> width, <b>the</b> size of the room, the location of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> and <b>the</b> pedestrian density. So as to find the effect of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> location on <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate, we analyze the correlation of the two variables. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate of large room is easily affected by <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> location. And it proves that <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate decreases {{with the increase of}} <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> location. At last we study the probability distribution of the number of pedestrians evacuating through <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> and list some reasons why <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate decreases with <b>the</b> increasing <b>exit</b> width...|$|R
