40|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} flexible choice is that alternative actions yield distinct consequences: Only when available action alternatives produce distinct outcome states does discrimination and selection between actions allow an agent to flexibly obtain the currently most desired outcome. Here, we use instrumental divergence - {{the degree to}} which alternative actions differ with respect to their outcome probability distributions - as an index of <b>flexible</b> instrumental <b>control,</b> and assess the influence of this novel decision variable on choice preference. In Experiment 1, when other decision variables, such as expected value and outcome entropy, were held constant, we found a significant preference for high instrumental divergence. In Experiment 2, we used an "auto- vs. self-play" manipulation to eliminate outcome diversity as a source of behavioral preferences, and to contrast <b>flexible</b> instrumental <b>control</b> with the complete absence of voluntary choice. Our results suggest that <b>flexible</b> instrumental <b>control</b> over decision outcomes may have intrinsic value...|$|R

Such powerful capability allows us to simulate frustration phenomena and disorder behaviors in 1 -d systems arising from next-NN interactions, a large class of problems of great importance in condensed matter physics.

Curtailment of output of wind plants is possible if {{there are a number}} of wind turbine generators that share a network demand.

However, wind plants can also be considered as limited-flexible plants if the alternative platforms are available to control the outputs of wind plants entering the power grid.
