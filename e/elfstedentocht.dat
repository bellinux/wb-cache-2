50|$|Koopmans, born in Amsterdam, {{organised}} {{his first}} Alternative <b>Elfstedentocht</b> in 1975 in Finland {{due to the}} winters in the Netherlands being too warm to skate 200 km in open air on ice. In later years, the Alternative Elfstedentochten were organised in various countries like Poland, Czech Republic, Canada, Norway, Sweden and Japan. In 2007 the first Alternative <b>Elfstedentocht</b> in Mongolia will be held.|$|E
5000|$|Reinier Paping (born 18 February 1931, in Dedemsvaart) is a Dutch speedskater {{primarily}} {{known as}} {{the winner of the}} <b>Elfstedentocht</b> of 1963. This <b>Elfstedentocht</b> became known as [...] "The hell of '63" [...] when only 69 of the 10,000 contestants were able to finish the race, due to the extremely low temperatures, dipping to -18°C, and a harsh eastern wind.|$|E

During the last held <b>Elfstedentocht</b> in 1997 she finished second. She also won the alternative <b>Elfstedentocht</b> - skated in Finland - in 1998, 2000 and 2001.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Kleine {{became a}} {{marathon}} skater. This {{led to some}} controversy in 1997 when he finished 5th in the <b>Elfstedentocht,</b> but was subsequently removed from the final list of results because of a missing stamp on his stamp card. The controversy lay in the fact that, afterwards, {{it became clear that}} in the past several winners of the <b>Elfstedentocht</b> had missed stamps too, but were still declared the winners.|$|E

50|$|In 1985, it {{had been}} 22 years since the last <b>Elfstedentocht,</b> which is skated on natural ice in Friesland, a 200 km race. On February 21, 1985, Van Benthem won the 13th <b>Elfstedentocht.</b> After 200 km on natural ice, he entered the final stretch into Leeuwarden {{together}} with Jan Kooiman, Jos Niesten and Henri Ruitenberg, all marathon speed skaters. Van Benthem won the sprint, completing the 196.8 km in 6 hours 47 mins, an average of 29.0 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Elfstedentocht</b> was {{organized}} as a competition in 1909 {{and has been}} held at irregular intervals, whenever the ice on the course is deemed good enough. Other outdoor races developed later, with Friesland in the northern Netherlands hosting a race in 1917, but the Dutch natural ice conditions have rarely been conducive to skating. The <b>Elfstedentocht</b> has been held 15 times in the nearly 100 years since 1909, and, before artificial ice was available in 1962, national championships had been held in 25 of the years between 1887, when the first championship was held in Slikkerveer, and 1961. Since artificial ice became common in the Netherlands, Dutch speed skaters {{have been among the}} world top in long track ice skating and marathon skating. Another solution to still be able to skate marathons on natural ice became the Alternative <b>Elfstedentocht.</b> The Alternative <b>Elfstedentocht</b> races take part in other countries, such as Austria, Finland or Canada, and all top marathon skaters, as well as thousands of recreative skaters, travel from the Netherlands to the location where the race is held. According to the NRC Handelsblad journalist Jaap Bloembergen, the country [...] "takes a carnival look" [...] during international skating championships.|$|E

50|$|Not even {{halfway through}} the harsh <b>Elfstedentocht</b> of January 18, 1963, Paping skated away from a leading group with Jeen van den Berg, Anton Verhoeven and Jan Uitham, and {{traveled}} {{the rest of the}} trip alone. Paping finished the race in ten hours and 59 minutes, while the second-place finisher, Jan Uitham, arrived a full 22 minutes later. Because of the horrendous conditions—which included bone chilling cold of -18°C— his long solo escape, {{and the fact that the}} next <b>Elfstedentocht</b> was not held until 22 years later, Paping became a national hero and the tour itself legendary.|$|E
