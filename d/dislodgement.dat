5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of <b>dislodgement</b> of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E
5|$|More serious {{complications}} include laryngospasm, perforation of the trachea or esophagus, pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents {{or other}} foreign bodies, fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine, temporomandibular joint or arytenoid cartilages, decreased oxygen content, elevated arterial carbon dioxide, and vocal cord weakness. In {{addition to these}} complications, tracheal intubation via the nasal route carries a risk of <b>dislodgement</b> of adenoids and potentially severe nasal bleeding. Newer technologies such as flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy have fared better in reducing the incidence {{of some of these}} complications, though the most frequent cause of intubation trauma remains a lack of skill {{on the part of the}} laryngoscopist.|$|E

40|$|In {{patients}} undergoing cardiac device implantation, anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy {{are associated}} with an increased risk of pocket hematoma. In case of vitamin K antagonist therapy, a strategy of continued warfarin with no heparin bridge showed a reduction of pocket hematoma. Evidence regarding antiplatelet therapy management is limited. This is a single-center observational study which reflects our systematic approach to the problem. In 2012, we proposed an improved management protocol for anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy (no-bridge protocol) based on individual thromboembolic risk stratification, noninterruption of oral anticoagulation, no bridge with heparin and elastic adherence compression bandage. The primary end point was the incidence of clinically significant pocket hematoma in the first 30  days after implantation. A total of 1, 035 patients were enrolled, of whom 522 received the standard management and 513 the new protocol. The primary end point occurred in 34 patients of the standard management group and 8  patients of the no-bridge protocol group (6. 5 % vs 1. 6 %, p < 0. 001). Patients in the standard management group had a higher incidence of pocket infections (2. 3 % vs 0. 6 %, p = 0. 02), lead <b>dislodgements</b> (4. 8 % vs 2. 1 %, p = 0. 02), and thromboembolic events (1. 3 % vs 0. 0 %, p < 0. 01). On a multivariate analysis, heparin and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of pocket hematoma (relative risk [RR] 3. 48, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 55 to 7. 83 and RR 2. 43, 95 % CI 1. 25 to 4. 76, respectively), whereas the no-bridge protocol was associated with a reduction of pocket hematoma (RR 0. 33, 95 % CI 0. 14 to 0. 76).

5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or <b>dislodgement</b> of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E
25|$|Larger {{trees are}} more likely to support more Orthalicus reses reses snails than smaller trees, {{probably}} because they provide the snails with an increased surface area for foraging. It is not known if Orthalicus reses reses prefer certain tree types or species; however, Voss (1976) suggested tree snails generally prefer trees with smooth bark rather than trees with rough bark, because it would require less energy to crawl over smooth bark. Voss also believed Orthalicus reses reses would prefer smooth bark because it {{would make it easier for}} them to form a secure mucous seal when they were aestivating, resulting in lower mortalities from dehydration or accidental <b>dislodgement.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these exposure stresses (temperature, desiccation, and salinity), intertidal organisms experience strong mechanical stresses, especially in locations of high wave action. There are myriad {{ways in which the}} organisms prevent <b>dislodgement</b> due to waves. Morphologically, many mollusks (such as limpets and chitons) have low-profile, hydrodynamic shells. Types of substrate attachments include mussels' tethering byssal threads and glues, sea stars' thousands of suctioning tube feet, and isopods' hook-like appendages that help them hold on to intertidal kelps. Higher profile organisms, such as kelps, must also avoid breaking in high flow locations, and they do so with their strength and flexibility. Finally, organisms can also avoid high flow environments, such as by seeking out low flow microhabitats. Additional forms of mechanical stresses include ice and sand scour, as well as dislodgment by water-borne rocks, logs, etc.|$|E
40|$|The {{subcutaneous}} implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) and leadless pacemaker (LP) are evolving {{technologies that}} do not require intracardiac leads. However, interactions between these two devices are unexplored. We investigated the feasibility, safety, and performance of combined LP and S-ICD therapy, considering (i) simultaneous device-programmer communication, (ii) S-ICD rhythm discrimination during LP communication and pacing, and (iii) post-shock LP performance. The study consists of two parts. Animal experiments: Two sheep were implanted with both an S-ICD and LP (Nanostim, SJM), and the objectives above were tested. Human experience: Follow-up of one S-ICD patient with bilateral subclavian occlusion who received an LP and two LP (all Nanostim, SJM) patients (without S-ICD) who received electrical cardioversion (ECV) are presented. Animal experiments : Simultaneous device-programmer communication was successful, but LP-programmer communication telemetry was temporarily lost (2 ± 2 s) during ventricular fibrillation (VF) induction and 4 / 54 shocks. Leadless pacemaker communication and pacing did not interfere with S-ICD rhythm discrimination. Additionally, all VF episodes (n = 12 / 12), including during simultaneous LP pacing, were detected and treated by the S-ICD. Post-shock LP performance was unaltered, and no post-shock device resets or <b>dislodgements</b> were observed (24 S-ICD and 30 external shocks). Human experience : The S-ICD/LP patient showed adequate S-ICD sensing during intrinsic rhythm, nominal, and high-output LP pacing. Two LP patients (without S-ICD) received ECV during follow-up. No impact on performance or LP <b>dislodgements</b> were observed. Combined LP and S-ICD therapy appears feasible in all animal experiments (n = 2) and in one human subject. No interference in sensing and pacing during intrinsic and paced rhythm was noted in both animal and human subjects. However, induced arrhythmia testing was not performed in the patient. Defibrillation therapy did not seem to affect LP function. More data on safety and performance are neede...|$|R
30|$|In many spine centres, VEPTR {{has been}} used for 5 – 10  years.

Given that there are an increasing number of VEPTR patients who are reaching skeletal maturity with a relative stiff spine at the time of conversion into instrumented fusion, underlying autofusion and ossifications must be hypothesized [12, 18]. It has been our anecdotal experience that unwanted new bone formation adjacent to the implant makes the term “non-fusion” and the assumption of function preservation questionable. However, there is a paucity of literature on those topics. Groenefeld and Hell recently claimed that the radiographic occurrence of ossification rose continuously up to 48  % at 53  months after the index procedure in a single-centre study of 57 VEPTR patients [14].|$|R

Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement. Primary outcomes were success rate, efficacy of feeding, quality of life, gastroesophageal reflux and post-operative complications. Results: Five retrospective studies, comparing 550 PEG to 483 LAG placements in children, were identified after screening 2347 articles. The completion rate was similar for both procedures. PEG was associated with significantly more adjacent bowel injuries (P = 0. 047), early tube <b>dislodgements</b> (P = 0. 02) and complications that require reintervention under general anaesthesia (P < 0. 001). Minor complications were equally frequent after both procedures. Conclusions: Because of the lack of well-designed studies, we have to be cautious in making definitive conclusions comparing PEG to LAG.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{safety profile}} of open door laminoplasty plates. Overview of Literature: Few reports have documented potential complications {{related to the}} use of cervical laminoplasty plates. Methods: Records and radiographs of consecutive plated laminoplasty patients of one academic surgeon were analyzed. Group 1 had screw back-out, defined as change in screw position, and group 2 did not. Results: Forty-two patients (mean age, 56. 9) underwent “open-door ” cervical laminoplasty using 165 plates. Mean follow-up was 24 months (range, 12 – 49 months). Mean Nurick grade improved from 2. 1 to 0. 9 postoperatively. Cervical lordosis (C 2 – 7) was 12. 1 ° preoperatively and 10. 0 ° postoperatively. Range-of-motion was 27. 0 ° preoperatively and 23. 4 ° postoperatively. Partial screw back-out was noted in 27 of 165 plates (16. 4 %) and in 34 of 660 screws (5. 2 %). Of the 34 screws, 27 (79. 4 %) were at either the most cranial (12 / 27, 44. 4 %) or the most caudal (15 / 27, 55. 5 %) level. Cranially, 11 / 12 screws (91. 7 %) had back-out. Caudally, 9 / 15 lateral mass screws (60. 0 %) backed-out versus 6 laminar screws (40. 0 %). Of the 22 patients with screw back-out, 15 (68. 2 %) occurred < 3 months postoperative and 6 (27. 3 %) occurred 4 – 12 months postoperative. No statistical differences were found between group 1 and 2 for age, gender, preoperative and postoperative lordosis, focal sagittal alignment, range-of-motion, or Nurick grade. Despite screw back-out in 22 patients, there were no plate <b>dislodgements,</b> laminoplasty closure, or neurological deterioration. Conclusions: Although screw back-out may occur with the use of cervical laminoplasty plates, the use of these plates without a bone block appears to be safe and reliable.

40|$|A leadless {{intracardiac}} transcatheter pacing {{system has}} been designed to avoid the need for a pacemaker pocket and transvenous lead. In a prospective multicenter study without controls, a transcatheter pacemaker was implanted in patients who had guideline-based indications for ventricular pacing. The analysis of the primary end points began when 300 patients reached 6 months of follow-up. The primary safety end point was freedom from system-related or procedure-related major complications. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage of patients with low and stable pacing capture thresholds at 6 months (≤ 2. 0 V at a pulse width of 0. 24 msec and an increase of ≤ 1. 5 V from the time of implantation). The safety and efficacy end points were evaluated against performance goals (based on historical data) of 83 % and 80 %, respectively. We also performed a post hoc analysis in which the rates of major complications were compared with those in a control cohort of 2667 patients with transvenous pacemakers from six previously published studies. The device was successfully implanted in 719 of 725 patients (99. 2 %). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the rate of the primary safety end point was 96. 0 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 93. 9 to 97. 3; P < 0. 001 for the comparison with the safety performance goal of 83 %); there were 28 major complications in 25 of 725 patients, and no <b>dislodgements.</b> The rate of the primary efficacy end point was 98. 3 % (95 % CI, 96. 1 to 99. 5; P < 0. 001 for the comparison with the efficacy performance goal of 80 %) among 292 of 297 patients with paired 6 -month data.

Patients and methodsWe review patients included over the last 12 months in the prospective study (REVALV) for patients undergoing RVOT intervention for severe stenosis and/or insufficiency. Only valved stent on native RVOT group is analyzed here. 10 patients were included. We perform MRI, balloon calibration and angiography of the RVOT to all patients in order to define the RVOT morphology, and to establish a personalized technique for each patient in order to implant a valved stent on the native RVOT. All patients undergoing valved stent implantation are previously pre-stented with a bare metal stent according to present recommendations. ResultsInitial dimensions for these patients were on the upper limit for the established criteria. 2 had a diameter above 24 mm. Decision for implanting valved stent was taken {{based on the fact}} that pre-stenting reduces RVOT diameter acchieving 22 mm, and giving the native outflow track the stability to prevent valved-stent fractures. For one patient, left pulmonary branch was stented down to the pulmonary trunk in order to have an appropriate diameter for valved-stenting. Pulmonary valve was placed successfully in all cases. All but one had been pre-stented at same procedure than valvulation. Of those, one freshly implanted bare metal stent dislodged to the right pulmonary artery when tenting to place the delivery system for the percutaneous valve. Two extra bare metal stents were implanted in order to cover the branch to the trunk, and finally valved stent was placed with no further problems. ConclusionsPercutaneous pulmonary valve implantation can be performed on patients having native RVOT with success. Pre-stenting should be performed in a previous intervention in order to ensure stabilization of the bare metal stent and to avoid <b>dislodgements.</b> MRI, angiography and balloon calibration are not discriminating criteria for discarding candidates if personalized techniques are established for each patient. Pulmonary branches can be used as anchors for PPVI...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2009. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Prof. Art Erdman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 193 pages, appendices A-D. ill. (some col.) In this work, a porous electrode was fabricated and evaluated in a chronic animal study on a coronary venous pacing lead {{in order to}} assess its potential for mitigating chronic lead <b>dislodgements</b> and reducing the characteristic rise in pacing thresholds after implant, both of which being important issues that impact safety and efficacy of implanted cardiac resynchronization therapy systems. Eight test leads were assembled with a porous tip electrode with an average pore size of approximately 30 micrometers, created via a novel fabrication method, and eight control leads were assembled with a standard solid tip electrode design. Both groups were created without steroid-eluting collars and without a capacitive coating on the tip electrodes in order to isolate the affects of electrode porosity. Leads were implanted in canines, and electrical data and x-rays of lead position were taken regularly throughout the 60 -day study. Tissue histology was performed for each lead. Significantly lower (p< 0. 05) mean rise in pacing threshold after implant was observed at day 3 and day 21 for the test group leads (with porous electrodes) as compared to the control group leads. Despite the higher surface area of the porous tip electrodes, pacing impedance was not statistically different between the groups throughout the study, a result likely due to decreased chronic inflammatory response at the surface of porous electrodes. The test group had no lead retractions after day 3 as determined by inspection of x-ray radiographs, while 3 - 6 (of 8) control group leads retracted after day 3, a result likely due to anchoring of the lead tip due to observed tissue growth into porous electrodes. Mean fibrous capsule thickness at pre-defined measurement points on the tip electrode was not statistically different between the groups, which correlates with the nearly equal mean pacing thresholds for the groups at day 60. The lack of lead retractions for the test groups leads after day 3 is a promising result which should be investigated further, along with investigations of lead extraction force and further electrical data evaluations, using larger sample sizes and more challenging implant conditions...|$|R
40|$|MiStent is a {{drug-eluting}} stent with a fully absorbable {{polymer coating}} containing and embedding a microcrystalline form of sirolimus into the vessel wall. It {{was developed to}} overcome the limitation of current durable polymer drug-eluting stents eluting amorphous sirolimus. The clinical effect of MiStent sirolimus-eluting stent compared with a durable polymer drug-eluting stents has not been investigated in a large randomised trial in an all-comer population. We did a randomised, single-blind, multicentre, phase 3 study (DESSOLVE III) at 20 hospitals in Germany, France, Netherlands, and Poland. Eligible participants were any patients aged at least 18 years who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in a lesion and had a reference vessel diameter of 2 · 50 - 3 · 75 mm. We randomly assigned patients (1 : 1) to implantation of either a sirolimus-eluting bioresorbable polymer stent (MiStent) or an everolimus-eluting durable polymer stent (Xience). Randomisation was done by local investigators via web-based software with random blocks according to centre. The primary endpoint was a non-inferiority comparison of a device-oriented composite endpoint (DOCE) -cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or clinically indicated target lesion revascularisation-between the groups at 12 months after the procedure assessed by intention-to-treat. A margin of 4 · 0 % was defined for non-inferiority of the MiStent group compared with the Xience group. All participants {{were included in the}} safety analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 02385279. Between March 20, and Dec 3, 2015, we randomly assigned 1398 patients with 2030 lesions; 703 patients with 1037 lesions were assigned to MiStent, of whom 697 received the index procedure, and 695 patients with 993 lesions were asssigned to Xience, of whom 690 received the index procedure. At 12 months, the primary endpoint had occurred in 40 patients (5 · 8 %) in the sirolimus-eluting stent group and in 45 patients (6 · 5 %) in the everolimus-eluting stent group (absolute difference - 0 · 8 % [95 % CI - 3 · 3 to 1 · 8], pnon-inferiority= 0 · 0001). Procedural complications occurred in 12 patients (1 · 7 %) in the sirolimus-eluting stent group and ten patients (1 · 4 %) in the everolimus-eluting stent group; no clinical adverse events could be attributed to these <b>dislodgements</b> through a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. The rate of stent thrombosis, a safety indicator, did not differ between groups and was low in both treatment groups. The sirolimus-eluting bioabsorbable polymer stent was non-inferior to the everolimus-eluting durable polymer stent for a device-oriented composite clinical endpoint at 12 months in an all-comer population. MiStent seems a reasonable alternative to other stents in clinical practice. The European Cardiovascular Research Institute, Micell Technologies (Durham, NC, USA), and Stentys (Paris, France...|$|R
50|$|Crosstalk occurs only in dual chamber or biventricular {{pacemakers}}, {{though it}} rarely seen more recent models of dual chamber pacemakers due to ventricular blanking period, which {{coincides with the}} atrial stimulus to prevent ventricular channel oversensing of atrial output, along with bipolar leads with a smaller pacing spike, and steroid eluting leads with a lower pacing threshold. Crosstalk {{is more common in}} unipolar systems due to larger pacing spike. Crosstalk is sometimes referred to as known crosstalk inhibition, far-field sensing, or self-inhibition. In some cases, crosstalk can occur in the pulse generator circuit itself, though more common causes include atrial lead <b>dislodgement</b> into the ventricle, ventricular lead <b>dislodgement</b> into the atrium, high atrial output current, high ventricular sensitivity, and short ventricular blanking period.|$|E
