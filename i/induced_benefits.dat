40|$|Huntington’s disease (HD) is an {{autosomal}} dominant neurodegenerative genetic disorder characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. It {{is well established}} that regular physical activity supports brain health, benefiting cognitive function, mental health as well as brain structure and plasticity. Exercise mimetics (EMs) are a group of drugs and small molecules that target signaling pathways in skeletal muscle known to be activated by endurance exercise. The EM 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide- 1 -β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) {{has been shown to}} <b>induce</b> cognitive <b>benefits</b> in healthy mice. Since AICAR does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, its beneficial effect on the brain has been ascribed to its impact on skeletal muscle. Our objective, therefore, was to examine the effect of chronic AICAR treatment on the muscular and neurological pathology in a mouse model of HD. To this end, R 6 / 2 mice were treated with AICAR for 8 [*]weeks and underwent regular neurobehavioral testing. Under our conditions, AICAR increased expression of PGC- 1 α, a powerful phenotypic modifier of muscle, and induced the expected shift toward a more oxidative muscle phenotype in R 6 / 2 mice. However, this treatment failed to <b>induce</b> <b>benefits</b> on HD progression. Indeed, neurobehavioral deficits, striatal, and muscle mutant huntingtin aggregate density, as well as muscle atrophy were not mitigated by the chronic administration of AICAR. Although the muscle adaptations seen in HD mice following AICAR treatment may still provide therapeutically relevant benefits to patients with limited mobility, our findings indicate that under our experimental conditions, AICAR had no effect on several hallmarks of HD...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Objectives of the Study: The {{objective}} of this thesis is to explore the hidden pitfalls of Kanban in software development. The aim is to discover the reasons behind the pitfalls and actions that nourish Kanban's failure. Academic background and methodology: Software development industry has been shifting towards more iterative, responsive and people-oriented development methods, which present the values of lean and agile thinking. Being characterized as the antidote for bureaucracy, the shift towards agile development methodologies {{has been one of}} the most significant factors affecting the software industry. Kanban as an agile change management framework has been perceived as the fairy godmother of software development making the reasons behind struggling Kanban projects particularly interesting. Thesis interviews five agile experts in the software development and studies their experiences of unsuccessful Kanban implementations. Emphasis is given to similar experiences and perceptions on how Kanban fails to redeem its value proposition. Findings: The primary finding of the study is that an organization that is unable to change its mindset to support Kanban is a pitfall affecting the whole project, inevitably causing Kanban to fail. This is a challenge that all agile methods have in common. Agile can flourish only when agile values are being appreciated. The secondary finding is that many software teams claiming to be using Kanban have implemented only a shallow imitation of the real method thus creating a superficial implementation, which prevents achieving Kanban <b>induced</b> <b>benefits.</b> Thus, creating a superficial implementation, which prevents achieving Kanban <b>induced</b> <b>benefits.</b> Furthermore, the erroneous human interpretation of what Kanban really is and how to apply it correctly is a key factor contributing to the emerge of the pitfalls.

40|$|Our results {{demonstrate}} that the addition of cisplatin after paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest was more effective than individual treatment on gastric adenocarcinoma cells (MKN 45). However, the treatment did not <b>induce</b> <b>benefits</b> in cells derived from lymph node metastasis (ST 2957). Time-lapse microscopy revealed that cell death was caused by mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis induction, {{as the use of}} the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk decreased cell death. We propose that the molecular mechanism mediating this cell fate is a slippage suffered by these cells, given that our Western blot (WB) analysis revealed premature cyclin B degradation. This resulted in the cell exiting from mitosis without undergoing DNA damage repair, as demonstrated by the strong phosphorylation of H 2 AX. A comet assay indicated that DNA repair was impaired, and Western blotting showed that the Chk 2 protein was degraded after sequential treatment (paclitaxel-cisplatin). Based on these results, the modulation of cell death during mitosis may be an effective strategy for gastric cancer therapy.

To summarize recent evidences on microflora modulation in main intestinal inflammatory disorders, PubMed was searched using terms microbiota, intestinal flora, probiotics, prebiotics, fecal transplantation. More than three hundred articles published up to 2015 were selected and reviewed. Randomized placebo-controlled trials and meta-analysis were firstly included, mainly for probiotics. A meta-analysis was not performed because of the heterogeneity of these studies. Most of relevant data derived from studies on probiotics, reporting some efficacy in ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis, while disappointing results are available for Crohn's disease. Probiotic supplementation may significantly reduce rates of rotavirus diarrhea. Efficacy of probiotics in NSAID enteropathy and irritable bowel syndrome is still controversial. Finally, FMT has been recently recognized as an efficacious treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.

40|$|Visceral pain is {{the most}} common form of pain caused by varied {{diseases}} and a major reason for patients to seek medical consultation. Despite much advances, the pathophysiological mechanism is still poorly understood comparing with its somatic counterpart and, as a result, the therapeutic efficacy is usually unsatisfactory. Acupuncture has long been used for the management of numerous disorders in particular pain and visceral pain, characterized by the high therapeutic benefits and low adverse effects. Previous findings suggest that acupuncture depresses pain via activation of a number of neurotransmitters or modulators including opioid peptides, serotonin, norepinephrine, and adenosine centrally and peripherally. It endows us, by advancing the understanding of the role of ion channels and gut microbiota in pain process, with novel perspectives to probe the mechanisms underlying acupuncture analgesia.

40|$|The {{glycaemic}} index (GI) concept was originally introduced to classify different sources of carbohydrate (CHO) -rich foods, usually having an energy content of > 80 % from CHO, to {{their effect on}} post-meal glycaemia. It was assumed to apply to foods that primarily deliver available CHO, causing hyperglycaemia. Low-GI foods were classified as being digested and absorbed slowly and high-GI foods as being rapidly digested and absorbed, resulting in different glycaemic responses. Low-GI foods were found to <b>induce</b> <b>benefits</b> on certain risk factors for CVD and diabetes. Accordingly it has been proposed that GI classification of foods and drinks could be useful to help consumers make 'healthy food choices' within specific food groups. Classification of foods according to their impact on blood glucose responses requires a standardised way of measuring such responses. The present review discusses the most relevant methodological considerations and highlights specific recommendations regarding number of subjects, sex, subject status, inclusion and exclusion criteria, pre-test conditions, CHO test dose, blood sampling procedures, sampling times, test randomisation and calculation of glycaemic response area under the curve. All together, these technical recommendations will help to implement or reinforce measurement of GI in laboratories and help to ensure quality of results. Since there is current international interest in alternative ways of expressing glycaemic responses to foods, some of these methods are discussed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper gives {{preliminary}} results about {{the utilization of}} an interaction technique called FOLLOW-ME to fasten the selection task for teleoperation system. The implementation of an interaction between a user and a Virtual Environment (VE) in Virtual Reality (VR) may use various techniques. However, {{in the case of}} teleoperation, the interaction must be very precise and comfortable for the user. The model associated to the FOLLOW-ME technique splits the Virtual Environment into three zones in which a specific interaction model is used: a free manipulation zone, a scaled manipulation zone and a precise manipulation zone. Each one of the three zones is characterized by a specific interaction granularity. In the precise manipulation zone, we use the concept of virtual guides in order to assist the user to achieve his task. In this paper, our aim is to show that the FOLLOW-ME technique is well suited for selection in teleoperation tasks. To do this, we have first compared the FOLLOW-ME technique with classical interaction techniques in a virtual environment where different targets are situated at different depth and may move. The {{preliminary results}} show that our technique is more efficient than the classical Go-Go and Ray-casting techniques, in a sense that the task is more reproducible and easier to accomplish by the user.

This thesis investigates the announcement effects surrounding the passage of SOX to examine the differential impact of SOX on U. S. publicly traded companies. As the Act requires greater transparency of financial reporting and imposes burden on managers through mandatory CEO/CFO certification of financial statements, the associated compliance costs create a significant loss in total market value that amounts to $ 1. 4 trillion (Zhang 2005). It is predicted that SOX has a disproportionate negative impact on small firms due to the fixed cost component of the compliance costs and the characteristics of small firms (i. e. they compete on flexibility but SOX limits it).

It is argued that such a Schumpeterian approach for an open economy is needed to understand deep integration dynamics while the standard CGE model used by Francois et al (2013) leads to an underestimation of deep integration projects such as TTIP. The panel data estimation of knowledge production functions for 20 EU countries between 2002 - 2012 shows clear empirical evidence that a rise of the number of researchers and of the FDI stock-GDP ratio (or related variables) will raise patent applications.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{patients}} with severe aortic stenosis (AS), long-term data tracking surgically induced effects of afterload reduction on reverse LV remodeling are not available. Echocardiographic data is available short term, but in limited fashion beyond one year. Cardiovascular MRI (CMR) offers {{the ability to}} serially track changes in LV metrics with small numbers due to its inherent high spatial resolution and low variability. Hypothesis We hypothesize that changes in LV structure and function following aortic valve replacement (AVR) are detectable by CMR and once triggered by AVR, continue for an extended period. Methods Tweny-four patients of which ten (67 ± 12 years, 6 female) with severe, but compensated AS underwent CMR pre-AVR, 6 months, 1 year and up to 4 years post-AVR. 3 D LV mass index, volumetrics, LV geometry, and EF were measured. Results All patients survived AVR and underwent CMR 4 serial CMR's. LVMI markedly decreased by 6 months (157 ± 42 to 134 ± 32 g/m 2, p 2). Similarly, EF increased pre to post-AVR (55 ± 22 to 65 ± 11 %,(p 2). LV stroke volume increased rapidly from pre to post-AVR (40 ± 11 to 44 ± 7 ml, p Conclusion After initial beneficial effects imparted by AVR in severe AS patients, there are, as expected, marked improvements in LV reverse remodeling. Via CMR, surgically <b>induced</b> <b>benefits</b> to LV structure and function are durable and, unexpectedly express continued, albeit markedly incomplete improvement through 4 years post-AVR concordant with sustained improved clinical status. This supports down-regulation of both mRNA and MMP activity acutely with robust suppression long term. </p...|$|E

Key words: input-output, negative impact, value added. Input-output (I-O) methodology is often used for predictions of local or regional economic changes that are expected if a project is un-dertaken. I-O is a useful tool because it pro-vides not only an accounting of a project's di-rect effects but also provides estimates of indirect effects and induced changes through-out the regional economy. Indirect and in-duced effects are not included in the benefit-cost (B-C) analysis that all federal projects must undergo prior to funding. B-C compares only direct costs with direct benefits. If resources that would otherwise be unemployed are used {{as a result of a}} project, a direct "employment benefit " may be credited. However, indirect or secondary effects such as might be predicted by I-O analysis may be included only in a "re-gional development " accounting or as part of a socioeconomic impact assessment.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) has led a {{revolution}} in physiology and pharmacology research {{during the last two}} decades. This labile molecule {{plays an important role in}} many functions in the body regulating vasodilatation, blood flow, mitochondrial respiration and platelet function. Currently, it is known that NO synthesis occurs via at least two physiological pathways: NO synthase (NOS) dependent and NOS independent. In the former, L-arginine is the main precursor. It is widely recognized that this amino acid is oxidized to NO by the action of the NOS enzymes. Additionally, L-citrulline has been indicated to be a secondary NO donor in the NOS-dependent pathway, since it can be converted to L-arginine. Nitrate and nitrite are the main substrates to produceNO via the NOS-independent pathway. These anions can be reduced in vivo to NO and other bioactive nitrogen oxides. Other molecules, such as the dietary supplement glycine propionyl-L-carnitine (GPLC), have also been suggested to increase levels of NO, although the physiological mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The interest in all these molecules has increased in many fields of research. In relation with exercise physiology, it has been suggested that an increase in NO production may enhance oxygen and nutrient delivery to active muscles, thus improving tolerance to physical exercise and recovery mechanisms. Several studies using NO donors have assessed this hypothesis in a healthy, trained population. However, the conclusions from these studies showed several discrepancies. While some reported that dietary supplementation with NO donors <b>induced</b> <b>benefits</b> in exercise performance, others did not find any positive effect. In this regard, training status of the subjects seems to be an important factor linked to the ergogenic effect of NO supplementation. Studies involving untrained or moderately trained healthy subjects showed that NO donors could improve tolerance to aerobic and anaerobic exercise. However, when highly trained subjects were supplemented, no positive effect on performance was indicated. In addition, all this evidence is mainly based on a young male population. Further research in elderly and female subjects is needed to determine whether NO supplements can induce benefit in exercise capacity when the NO metabolism is impaired by age and/or estrogen status...|$|E

The study employed ideas mainly from the Sustainable Livelihood Frameworkcomplemented with ideas from political ecology focusing on the concepts of power and culture. The study was analyzed based on ideas from this theories and concepts. Following the qualitativeresearch methodology, the study drew on interviews, focus group discussions as well asobservations to solicit the views of 34 primary informants (farmers) and 10 key informants onthe topic. The informants were selected from the two limestone mining communities ofOdugblase and Bueryonye (otherwise known as the twin villages due to their proximity). Thechoice of both communities was to enrich the data because farmers from both communities lostland to the same concession. The study revealed that limestone mining has adversely affected farmer’s assets. It alsorevealed that this was largely due {{to the role of the}} traditional council (chieftaincy institution) inthe mining process. Institutional factors such as power relations and the culture of obedience tochiefs constrained farmer’s access to mining <b>induced</b> <b>benefits</b> (assets). The traditional councildid not involve farmers in the decision making process and even when they do, their voices didnot count due to the hierarchical nature of decision making.

Copingstrategies employed by farmers were varied with the most vibrant one being livelihooddiversification. The study therefore concludes that, for mining to benefit host communities, attentionmust be given to the local chieftaincy institutional politics of power as the major determinant ofwho gets what, whose rationality counts as knowledge and whose interest prevails. Programsmust also be implemented to support livelihood diversification as a coping strategy as well asfarmers in rural communities must be empowered to demand their rights. </p...|$|E

PL has been found for a variety of visual tasks, this type of learning also requires synaptic plasticity. However, PL studies typically require a significant amount of training, and concentrate on isolating a single mechanism, leading to great specificity of learning on the trained task. This focus on this specificity has defined the field, but is not representative of ecological conditions. Combining many features is more representation of nature, and recent research suggests this type of training leads to more broad based perceptual benefits. This dissertation will investigate the links between the rules of plasticity at the cellular level and behavior in both a single mechanism, using exposure-based learning, and by combining several PL approaches into a video game framework. 	Using the single PL mechanism, exposure-based learning, does not significantly alter behavior on a contrast discrimination task after limited training. Using an integrative approach that combines many perceptual learning mechanisms, including attention, reinforcement, multisensory stimuli, and multi-stimulus dimensions, broad-based benefits of vision were found in a healthy adult population. These results were extended into a highly specialized population, college baseball players. The improvements transferred not only to laboratory tests of vision, but also to improved offensive performance on the baseball field. 	Overall, these results give evidence that rules of synaptic plasticity have efficacy when applied at the behavioral level using PL mechanisms. Work remains on establishing optimal training procedures and relating the training <b>induced</b> <b>benefits</b> to the underlying neural mechanisms. Integrating PL approaches that use longer training paradigms produce robust improvements to vision. These findings provide an exciting potential for PL based video-game training {{to be used as a}} diagnosis tool and therapeutic intervention to a variety of visual conditions...|$|E

The birth of Israel and its religion was unpretentious and not as unique as it may appear in the Biblical accounts.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of endothelial cells (ECs) {{has only}} recently been recognized as a driving force of angiogenesis. Metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and glutamine metabolism, have distinct, essential roles during vessel formation. Moreover, EC metabolism is markedly perturbed in pathologies such as cancer and diabetes. For instance, because tumor ECs increase glycolysis, lowering hyperglycolysis in tumor ECs <b>induces</b> therapeutic <b>benefits</b> in preclinical tumor models. Expanding our knowledge of how ECs alter their metabolism in disease could {{pave the way for}} novel therapeutic opportunities. In this review, we discuss the most recent insights into EC metabolism in health and disease, with emphasis on the changes in metabolism in the tumor endothelium. status: accepte...|$|R

By assigning all relevant sources of uncertainty for {{such kind of}} tax shields and by accounting for corporate debt it is shown that for APV valuations r*, a rate between the firm's cost of debt and the risk-free rate, is adequate to discount step-up <b>induced</b> depreciation <b>benefits.</b> When the benefits are valued on a standalone basis, the adequate discount rate is the after-tax weighted average of r*. Discount rates for these shields have been determined arbitrarily in empirical research on corporate acquisitions so far.
