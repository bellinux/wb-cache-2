THE RESEARCH WORK IS DEALING WITH VARIABLE SPEED WIND TURBINES MODELLING AND CONTROL DESIGN, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES OF MAXIMIZING THE EXTRACTED ENERGY FROM THE WIND, BELOW THE RATED POWER AREA IN THE ONE HAND AND IN THE OTHER HAND REGULATING THE ELECTRIC POWER PRODUCTION, ABOVE THE RATED POWER AREA, WHILE REDUCING MECHANICAL TRANSIENT LOADS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE HAVE STUDIED VARIOUS CONTROL STRATEGIES FROM LINEAR TO NONLINEAR BASED. SOME OF THE CONTROLLERS THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED, HEREIN APPEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE RELEVANT DOMAIN, THE REMAINING OTHERS ARE AN ADAPTATION OF WELL KNOW CONTROLLERS TO THE ADOPTED WIND TURBINE MODELS. AS MATTER OF FACT, WE HAVE DERIVED TWO WIND TURBINE MODELS AS WELL AS A WIND SPEED ESTIMATOR. INDEED, THE ESTIMATOR ALLOWS OBTAINING THE EFFECTIVE WIND SPEED WHICH CANNOT BE MEASURED, SINCE THE WIND PROFILE AROUND THE ROTOR IS VARIABLE IN TIME AND SPACE. AS RESULTS, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT SINGLE INPUT CONTROL BY MEANS OF PITCH ANGLE OR GENERATOR CONTROL CANNOT SUCCEED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY DRIVE THE ELECTRIC POWER OUTPUT REGULATION AND THE ROTOR SPEED REFERENCE TRACKING. SO THEN, OUR IDEA IS TO COMBINE NONLINEAR DYNAMIC STATE FEEDBACK TORQUE CONTROL AND PITCH LINEAR BASED CONTROL WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE THE BEST STRATEGY.

40|$|That Raymond Queneau {{has read}} {{quite a lot}} of René Guénon is an undeniable fact. But how to reveal the {{influence}} of René Guénon on Raymond Queneau in the literary creation of the latter remains since long time a puzzle. The present thesis aims at providing a possible answer to this question. We focus on a point common to the two writers : the spiritual centre. At first, we try to show what it means by the spiritual centre in René Guénon, particularly his idea of the identification between man and nature : the non-duality. From this non-duality are proceeded the three realms or the three gunas, wherein originates the chain of the worlds. This vision of the worlds gives birth to the idea of the universe in constant movement of spirality, which takes the form of the Axis of the World. it is, in its turn, expressed by other symbols such as the Tree of the World, the couple of yin and yang, hermaphrodite, etc [...] All these symbols, equivalent to the spiritual centre, find their elaboration in most of the novels of Raymond Queneau. In the meantime, we try to analyse the narrative circularity rendered in his novels, also based on the Axis of the World. So far as the analyse of the poems is concerned, we rely once again on the Axis of the World and its variations : the Universal Man, the Great Peace, the navigation, etc [...] Finally, we touch on the impregnation of the thought of René Guénon in the literary creation of Raymond Queneau in its general view : the metamorphosis, the narrative circularity, the dream, the Great Chain of Being (the Axis of the World) Que Raymond Queneau ait trop lu René Guénon est un fait incontesté. Mais comment relever l'influence de René Guénon sur Raymond Queneau dans la création littéraire de ce dernier. Cela reste depuis toujours un casse-tête. Le but de cette thèse est d'essayer de fournir une réponse possible à cette question. Nous localisons un lien qui existe entre les deux : le centre spirituel. Tout d'abord, nous montrons ce qu'est le centre spirituel chez René Guénon, et particulièrement son idée de l'identification de l'homme à la nature - la non-dualité. De cette non-dualité dérivent les trois règnes ou les trois gunas, d'où provient l'enchaînement des mondes. Cela donne naissance à un univers en circulation spirale, ce qui se traduit dans l'Axe du Monde, lequel, à son tour, se transforme en Arbre du monde, <b>en</b> <b>couple</b> du yin et du yang, en androgynie, en amour, etc [...] Tous les symboles équivalents au centre spirituel trouvent leurs élaboration dans de nombreux romans de Raymond Queneau. Nous essayons en même temps d'analyser la circularité narrative utilisée dans des romans de Raymond Queneau, en nous appuyant sur l'Axe du Monde, qui charpente la pensée guénonienne. En ce qui concerne l'analyse de la poésie de Raymond Queneau, nous nous basons aussi sur l'Axe du Monde et ses termes dérivées - l'Homme Universel, la Grande Paix, la navigation, etc [...] Enfin, nous essayons aussi d'aborder l'imprégnation de la pensée de René Guénon dans l'ensemble de la création littéraire de Raymond Queneau - la métamorphose, la circularité narrative, le rêve, la Grande Chaîne des êtres (l'Axe du Monde), etc [...] ...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Neonaticide is {{the term}} {{used to refer to}} the killing of newborn infants within the first 24 hours of life. A recent study {{conducted}} by Inserm Unit 750 found a frequency of 2. 1 cases of neonaticide for 100, 000 births in France. The persistence of these crimes raises serious issues, and scientists have attempted to explain this by the profile of neonaticidal mothers: young, or even teenage, single, primiparous, and socially deprived. The present study sought to question this profile, and to suggest a new profile for neonaticidal mothers. DATA AND METHODS: This retrospective study over the years 1996 - 2000 comprised 32 cases of neonaticide perpetrated in three French regions. Seventeen solved cases of these 32 cases generated 54 documents by expert consultants, mainly psychiatric and psychological expertise, studied and analysed here using Modalisa software for quantitative analyses and Nvivo software for qualitative data. RESULTS: No single socio-demographic profile was observed. The mothers were in contrasting situations {{at the time of the}} event. There were few psychotic profiles. The other psychopathological disturbances detected were very often related to the event. The most surprising feature in the expert reports describing the neonaticidal mothers was the existence of what we have termed "descriptive absent-factors". These mothers had not experienced major trauma in childhood such as the death of persons close or foster care. They were not living in an environment of family violence. They did not exhibit addictive or self-harm behaviour. Their parents before them had similar profiles, except three cases of alcoholism. Their parentage, and that of the infants, was not an issue. The most widely described personality features were immaturity, dependency on others, withdrawal, inhibition, emptiness, lack of affectivity, non-expressiveness, and devaluation of self-image. The very impoverished relational environment of these mothers also appears in the expertise data. Their affective and relational foundations were insecure. DISCUSSION: The "classic" profile of the neonaticidal mother as being young, single, and primiparous is not confirmed in this study. Recent American and European studies reach similar conclusions. More than half of these mothers already had other children; more than half were living with a partner. Nor did these mothers have an evident psychopathological profile, and even less so a psychopathic profile. This study suggests a "psycho-relational" profile for the neonaticidal mother: immature, affectively dependent, expressing herself very little, and experiencing considerable affective isolation. CONCLUSION: These neonaticidal mothers did not present any specific socio-demographic or evident psychopathological profile. The study nevertheless enabled definition of a "psycho-relational" profile. Notre étude explore 54 documents d'expertises relatifs à 17 affaires de néonaticides commis entre 1996 et 2000 dans trois régions françaises. Les néonaticides sont des meurtres d'enfants dans leurs premières vingt-quatre heures de vie, le plus souvent commis par les mères. Le profil " classique ", souvent issu de données anglo-saxonnes, de la mère néonaticide comme une jeune femme, célibataire, primipare, dépourvue de ressources éducationnelles et sociales est contesté par les résultats de notre étude à l'instar d'autres études plus récentes américaines et européennes. Il n'existe pas de profil socio-démographique unique des mères néonaticides. Ces mères sont de tous âges, plus de la moitié ont déjà des enfants, plus de la moitié vivent <b>en</b> <b>couple.</b> Ces mères ne présentent pas non plus de profil spécialement psychopathologique, et encore moins psychopathique, ces profils ne se retrouvant pas non plus à la génération précédente. Les mères néonaticides sont décrites comme immatures, dépendantes affectivement, s'exprimant peu, se dévalorisant, vivant dans des contextes relationnels médiocres aux moments des faits comme dans le passé, connaissant une grande solitude affective. Leur personnalité ne nous semble pas pouvoir être décrite isolément de leur environnement relationnel...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of direct}} {{distribution}} of agricultural products is, {{in most of}} the cases in France, initiated by producers. The few experiments led by groups of consummers were limited, until now, to organic products. The recent expansion of consummers networks (AMAP) based on the japanese experience of Teikei (Ikegami, 2005) brings out new explanations to the growing success of direct distribution. However, the farmer's motivation remains the starting point for these initiatives in Brittany. The focus {{of this paper is to}} describe these motivations considering the expectations of a growing part of the population. The analysis conducted by Matthieu Anasaloni (chapter 8) on the motivations propounded by consummers met in Guichen annual organic agriculture exhibition shows three main categories: country-style nostalgia, contemporary hedonism and (micro-) political involvements. The objective of this paper is to understand how producers try to answer these expectations through direct distribution. Thus, the producer's motivations can be understood as direct answers to these needs : 1. coming back to traditional agriculture, 2. catching market opportunities and 3. a political reaction to intensive production processes. Based on the answers of 38 producers in Brittany who use direct distribution, this paper proposes to confront these assumptions to the reality of the process that leads a growing number of farmers to choose this short and alternative relation with the public. We can first set aside the first assumption. Some traditional values of agriculture are not necessary incompatible with a modern production process: promoting quality can be achieved considering recent norms and the relationships can be convivial even over the neighbourhood. If nostalgia does exist in the mind of a category of consummers, we do not consider that producers who learnt their activity in a context of a centralized agriculture take that nostalgia into account in their approach. The second class of motivation seems to be more relevant in the light of the answers given for our survey. The search for added value is the main reason for farmers to adopt direct distribution. But this assertion must take the size of farms into account: small farms can use direct distribution to balance the lack of economies of scale and large ones use short tracks in response to cyclical or sectorial shocks. However the producer's wish to extract his activity from the standard production with that kind of differenciation does not seem so obvious. We can enlarge the possible opportunities given by direct distribution by considering the adaptation of the activity to the familial structure and the search for contact as the will to give value to a special skill. Once more, these opportunities can not explain by themselves the pace of the producers. Most of the producers live in couple, but the fact to be in couple is not significantly determinant in the choice. A skill given by an past experience requiring contact with a public can be a source of motivation, but we observe that this category of producer is not more likely to invest itself in selling tasks. The farmers's wish to be in contact with the consummers and with the public finds its source in a need for recognition of agriculture as a whole and not only for differenciation on the part of one single farm. Most of these opportunities are taken into account by producers in accordance with each attribute. But {{in most of the}} cases, the economics and rational explanations show their limits. Thus, it seems also necessary to consider direct distribution as a critical reaction to the socio- economic context and as an evolution of agricultural practices. A global view of the deep motivations of the producers we met shows a divide between trying to improve the image of agriculture and searching for an alternative of the productivist agriculture. If the first class tend toward a perspective of sustained development – an attitude that can take a concrete form in the landscape practices or in the contractaul engagements (CTE, CAD) - the other one comprehend direct distribution as a break with the existing model. But all of the producers consider direct distribution as a gain of autonomy. This autonomy has a important cost in time, work and avalaibility. This important cost confirms the need for farmers to believe more in their own convictions than in an invividual rationality. La vente directe de produits agricoles est en France, dans la plupart des cas, l'initiative de producteurs. Le développement récent des AMAP montre que cela peut évoluer. Dans ce contexte il est important de comprendre les motivations des agriculteurs engagés dans la vente directe, d'autant plus que cette motivation individuelle est à l'origine de la plupart des initiatives en Bretagne. L'analyse des motivations des consommateurs peut s'organiser autour de la nostalgie rurale, de l'hédonisme contemporain et de micro-engagements politiques. Nous proposons en parallèle d'examiner en quoi les vendeurs directs cherchent à revenir à une certaine tradition paysanne, cherchent à profiter d'opportunités de marché ou bien construisent une réaction de nature politique au paradigme productiviste. Une enquête auprès de 38 vendeurs directs de Haute-Bretagne permet d'éliminer la première hypothèse : pas l'ombre d'une nostalgie dans les réponses. Par contre la recherche de valeur ajoutée semble la raison principale et largement partagée. Pour les petites fermes c'est un complément d'activité, pour les plus grosses c'est une diversification pour contrer les risques de marché. Autre opportunité, la vente directe valorise le travail familial, et particulièrement le travail des femmes. Néanmoins, si presque tous les vendeurs directs travaillent <b>en</b> <b>couple,</b> cela n'est pas le facteur décisif du choix. L'expérience passée d'un contact avec le public semble plus déterminante. Les motivations économiques ne suffisent pas à décrire les choix. Une analyse approfondie des motivations des agriculteurs rencontrés les divise entre ceux qui cherchent à améliorer l'image de l'agriculture (aux yeux du public mais aussi à leurs propres yeux) et ceux qui cherchent à construire une alternative au productivisme. L'ensemble cherche une meilleure autonomie, les premiers au sein du marché, les second en tentant de sortir des cadres de référence établis. Cette autonomie coûte cher en investissement et surtout en temps de travail, coût que tous assument, préférant suivre la logique de leurs convictions qu'une prétendue rationalité individuelle...|$|E

Nearly 80 samples were evaluated by sensory analysis ITERG’s panel according to CEE 2568 / 91 method, and analyzed with FOX 3000 Alpha MOS electronic nose. These samples were also analyzed by GC and GC/MS {{in order to identify}} and quantify components of the headspace. With the EN used, it was impossible to get discrimination between samples of the four different grades : “extra virgin”, “virgin”, “ordinary” and “lampante”. Moreover, when diluting “lampante” samples in two different “extra” virgin olive oils, sensors were more sensitive to {{the differences between the two}} “extra” oils than those between sensory defects. To understand EN results, partition coefficients in olive oil/air at 50 °C were evaluated. Static headspace is rich in alcohols (methanol, ethanol), poor in aroma components such as t- 2 -hexenal, hexanal, 3 -methyl-butanol or 1 -octen- 3 -ol. These results explain why chromatograms of “extra” and “lampante” oils are scarcely different.

In recent years, the application of silanes in aluminium bonding process has been extensively investigated. Silane surface treatment is a more environment-friendly alternative than other treatments, which use toxic chemicals (hexavalent chromium compounds, strong acids, etc.), such as FPL (Forest Products Laboratory) etch, CAA (chromic acid anodisation) or PAA (phosphoric acid anodisation). The aim of this work was to optimize the ?-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane application process to obtain the best durability in toughened acrylic bonded aluminium joints. Variables such as pH, concentration of silane in aqueous solution, drying temperature and pretreatment prior to silanisation have been investigated. The durability was tested using single-lap shear specimens and wedge tests. Specimens were exposed to 95 % RH at 50 °C, for 90 days. Silanisation parameters such as solution concentration and drying temperature showed a great influence on the durability; however pH had only a little influence.

40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} an electronic nose (EN) containing 13 conducting polymer gas sensors to discriminate between patterns of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants. The VOC patterns examined were produced by tomato, cucumber and pepper plants under both healthy and infected or infested conditions. Leaves from the plants were subjected to mechanical damage or pest and disease attacks (i. e. spider mites infested or mildew infected) and others were judged against undamaged healthy leaves. Support vector machines (SVMs) with linear, polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels were used to process and classify the raw data collected. The SVM illustrated an ability to discriminate between different VOC patterns and hence was able to classify correctly the infected leaves using the EN data. The results indicate that the array of 13 EN gas sensors can discriminate among VOC patterns from undamaged and artificially damaged leaves of the three plant species.

Experiments were conducted in monolayers of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes using heptanol and isoproterenol as means of altering cell-to-cell coupling and automaticity, respectively. Ex-perimental findings were explained and expanded using a modified Beeler-Reuter numerical model. The data suggest that the combination of a heterogeneous substrate, a gradient of coupling, and an increase in oscillatory activity of individual cells creates a rich set of behaviors associatedwith self-generated spiral waves andectopic sources. Spiral waves feature a flattened shapeanda pin-unpin drift type of tip motion. These intercellular waves are action-potential based and can be visualized with either voltage or calcium transientmeasurements. A source/loadmismatch on the interface between the boundary andwell-coupled layers can lock wavefronts emanating from both ectopic sources and rotating waves within the inner layers of the coupling gradient.

Experimental findings were explained and expanded using a modified Beeler-Reuter numerical model. The data suggest that the combination of a heterogeneous substrate, a gradient of coupling, and an increase in oscillatory activity of individual cells creates a rich set of behaviors associated with self-generated spiral waves and ectopic sources.

5000|$|By the 1970s, {{feminine}} traces in some {{versions of}} the name and more often in the epithets led to various theories. Among them, that Nefertiti was masquerading as Smenkhkare before changing her name again to Neferneferuaten. When considered with various stela depicting Akhenaten with another king in familiar, if not intimate poses, the theory that Akhenaten and Smenkhkare were homosexual arose. In 1978, it was proposed that there were 2 individuals using the same name: a male king Smenkhkare and a female Neferneferuaten. Ten years later, James Allen pointed out the name 'Ankhkheperure' nearly always included an epithet referring to Akhenaten such as 'desired of Wa <b>en</b> Re' when <b>coupled</b> with 'Neferneferuaten'. There were no occasions where the ‘long’ {{versions of the}} prenomen occurred alongside the nomen 'Smenkhkare', nor was the ‘short’ version ever found associated with the nomen 'Neferneferuaten'. The issue of a female Neferneferuaten was finally settled for the remaining holdouts when James Allen confirmed Marc Gabolde's findings that objects from Tutankhamun's tomb originally inscribed for Neferneferuaten which had been read using the epithet [...] "...desired of Akhenaten" [...] were originally inscribed as Akhet-en-hyes or [...] "effective for her husband". Smenkhkare, as son in law, might be 'desired of Akhenaten', but only a female could fit the new reading. [...] By {{the start of the}} 21st Century, [...] "a fair degree of consensus" [...] emerged that Neferneferuaten was a female king and Smenkhkare a separate male king, particularly among specialists of the period (the public and the internet still often commingle the two unwittingly and otherwise). Almost as important, when presented with just the name Ankhkheperure, it is now widely accepted that the use of epithets indicates Neferneferuaten while no epithets indicates Smenkhkare.|$|R
40|$|The wear {{rates of}} sliding {{surfaces}} are significantly reduced if mild oxidational wear can be encouraged. It is hence of prime {{importance in the}} interest of component life and material conservation to understand the factors necessary to promote mild, oxidational wear, The present work investigates the fundamental mechanism of the running-in wear of BS EN 31 !<b>EN</b> 8 steel <b>couples.</b> under various conditions of load. speed and test duration. Unidirectional sliding experiments were carried out on a pin-on~disc wear machine where frictional force, wear rate, temperature and contact resistance were continuously monitored during each test. Physical methods of analysis (x-ray, scanning electron microscopy etc.) were used to examine the wear debris and worn samples. The wear rate versus load curves revealed mild wear transitions, which under long duration of running, categorized mild wear into four distinct regions. α-Fe 20 s. Fe 304, FeO and an oxide mixture were the predominant oxides in four regions of oxidational wear which were identified above the Welsh T 2 transition. The wear curves were strongly effected by the speed and test duration. A surface model was used to calculate the surface parameters, and the results were found to be comparable with the experimentally observed parameters. Oxidation was responsible for the transition from severe to mild wear at a load corresponding to the Welsh T 2 transition. In the running-in period sufficient energy input and surface hardness enabled oxide growth rate to increase and eventually exceeded the rate of removal, where mild wear ensued. A model was developed to predict the wear volume up to the transition. Remarkable agreement was found between the theoretical prediction and the experimentally-measured values. The oxidational mechanjsm responsible for transitjon to mild wear under equilibrium conditions was related to the formation of thick homogenous oxide plateaux on subsurface hardened layers, FeO was the oxide formed initially at the onset of mild wear but oxide type changed. during the total running period to give an equilibrium oxide whose nature depended on the loads applied...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} a physico-chemical {{analysis}} of five different types of bitumens, {{both before and after}} aging. These bitumen samples were chosen based on : the original crude oil (straight-run bitumens with different asphaltene and crystallized fraction contents), mode of refining (straight-run vs. halfblown bitumen), and modifier characteristics (straight-run vs. polyphosphoric acid (PPA) -modified bitumen). The aim {{of this study is to}} determine both the aging effect on chemical species and the chemical organization as a function of the type of bitumen sample. In order to obtain information on bitumen chemistry, n-heptane precipitation (Standard NF <b>EN</b> 12591),IATROSCAN chromatography (<b>coupling</b> between a thin-layer liquid chromatography on a silica gel and a flame ionization detector), FTIR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) have all been used. Size exclusion chromatography under high-speed conditions (HS-SEC), which yields information relative to asphaltene associations, was also introduced. Several years of road aging were simulated through 25 h of a pressure aging vessel (PAV) test. The coupling of IATROSCAN chromatography and n-heptane precipitation made it possible to identify and quantify polar resins. In accordance with previous studies, the use of HS-SEC combined with IATROSCAN chromatography indicates that a modification by PPA leads to an increase in asphaltene content and a more dispersed asphaltene structure than that found in pure bitumen. This same conclusion can be drawn from observations of the half-blown bitumen sample. The half-blown bitumen actually contains less asphaltene than one of the straight-run bitumens in the study; furthermore, its asphaltenes are more highly agglomerated. These results demonstrate that asphaltene association does not systematically depend on quantity alone, as its chemical type also enters into play. Moreover, during aging, even though asphaltene content is increasing for all bitumen samples, its agglomeration is still highly dependent on the type of bitumen. It would therefore appear that the presence of crystallized fractions exerts a major influence on this process...|$|R
40|$|Sulphide stress {{corrosion}} cracking, (SSCC) {{is one of}} the major problems encountered by the petroleum industry throughout the world. The problem is likely to increase in severity for the North Sea oil and gas industries as the fields get older and platforms are moved to deeper waters. This is because the hydrogen sulphide concentration increases as the fields get older and deeper water explorations require higher strength steels. The protective measures taken at present to combat SSCC are not adequate. Therefore a novel method was developed to inhibit SSCC in steel. This method is based on using an active hydrogen evolution sulphide electro-catalyst, more active than steel, as a coat on the surface of the steel, such that the hydrogen evolution will take place on the catalyst surface, instead of on the corroding steel surface. Therefore, the amount of hydrogen diffusing through the steel is greatly reduced. Hence, SSCC in the steel is effectively inhibited. Electrochemical and mechanical experimental studies were carried out to confirm the validity of this method A computer-aided literature survey on SSCC and its prevention in oil- and gas-well equipment is presented. The viability of three sulphide electro-catalysts, NiCo₂S₄, MoS₂ and WS₂ for this method were studied in various experiments, namely, electrochemical polarization, hydrogen diffusion studies and corrosion weight loss measurements. The experimental studies carried out in NACE solution, consisting of a 5 percent (mass/volume) NaCl and 0. 5 percent (volume/volume) acetic acid, with a continuous flow of H₂S at 1 atmospheric pressure, indicated that hydrogen evolution performances are in the following order: in the absence of H₂S, NiCo₂, S₄ > WS₂, > MoS₂> EN 42 steel in the presence of H₂S, MoS₂> WS₂> NiCo₂S₄> EN 42 steel MoS₂was found to be the most stable catalyst in the sour corrosive environment. Evans diagrams, constructed to predict corrosion rates, indicate that the corrosion current ratio of the MoS₂ - <b>EN</b> 42 steel <b>couple</b> and <b>EN</b> 42 steel did not change significantly when the catalyst loading was reduced. The hydrogen diffusion studies confirmed that an MoS₂/ FEP (fluoro ethylene polymer) adherent coat with higher catalyst to FEP ratio was the most effective of three adherent coats. The corrosion weight loss measurements showed that the corrosion rates of steel coupons partially coated with MoS₂/ FEP coat were higher than those of uncoated coupons for up to 50 hours but thereafter they reduced significantly below those of uncoated coupons. Mechanical studies carried out to eväluate the effectiveness of this method were helped by a literature survey on {{stress corrosion}} test methods and interpretation of results. Slower straining/loading rate tests and sustained load tests were selected to study the changes in various mechanical parameters on different types of specimens when protected with MoS₂ / FEP coat. In addition to these tests, Charpy impact tests were also carried out. The mechanical parameters measured on the specimens are: a) for compact tension specimens - stress intensity factor at failure - total energy required for fracturing the specimen - average energy consumed for unit length of crack extension - crack opening displacement - crack growth rate - time to failure b) for three-point bend specimens - crack opening displacement c) for Charpy V-notch impact test specimens - fracture energy All these mechanical parameters confirm the effectiveness of the MoS₂ / FEP coat to inhibit SSCC in steel. Scanning electron microscopic examinations of the specimens also confirmed the viability of the novel protective method. The sour-corrosion fatigue tests showed that the MoS₂ / FEP coat could be used effectively in environments where a cyclic loading pattern is inevitable. These studies confirm that the proposed protective technique could be used effectively in the oil and gas industries to inhibit SSCC...|$|R
