40|$|Objective: To {{introduce}} the clinical effect among {{patients who received}} an unwrapped orbital implant with <b>high</b> <b>density</b> porous <b>polyethylene</b> material (Medpor) after enucleation or evisceration. Methods: Retrospective analysis {{of a series of}} 302 patients with anophthalmia who underwent placement of an unwrapped <b>high</b> <b>density</b> porous <b>polyethylene</b> orbital implant. We compared the patients (n= 180) who accepted primary implant placement with those (n= 122) who accepted secondary implant placement. Parameters evaluated included: age at time of surgery, date of surgery, sex, implant type and size, surgery type, the surgical procedure and technique performed, and complications. Results: The time of follow-up ranged from 2. 0 to 58. 0 months (mean 32. 5 months). A total of 5 of 302 (1. 66 %) cases had documented postoperative complications. The following problems were noted after surgery: implant exposure, 3 patients (0. 99 %); implant removed due to orbital infection, 1 patient (0. 34 %); ptosis, 1 patient (0. 34 %). There were no significant complications observed in other 297 cases and all implants showed good orbital motility. The clinical effect of primary implant placement is better than that of secondary placement.

The WAXS results show that crystalline orientation is also related uniquely to the applied strain and moreover is independent of the characteristics of the polymer concerned.

40|$|In this paper, the {{predictions}} of the Pompom constitutive model in medium and large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) are examined using Fourier transform rheology (FTR). FTR is commonly used in combination with small amplitude oscillatory shear to fit linear Maxwell parameters to dynamic moduli, and in this paper, this process is expanded to larger strain amplitudes and to further terms in the Fourier series. For both small and large amplitudes, these higher harmonics are dependent on the nonlinear Pompom parameters and the Pompom parameter space is explored to see how experimental oscillatory shear data can infer molecular detail. In the regime of small and medium strain amplitude, there exists an asymptotic solution to the Pompom equations which depends only on {{the ratio of the}} orientation and stretch relaxation times, τb and τs. This asymptotic solution is found to be accurate up to strains of order unity and the branching priority, q, only affects the stress response at larger strains. The Pompom parameters fitted to extensional data are compared to LAOS data for three materials; two lightly branched metallocene catalyzed <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> and a densely branched low <b>density</b> <b>polyethylenes.</b> In general, the Pompom model performs well in LAOS but tends to over predict experimental results at high strain amplitudes...|$|R

40|$|A new {{experimental}} and numerical method {{has been developed}} to characterize the terminal flow behavior of polydisperse, commercial grade polymer melts over a wide dynamic range of time/frequency scales. Experimentally, an MVM rheometer specifically designed for long time scale (t ∼ 10 4 s) creep measurements is {{used to measure the}} creep compliance of three commercial polymers: two <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> and one polystyrene. The long time scale MVM creep data are complemented in the short time scale regime by creep data from an industrial plate-plate rheometer. The time-dependent creep data is combined and converted to a discrete retardation spectra using a nonlinear regularization algorithm to address the ill-posed nature of the interconversion. The retardation spectrum is analytically converted to dynamic moduli and compared with independently measured dynamic moduli. In the overlapping frequency region, calculations and measurements show excellent agreement and the combined data span a much larger dynamic range than either independent data set. The calculated and measured dynamic moduli data are combined and a retardation spectrum with a vastly expanded dynamic range is generated. Combining long time scale MVM creep compliance data and dynamic moduli data exploits the intrinsic sensitivities of controlled strain and controlled stress rheological experiments and is a powerful means to greatly expand the experimentally accessible dynamic range of time/frequency. This approach is particularly useful for commercial polymers with broad molecular weight distributions and commensurately large distributions of relaxation times...|$|R
