5|$|Jevons {{warned that}} fuel <b>efficiency</b> gains tend to {{increase}} fuel use. But {{this does not}} imply that improved fuel <b>efficiency</b> is worthless: higher fuel <b>efficiency</b> enables greater production and a higher material quality of life. For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the Industrial Revolution. However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel <b>efficiency,</b> by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Considerable debate exists {{about the}} size of the rebound in energy <b>efficiency</b> and the {{relevance}} of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy <b>efficiency.</b> Environmental economists have proposed that <b>efficiency</b> gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|Copper's {{superior}} conductivity {{enhances the}} <b>efficiency</b> of electrical motors. This {{is important because}} motors and motor-driven systems account for 43%–46% of all global electricity consumption and 69% of all electricity used by industry. Increasing the mass and cross section of copper in a coil increases the <b>efficiency</b> of the motor. Copper motor rotors, a new technology designed for motor applications where energy savings are prime design objectives, are enabling general-purpose induction motors to meet and exceed National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) premium <b>efficiency</b> standards.|$|E

40|$|China’s recent {{remarkable}} {{economic development}} has also witnessed changes in technique <b>efficiencies</b> associated with factors, such as R&D investment, institutional factors, human capital accumulation and trade openness. Based on stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) panel data, this paper evaluates these changing technique <b>efficiencies</b> in 30 Chinese administrative regions {{over the period}} from 1996 to 2009. It also conducts a quantitative evaluation of the influence administrative expenditures have on technique <b>efficiencies</b> and analyses the impacts of financial crises on the technique <b>efficiencies</b> of the Chinese provinces. The {{results from this study}} show that China’s economy is typically investment-driven and is at a stage of increasing scale of development when governmental expenditures on education, health, public goods and R&D can improve the provincial technique <b>efficiencies.</b> This study also points out serious imbalance in China’s technique <b>efficiencies</b> with those in the eastern regions being much higher than for the central and western regions. Furthermore financial crises have impacts on the technique <b>efficiencies,</b> including the shockwaves sent by the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The technique <b>efficiencies</b> have been further influenced significantly by the recent global financial crisis whose impact has been felt {{over a longer period of}} time. Optimising the structure of the government expenditure, improving its <b>efficiencies</b> and facilitating the development of the central and western regions are major tasks for increasing the provincial technique <b>efficiencies</b> in China...|$|R

5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel <b>efficiency</b> (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel <b>efficiency</b> usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased <b>efficiency</b> does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved <b>efficiency.</b> For example, increased fuel <b>efficiency</b> may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased <b>efficiency</b> is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E

5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of {{the relevance of the}} Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve <b>efficiency,</b> holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that <b>efficiency</b> gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, <b>efficiency</b> gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E

25|$|The {{energy of}} the gamma rays being {{detected}} {{is an important factor}} in the <b>efficiency</b> of the detector. An <b>efficiency</b> curve can be obtained by plotting the <b>efficiency</b> at various energies. This curve can then be used to determine the <b>efficiency</b> of the detector at energies different from those used to obtain the curve. High-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors typically have higher sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|The {{isothermal}} <b>efficiency</b> (Z) is {{a measure}} of where the process lies between an adiabatic and isothermal process. If the <b>efficiency</b> is 0%, then it is totally adiabatic; with an <b>efficiency</b> of 100%, it is totally isothermal. Typically with a near isothermal process an <b>efficiency</b> of 90-95% can be expected.|$|E
25|$|<b>Efficiency,</b> like resolution, can be {{expressed}} in absolute or relative terms. The same units are used (i.e., percentages); therefore, the spectroscopist must take care to determine which kind of <b>efficiency</b> is being given for the detector. Absolute <b>efficiency</b> values represent {{the probability that a}} gamma ray of a specified energy passing through the detector will interact and be detected. Relative <b>efficiency</b> values are often used for germanium detectors, and compare the <b>efficiency</b> of the detector at 1332keV to that of a 3in×3in NaI detector (i.e., 1.2×10 −3cps/Bq at 25cm). Relative <b>efficiency</b> values greater than one hundred percent can therefore be encountered when working with very large germanium detectors.|$|E
