40|$|Buildings {{located near}} {{airports}} may {{be subjected to}} significant noise levels due to aircraft <b>flyovers.</b> Aircraft <b>noise</b> is particularly annoying {{when compared to other}} traffic noises due to its intermittent nature. While noise control is typically performed at the source, sound insulation programs are in place to improve the acoustic performance of a residence affected by the <b>flyovers.</b> <b>Noise</b> Level Reduction (NLR) is a common metric used in the United States to determine whether a residence qualifies for such programs. Sound insulation programs are available to houses that have an indoor Day Night Average Sound Level (DNL) greater than 45 dBA. NLR is a single-number metric used to quantify the ability for a building or building element to reduce the transmission of external sound pressure levels generated by aircraft. In addition to determining whether a residence qualifies, NLR can be used to quantify the effectiveness of the modifications performed {{as a result of the}} sound insulation program. NLR measurements with a loudspeaker offer an alternative method to those performed with aircraft flyovers, offering flexibility to the consultants that perform these measurements in the field. The purpose of this research was to better understand and improve the loudspeaker test for measuring NLR, providing a resource to the aircraft noise industry. Testing was completed on a "test house" that was constructed on campus with construction methods typical of a mixed-humid climate. The angular dependency, repeatability, and reproducibility of NLR, among other factors, were evaluated with field measurements. Significant NLR variations were observed with changes in lateral and vertical angles of incidence. M. S...|$|R

40|$|Methods {{for testing}} human subject {{response}} to aircraft <b>flyover</b> <b>noise</b> have greatly advanced {{in recent years}} as a result of advances in simulation technology. Capabilities have been developed which now allow subjects to be immersed both visually and aurally in a three-dimensional, virtual environment. While suitable for displaying recorded aircraft noise, the true potential is found when synthesizing aircraft <b>flyover</b> <b>noise</b> because it allows the flexibility and freedom to study sounds from aircraft not yet flown. A virtual acoustic simulation method is described which is built upon prediction-based source noise synthesis, engineering-based propagation modeling, and empirically-based receiver modeling. This source-path-receiver paradigm allows complete control over all aspects of flyover auralization. With this capability, it is now possible to assess human response to <b>flyover</b> <b>noise</b> by systematically evaluating source noise reductions {{within the context of a}} system level simulation.

40|$|The {{effects on}} {{acoustic}} characteristics of nozzle type and location on a wing for STOL engine over-the-wing configurations are assessed at full scale {{on the basis}} of model-scale data. Three types of nozzle configurations are evaluated: a circular nozzle with external deflector mounted above the wing, a slot nozzle with external deflector mounted on the wing and a slot nozzle mounted on the wing. Nozzle exhaust plane locations with respect to the wing leading edge are varied from 10 to 46 percent chord (flaps retracted) with flap angles of 20 (takeoff altitude) and 60 (approach attitude). Perceived noise levels (PNL) are calculated as a function of flyover distance at 152 m altitude. From these plots, static EPNL values, defined as <b>flyover</b> relative <b>noise</b> levels, are calculated and plotted as a function of lift and thrust ratios.

40|$|A model {{high-speed}} fan {{stage was}} acoustically {{tested in the}} NASA Glenn 9 - by 15 -Foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel at takeoff/approach flight conditions. The fan was designed for a corrected rotor tip speed of 442 m/s (1450 ft/s), and had a powered core, or booster stage, giving the model a nominal bypass ratio of 5. The model also had a simulated engine pylon and nozzle bifurcation contained within the bypass duct. The fan was tested with three stator sets to evaluate acoustic benefits associated with a swept and leaned stator and with a swept integral vane/frame stator which incorporated some of the swept and leaned features as well as eliminated some of the downstream support structure. The baseline fan with the wide chord rotor and baseline stator approximated a current GEAE CF 6 engine. A <b>flyover</b> effective perceived <b>noise</b> level (EPNL) code was used to generate relative EPNL values for the various configurations. <b>Flyover</b> effective perceived <b>noise</b> levels (EPNL) were computed from the model data to help project noise benefits. A tone removal study was also performed. The swept and leaned stator showed a 3 EPNdB reduction at lower fan speeds relative to the baseline stator; while the swept integral vane/frame stator showed lowest noise levels at intermediate fan speeds. Removal of the bypass blade passage frequency rotor tone (BPF) showed a 4 EPNdB reduction for the baseline and swept and leaned stators, and a 6 EPNdB reduction for the swept integral vane/ frame stator. Therefore, selective tone removal techniques such as active noise control and/or tuned liner could be particularly effective in reducing noise levels for certain fan speeds...|$|R

However, a correction factor is required for predicting from physical measures the subjective noisiness of sonic booms when compared to nonimpulsive subsonic aircraft <b>flyover</b> <b>noise</b> measured in the same physical units.

This presentation utilizes data obtained from these flyovers to evaluate predictions of broadband shock noise from supersonic jets in flight.

40|$|With {{continued}} growth in air travel, sensitivity to community noise intensifies and materializes {{in the form}} of increased monitoring, regulations, and restrictions. Accordingly, realization of quieter aircraft is imperative, albeit only achievable with reduction of both engine and airframe components of total aircraft noise. Model-scale airframe noise testing has aided in this pursuit; however, the results are somewhat limited due to lack of fidelity of model hardware, particularly in simulating full-scale landing gear. Moreover, simulation of true in-flight conditions is non-trivial if not infeasible. This paper reports on an investigation of full-scale landing gear noise measured as part of the 2005 Quiet Technology Demonstrator 2 (QTD 2) flight test program. Conventional Boeing 777 - 300 ER main landing gear were tested, along with two noise reduction concepts, namely a toboggan fairing and gear alignment with the local flow, both of which were down-selected from various other noise reduction devices evaluated in model-scale testing at Virginia Tech. The full-scale toboggan fairings were designed by Goodrich Aerostructures as add-on devices allowing for complete retraction of the main gear. The baseline-conventional gear, faired gear, and aligned gear were all evaluated with the high-lift system in the retracted position and deployed at various flap settings, all at engine idle power setting. Measurements were taken with <b>flyover</b> community <b>noise</b> microphones and a large aperture acoustic phased array, yielding far-field spectra, and localized sources (beamform maps). The results were utilized to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively the merit of each noise reduction concept. Complete similarity between model-scale and full-scale noise reduction levels was not found and requires further investigation. Far-field spectra exhibited no noise reduction for both concepts across all angles and frequencies. Phased array beamform maps show inconclusive evidence of noise reduction at selective frequencies (1500 to 3000 Hz) but are otherwise in general agreement with the far-field spectra results (within measurement uncertainty) ...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{community}} noise {{is a significant}} concern due to continued growth in air traffic, increasingly stringent environmental goals, and operational limitations imposed by airport authorities. The assessment of human response to noise from future aircraft can only be afforded through laboratory testing using simulated <b>flyover</b> <b>noise.</b> Recent work by the authors demonstrated the ability to auralize predicted <b>flyover</b> <b>noise</b> for a state-of-the-art reference aircraft and a future hybrid wing body aircraft concept. This auralization used source noise predictions from NASA's Aircraft NOise Prediction Program (ANOPP) as input. The results from this process demonstrated that auralization based upon system noise predictions is consistent with, and complementary to, system noise predictions alone. To further develop and validate the auralization process, improvements to the interfaces between the synthesis capability and the system noise tools are required. This paper describes the key elements required for accurate noise synthesis and introduces auralization architectures for use with the next-generation ANOPP (ANOPP 2). The architectures are built around a new auralization library and its associated Application Programming Interface (API) that utilize ANOPP 2 APIs to access data required for auralization. The architectures are designed to make the process of auralizing <b>flyover</b> <b>noise</b> a common element of system noise prediction...|$|E

Other tests were also performed in which people read out loud during aircraft <b>flyover</b> <b>noise.</b> Results of these tests indicate that people do indeed raise their voice during flyovers at a rate of about 3 - 1 / 2 dB for each 10 dB increase in background level. This finding is in agreement with other tests of speech levels in the presence of steady state background noise...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} experiment {{was conducted to}} quantify the annoyance to advanced turboprop (propfan) aircraft <b>flyover</b> <b>noise.</b> A computer synthesis system was used to generate 45 realistic, time varying simulations of propeller aircraft <b>flyover</b> <b>noise</b> in which the tonal content was systematically varied to represent the factorial combinations of five fundamental frequencies, three frequency envelope shapes, and three tone-to-broadband noise ratios. In the experiment, 64 subjects judged the annoyance of recordings of the 45 synthesized flyover noises presented at three sound levels in a test facility which simulates the outdoor acoustic environment. Analyses of the judgements showed that frequency envelope shape did not significantly affect annoyance. The interaction of fundamental frequency with tone-to-broadband noise ratio did have a large and complex effect on annoyance. Duration corrected A-weighted sound pressure level with a modified tone correction predicted annoyance {{better than any other}} measurement procedure...|$|E
40|$|Additional noise {{sources are}} {{generated}} when an aircraft engine is mounted beneath a wing. The two main installation sources include: (1) {{reflection of the}} exhaust jet mixing noise from {{the underside of the}} wing, and (2) interaction between the turbulent jet plume and the trailing edge of the wing, or deployed flap. The strength, directivity and frequency content of these particular sources all serve to increase the time-averaged <b>flyover</b> aircraft <b>noise</b> level heard on the ground by residents beneath the flight path. As the bypass ratio and nacelle diameter of modern turbofan engines continues to increase, constraints on ground clearance are forcing under-wing-mounted engines to be coupled more closely to the wing and flap system, which, in turn, serves to accentuate both of these noise sources. Close-coupled nacelle-airframe designs are now a critical issue surrounding efforts to meet the future environmental targets for quieter civil aircraft. This research is principally aimed at understanding and predicting the groundpropagating noise generated by the latter of these two installed jet noise sources. In order to characterise the jet-surface interaction noise source, however, it is first necessary to isolate it. A small 1 / 50 th model-scale acoustic experiment, therefore, is conducted in a semi-anechoic university laboratory using a single stream jet installed beneath a flat plate. Both far-field acoustic and near-field plate surface pressure data are measured to investigate the jet-surface interaction noise source. Results from this fundamental experiment are then used to help drive a larger, and more realistic, 1 / 10 th modelscale test campaign, at QinetiQ's Noise Test Facility, where 3 D wing geometry effects, Reynolds number scaling effects and static-to-flight effects are investigated. A jet-flap impingement tonal noise phenomenon is also identified and investigated at particularly closely-coupled jet-wing configurations. Finally, the first version of a fast, semi-empirical engineering tool is developed to predict the additional noise caused by jet-wing interaction noise, under static ambient flow conditions. It is hoped that this tool will serve to inform future commercial aircraft design decisions and, thus, will help to protect the acoustic environment of residents living beneath flight paths...|$|R
40|$|A new aeroacoustic {{measurement}} capability {{has been}} developed consisting of a large channelcount, field-deployable microphone phased array suitable for airframe <b>noise</b> <b>flyover</b> measurements {{for a range of}} aircraft types and scales. The array incorporates up to 185 hardened, weather-resistant sensors suitable for outdoor use. A custom 4 -mA current loop receiver circuit with temperature compensation was developed to power the sensors over extended cable lengths with minimal degradation of the signal to noise ratio and frequency response. Extensive laboratory calibrations and environmental testing of the sensors were conducted to verify the design's performance specifications. A compact data system combining sensor power, signal conditioning, and digitization was assembled for use with the array. Complementing the data system is a robust analysis system capable of near real-time presentation of beamformed and deconvolved contour plots and integrated spectra obtained from array data acquired during flyover passes. Additional instrumentation systems needed to process the array data were also assembled. These include a commercial weather station and a video monitoring / recording system. A detailed mock-up of the instrumentation suite (phased array, weather station, and data processor) was performed in the NASA Langley Acoustic Development Laboratory to vet the system performance. The first deployment of the system occurred at Finnegan Airfield at Fort A. P. Hill where the array was utilized to measure the vehicle noise from a number of sUAS (small Unmanned Aerial System) aircraft. A unique in-situ calibration method for the array microphones using a hovering aerial sound source was attempted for the first time during the deployment...|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{characteristics of}} a model high-speed fan stage were measured in the NASA Glenn 9 - by 15 -Foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel at takeoff and approach flight conditions. The fan was designed for a corrected rotor tip speed of 442 m/s (1450 ft/s), and had a powered core, or booster stage, giving the model a nominal bypass ratio of 5. A simulated engine pylon and nozzle bifurcation was contained within the bypass duct. The fan stage consisted of all combinations of 3 possible rotors, and 3 stator vane sets. The 3 rotors were (1) wide chord, (2) forward swept, and (3) shrouded. The 3 stator sets were (1) baseline, moderately swept, (2) swept and leaned, and (3) swept integral vane/frame which incorporated some of the swept and leaned features as well as eliminated the downstream support structure. The baseline configuration {{is considered to be}} the wide chord rotor with the radial vane stator. A <b>flyover</b> Effective Perceived <b>Noise</b> Level (EPNL) code was used to generate relative EPNL values for the various configurations. The swept and leaned stator showed a 3 EPNdB reduction at lower fan speeds relative to the baseline stator; while the swept integral vane/frame stator showed lowest noise levels at high fan speeds. The baseline, wide chord rotor was typically the quietest of the three rotors. A tone removal study was performed to assess the acoustic benefits of removing the fundamental rotor interaction tone and its harmonics. Reprocessing the acoustic results with the bypass tone removed had the most impact on reducing fan noise at transonic rotor speeds. Removal of the bypass rotor interaction tones (BPF and nBPF) showed up to a 6 EPNdB noise reduction at transonic rotor speeds relative to noise levels for the baseline (wide chord rotor and radial stator; all tones present) configuration...|$|R
