In 2014 an additional, even more extensive 4K restoration, using the original 16mm A/B reversal rolls, was carried out. After a screening in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, this was also released on DVD and Blu-ray worldwide. <b>Dark</b> <b>Sky</b> Films' US 40th Anniversary Edition was nominated for Best DVD/BD Special Edition Release at the 2015 Saturn Awards.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Vesta reached {{opposition}} in the constellation of Leo {{on the night of}} 17–18 February, at about magnitude 6.1, a brightness that makes it visible in binocular range but generally not for the naked eye. Under perfect <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> conditions where all light pollution is absent it might be visible to an experienced observer without the use of a telescope or binoculars. Vesta came to opposition again on 5 August 2011, in the constellation of Capricornus at about magnitude 5.6.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's <b>Dark</b> <b>Sky</b> Fund has paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E

25|$|The ISM is also {{responsible}} for extinction and reddening, the decreasing light intensity and shift in the dominant observable wavelengths of light from a star. These effects are caused by scattering and absorption of photons and allow the ISM to be observed {{with the naked eye}} in a <b>dark</b> <b>sky.</b> The apparent rifts that {{can be seen in the}} band of the Milky Way – a uniform disk of stars – are caused by absorption of background starlight by molecular clouds within a few thousand light years from Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} color descriptions {{are traditional}} in astronomy, and represent colors {{relative to the}} mean color of an A-class star, which {{is considered to be}} white. The apparent color descriptions are what the observer would see if trying to describe the stars under a <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> without aid to the eye, or with binoculars. However, most stars in the sky, except the brightest ones, appear white or bluish white to the unaided eye because they are too dim for color vision to work. Red supergiants are cooler and redder than dwarfs of the same spectral type, and stars with particular spectral features such as carbon stars may be far redder than any black body.|$|E
25|$|Most auroras {{occur in}} a band known as the auroral zone, which is {{typically}} 3° to 6° wide in latitude and between 10° and 20° from the geomagnetic poles at all local times (or longitudes), most clearly seen at night against a <b>dark</b> <b>sky.</b> A region that currently displays an aurora is called the auroral oval, a band displaced towards the nightside of the Earth. Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. Elias Loomis (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881) and S. Tromholt (1882) in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone. Day-to-day positions of the auroral ovals are posted on the internet.|$|E

500|$|Cherry Springs State Park {{was named}} Pennsylvania's first <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> park by the DCNR in 2000.

Cherry Springs has received national press coverage and hosts two star parties a year, which attract hundreds of astronomers. There are regular stargazing and educational programs for the public at the park, and the Woodsmen's Show attracts thousands each summer. Cherry Springs also offers rustic camping, picnic facilities, and trails for mountain biking, hiking, and snowmobiling. The surrounding state forest and park are home to a variety of flora and fauna.|$|E

500|$|The Nassau Station, {{originally}} {{constructed in}} the 1950s, currently houses a 36-inch reflecting telescope. It is named after observatory director Jason John Nassau, who was a prominent astronomer at the time. [...] Work {{was carried out in}} the 1990s to make the telescope capable of remote viewing, {{making it one of the}} first telescopes to be used in this manner. However, it was seldom used by Case astronomers due to increased light pollution from Cleveland and the enhanced capabilities of the Burrell Schmidt. As a result, the observatory was left unused for several years until 2008, when it was sold to the Geauga Park District. The park district reopened the facility as part of its Observatory Park on June 16, 2012. The park was designated as a <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> park by the International <b>Dark</b> <b>Sky</b> Association.|$|E

500|$|An {{increasing}} number of astronomers began to come to Cherry Springs, most in the 14-day <b>dark</b> <b>sky</b> period around the new moon, between the last quarter and first quarter phases. The park is open year-round and between 60and 85nights each year have ideal conditions, when the apparent magnitudes of the faintest stars visible can range from 7.1to 7.5. The park's Astronomy Field has been upgraded to accommodate these astronomers. In 2005a rotating [...] slotted observatory dome, two [...] clamshell domes, and a [...] sky shed were added, {{as well as a}} small amphitheater for programs. The four structures protect telescopes from the wind and thermal currents.

In 2009, Wi-Fi internet access was added to the Astronomy Field.|$|E
500|$|Current park policy {{mandates}} partial {{restoration of}} excavated sites. [...] "Backfilling", or re-burying excavated sites with sand, {{is one such}} means. Other measures attempt to safeguard the area's ancient ambiance and mystique, such as the [...] "Chaco Night Sky Program", which seeks to eliminate the effect of light pollution on the park's acclaimed night skies; under the program, some 14,000 visitors {{make use of the}} Chaco Observatory (inaugurated in 1998), park telescopes, and astronomy-related programs. The park was named a Gold-tier <b>Dark</b> <b>Sky</b> Park by the International Dark-Sky Association in 2013. Chacoan relics outside the current park's boundaries have been threatened by development: an example was the proposed competitive leasing of federal lands in the San Juan Basin for surface coal mining beginning in 1983. As ample coal deposits abut the park, this strip mining threatened the web of ancient Chacoan roads. The year-long [...] "Chaco Roads Project" [...] thus documented the roads, which were later protected from mining.|$|E
