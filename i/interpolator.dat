40|$|The {{amount of}} {{geometric}} information {{that must be}} transferred between a system and a computerized numerical control system creates a conflict between part precision {{on the one hand}} and feedrate fidelity and communications load on the other. This is the motivation for the development of new curve interpolation algorithms for CNC. The interpolation depends on the method of curve representation, i. e. the use of an implicit or a parametric from. Accordingly, the paper presents two realtime interpolation algorithms and compares them with existing <b>interpolators.</b> With the new <b>interpolators,</b> the amount of geometric information transferred from the system to the CNC system is reduced by orders of magnitude. Moreover, the contour errors caused by the new <b>interpolators</b> are much smaller than those caused by conventional <b>interpolators...</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{variations}} {{exist between the}} statements by Josephus regarding the deaths of James and the New Testament accounts. Scholars generally view these variations as indications that the Josephus passages are not interpolations, because a Christian <b>interpolator</b> would more likely have made them correspond to the Christian traditions. Robert Eisenman provides numerous early Christian sources that confirm the Josephus testament, that James was the brother of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Louis Feldman, who {{believes}} the Josephus passage on John is authentic, states that Christian interpolators {{would have been}} very unlikely to have devoted almost twice as much space to John (163 words) as to Jesus (89 words). Feldman also states that a Christian <b>interpolator</b> would have likely altered Josephus' passage about John the Baptist to make the circumstances of the death of John become similar to the New Testament, and to indicate that John was a forerunner of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{arguments}} against {{the authenticity of the}} James passage has been that in the Jewish Wars Josephus portrays the High Priest Ananus in a positive manner, while in the Antiquities he writes of Ananus in a negative tone. Louis Feldman rejects these arguments against the authenticity of the James passage and states that in several other unrelated cases the Jewish War also differs from the Antiquities, and that an <b>interpolator</b> would have made the two accounts correspond more closely to each other, not make them differ.|$|E

We study this problem for two decimation schemes {{that are most}} commonly used in practice: (1) quincunx lattice and (2) rectangular lattice. For each decimation lattice, we propose a number of interpolation structures {{that are based on}} some median or finite impulse response (FIR) -median hybrid filters. Extensive simulations show that the proposed median-based <b>interpolators</b> outperform significantly as compared with linear schemes. To further verify the effectiveness of these median-based <b>interpolators,</b> we compare them with multilayer neural networks designed through a training process, and still show a preference for the median-based <b>interpolators.</b> As an application, they are used in an interpolative Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) coding scheme to suppress blocking artifacts at very low bit rates. © 1998 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers...|$|R
2500|$|Some {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} partial authenticity rely on the language used in the Testimonium, e.g. that the passage calls Jesus [...] "a wise man" [...] which is not laudatory enough for an <b>interpolator,</b> neither is the reference to [...] "amazing deeds". According to Van Voorst, the statement [...] "those that loved him at the first did not forsake him" [...] has the characteristics of Josephus' writing and points to the continuation of Christianity. Van Voorst states that this sentence argues for the continuation of Christianity based on the love for its leader, not the reported appearances after his death. Van Voorst states {{that it is hard to}} imagine that the phrase [...] "receive the truth with pleasure" [...] used in the Testimonium is the work of a Christian <b>interpolator,</b> for Christian writers generally avoid the use of the word [...] "pleasure" [...] (ἡδονή in Greek) in a positive sense due to its association with hedonism.|$|E
2500|$|A textual {{argument}} against {{the authenticity of the}} James passage is that {{the use of the term}} [...] "Christos" [...] there seems unusual for Josephus. An argument based on the flow of the text in the document is that, given that the mention of Jesus appears in the Antiquities before that of the John the Baptist, a Christian <b>interpolator</b> may have inserted it to place Jesus in the text before John. A further {{argument against}} the authenticity of the James passage is that it would have read well even without a reference to Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|Geza Vermes {{believes}} in the partial authenticity of the Testimonium {{and the existence of}} a reference to Jesus within it. Vermes states that if the Testimonium had been the work of a Christian forger, it would have placed blame on the Jewish leaders, but as is it is [...] "perfectly in line" [...] with the attitude of Josephus towards Pilate. Vermes also states that the detached depiction of the followers of Jesus is not the work of a Christian <b>interpolator.</b> Vermes calls the Jesus notice in the Testimonium a [...] "veritable tour de force" [...] in which Josephus plays the role of a neutral witness.|$|E

2500|$|Andreas Köstenberger {{considers}} the James passage {{to be authentic}} and states that the James passage attests {{to the existence of}} Jesus as a historical person, and that his followers considered him the Messiah.(Köstenberger pages 104–105) Köstenberger states that the statement by Josephus that some people recognized Jesus as the Messiah is consistent with the grammar of Josephus elsewhere but does not imply that Josephus himself considered Jesus the Messiah.(Köstenberger pages 104–105) Köstenberger concurs with John Meier that it is highly unlikely for the passage to be a Christian interpolation given that in New Testament texts James {{is referred to as the}} [...] "brother of the Lord" [...] rather than the [...] "brother of Jesus", and that a Christian <b>interpolator</b> would have provided a more detailed account at that point.(Köstenberger pages 104–105) ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Robert E. Van Voorst the {{overwhelming}} majority of scholars consider both the reference to [...] "the brother of Jesus called Christ" [...] and the entire passage that includes it as authentic. Van Voorst states that the James passage fits well in the context in the Antiquities and an indication for its authenticity is the lack of the laudatory language that a Christian <b>interpolator</b> would have used to refer to Jesus as [...] "the Lord", or a similar term. Van Voorst also states that the use of a neutral term [...] "called Christ" [...] which neither denies nor affirms Jesus as the Messiah points to authenticity, and indicates that Josephus used it to distinguish Jesus from the many other people called Jesus at the time, {{in the same way that}} James is distinguished, given that it was also a common name.|$|E
40|$|IMAGE {{interpolation}} {{is getting}} more and more attentions because it {{plays an important role in}} many video applications such as image compression, interlaced- to-progressive conversion, and pyramidal image coding. In the past, image interpolation was usually performed by pixel replication in a small neighborhood of the original pixel. Later on, higher-order linear filters were used to enhance the performance. However, all these filters are only based on the neighborhood pixels to interpolate the missing pixels. Therefore, when an image is transmitted at a high compression rate, the distortion in the received image is very serious. As a result, we may not be able to get a good interpolated image based on the highly distorted neighbor pixels. In this thesis, we develop three new approaches, namely neural network approach, Wiener filtering approach, and subband Wiener filtering approach. In contrast to the traditional linear filtering methods described above, a unique feature of these <b>interpolators</b> is that they are able to make use of the information of desired pixels (i. e. the ideal pixels which we want to interpolate) and the image statistics to predict the missing pixels, while the prediction is optimal in the least-mean-square sense. We use the JPEG based interpolative image coding scheme [l] as an example to test our new <b>interpolators.</b> It is shown by the simulation results that our <b>interpolators</b> give better performance than traditional <b>interpolators...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Classic <b>interpolators</b> (resamplers) of band-limited {{signals are}} based on windowed sinc() {{function}} kernels. To speed computations up, kernel is not calculated in realtime, but sampled and stored in a table. Linear interpolation between kernel samples is used to lower noise caused by discretization of the continuous kernel function. In spite of this, the table is lenghty for high quality <b>interpolators.</b> This paper describes how the table size can be significantly lowered {{at a cost of}} slightly increased computation complexity and without quality loss. The algorithm described is specifically designed for SIMD processors, which high computational power is limited by memory bandwidth. ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{existence}} of John the Baptist {{within the same}} time frame as Jesus, and his eventual execution by Herod Antipas is attested to by 1st-century historian Flavius Josephus and {{the overwhelming majority of}} modern scholars view Josephus' accounts of the activities of John the Baptist as authentic. Josephus establishes a key connection between the historical events he recorded and specific episodes that appear in the gospels. The reference in the Antiquities of the Jews by Josephus to John's popularity among the crowds (...) and how he preached his baptism is considered a reliable historical datum. Unlike the gospels, Josephus does not relate John and Jesus, and does not state that John's baptisms were for the remission of sins. However, almost all modern scholars consider the Josephus passage on John to be authentic in its entirety and view the variations between Josephus and the gospels as indications that the Josephus passages are authentic, for a Christian <b>interpolator</b> would have made them correspond to the Christian traditions.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{scholarship}} has largely acknowledged {{the authenticity of}} the reference in [...] of the Antiquities to [...] "the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James" [...] and considers it as having the highest level of authenticity among the references of Josephus to Christianity. Almost all modern scholars consider the reference in [...] of the Antiquities to the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist also to be authentic and not a Christian interpolation. The references found in Antiquities have no parallel texts in the other work by Josephus such as The Jewish War, written 20 years earlier, but some scholars have provided explanations for their absence. A number of variations exist between the statements by Josephus regarding the deaths of James and John the Baptist and the New Testament accounts. Scholars generally view these variations as indications that the Josephus passages are not interpolations, for a Christian <b>interpolator</b> would have made them correspond to the New Testament accounts, not differ from them.|$|E

40|$|In many {{applications}} such as acoustic echo cancellation aid wideband active noise control, the Least Mean Square (LMS) based adaptive filters with hundreds of taps are used, resulting in lower convergence and high computational complexity. In recent years researchers have developed adaptive filters based on subband techniques to improve the convergence rate and reduce the computational complexity. One such approach is IFIR structure based adaptive filters also called Filter Rank Adaptive Filters (FBAF). Though the technique improves the convergence rate, it introduces a delay in the signal path. FBAFs usually use fixed paraunitary Perfect Reconstruction (PR) filterbanks for pre-processing the data. An arbitrary FIR transfer function can be modelled by a delayless IFIR structure with no conditions on the interpolating filter coefficients. The <b>interpolators</b> can be designed using optimization techniques with knowledge of input signal statistics to improve the convergence rate. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to adapt the <b>interpolators</b> themselves and the model filters simultaneously to reduce the mean square error and hence require no offline optimization procedure to design the <b>interpolators...</b>|$|R

We concentrate on pure interpolation and build smooth polynomial <b>interpolators</b> by first extending the monomial (polynomial) basis and then minimizing a measure of roughness {{with respect to the}} extra parameters in the extended basis. Algebraic methods can help in choosing the extended basis. We get arbitrarily close to optimal smoothing for any dimension over an arbitrary region, giving simple models close to splines.

60|$|Colonel Elliot devotes a long {{digression}} to the trivial {{value of}} recitations, so styled, {62b} and gives his suggestions about the copy being made {{up from the}} Reliques. When Scott's copy of 1806 agrees with the English version, Colonel Elliot surmises that a modern person, familiar with the English, has written the coincident verses in WITH DIFFERENCES. Percy and Douglas, for example, change speeches, each saying what, in the English, the other said in substance, not in the actual words. When Scott's version touches on an incident known in history, but not given in the English version, the encounter between Douglas and Percy at Newcastle (Scott, vii., viii.), Colonel Elliot suspects the <b>interpolator</b> (and well he may, for the verses are mawkish and modern, not earlier than the eighteenth century imitations or remaniements which occur in many ballads traditional in essence).|$|E
6000|$|The poet's meaning {{seems quite}} clear. He is not {{flattering}} Pisistratus, but, with quiet humour, offers {{the portrait of}} a vain, worthy veteran. It is difficult to see how this point can be missed; it never was missed before Nestor's speeches seemed serviceable to the Pisistratean theory of the composition of the ILIAD. In his first edition Mr. Leaf regarded the interpolations as intended [...] "to glorify Nestor" [...] without reference to Pisistratus, whom Mr. Leaf did not then recognise as the master of a sycophantic editor. The passages are really meant to display the old man's habit of glorifying himself and past times. Pisistratus could not feel flattered by passages intended to exhibit his ancestor as a conceited and inopportune old babbler. I ventured in 1896 to suggest that the <b>interpolator</b> was trying to please Pisistratus, but this was said in a spirit of mockery.|$|E
6000|$|Another {{plan is to}} {{maintain}} that if the poet does not in any case mention a corslet, there was no corslet. Thus in V. 99, an arrow strikes Diomede [...] "hard by the right shoulder, the plate of the corslet." [...] Thirteen lines later (V. 112, 113) [...] "Sthenelus drew the swift shaft right through out of Diomede's shoulder, and the blood darted up through the pliant chiton." [...] We {{do not know what}} the word here translated [...] "pliant" [...] [Greek: streptos] means, and Aristarchus seems to have thought it was [...] "a coat of mail, chain, or scale armour." [...] If so, here is the corslet, but in this case, if a corslet or jack with intertwisted small plates or scales or rings of bronze be meant, gualon cannot mean a large [...] "plate," [...] as it does. Mr. Ridgeway says, [...] "It seems certain that [Greek: streptos chitoon] means, as Aristarchus held, a shirt of mail." [...] [Footnote: Early Age of Greece, vol. i. p, 306.] Mr. Leaf says just the reverse. As usual, we come to a deadlock; a clash of learned opinion. But any one can see that, in the space of thirteen lines, no poet or <b>interpolator</b> who wrote V. i 12, i 13 could forget that Diomede was said to be wearing a corslet in V. 99; and even if the poet could forget, which is out of the question, the editor of 540 B.C. was simply defrauding his employer, Piaistratus, if he did not bring a remedy for the stupid fault of the poet. When this or that hero is not specifically said to be wearing a corslet, it is usually because the poet has no occasion to mention it, though, as we have seen, a man is occasionally smitten, in the midriff, say, without any remark on the flimsy piece of mail.|$|E
