In the final shot, Maggie is shown with shifty eyes, suggesting that she may have shot Mr. Burns deliberately.|$|E
5|$|The entire park {{is within}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, making it the only federal court district that includes portions of more than one state (Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming). Law professor Brian C. Kalt has argued that it may be impossible to impanel a jury in compliance with the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> committed solely in the unpopulated Idaho portion of the park (and that {{it would be difficult to}} do so <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> committed solely in the lightly populated Montana portion). One defendant, who was accused of a wildlife-related crime in the Montana portion of the park, attempted to raise this argument but eventually pleaded guilty, with the plea deal including his specific agreement not to raise the issue in his appeal.|$|E

5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of {{alienation}} and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.|$|E
5|$|In October 1957, Hergé {{sent his}} publisher, Casterman, {{the cover of}} his {{completed}} nineteenth Tintin adventure, The Red Sea Sharks, and for several weeks considered plot ideas for his next story. Fondly recalling the Scouting days of his youth, his first idea was to send Tintin back to the United States, as in the third adventure, Tintin in America, to help a group of Native Americans defend their land from a large corporation that wished to drill for oil; on reflection, Hergé {{came to believe that}} retracing old ground would be a step backwards. Another idea had Tintin striving to prove that Haddock's butler Nestor was framed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> committed by his old employers, the Bird brothers. He dismissed this as well, but kept the idea of an adventure with no guns or violence—the only Tintin story without an antagonist. A third idea sent Tintin and Professor Calculus to a snow-covered polar region, where a stranded group of explorers need Calculus to save them from food poisoning. He abandoned this plot also, but kept the setting in a snowy environment and decided to focus, not on Calculus, but on his main character Tintin.|$|E

5|$|Yellowfang's Secret was {{released}} on 9 October 2012. It is a Super Edition about the former medicine cat of ThunderClan, Yellowfang and her life in ShadowClan. It follows Yellowfang as she first trains to be a warrior, then a medicine cat, as Sagewhisker tells her that her paws are not meant for shedding blood. She decides to switch {{to the role of}} medicine cat instead because she can feel the injuries of all the other cats in ShadowClan. A few moons later she breaks the code of medicine cats when she gives birth to kits; as a result, she and her whole Clan are punished for her disloyalty to the code, as her only surviving kit, Brokenkit proves to be vicious, bloodthirsty, and driven only by ambition, qualities that his own father, Raggedstar, ignores. In the end, Yellowfang herself is cast out of ShadowClan to live as a rogue by her own kit, now having gone on to follow in his father's footsteps and become Brokenstar <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> she did not commit.|$|E
5|$|Callum's {{presence}} causes countless {{problems for}} the Platt family. His court proceedings cause the feud to heighten to violence. He also manipulates David's sister Sarah and gets her daughter Bethany into trouble with drugs. Callum attacks Sarah for framing him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> Kylie hits Callum with a tool and kills him. She, Sarah and David bury Callum in a manhole under their home.

5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E
