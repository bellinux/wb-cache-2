40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of jet engines hard to machine titanium- and nickel-based alloys are in common use for blade and disk materials. With Electrochemical Machining (ECM) highest material removal rates can be achieved at best surface qualities. However for tool design, knowledge of local material dissolution is indispensable. This paper deals with basic research on the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machinability</b> of selected modern titanium- and nickel-based alloys for aero engine components. Therefor experimental results of feed rate as a function of current density for an ECM sinking operation with a cylindrical tool electrode and external flushing are compared to the theoretical dissolution behavior according to Faraday's law. Furthermore surface properties were examined in terms of SEM and EDX analysis of the rim zone...|$|E
40|$|Abstractγ-TiAl-based alloys have {{attractive}} properties {{regarding the}} specific strength at high temperatures. Thus, {{the demand for}} aero engine components such as turbine blades and discs out of this class of materials will increase over the next years significantly. Due to the hard machinability via conventional cutting processes one possible alternative {{is seen in the}} Electrochemical Machining (ECM). This paper contains basic research on the unpulsed <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machinability</b> of four typical γ-TiAl-based alloys. Therefor specific material removal rate is investigated as a function of current density and compared to the theoretical dissolution behavior according to Faraday's law. Finally investigations on surface integrity aspects of these alloys are presented and exemplarily compared to conventional cutting processes to show specific ECM process capabilities...|$|E
40|$|In micro {{injection}} molding, cavities {{with high}} accuracy are required {{in order to}} fulfil the given requirements on precision. The molding inserts are often made of additive manufactured alloys in order to create conformal cooling or heating channels close to the injection molding cavity. Since these materials are usually harder than melting metallurgical alloys of the same composition, Precise Electrochemical Machining (PEM) represents a potential procedure for micro manufacturing of high precision cavities, because mechanical characteristics such as the material’s hardness and the ductility have no influence on the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machinability.</b> In addition, no mechanical forces nor thermal impact influence the machining result. Due to the missing mechanical contact between the tool electrode and the machined cavity, filigrane structures with high precision can be manufactured even in mechanically hard to machine materials. The dissolution behavior of the work piece material is only influenced by its electrochemical attributes. In this study, precise electrochemical machining of a stainless steel (1. 4301) plate is investigated. A complex shaped brass electrode is applied {{in order to create a}} complicated cavity, which would be difficult to be machined by conventional techniques. For the determination of the precision, the influence of an increasing feed rate on the resulting cross-sectional shape of the cavity as well as on the lateral widening and on the influence of a micro pillar is examined...|$|E
