25|$|For a time, {{the future}} of {{composite}} baseball bats at the collegiate level was in question. On July 22, 2009, the NCAA reported that the rules committee had requested to ban the use of composite bats. The NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel found that 20 out of the 25 composite bats tested during the 2009 NCAA Division 1 Baseball Tournament failed the BESR (Ball <b>Exit</b> <b>Speed</b> Ratio) test. The tests showed that the balls were actually coming off the bat much quicker than what the specifications allowed. Since bats must pass the BESR specification at the factory before reaching the market, there are two possible hypotheses. One suggests that the performance of composite bats increases with repeated use; the other states that players are intentionally altering the composite bat. The most common method of altering composite bats is through bat rolling, where {{a large amount of}} pressure is applied, by various means, while rolling the bat back and forth. The rules committee met on August 17, 2009, to discuss their proposal with manufacturers, and on August 24, the NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel approved a temporary ban on composite bats. During this temporary ban, the rules committee will continue testing the bats to determine if the performance is enhanced through repetitive use, or if intentional alteration seems more plausible. Currently, the NCAA is requiring that all composite bats meet BBCOR standards. See the Design section above for details.|$|E

Automation of sorting process by implementing microprocessor control systems is the main direction of increasing hump yard capacity, enhancement of safety in trains breaking-up, improvement of working conditions on hump yards. However, for wider introduction of such systems at the humps, {{it is necessary to}} reduce their cost. One of the main tasks of hump control systems is the determination of the optimal cars <b>exit</b> <b>speeds</b> from the retarders. Its solution is significantly complicated because of the uncertainty of cars rolling resistance coefficient, wind velocity and direction, retarder control errors. The paper is aimed at solving the problem of searching for such cars <b>exit</b> <b>speeds</b> from the retarders that provide the longest time intervals between them at the switches. Implementation of this method will make it possible {{to improve the quality of}} sorting process as a whole by improving the software of microprocessor control systems for automatic humping, rather than by increasing their technical facilities, which as a result will reduce the cost of their construction and operation. The research results, when solving the problem of searching for cars <b>exit</b> <b>speeds</b> from the retarders, allow us to move from searching for the maximum of a nonlinear non-smooth function of two variables to solution of an equation with one variable, which significantly accelerates and simplifies the solution to the problem.|$|R

3000|$|At this, to {{increase}} both intervals δ t_ 1 and δ t_ 2 {{and at the}} same time to maintain their equality, it is necessary to reduce the movement time of cut at the initial section τ_ 2 ([...] σ_ 2) with the simultaneous increase of Δ t_ss.

40|$|Some of the {{background}} to contemporary jet aeroacoustics is addressed. Then scaling laws for noise generation by low-Mach-number airflows and by turbulence convected at 'not so low' Mach number is reviewed. These laws {{take into account the}} influence of Doppler effects associated with the convection of aeroacoustic sources. Next, a uniformly valid Doppler-effect approximation exhibits the transition, with increasing Mach number of convection, from compact-source radiation at low Mach numbers to a statistical assemblage of conical shock waves radiated by eddies convected at supersonic speed. In jets, for example, supersonic eddy convection is typically found for jet <b>exit</b> <b>speeds</b> exceeding twice the atmospheric speed of sound. The Lecture continues by describing a new dynamical theory of the nonlinear propagation of such statistically random assemblages of conical shock waves. It is shown, both by a general theoretical analysis and by an illustrative computational study, how their propagation is dominated by a characteristic 'bunching' process. That process associated with a tendency for shock waves that have already formed unions with other shock waves to acquire an increased proneness to form further unions - acts so as to enhance the high-frequency part of the spectrum of noise emission from jets at these high <b>exit</b> <b>speeds...</b>|$|R
