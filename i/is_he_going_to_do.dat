His first {{appearance}} was in [...] "Dark Wings, Dark Words", as a then-unnamed [...] "boy" [...] who helps a captured Theon Greyjoy. Before he was cast as Ramsay, Rheon auditioned {{for the role of}} Jon Snow. In an interview, he described learning about his character's fate: [...] "I had received half the scripts, five episodes, then I got the call. They joked, 'Isn't it great Ramsay ends up on the Iron Throne?' As soon as they said that I said, 'He's dead, isn't he?' It's cool. I've had four lovely seasons here. It's been great to be involved with such an amazing show. I think it's kind of right he goes down. Because what else <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> after this? He's done so many things. It's justified and it's the right thing to do. It's the right path. He's reached his peak. It's nice for the audience that he goes out on this high, if you will." [...] In that interview, Kit Harington talked about Rheon: [...] "I love Iwan's work. He's an incredibly detailed actor who's created a character who's remarkable and despicable." ...|$|E

After the battle, supporting troops asked the victorious North Carolinians: [...] "Any more tar down in the Old North State, boys?" [...] and they replied: [...] "No, not a bit; old Jeff's bought it all up." [...] The supporting troops continued: [...] "Is that so?

6000|$|... "I hope it was {{a change}} for the better as to that stupid girl." [...] Lady Tringle could not say {{that there had been a}}ny {{change for the better}}, but she thought that there had been a change about the girl. Tom had, as she said, quite [...] "brisked up," [...] had {{declared}} that he was not going to stand this thing any longer, had packed up three or four portmanteaus, and had had himself carried off to the nearest railway station in time for an afternoon train up to London.

6000|$|Absorbed in {{the events}} which had {{followed}} his aunt's invitation, Julian had forgotten his engagement to stay at Mablethorpe House. Could he return, knowing his own heart as he now knew it? Could he honorably remain, perhaps for weeks together, in Mercy's society, conscious as he now was of the impression which she had produced on him? No. The one honorable course that he could take was to find an excuse for withdrawing from his engagement. [...] "Beg her ladyship not to wait dinner for me," [...] he said. [...] "I will write and make my apologies." [...] The cab drove off. The wondering servant waited on the doorstep, looking after it.

6000|$|In {{the making}} of very rich men {{there is always a}} factor of good fortune and a factor of design and will. One meets rich men at times who seem to be merely lucky gamblers, who strike one as just the thousandth man in a myriad of wild plungers, who are, in fact, chance nobodies washed up by an eddy. Others, again, strike one as {{exceptionally}} lucky half-knaves. But there are others of a growth more deliberate and of an altogether higher personal quality. One takes such men as Mr. J.D. Rockefeller or Mr. Pierpont Morgan--the scale of their fortunes makes them public property--and it is clear that we are dealing with persons on quite a different level of intellectual power from the British Colonel Norths, for example, or the South African Joels. In my [...] "Future in America" [...] I have taken the former largely at Miss Tarbell's estimate, and treated him as a case of acquisitiveness raised in Baptist surroundings. But I doubt very much if that exhausts the man as he is to-day. Given a man brought up to saving and [...] "getting on" [...] as if to a religion, a man very acquisitive and very patient and restrained, and indubitably with great organising power, and he grows rich beyond the dreams of avarice. And having done so, there he is. What <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> Every step he takes up the ascent to riches gives him new perspectives and new points of view.|$|E

Alberto is also shocked and asks Gerado what <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now. Gerado says he will gather the army and attack Lodi.|$|E

5000|$|... 2nd ball : Fleming again bowled full but Klusener {{also hit}} this ball hard {{along the ground}} past Mark Waugh, who was {{standing}} at long-off, for another boundary. Klusener had {{made his way to}} 31 runs off just 14 balls and South Africa were now level, but they still needed one more run to advance into the final. On this delivery, South African commentator Mike Proctor said [...] "He’s hit it hard...that’s Mark Waugh down there, he won’t get it - they are level! What kind of shot is that? That’s unbelievable, <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it again for South Africa? He has done it on so many occasions. The first two deliveries of this over, he has gone bang, bang four, four - take that! Scores are level, South Africa need one to win to reach the final."
