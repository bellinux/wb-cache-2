50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{emergency}} <b>eyewash</b> <b>station</b> and safety shower station systems, including safety showers, eyewash stations, drench hoses, combination units, and eyewash bottles.|$|E
50|$|A {{combination}} unit {{is where}} other units {{such as a}} shower station, <b>eyewash</b> <b>station,</b> and drench hose share the same water supply plumbing. This unit is useful in laboratory where hazardous chemicals with different properties are used.|$|E
50|$|An <b>eyewash</b> <b>station</b> is a {{unit for}} washing {{chemicals}} or substances that might splash into an individual's eyes before {{he or she}} can seek further medical attention. The user needs to wash their eyes for at least 5 minutes.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} found in <b>eyewash</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
40|$|Where are <b>eyewash</b> <b>stations</b> used? <b>Eyewash</b> {{facilities}} are required in workplaces where corrosive chemicals are used (29 CFR 1910. 151 (c)), {{as well as}} in HIV and HBV research laboratories and production facilities (1910. 1030 (e) (3) (i)), and where there is any possibility that an employee’s eyes may be splashed with solutions containing 0. 1 percent or greater formaldehyde (1910. 1048 (i) (3)). They may also be found in research and production laboratories, in medical facilities and other workplaces with materials that may cause injury to or infection of the eyes. How can improperly maintained <b>eyewash</b> <b>stations</b> cause infections? Water found in improperly maintained eyewas...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{requirements}} is to ensure <b>eyewash</b> and shower <b>stations</b> are available to help protect workers after an eye or skin exposure to injurious corrosive chemicals. They cover selecting, installing, inspecting, and maintaining emergency <b>eyewash</b> and shower <b>stations.</b> They apply to workers, supervisors, building managers, and ESH coordinators. ...|$|R
50|$|According to ANSI, the {{location}} of safety shower and <b>eyewash</b> <b>station</b> should be within 10 second walking distance from the place of hazard and must located on the same floor of the hazard so the victim {{does not have to}} go up or down the stair when accident occur. Moreover, the path way should be clear from any obstacle and as straight as possible.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} a {{personal}} eyewash unit, it is a supplementary for eyewash stations. However, eyewash stations cannot be replaced by eyewash bottles since they do not meet safety standards. Eyewash bottles allow an individual to flush the injured area immediately, or until the individual can reach the fixed <b>eyewash</b> <b>station.</b> Early eyewashes were designed with a single rinsing stream, but recent advancements have made eyewashes capable of flushing both eyes simultaneously. A pH neutral solution for emergency eyewash may also be chosen to reduce the danger from contaminants if strong acid or alkali chemicals are present.|$|E
50|$|Sofi {{is upset}} by the {{research}} they're doing and Karen leaves. Sofi kisses Ian and knocks over a bottle of formaldehyde, splashing his eyes. They call Karen, who helps him to the <b>eyewash</b> <b>station</b> and bandages his eyes, and Sofi takes him home. Then the elevator in Sofi's apartment building stops between floors. As they try to climb out, the elevator starts to move again and Sofi is killed. Ian goes into a depression, and Karen continues their research. One night Karen brings him a meal at his home. He begins to cry and she hugs him. They begin to kiss.|$|E
50|$|A drench hose is {{equipment}} that can spray {{water to a}} specific spot of the chemical exposure on individual's body. The benefit of a drench hose {{is that it can}} be applied to an individual who cannot reach a normal <b>eyewash</b> or shower <b>station</b> or where the <b>eyewash</b> and shower <b>station</b> is unavailable.|$|R
5000|$|According to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), several {{regulation}} of emergency <b>eyewash</b> and shower <b>station</b> {{was developed and}} contained in 29 CFR 1910.151 stated that [...] "Where the eyes or body of any person may be exposed to injurious corrosive materials, suitable facilities for quick drenching or flushing of the eyes and body shall be provided within the work area for immediate emergency use." [...] However, OSHA regulation is unclear on defining what facility is required. From this reason, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has developed a standard for emergency <b>eyewash</b> and shower <b>station</b> including the design.|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the development and}} evaluation of a specific Legionella pneumophila Taqman duplex real-time PCR (qPCR) for fast and reliable quantification of this human pathogen in suspected man-made water systems. The qPCR assay was 100 % specific for all L. pneumophila serogroups 1 - 15 with a sensitivity of 60 genome units/l and an amplification efficiency of 98 %. Amplification inhibitors were detected via an exogenous internal positive control, which was amplified simultaneously with L. pneumophila DNA using its own primer and probe set. Mean recovery rates of the qPCR assay for tap water and cooling circuit water, spiked with a known number L. pneumophila bacteria, were 93. 0 % and 56. 3 %, respectively. Additionally, by using the Ultracleantrade mark Soil DNA isolation kit, {{we were able to}} remove amplification inhibitors ubiquitously present in cooling water. The practical value of our qPCR assay was evaluated through analysis of 30 water samples from showers, taps, <b>eyewash</b> <b>stations,</b> fire sprinklers and recirculation loops with qPCR and traditional culture. In conclusion, the described L. pneumophila Taqman duplex real-time assay proved to be specific, sensitive and reproducible. This makes it a promising method complementing the current time-consuming culture standard method. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Health care {{providers}} use laboratory test results to diagnose disease, determine prognosis, and monitor a patient 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s treatment or health status. Current practice shows an increased trend for medical {{decisions based on}} tests performed {{at the point of}} care. Forethought, planning, and preparation are critical when making decisions to begin testing or when adding a new test to the menu in a laboratory, physician office, or other point-of-care location. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) Certificate for Provider-Performed Microscopy (PPM) procedures issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) permits a laboratory or testing site to perform a limited list of moderate complexity microscopic tests, as well as any waived tests. PPM-certified laboratories may perform certain microscopic examinations {{during the course of a}} patient visit using specimens that quickly deteriorate or are not easily transportable. PPM-certified laboratories must meet the same CLIA quality standards as laboratories performing moderate complexity tests. This booklet describes recommended practices for physicians, midlevel practitioners (nurse midwife, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant), and dentists who perform patient testing under a CLIA Certificate for PPM procedures. The CLIA requirements for testing under a Certificate for PPM can be found at [URL] xml/CFR- 2003 -title 42 -vol 3 -part 493. xml#seqnum 493. 19. Although some of the recommendations in this booklet exceed CLIA requirements for provider-performed microscopy testing, following these good testing practices will likely lead to reliable, high quality test results. The findings and conclusions in this booklet are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

40|$|Forty eyewash {{units were}} sampled for protozoa, bacteria, and fungi. Total {{heterotrophic}} bacterial counts on nutrient agar and R 2 A agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) ranged from 0 to 10 (5) CFU/ml, with Pseudomonas spp. {{being the most}} frequently isolated. Total counts of 10 (4) and 10 (8) cells per ml were obtained with the acridine orange staining procedure. All samples were examined for Legionella spp. by direct fluorescent-antibody staining and by culturing on buffered charcoal-yeast extract agar containing alpha-ketoglutarate and glycine and supplemented with cycloheximide, vancomycin, and polymyxin B. DNA-DNA hybridization was used to confirm identification of the Legionella isolates. Legionellae were detected in 35 of 40 (87. 5 %) samples by direct fluorescent-antibody staining, with 3 samples yielding both Legionella spp. and amoebae. Amoebae identified as Hartmannella, Vahlkampfia, Acanthamoeba, and Cochliopodium spp. were detected in 19 of 40 (47 : 5 %) samples. Sabouraud dextrose agar was used to obtain a crude estimate of viable fungal populations, pH, hardness, and ammonia, alkalinity, chlorine, copper, and iron contents were recorded for all water samples collected from eyewash stations; 33 % of the samples had {{greater than or equal}} to 10 mg of CO 2 per liter. It is concluded that <b>eyewash</b> <b>stations</b> not regularly flushed and/or cleaned and used to flush traumatized eye tissue may be a source of infection and can contaminate laboratory environments via aerosol transmission...|$|R
40|$|Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative {{bacterium}} responsible for Legionnaire 2 ̆ 7 s disease, and is commonly transmitted via aerosolized water. Legionella colonization of emergency <b>eyewash</b> and shower <b>stations</b> may pose an exposure hazard to users of these stations. There is little {{information about the}} role of these stations as significant reservoirs for Legionella. Samples were collected from 67 stations in an industrial facility. At the time of this study, the stations within this facility were under a routine maintenance program that included at least monthly flushing. This study also included the analysis for other bacterial organisms to determine an association between the presence and concentration of other bacteria and Legionella. All samples resulted in no detection of Legionella, yet 12 of the samples contained large counts of other bacteria. Thus, this study supports that properly maintained emergency <b>eyewash</b> and shower <b>stations</b> {{do not appear to be}} a significant source for aerosol transmission of Legionella...|$|R
