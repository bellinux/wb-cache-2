Insofar as the Maritime School of 1881 was not only the start of the Naval Academy, but also a prototype of the modern Engineering Faculty and most departments in it. It should be emphasized that the Temporary Officer Course of 1893 was a prototype of the modern Navigation Faculty, as well as departments in it such as Naval Tactics Department, Navigation and Fleet And Ports Operation.

It {{also points out that}} cooperation shall continue with the aim of raising the level of general education and vocational education and training (VET) in Albania, as well as employment policy and social inclusion. It emphasises that a priority for the higher education system shall be the achievement of the objectives of the Bologna Declaration. The EU and Albania shall also cooperate with the aim of ensuring that access to all levels of education and training in Albania is free of discrimination on the grounds of gender, race, ethnic origin or religion. The relevant Community programmes and instruments shall contribute to the upgrading of <b>educational</b> and <b>training</b> <b>structures</b> and quality improvement measures in Albania. To comply with the expectations expressed in the SAA document, the Government of Albania adopted a revised National Action Plan in July 2006, and as a potential EU candidate country Albania has already started to use funds from the EUâ€™s Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA). 3 One important field that will receive assistance from this instrument is human resources development (HRD), which will address the following mid-term priorities: (i) advancing the reform of the education and VET system to support the development of economy and society; (ii) creating a link between the education system and the labour market; (iii) improving the capacity of the public employment service, and making it relevant to the Albanian context; (iv) developing relevant active labour market measures in order to combat unemployment...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the characterictics and {{development}} of the <b>educational</b> <b>training</b> theory by Fusanosuke Tada, famous teacher, didacticer and educational journalist in Meiji Era. The main findings are as follows. 1) In his conception of <b>educational</b> <b>training</b> were 2 conceptions; inner and external. 2) His principle of <b>educational</b> <b>training</b> was coordination between policy and method of <b>educational</b> <b>training.</b> 3) He attached great importance to the thought of self-government, especially to the practice of classroom-leader system. 4) He made rather a cantious use of the methods of reward and punishment. 5) He clarified the role of the thought of "school-life" that developed into extra-curricular activities later. The obtained findings suggest that the theory of <b>educational</b> <b>training</b> of Fusanosuke Tada played an inportant part in the realization and development of educational theory in Meiji Era...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades the geosciences have {{acquired}} a wealth of new and high quality data from new and greatly improved observing technologies. These datasets have been paramount in enabling improved understanding and modeling but have also strikingly demonstrated important knowledge gaps and the limitations of our current conceptual models to explain key aspects of these observations. This situation limits progress on questions that have both fundamental scientific and societal significance, including climate and weather, natural disaster mitigation, earthquake and volcano dynamics, earth structure and geodynamics, resource exploration, and planetary evolution. The challenge in modeling accurately these processes is not only one of computational power. Powerful computations based on existing models are incapable of reproducing the observations faithfully. Instead, we need to develop new conceptual approaches to describe the complexities of these natural systems. Essentially, we need ways to characterize complicated systems that vary strongly in space and time in ways that are not adequately accounted for in our current paradigms. A four-day workshop in October 2011 explored this issue and reached a consensus that significant advances can result from accelerating the traditional interaction between geoscientists, mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists. We considered key challenges that confront the geosciences and major areas of rapid development in mathematics, statistics and computer science that offer the potential for significant advances in meeting these challenges. This type of research will require combining stochastic and deterministic models, improving methods of model validation and verification, developing inverse methods and techniques for the identification of extreme events and critical transitions, and formulating novel numerical algorithms and implementations, along with the greatly enhanced use of data from the rapidly evolving observing systems. To advance these goals, we propose establishing a geographically distributed but well-focused institute with a novel operational, <b>educational</b> and <b>training</b> <b>structure</b> that can foster and promote these valuable interactions...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} satanic ritual abuse has gained {{widespread}} public and professional {{attention in the}} past ten years. During therapy, many adult Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) clients describe memories of Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) beginning in childhood. Basically, the only information circulating in the mental health professional community about MPD/SRA issues is derived from workshops and lectures at trainings and professional meetings. The intent of this project was to determine the need for an in-depth <b>educational</b> <b>training</b> film for mental health professionals to assess, diagnose and treat satanic ritual abuse survivors in conjunction with multiple personality disorder. A questionnaire was used to determine whether a video <b>educational</b> <b>training</b> film would be beneficial.

40|$|Previous studies {{comparing}} {{groups of}} subjects have indicated differential probabilities of stimulus equivalence outcome {{as a function}} of <b>training</b> <b>structure.</b> Both one-to-many (OTM) and many-to-one (MTO) <b>training</b> <b>structures</b> seem to produce stimulus equivalence more often than a linear series <b>training</b> <b>structure.</b> The {{purpose of the present study}} was to explore whether or not corresponding differential probabilities of equivalence outcome {{as a function of}} <b>training</b> <b>structure</b> can be demonstrated in the performances of single subjects. In Experiment 1, equivalence outcome was tested successively following training according to each of the three <b>training</b> <b>structures.</b> All subjects responded in accord with equivalence following the OTM <b>training</b> <b>structure</b> independent of the training order, except for 1 Â· subject who did not respond in accord with equivalence following neither of the three <b>training</b> <b>structures.</b> Furthermore, 2 subjects demonstrated individual success following both one-to-many and many-to-one training even when they did not demonstrate success following linear series training, while the reverse never happened. In Experiment 2, equivalence outcome was tested successively following training according to a many-to-one and a one-to-many <b>training</b> <b>structure</b> with both 2 and 3 classes of stimuli. The results showed that all subjects responded in accord with equivalence following the OTM <b>training</b> <b>structure,</b> while 2 subjects did not respond in accord with equivalence following the MTO <b>training</b> <b>structure.</b> In Experiment 3, equivalence outcome was tested successively following training according to a many-to-one <b>training</b> <b>structure</b> and one-to-many <b>training</b> <b>structure</b> with both 3 and 4 members in each class. In accord with the results of Arntzen and Holth (1997) the present results indicated a superiority of the one-to-many over alternative <b>training</b> <b>structures</b> as regards the probability of an equivalence outcome. There was no difference in the probability of an equivalence outcome following one-to-many and many-to-one as a function of increasing number of members. The difference in number of comparisons connected to each sample as a consequence of the dissimilarity in the <b>training</b> <b>structures</b> is discussed as a possible explanation for the difference in equivalence outcome...|$|R
