50|$|A humor {{magazine}} is a magazine {{specifically designed to}} deliver humorous content to its readership. These publications often offer satire and parody, but some also put an emphasis on cartoons, caricature, absurdity, one-liners, witty aphorisms, surrealism, neuroticism, <b>gelotology,</b> emotion-regulating humor, and/or humorous essays. Humor magazines first became popular in the early 19th century with specimens like Le Charivari (1832-1937) in France, Punch (1841-2002) in the United Kingdom and Vanity Fair (1859-1863) in the United States.|$|E

In 1974, Klein's wife was only 34 {{years old when she}} died of liver disease, and the aspect where she had kept her sense of humor {{all the way to the}} end inspired Klein to give up his previous career as a theater and television scene designer and to study human development. Klein is an American author and lecturer on the stress relieving benefits of humor and on gallows humor. Among other positions, Klein was the 2005-2006 president of The Association for Applied and Therapeutic Humor.|$|E
5000|$|In 1872, Charles Darwin {{published}} one of {{the first}} [...] "comprehensive and in many ways remarkably accurate description of laughter in terms of respiration, vocalization, facial action and gesture and posture" [...] (Laughter). In this early study Darwin raises further questions about who laughs and why they laugh; the myriad responses since then illustrates the complexities of this behaviour. To understand laughter in humans and other primates, the science of <b>gelotology</b> (from the Greek , meaning laughter) has been established; it is the study of laughter and its effects on the body from both a psychological and physiological perspective. While jokes can provoke laughter, laughter cannot be used as a one-to-one marker of jokes because there are multiple stimuli to laugher, humour being just {{one of the}}m. The other six causes of laughter listed are: social context, ignorance, anxiety, derision, acting apology, and tickling. As such, the study of laughter is a secondary albeit entertaining perspective in an understanding of jokes.|$|E

40|$|Background. To {{study the}} {{features}} of psychological state, clinical and instrumental parameters in children with vegetative dysfunction (VD) and hypotension influenced by comprehensive treatment with {{the inclusion of the}} innovative psychocorrective program with elements of music therapy, visual art therapy and <b>gelotology.</b> Materials and methods. The study included 57 patients with VD and hypotension aged 12 to 17 years, 37 of them received psychotherapy with innovative program “Our drugs — music, laughter, creativity” in comprehensive treatment, 20 children (control group) received basic treatment without psychological assistance. General clinical, laboratory, instrumental and psychodiagnostic studies were performed both in main and control groups. Results. Using innovative psychocorrective program in children with VD and hypotension as a part of comprehensive treatment contributed to the improvement of clinical and instrumental data: number of cases with autonomic influences on the heart reduced (from 22. 1 to 5. 25 %, р < 0. 05), orthostatic test autonomic provision was normalized in 40. 5 % of children, psychological state improvement was observed in 74. 1 % of cases. Conclusions. Innovative psychocorrective program with elements of music therapy, visual art therapy and <b>gelotology</b> can be recommended as a part of comprehensive treatment of children with VD and hypotension in hospital environment and in future psychological support of patients...|$|E

Michaela Votroubková Number as regards: 98 Number supplements: 10 Year defences: 2009 Keywords: humour, nursing, geriatrics, {{experimental}} research, patient The thesis Usage of Humour in Nursing {{is divided}} into two main parts - a theoretical part and an empirical part. The first part summarises the main knowledge of <b>gelotology</b> and the ways of application of humour in patients. The branch of nursing, its main ideas leading to satisfying of patients' needs are defined in this part. Some typical problems of geriatric patients are mentioned in the theoretical part. The empirical part describes an experiment carried out in a group of patients in Teaching Hospital Hradec Kralove. Subjective and objective indicators of the patients' condition of an experimental group and a control group were observed and compared. Humour was applied bedside in both groups of patients. There were used audio and video recordings of known crowd-pleasers. The results indicate the possibility of successful usage of humour in nursing / clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Laughter {{is a part}} {{of human}} {{behavior}} regulated by the brain, helping humans clarify their intentions in social interaction and providing an emotional context to conversations. Traditionally, it is considered a visual expression of happiness, or an inward feeling of joy. It may ensue from hearing a joke, being tickled, or other stimuli. In History <b>Gelotology</b> was first studied by psychiatrists, although some doctors in antiquity recommended laughter as a form of medicine. Several types of therapy have emerged which use laughter to help patients like Humor and Laughter Therapy, Laughter Meditation, Laughter Yoga. A link between laughter and healthy function of blood vessels was first reported in 2005 by researchers at the University of Maryland Medical Center with the fact that laughter causes the dilatation of the inner lining of blood vessels, the endothelium, and increases blood flow. Drs. Michael Miller (University of Maryland) and William Fry (Stanford), theorize that beta-endorphin like compounds released by the hypothalamus activate receptors on the endothelial surface to release nitric oxide, thereby resulting in dilation of vessels. Other cardioprotective properties of nitric oxide include reduction of inflammation and decreased platelet aggregation. Laughter has also been shown to have beneficial effects on various other aspects of biochemistry 1. For example, laughter has been shown to lead to reductions in stress hormones such as cortisol and epinephrine. While laughing the brain also releases endorphins that can relieve some physical pain. Laughter also boosts the number of antibody-producing cells and enhances the effectiveness of T-cells, leading to a stronger immune system...|$|E
40|$|A pesquisa é uma investigação sobre o fenômeno do Riso, partindo dos estudos de Henri Bergson e Sigmund Freud até as pesquisas atuais da neurociência, da gelotologia e dos variados estudos sobre o comportamento humano. Para compreender melhor o Riso, é feita uma avaliação detalhada do livro O Riso, de Henri Bergson, buscando compreender as considerações fundamentais estabelecidas pelo autor, na sua interpretação deste fenômeno como um Gesto Social e todas as implicações que derivam deste fato. No segundo capítulo deste estudo é analisado com detalhes O Chiste e sua relação com o Inconsciente, de Sigmund Freud, comparando as abordagens de Freud e Bergson e analisando os mecanismos propostos por Freud para o funcionamento do chiste e quais as razões pelas quais eles seriam contados. A leitura e análise deste livro são dirigidas especificamente ao estudo do Riso, deixando de abordar outros aspectos, importantes para a leitura da obra de Freud como um todo, mas que desviariam o foco deste trabalho. Todo o esforço foi dedicado à compreensão dos mecanismos do chiste estudados por Freud e das formas de obtenção de prazer através deles. Ao final, pesquisas atuais são estudadas, como as do Laboratório do Riso de Richard Wiseman, que realizou uma pesquisa mundial sobre quais seriam as piadas consideradas mais engraçadas pelas pessoas. Investiga-se também o papel dos neurônios-espelho, importante descoberta que permite uma visão mais clara sobre comportamentos sociais de humanos e primatas. A possibilidade de o riso ser um comportamento semelhante ao {{grooming}} dos primatas também é levantada, já que ambas seriam trocas de prazer entre indivíduos visando um benefício dentro do grupo. Nesta linha, é apresentado um estudo que define o riso como uma característica específica do gênero masculino, que usaria o recurso para aproximação da fêmea visando acasalamento. Não há um resultado conclusivo, não há uma palavra final sobre o Riso, pois se torna claro que em muitas circunstâncias o termo abarca fenômenos semelhantes, mas não exatamente iguais. Da mesma maneira que existem múltiplos risos, também existem múltiplas áreas que estudam as distintas variações do Riso. The {{research is}} an investigation about {{the phenomenon of}} the Laugh, from the studies of Henri Bergson and Sigmund Freud up to today's research on neuroscience, <b>gelotology</b> and several other studies on human behaviour. In order to better understand the Laugh, an accurate evaluation of the book " Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic", by Henri Bergson is made as an attempt to better understand the main considerations set by the author, in his interpretation of this phenomenon as a Social Gesture and all the implications originated by such fact. In the second chapter of this study, Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious, by Sigmund Freud, are closely analyzed in details, comparing Freuds and Bergsons approaches and analyzing the mechanisms proposed by Freud concerning the way the Joke works, pointing out the reasons why they would be told to others. The reading and analysis of this book are directed specifically {{to the study of the}} Laugh, not approaching any other aspect, relevant to the reading of Freuds work as a whole, which however, would deviate the focus of this work. All the efforts were dedicated to the comprehension of the jokes mechanisms studied by Freud as well as ways to obtain pleasure through them. At the end updated research is verified, such as the one from Richard Wisemans Laugh Laboratory, that accomplished a worldwide research selecting which would be considered the funniest jokes by people. Also as an object of study there is the role of the mirror-neurones, an important finding that allows a clearer vision about primates and humans social behaviors. The possibility of the laughter to be a behaviour similar to the grooming of the primates is also raised, since both would be related to the exchange of pleasure among individuals viewing the benefit of the group. Following this line, a study is presented defining the laughter as a specific characteristic of the male gender, who would use this feature as an approach aiming at attracting a mate. There isn't a conclusive result, there is not a final word about the laughter because it is clear that in many circumstances the term ranges similar phenomena, which are not exactly the same. In the same way that there is multiple laughter, there are multiple areas that study the distinct variations of the Laugh...|$|E
