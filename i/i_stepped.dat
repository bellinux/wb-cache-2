In {{order to get a}} shot of Pam and Jim looking into the camera, Greg Daniels restaged the scene four years after [...] "Niagara" [...] had been filmed. Daniels noted, [...] "To get Jim and Pam's eye line right for the camera, <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> in as the minister [...] so they were both looking at me with the full actor-power of all the emotions {{they were supposed to be}} feeling at their own wedding, just blasting in my face.

500|$|A trilogy {{of young}} adult novels, The Whitby Witches, makes {{much of the}} town's setting and history, embellishing local traditions whilst {{incorporating}} them into the narrative. The author, Robin Jarvis, recalls [...] "The first time I visited Whitby, <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> off the train and knew I was somewhere very special. It was a grey, drizzling day but that only added to the haunting beauty and lonely atmosphere of the place. Listening to Carmina Burana on my headphones, I explored the ruined abbey on the clifftop. The place was a fantastic inspiration. In the Whitby Witches I have interwoven many of the existing local legends, such as the frightening Barguest, whilst inventing {{a few of my}} own, most notably the aufwaders." [...] Jarvis returned to Whitby for his 2016 novel, The Power of Dark, the first in The Witching Legacy series.|$|E
500|$|On October 2, detectives put Bundy in {{a lineup}} before DaRonch, who {{immediately}} {{identified him as}} [...] "Officer Roseland". Witnesses from Bountiful picked him from the same lineup as the stranger lurking about the high school auditorium. There was insufficient evidence linking him to Debra Kent (whose body was never found), but {{more than enough to}} charge him with aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault in the DaRonch case. He was freed on $15,000 bail, paid by his parents, and spent most of the time between indictment and trial in Seattle, living in Kloepfer's house. Seattle police had insufficient evidence to charge him in the Pacific Northwest murders, but kept him under close surveillance. [...] "When Ted and <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> out on the porch to go somewhere," [...] Kloepfer wrote, [...] "so many unmarked police cars started up that it sounded like the beginning of the Indy 500." ...|$|E

As soon as he arrived at EKU, he became close with the school. Oppong said, [...] "From the first day, I was accepted, as soon as <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> on campus. I was here in the summertime and there were a few guys here who I knew and as soon as we came in August, I felt like I was part of the family." [...] Head coach Jeff Neubauer commented on him, [...] "We think Papa Oppong will be a tough match-up for our opponents because he is a shooter, rebounder and slasher." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 11 October 2004, Blasko {{released}} her debut studio album, The Overture & the Underscore, {{which had been}} recorded in Hollywood at the studio of engineer Wally Gagel {{during the first half}} of the year. She co-produced the album with Gagel and fellow songwriter Robert F. Cranny. Gagel engineered and mixed the album, with assistance from Bruce MacFarlane. Joey Waronker (Beck, Atoms for Peace) played drums and percussion on all songs, while Cranny played various instruments on the album. Blasko recalled: [...] "I stayed in a backpackers hostel right near Hollywood Boulevard and worked on the album six days a week for two months ... I really wanted there to be something pretty classic about it. I was honestly surprised by what a 'complete' record it sounded to me when <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> away from it".|$|E
2500|$|For a {{long time}} before it was formalised, it had been known by doctors and {{midwives}} that mouth to mouth resuscitation could be useful in bringing a lifeless newborn around. In 1946, during the middle of a polio outbreak, an anesthesiologist, James Elam, applied this principle to an older child in an emergency situation. Elam described the event in his own words as [...] "I was browsing around to get acquainted with the ward when along the corridor came a gurney racing - a nurse pulling it and two orderlies pushing it, and the kid on it was blue. [...] I went into total reflex behaviour. [...] <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> {{out in the middle of}} the corridor, stopped the gurney, grabbed the sheet, wiped the copious mucous off his mouth and face, … sealed my lips around his nose and inflated his lungs. [...] In four breaths he was pink." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} Wilson's {{increasingly}} fragile mental state, the group tensions, and his signing to Warner Bros., Parks's involvement in Smile effectively ceased on April 14, 1967, {{when he left}} to begin work on his solo career. Giving his reasons, he said, [...] "I {{walked away from the}} situation as soon as I realized that I was causing friction between him and his other group members, and I didn't want to be the person to do that. I thought that was Brian's responsibility to bring definition to his own life. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> in, perhaps, I 'took a leap before I looked'. I don't know, but that's the way I feel about it.…As soon as I found out I was entering an eat or be eaten situation... I was raised differently. I didn't {{want to be part of}} that game." [...] Recording sessions ground to a halt soon after, as Wilson became increasingly withdrawn, and the album was shelved a few months later.|$|E

2500|$|In France, Bunin found himself, for {{the first}} time, {{at the center of}} public attention. On 10 November 1933, the Paris {{newspapers}} came out with huge headlines: [...] "Bunin— the Nobel Prize laureate" [...] giving the whole of the Russian community in France cause for celebration. [...] "You see, up until then we, émigrés, felt like we were at the bottom there. Then all of a sudden our writer received an internationally acclaimed prize! And not for some political scribblings, but for real prose! After having been asked to write a first page column for the Paris Revival newspaper, <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> {{out in the middle of}} the night onto the Place d'Italie and toured the local bistros on my way home, drinking in each and every one of them to the health of Ivan Bunin!"

2500|$|After {{the series}} Medical Center ended, Everett became {{frustrated}} when no movie roles were forthcoming and television roles were not working out. A long-time social drinker, he began drinking heavily. He was consuming {{a quart of}} vodka a day {{by the time he}} quit drinking in 1986. [...] "I was a functional alcoholic." [...] Shelby noted his alcohol-related mood swings and has said, [...] "finally I confronted him. I came into the bedroom with a big pot of coffee one morning and said 'we have a major problem to deal with here.'" [...] A month later, Everett caught sight of himself on a video and did not like what he saw. [...] " [...] 'Finally,' I said, 'I am really in trouble'. <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> outside and I looked up and said, 'Father, you take it. I can't handle it anymore.'" [...] The next day, he told his daughters (who were living at home at the time), [...] "I am addicted to alcohol, and I am not going away to detox. I am going to do it here so that you can see what happens to someone if you let a substance take control of you." [...] He attended his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting the next day and claimed he never drank again, attributing his discipline to his Christian faith and his self-pride.|$|E
2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E
