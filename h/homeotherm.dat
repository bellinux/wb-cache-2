An endothermic (warm-blooded) animal should maintain a very similar body temperature throughout its entire body (which is called homeothermy) and therefore there should be little variation in the oxygen-isotope ratio when measured in different bones. Alternatively, the oxygen-isotope ratio differs considerably when measured throughout the body of an organism with an ectothermic (cold-blooded) physiology. Oxygen-isotope ratios calculated for Hypacrosaurus suggesting that the ratios varied little, indicating that Hypacrosaurus was a <b>homeotherm,</b> and likely was endothermic.

50|$|<b>Homeotherms</b> are not {{necessarily}} endothermic. Some <b>homeotherms</b> may maintain constant body temperatures through behavioral mechanisms alone, i.e., behavioral thermoregulation. Many reptiles use this strategy. For example, desert lizards are remarkable in that they maintain near-constant activity temperatures that are often within a degree or two of their lethal critical temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Humans are <b>homeotherms.</b> The {{essential}} {{organs of}} <b>homeotherms</b> {{must be kept}} at a constant temperature. This means that heat production and heat loss must be in balance. When the body loses more heat than it produces, the temperature will drop below the set point of 37 °C. In mild hypothermia the core temperature is between 35 and 32 °C, in moderate hypothermia the core temperature is between 32 and 28 °C and in severe hypothermia the core temperature is below 28 °C...|$|R
50|$|Maintaining {{homeostasis}} through internal regulatory mechanisms {{is directly}} affected by habitat variation. The common raven {{is considered to be}} a <b>homeotherm,</b> an endotherm, and a regulator, so it is required to adjust its internal physiological state in response to environmental changes. Food habitats influence the metabolic rate of the Common Raven. Since common ravens are omnivores, metabolic rates must fluctuate according to the type of food consumed. According to one study, species that consume only fruit possess lower metabolisms compared to species that ate both fruit and insect material. The high metabolic rate of the common raven is partially due to the diversity of its diet.|$|E
5000|$|Bernardi {{and colleagues}} first {{uncovered}} the compositional non-uniformity within vertebrate genomes using thermal melting and density gradientcentrifugation.

5000|$|A {{poikilotherm}} (...) is {{an animal}} whose internal temperature varies considerably. It {{is the opposite}} of a <b>homeotherm,</b> an animal which maintains thermal homeostasis. While the term in principle can apply to all organisms, it is usually only applied to animals, and mostly to vertebrates. Usually the variation is a consequence of variation in the ambient environmental temperature. Many terrestrial ectotherms are poikilothermic. However some ectotherms remain in temperature-constant environments {{to the point that they}} are actually able to maintain a constant internal temperature (i.e. are homeothermic). It is this distinction that often makes the term [...] "poikilotherm" [...] more useful than the vernacular [...] "cold-blooded", which is sometimes used to refer to ectotherms more generally.|$|E
5000|$|Poikilotherm animals {{must be able}} to {{function}} over a wider range of temperatures than <b>homeotherms.</b> The speed of most chemical reactions vary with temperature, and in order {{to function}} poikilotherms may have four to ten enzyme systems that operate at different temperatures for an important chemical reaction. As a result, poikilotherms often have larger, more complex genomes than <b>homeotherms</b> in the same ecological niche. Frogs are a notable example of this effect, though their complex development is also an important factor in their large genome.|$|R

While <b>homeotherms</b> have a thermal-neutral zone (TNZ) in which no extra metabolic energy is spent on the regulation of body temperature, amphibians have a zone in which their metabolic processes are at their optimum (Navas, Gomes, Carvalho. 2007). Expenditure of extra metabolic energy in amphibians when body temperature reaches a lower limit occurs only to prevent a reduction in metabolic rate caused by these lower temperatures (Navas et al., 2007).|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. The episodic, or intermittent, {{breathing}} {{of frogs}} and many ecto-thermic vertebrates results in important fluctuations of arterial blood gases. This pattern of breathing {{differs from the}} rhythmic and continuous alterna-tion of inspiration observed in most <b>homeotherms,</b> which maintain O 2 and CO 2 levels within narrow ranges. These differences in pattern of breathing indicate that the respiratory control systems of ectotherms and <b>homeotherms</b> differ substantially. The results of recent studies using in vitro brainstem-spinal cord preparations of adult frogs and premetamorphic tadpoles {Rana catesbeiana and Rana pipiens) demonstrate, however, that the mechanisms for rhythm generation and pattern formation described previously for mammals are also key features of the respiratory control system of frogs.

40|$|There is renewed {{focus on}} the {{ecological}} determinants of animal metabolism and recent comparative analyses support the physiological expectation that the field metabolic rate (FMR) of <b>homeotherms</b> should increase with declining ambient temperature. However, sustained elevation of FMR during prolonged, seasonal cold could be prevented by intrinsic limits constraining FMR to some multiple of basal metabolic rate (BMR) or extrinsic limits on resource abundance. We analysed previous measures of mammalian FMR and BMR to establish the effect of ambient temperature on both traits and found no support for intrinsic limitation. We also measured the FMR of a northern population of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) exposed to ambient temperatures much colder than all but one previous study of mammal FMR.

For bats, force contraction remains relatively constant over the entire test range of temperatures. 2. Twitch duration increased for all species of animals tested, but for bats, the magnitude of duration was greater as temperatures were reduced. 3.
