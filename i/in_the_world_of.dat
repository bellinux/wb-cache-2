5|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{reader and}} independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble {{adapting to the}} teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions to succeed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but {{he turned his back}} on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.|$|E

5|$|Heyer's {{earliest}} {{works were}} romance novels, most set before 1800. In 1935, she released Regency Buck, {{her first novel}} set in the Regency period. This bestselling novel essentially established the genre of Regency romance. Unlike other romance novels of the period, Heyer's novels used the setting as a plot device.

The books were set almost entirely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> the wealthy upper class and only occasionally mention poverty, religion, or politics.|$|E

5|$|In Canada, as {{elsewhere}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> European colonies, {{the frontier of}} European exploration and settlement tended to be a linguistically diverse and fluid place, as cultures using different languages met and interacted.

Languages like Michif, Chinook Jargon and Bungi creole tended to be highly localized and were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language. Plains Sign Talk, which functioned originally as a trade language used to communicate internationally and across linguistic borders, reached across Canada, the United States and into Mexico.|$|E
