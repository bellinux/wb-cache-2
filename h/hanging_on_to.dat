5|$|Later, Alan and Joanna are {{stopped by}} a {{policeman}} on suspicion of stealing the campervan. Joanna gets her peanut-butter sandwich and smears it in the policeman's face. Alan and Joanna have an argument about the minute odds of the policeman having a peanut allergy and going into anaphylaxis, while in the background this is actually happening. They then carry {{the body of the}} policeman into the van. Soon, having run out of food and petrol, Alan changes the engine to run on alcohol and fermented excrement. The plan is of no use however, as the van explodes. They soon reach the beach and Joanna gives Alan three options: Give themselves up, swim the Channel to Spain or commit suicide. As Alan is not keen on the Spanish, they choose the third option and they are last seen walking naked into the sea, presumably to their deaths - although the alternate ending shows them <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a buoy sometime later.|$|E
5|$|Brains pilots {{the plane}} {{onto the top}} deck but is confronted by Foster and his two {{surviving}} associates. Holding Penelope hostage in the cockpit, Foster intends to abandon the others, but Alan shoots and kills Foster. The Tiger Moth lifts off again with all <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> either the wings or undercarriage, just before Skyship One crashes {{to the ground and}} obliterates the evacuated missile base in a chain reaction. A shootout on board the Tiger Moth disposes of the last of the White Ghost agents, but a bullet has penetrated the fuel tank and the controls will not respond to Penelope. After narrow misses with a bridge on the unfinished M104 motorway and an exhaust tower, Alan and Penelope finally manage to ditch the plane into a field with Tin-Tin and Brains unhurt, however they then realise that no-one has seen Parker since Alan shot Foster, leading them to believe he never made it off Skyship One, but a distant voice reveals that he was caught up in a tree the plane crashed through. Back on Tracy Island, Brains unveils Thunderbird 6 as none other than the repaired, repainted and revamped Tiger Moth, which all agree has proven its value as a rescue aircraft.|$|E
25|$|After {{beginning}} his season with some solid placings {{in a couple}} of Italian one-day races, Sagan really got his season going at the Giro di Sardegna. He won three of the five stages in the race, and won both the overall and the points classification, narrowly <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> beat José Serpa by three seconds in the general classification.|$|E

25|$|The Culavamsa dedicates much of chapter LXXVII to a {{description}} of the ensuing war between Lankapura and Kulasekhara, who apparently fought on with assistance from the Cheras. The Lankan effort was so successful that Parākramabāhu appears to have established a near-permanent authority over Pandya Nadu (the chapter is entitled Conquest of the Pandya Kingdom), even establishing a city called Panduvijaya in commemoration of the conquest. However the account ends abruptly. No mention is made of Lankapura's return to Sri Lanka, nor of whether Virapandu III succeeded on <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> power.|$|E
25|$|Wilson survived {{as leader}} of the Labour party in opposition. In the summer of 1973, holidaying on the Isles of Scilly, he tried to board a motor boat from a dinghy and stepped into the sea. He was unable to get into the boat and was left in the cold water, <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the fenders of the motor boat. He was close to death before he was saved by passers by. The {{incident}} was taken up by the press and resulted in some embarrassment for Wilson; his press secretary, Joe Haines, tried to deflect some of the comment by blaming Wilson's dog for the problem.|$|E
25|$|With all {{survivors}} {{floating on}} the water with no life vests, co-pilot Carlton suddenly noticed that a Mrs Thorburn was <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a raft still in its case. Fearing the bright yellow rubber raft might {{attract the attention of}} PLAAF fighters, it took Carlton twenty minutes to finally inflate the rubber dinghy and lift all nine passengers in. Once all were on the dinghy, concern remained that the attacking planes might return; some of the dazed, injured passengers, with their clothes in shreds, hid under a plastic sunshade covering the edges of the dinghy. Although Blown and passenger Peter Thacher kept watch, the attacking planes never returned.|$|E

25|$|Moores second {{series in}} charge saw him {{come up against}} India. For the Tests, Moores called up Chris Tremlett and handed him his debut in the First Test. England came close to winning the match but fell one wicket short of a convincing victory, with India <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> post 282/9 {{on the final day}} after England took a big lead in to the second innings {{following}} a hundred from Kevin Pietersen. Had {{it not been for the}} rain delaying play on day five, England would have almost certainly won the match. This was seen as further improvements being heralded under the regime of Moores.|$|E
25|$|Ellsworth {{accompanied}} Morgan on his unauthorized great raid into Indiana and Ohio in 1863, but {{he escaped}} capture by swimming across the Ohio River with his portable telegraph, <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a mule, at the Battle of Buffington Island. After Morgan made his escape from a Yankee prison, Ellsworth accompanied {{him on his}} last Kentucky Raid in 1864. Morgan was killed, and Ellsworth himself was captured at Cynthiana, Kentucky, but he soon managed to escape {{and made his way}} to Canada. Confederate secret agent Thomas Hines met him there, and he enlisted Ellsworth's help in an unsuccessful attempt to free Confederate POWs in the North.|$|E
25|$|The French cycling union, the Union Vélocipédique Française, {{heard from}} dozens of {{competitors}} and witnesses and in December disqualified all the stage winners and the first four finishers: Garin, Pothier, César Garin, and Hippolyte Aucouturier. The UVF did not say precisely {{what had happened and}} the details were lost when Tour archives were transported south in 1940 to avoid the German invasion and never seen again. Stories spread of riders spreading tacks on the road to delay rivals with punctures, of riders being poisoned by each other or by rival fans. Lucien Petit-Breton said he complained to an official that he had seen a rival <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a motorcycle, only to have the cheating rider pull out a revolver.|$|E

60|$|I was dazed for a moment, and afore I {{could do}} {{anything}} Kumbo woke up and missed Rupert.

25|$|At 1:40pm on 15 November 1940 {{the sirens}} were sounded in Margate {{to alert the}} town of an air-raid. The lifeboat-men of Lord Southborough were mustered and were in the Margate {{boathouse}}. From the boathouse the men watched as the Royal Naval Tug HMS Guardsman exploded after she hit a mine off North Foreland headland. The lifeboat was immediately launched {{to go to the}} aid of the tug. By the time the lifeboat arrived at the scene, the tug had sunk, but the Lord Southborough was able to save the lives of seven of the crew of ten who they found <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> pieces of the wreckage that were still afloat. The lifeboat reported that {{there was no sign of}} the other two crewmen and it was assumed that they must have gone down with the tug.|$|E
25|$|The Boxer is a medium-sized, {{short-haired}} {{breed of}} dog, developed in Germany. The coat {{is smooth and}} tight-fitting; colours are fawn or brindled, with or without white markings, and white. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The purpose of the crossbreeding was the wish to eliminate the excessive white color of the breed, {{and the necessity of}} producing thousands of dogs {{for one of the most}} popular breeds in the world. The Boxer is part of the Molosser group. This group is a category of solidly built, large dog breeds that all descend from the same common ancestor, the large shepherd dog known as a Molossus. The Boxer is a member of the Working Group.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine Empire {{entered into}} {{a new era of}} decay in 1341. The Empire was ravaged by every {{possible}} disaster — alongside wars and civil wars, renewed epidemics of bubonic plague swept through its diminished lands. The first outbreak occurred in 1347, and between the 1360s and 1420s, eight further outbreaks of plague are recorded. Cities were full of social unrest between the corrupt wealthy (who had been exploiting the tax system for their own benefit) and the countless landless peasants burdened by the demands of the government. Religious controversy, the cancer of Byzantium in the 7th and 8th centuries, once again emerged {{in the form of the}} Hesychasm controversy, which eventually became a doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox church. There were numerous earthquakes, destroying Byzantium's infrastructure — the fortress of Gallipoli was destroyed in 1354 by such an earthquake and the Ottoman Turks lost no time in taking it and establishing a bridgehead in Europe. Meanwhile, the Serbs continued pressing south, removing any nominal Imperial control in Epirus. The Empire shrunk in size and when the civil war ended, Byzantium would be a petty city state, <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> life through the respites of her foes, and soon to-be protectors.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, Mosby was unhappy, {{despite the}} electoral victory {{of his friend}} Garfield in November and his son Beverley joining him as vice-consul. His {{repeated}} requests for leave to return home and visit {{the rest of his}} family kept being denied, as were most requests for supplies or funds, and one relative was removed from the Lighthouse Board. In addition to the press and bureaucratic sniping, Mosby found his salary insufficient to support socialization among the local merchant class. Still, as the new year began, Mosby won a slander lawsuit brought against him in Hong Kong by Peter Smith, the sailors' boardinghouse keeper associated with ex-consul Bailey, reporting that he defended himself to the applause of jury and spectators, as well as laughter of the distinguished judge. By the time Mosby received notice that his U.S. leave had been approved, President Garfield had been assassinated and was <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> life. Garfield died on September 20, and President Chester Arthur considered promoting Mosby to the similar post at Shangai (with higher living expenses), but Mosby wanted to either return home or remain in Hong Kong. Thus he remained in exile and dealt with the implications of the Chinese Exclusion Acts, the growing opium trade and the brewing war between France and China.|$|E
25|$|Appleby Castle {{surrendered}} to the Scots on 31 July, whereat Lambert, who was still <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the flank of the Scottish advance, fell back from Barnard Castle to Richmond so as to close Wensleydale against any attempt of the invaders to march on Pontefract. All the restless energy of Langdale's horse was unable to dislodge Lambert from the passes or {{to find out what}} was behind that impenetrable cavalry screen. The crisis was now at hand. Cromwell had received the surrender of Pembroke Castle on 11 July, and had marched off, with his men unpaid, ragged and shoeless, at full speed through the Midlands. Rains and storms delayed his march, but he knew that the Duke of Hamilton in the broken ground of Westmorland was still worse off. Shoes from Northampton and stockings from Coventry met him at Nottingham, and gathering up the local levies as he went, he made for Doncaster, where he arrived on 8 August, having gained six days in advance of the time he had allowed himself for the march. He then called up artillery from Hull, exchanged his local levies for the regulars who were besieging Pontefract, and set off to meet Lambert. On 12 August he was at Wetherby, Lambert with horse and foot at Otley, Langdale at Skipton and Gargrave, Hamilton at Lancaster, and Sir George Monro with the Scots from Ulster and the Carlisle Royalists (organized as a separate command owing to friction between Monro and the generals of the main army) at Hornby. On 13 August, while Cromwell was marching to join Lambert at Otley, the Scottish leaders were still disputing whether they should make for Pontefract or continue through Lancashire so as to join Lord Byron and the Cheshire Royalists.|$|E

Rehman claimed [...] "Why wasn't (Chopra) picked ahead of Dave Nugent? He's the top goal scorer in the Championship but he can't get in (the England set-up).
