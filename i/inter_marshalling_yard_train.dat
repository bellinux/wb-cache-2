50|$|Helena's {{schedule}} {{called for}} a summer spent in Long Beach, followed by overhaul at San Francisco. Suddenly came word of the communist aggression in Korea. Hurriedly she prepared for sea; and, on 6 July 1950, sped westward. Stopping at Pearl Harbor only to take on ammunition, she plowed across the Pacific and into action {{on the east coast}} of Korea. On 7 August, she first unleashed her guns on an enemy target—the railroad <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards,</b> <b>trains,</b> and power plant near Tanchon.|$|R
50|$|The {{junction}} {{itself was}} {{to the north of}} the station, where there were also <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards.</b> Branch <b>trains</b> to and from Burnham and Highbridge started and finished at Evercreech in latter years. To the south of the station a level crossing carried the main A371 road across the line.|$|R
50|$|Eastwards run Federal Highways B 508 towards Hilchenbach and B 517 towards Kirchhundem and Lennestadt.Parallel to the {{highways}} run the railways. From {{north to south}} runs the Ruhr-Sieg line, and east-west runs the Rothaar Railway through the Wittgensteiner Land towards Marburg. Within the municipal area are six railway stations or halts (as of 2003). The central station lies in Kreuztal (main town). Halts {{are to be found}} in Littfeld, Eichen, Ferndorf and Kredenbach. Although it serves Dahlbruch, a constituent community of Hilchenbach, this station is nonetheless within Kreuztal's municipal area. Kreuztal also has South Westphalia's only <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard,</b> and connected thereto is the region's only railway container terminal. This is found in Langenau, and beyond its national functions, it also serves regional goods transport in the Sauerland and Siegerland. To and from the Kreuztal <b>Marshalling</b> <b>Yard,</b> <b>trains</b> run, by way of the national <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> in Hagen-Vorhalle, to all destinations that can be reached by rail.|$|R
25|$|The track {{follows the}} eastern {{waterside}} from the Melide causeway to Capolago-Riva San Vitale station. Here interchange {{is made with}} the Monte Generoso railway, a rack railway to the summit of Monte Generoso. The Gotthard line then continues to Mendrisio and Chiasso. Chiasso station houses the border controls and has a large international <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard.</b> Conventional <b>trains</b> change locomotives here due to different traction voltages and train protection systems in Italy.|$|R
50|$|A Durchgangsgüterzug (abbreviation: Dg, literally: through goods train) is a {{category}} of German train that describes a goods train that runs directly to its destination with the same train formation. No shunting takes place at intermediate stations and it is usually a unit train. In addition to transporting freight between <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards,</b> these <b>trains</b> are also used to move large quantities of bulk goods on set routes (e.g. coal and ore) from ports to power stations and steelworks.|$|R
50|$|A goods <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> for up <b>trains</b> had {{developed}} at Kingmoor, north of Carlisle, and {{together with the}} traffic from the Canal lines there was intensive and congested train working at {{the northern end of}} Carlisle station complex. In 1943 quadruple track was provided from Kingmoor, where an up <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> had been established, to Port Carlisle branch junction, from where there was already quadruple track to Caldew Junction.|$|R
25|$|The {{industrial}} area opposite {{the station was}} the site of the South Devon Railway workshops, its engine shed being situated a little {{to the north of the}} station. Beyond this was established Hackney <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard,</b> where goods <b>trains</b> were—and indeed still are from time to time—reformed for the journey over the hills towards Plymouth.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} small goods yard to {{the south}} of the station was greatly extended during the First World War and was used as a <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> for munitions <b>trains</b> heading for the Continent.

50|$|Freight travels on the South Ring usually via {{the tunnel}} from Laim <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> to Heimeranplatz. <b>Trains</b> on the South Ring usually run towards Mühldorf and the Riem {{container}} depot, as this line is {{not connected to}} the Northern Ring. Some trains on the South Ring also run towards Rosenheim. This traffic usually, however, uses the Northern Ring.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{structural}} change in the region, passenger transport on the Cross-Venn Railway ended on 26 May 1963; almost exactly ten years later, on 3 June 1973, passenger traffic ended on the Dümpelfeld-Lissendorf railway to Dümpelfeld. On 1 February 1979, the Jünkerath station office was dissolved. From this point onwards, the tracks were reconstructed in the station and on the branch lines. The line to Hillesheim was closed in 1982. However, Jungkerath retained its importance as a <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> for <b>train</b> formation up to the 1990s. In 2003, the line to Losheimergraben was closed, which had been maintained for strategic reasons to link the military training camp in Elsenborn. The <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> was closed in 2004.|$|R
50|$|Its {{importance}} {{increased in}} the early 20th century {{with the construction of}} the Dümpelfeld-Lissendorf railway (Mittellere Ahrtalbahn—"Central Ahr Valley Railway") and the Cross-Venn Railway (Vennquerbahn), which branched off at the station. Jünkerath developed along with the nearby Gerolstein station into an important junction station in the Eifel. Both the freight and passenger traffic grew rapidly, which meant that Jünkerath station was constantly expanded. There were four signal boxes and a Bahnbetriebswerk (locomotive depot) on the site. It was also particularly important for its connection to Belgium. As a result, it now served as an important <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> for <b>train</b> formation.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report was to conduct a risk {{analysis}} of the confined accidents that can cause serious damage {{to people on the}} <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> in Gävle. The risks are assessed for the staff at the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> and the population in the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> environment. The <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> in Gävle is classified as a hazardous activity according to the Law (SFS 2003 : 778) of protection against accidents, because of the handling of hazardous substances in the area. On the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> <b>train</b> arrives and departs and wagons is shunted, which means that they are sorted. Eight percent of the wagons handled on the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> contains hazardous substances. The most frequent substance is flammable liquid which represents almost 80 percent of the hazardous substances. Other frequent substances on the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> included in this analysis are flammable gas, toxic gas and oxidizing substances. Managers on a hazardous activity are required to make a risk analysis of accidents that can cause serious damage to people and environment. The analysis needs to be updated every five years. The report conducts on an analysis of a number of incidents identified though a What-if analysis with help from expert staff. The risk is based on an appraisal of the incidents frequency and consequence. The calculation of the incidents frequency is based on statistics of accidents from Trafikverket and values from literature. The estimate of the consequences of ignition of flammable liquid is made after calculations of incident radiation. Simulations in a computer program have been the basis to estimate the consequences of a release of toxic gas. For the remaining incidents estimates have been made based on results from previous risk analyses and the literature study. The risk has then been evaluated, for the population in the environment based on an F/N chart with recommended criteria developed by SRV and for the staff based on a risk matrix developed by Kemikontoret. The analysis shows that unauthorized persons in the railroad on the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> are an unacceptably high risk and collision and derailment an unacceptably high risk to staff based on the selected risk criteria. Risks that is medium high to staff and populations in the environment and inadequate procedures in Trafikverket´s risk management process is also identified in the analysis. To decrease the risks in the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> a number of actions have been developed as a recommendation. Some of the recommended actions are that the perimeter protection around the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> should be improved, a review of the possibility to change the placement of the allotment is made and the signaling to one turnout are developed. The analysis shows that consequences of a collision or derailment on the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> in Gävle are lower than what has been described in the literature study. If the recommended actions are implemented and the risk is reduced is it considered that the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> in Gävle constitutes an acceptable level of risk.

50|$|In freight transport, {{the line}} is {{important}} for connecting to and from Seddin <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> and for <b>trains</b> from southern and western Germany to the east that bypass central Berlin. Because freight transport continues to bypass the inner part of the city, the reopening of the connections to West Berlin did not much change {{the importance of the}} line for freight traffic. However, the volume of freight on the railway declined compared to the situation during the existence of the German Democratic Republic.|$|R
50|$|Radyr was {{originally}} a major railway junction {{and the location}} of sidings forming a <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> for freight <b>trains</b> used in the industries in the Glamorgan valleys. It was first opened by the Taff Vale Railway in June 1863, and {{was originally}} named Penarth Junction. At one time there were four running lines through the station, up and down passenger and up and down goods on the Taff Vale main line to the valleys northwards and via Llandaff to Cardiff and the docks to the south east. Immediately south of the station, the Cardiff City line diverged southwards and reached the east side of Cardiff via Waterhall Junction, en route to the harbour at Penarth. The <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> was south of the station in the fork between the running lines. Following the down-turn in coal traffic; the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> closed (in 1993) and the sidings were greatly rationalised, becoming a permanent way depot. The platforms were also rationalised, from five to two, one up and one down.|$|R
50|$|In 1955, {{as part of}} British Railways' (BR) Modernisation Plan, it was {{proposed}} to develop the Varsity Line as a freight link from the East Coast ports to South Wales, capable of handling up to 2,400 wagons of coal class traffic and empties daily. At Swanbourne, it was planned to redevelop the sidings and land near Swanbourne station as a <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> where <b>trains</b> could be sorted into the order required for their destinations on the Southern and Western Regions. This would enable smaller goods yards in those regions to be closed, with the freight traffic concentrated at Swanbourne which, like the other proposed <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards,</b> would be equipped with the latest automation technology. Swanbourne was one of seven proposed sites on green field land, the others being Carlisle Kingmoor, Perth, Edinburgh Millerhill, Margam, Brookthorpe and Walcot. In September 1958, work started on the upgrade of the Varsity Line {{with the construction of}} a flyover at Bletchley to separate local and long distance traffic. Compulsory purchase orders were issued for the proposed site including Horwood House, then a boarding school, which was intended by BR to become a training school for the new yard.|$|R
50|$|They were {{initially}} placed in {{service in the}} yards in Cape Town, but they ended up being used mainly in <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> on the Western Transvaal System and also on the Cape Northern System, employed at Braamfontein, Millsite in Krugersdorp, Bloemfontein and Kimberley. Bloemfontein {{had one of the}} SAR’s more important <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> where goods <b>trains</b> from the north were sorted into consists bound for East London, Port Elizabeth, Mossel Bay, Cape Town and a host of Cape country towns. In its heyday, Bloemfontein’s retarder yard had 40 tracks, 24 for southbound traffic and 16 for northbound. There were two humps with two primary and five secondary retarders, the latter split into three for southbound and two for northbound traffic. The hump leads were served around the clock by Class S1 engines no. 374 and 375.|$|R
50|$|Previously München-Laim <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> (Rangierbahnhöfe) was {{along with}} Munich East <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> one of Munich’s two <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards.</b> With the {{commissioning}} {{of the new}} Munich North <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards,</b> the station’s <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> lost its purpose, as wagons were now handling at the new facility. As Deutsche Bahn required additional storage space for Intercity-Express trains, parts of the old rail yard were rebuilt and modernised. The trains enter these storage sidings via a connecting track from the Munich Hauptbahnhof depot.|$|R

40|$|This {{graduation}} thesis {{covers the}} design of medium and large <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> including the dimensioning of their working parts. Firstly, the thesis defines <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> divisioning according to function, design, shape and use of automatic equipment. It furthermore describes the workflow at half automatic and fully automatic <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards,</b> based on {{the data for the}} only Slovenian <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> in Zalog. The next section describes various <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> devices with special emphasis on shorter turnouts specific for hump yards, and different brake systems according to the yard automatic equipment. The dimensioning of different track groups of a <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> and the requirements for upper and lower track superstructure are defined as a part of spatial placement. Different track groups with their longitudinal and transverse profile features, ground plans and equations for different calculation methods are presented. The latter include the number and length of the tracks, track capacity and their utilization. Where multiple methods of calculation can be used, choosing the right one is defined. The goal of the thesis is to check the existing dimensions of Zalog <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> based on an actual capacity common for the last 12 years. For easier understanding, the role of Zalog <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> is defined within the Slovenian and European rail network. Different measures for improvements are presented based on the comparison of the existing and new <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> dimensioning data...|$|R
