Smith, {{the director}} of Princeton University Press, {{about the possibility of}} renting his printing plant to the government during a two-week summer shutdown so that Smyth could produce 5,000 copies of a top secret report. Smith’s response was that he found it hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>anyone</b> needing to print 5,000 copies of a top secret report. He found it much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems, and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with top secret material. Under the circumstances, he felt that he could not risk this.|$|E

Apart from directing the remake, Balakrishna played a dual {{role in the}} remakethose of Arjuna and Kichaka. Soundarya was signed to play Draupadi with Srihari, Sarath Babu, Uday Kiran and Asin cast in supporting roles. The remake's principal photography commenced on 1 March 2004.

500|$|Dave Gibbons {{became an}} adviser on Snyder's film, but Moore {{has refused to}} have his name {{attached}} to any film adaptations of his work. Moore has stated he {{has no interest in}} seeing Snyder's adaptation; he told Entertainment Weekly in 2008 that [...] "here are things that we did with Watchmen that could only work in a comic, and were indeed designed to show off things that other media can't". While Moore believes that David Hayter's screenplay was [...] "as close as I could <b>imagine</b> <b>anyone</b> getting to Watchmen", he asserted he did not intend to see the film if it were made.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, Narasimha Reddy {{said that}} Rama Rao and Bhanumathi [...] "made a cute {{on-screen}} pair", adding that one cannot <b>imagine</b> <b>anyone</b> else as Nagaraju and Malleswari. T. G. Kamala Devi, {{who played the}} role of Malliswari in Buchibabu's radio play, was cast as Jalaja, Malliswari's maid in the film. Pasumarthi Krishnamurthy choreographed the songs. Narasimha Reddy incorporated a few of his childhood incidents in the film, and according to Bhanumathi, the pranks between Malliswari and Nagaraju and the sequence before the song [...] "Kothi Bavaku Pellanta" [...] were inspired by his childhood experiences. Apart from designing the sets, Shekhar took care of the artists' hair and costumes. He also recreated the shores of the Tungabhadra River on a floor a Vauhini Studios building in Madras for the song [...] "Manasuna Mallela". The production phase of Malliswari lasted two years.|$|E

He found the inspiration to compose the song from his experiences with an unidentified woman; speaking to Billboard, he explained: [...] "I {{was involved with}} this really, really wonderful woman, and I loved her very much. But I knew deep in my heart of hearts that we had no business being romantically involved. So, it's sort of about being {{in love with someone}} but knowing you shouldn't be with them." [...] Moby initially disliked the track, criticizing his production as [...] "mushy" [...] and his vocals as [...] "really weak". He had dismissed [...] "Porcelain" [...] as [...] "average" [...] and later recalled that he [...] "couldn't <b>imagine</b> <b>anyone</b> else wanting to listen to it" [...] – however, he was eventually talked into including it on Play.|$|E

500|$|... "Gone for Goode" [...] {{was seen}} by 18.24million viewers. It earned an 18 rating, which {{represents}} the percentage of television-equipped homes, and a 31 share, which represents percentage of sets in use. This marked the best ratings performance of a preview or premiere following a Super Bowl since The Wonder Years in 1988. It was also the largest viewership of the first season, in large part due to its 10:25p.m. time-slot immediately following the Super Bowl. Nevertheless, NBC considered it a disappointing performance, based {{on the amount of}} advertising and press coverage the episode received. [...] The episode received less than half the audience that the Super Bowl itself did. Levinson later said the Super Bowl crowd might not have been perfectly suited to Homicide: Life on the Street. In particular, regarding the episode's complex story lines and distinctive visual style, he said, [...] "I <b>imagine</b> <b>anyone</b> who has been drinking a lot at a Super Bowl party might have trouble following the show." ...|$|E
500|$|The casting, mainly Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe, {{is often}} cited {{as one of the}} film's high points. Eric Harrison, of the Houston Chronicle, was {{initially}} skeptical of the casting of Maguire, but, after seeing the film, he stated, [...] "within seconds, however, it becomes hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>anyone</b> else in the role." [...] USA Today critic Mike Clark believed the casting rivaled that of Christopher Reeve as 1978's Superman. Owen Gleiberman, of Entertainment Weekly, had mixed feelings about the casting, particularly Tobey Maguire. [...] "Maguire, winning as he is, never quite gets the chance to bring the two sides of Spidey– the boy and the man, the romantic and the avenger– together." [...] The Hollywood Reporters Kirk Honeycutt thought, [...] "the filmmakers' imaginations work in overdrive from the clever design of the cobwebby opening credits and Spider-Man and M.J.'s upside down kiss– after one of his many rescues of her– to a finale that leaves character relationships open ended for future adventures." ...|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{critics also}} praised Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfus's {{performances}} in the film. Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that Gandolfini brought [...] "superb sensitivity and naked vulnerability" [...] to his portrayal of Albert, while Indiewire's Eric Kohn felt that Gandolfini [...] "truly blossoms" [...] in the film. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern similarly described Gandolfini's performance as [...] "marvelous" [...] and [...] "grounded in genial humanity", and found Louis-Dreyfus to be [...] "equally endearing". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe wrote that Gandolfini gave [...] "a performance of immense tenderness and charm", [...] "as endearing as it is heartbreaking", and said of Louis-Dreyfus, [...] "Holofcener brings out a vulnerability you may have forgotten was in this actress." [...] Slate magazine's Dana Stevens, meanwhile, wrote that [...] "There's no one making films right now who writes that kind of dialogue better than Holofcener ...

[...] Dale Allison writes: [...] "A profoundly depressing meditation on despair and suicide … One has trouble <b>imagining</b> <b>anyone</b> enjoying it." [...] Elliot Huntley considers the problem to be the musical arrangement rather than the composition itself, and laments how the Moog and ARP synthesizers [...] "seem to soak the song". Writing for the music website Something Else!, Nick DeRiso opines that, with Extra Texture, Harrison [...] "couldn't have strayed further from his religious moorings – or from the free-spirited uplift that made his initial post-Beatles projects such pleasant surprises", and he dismisses [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies" [...] as [...] "one of [...] most wrist-slashingly awful songs".|$|R
500|$|While Polygon Danielle Riendeau {{praised the}} puzzle design, other critics noted {{its lack of}} {{difficulty}} and short length. Riendeau wrote that the puzzles solutions always felt intuitive and never felt frustrating. She found [...] "everything" [...] about the game to be [...] "soothing, almost hypnotic". Edge thought that the game did not present a [...] "genuine" [...] challenge, and that the puzzles did not [...] "find fresh ways to confound and delight" [...] until the final levels. The magazine compared the game to [...] "assembling flat-pack furniture": straightforward in its process, but rewarding in its transformation. Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer wrote that the game was [...] "almost breathtakingly unique". Riendeau said she finished the game in under three hours, and TouchArcade Shaun Musgrave, who could not [...] "even begin to <b>imagine</b> <b>anyone</b> getting stuck on ... the puzzles", put the game's length at [...] "an hour and change". Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer wanted more content. He was also unsatisfied with the game's narrative, which he found [...] "obtuse" [...] and [...] "vague" [...] to a fault. Musgrave of TouchArcade thought that while games that focus on experiences can be shorter, Monument Valley {{did not last long}} enough [...] "for the mechanics to reach their full potential", though the time was [...] "just about right" [...] for the story.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The Guardian called it [...] "the kind of ambitious avant-pop hybrid that gets Björk rapturous acclaim". AllMusic wrote that [...] "Murphy keeps the alluring sensuality and unpredictable quirks that made Moloko unique, without sounding like she's rehashing where she's already been". Stylus Magazine said the album [...] "happily represents {{something of a}} midpoint between the downright oddity of Moloko's early albums...and the mix of disco sensibility and wrenching balladry of their swansong". PopMatters referred to the album as [...] "one {{of the best examples}} of production shaping but not overwhelming the artist's vision". The Guardian agreed, stating that because of Herbert's production, Murphy sounded [...] "sonically enticing and varied…at times sultry, rude, powerful and tender across white noise, waltz time signatures and jazz sass" [...] but was mixed on the album overall, adding that the pair [...] "their noodling eclipse the songs, leaving few you'll actually be able to sing back to anyone". Pitchfork Media remarked that [...] "it's hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>anyone</b> not ranking this is the best thing Murphy has ever done" [...] and that [...] "when the songwriting is on, Ruby Blue seems perfect, the ultimate combination of human warmth and technological know-how". The publication listed the album at number forty-one in its list of the top fifty albums of 2005.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Kolan of IGN Australia awarded it {{a perfect}} 10/10 and said, [...] "It's the Watchmen film you {{always wanted to}} see, but never {{expected}} to get." [...] Also praising the film along with another perfect score (4/4) was Kyle Smith of the New York Post, comparing it to some of Stanley Kubrick's films: [...] "Director Zack Snyder's cerebral, scintillating follow-up to 300 seems, to even a weary filmgoer's eye, as fresh and magnificent in sound and vision as [...]" [...] Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "It's a compelling visceral film—sound, images and characters combined into a decidedly odd visual experience that evokes {{the feel of a}} graphic novel." [...] Richard Corliss of Time concluded [...] "this ambitious picture is a thing of bits and pieces," [...] yet [...] "the bits are glorious, the pieces magnificent." [...] Total Film awarded it 4/5 stars, stating: [...] "It's hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>anyone</b> watching the Watchmen as faithfully as Zack Snyder's heartfelt, stylised adap. Uncompromising, uncommercial, and unique." [...] When comparing the film to the original source material, Ian Nathan of Empire felt that while [...] "it isn't the graphic novel... Zack Snyder clearly gives a toss, creating a smart, stylish, decent adaptation." [...] Nick Dent of Time Out Sydney gave the film 4/6 in his review of February 25, praising the film's inventiveness but concluding, [...] "While Watchmen is still as rich, daring, and intelligent an action film as there's ever been, it also proves Moore absolutely right [...] As a comic book, Watchmen is an extraordinary thing. As a movie, it's just another movie, awash with sound and fury." ...|$|E

500|$|Pfeiffer {{maintains}} {{that she has}} never received any formal acting training. Instead, she credits director Milton Katselas with teaching her the difference between how an actor initially thinks a character would behave during a particular scene, and how the actor themself would behave during that same scene. Vulture.com's Angelica Jade Bastién identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an actress of such depth, breadth, and tenacity, she obliterates the argument that an untrained actor has less capability than her trained counterparts." [...] In 1992, Rolling Stone Gerri Hirshey identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an accomplished character actress" [...] who is comfortable wearing costumes that are unflattering in the traditional Hollywood sense, The Fabulous Baker Boys Susie Diamond – her most critically acclaimed role to-date – being a notable exception at the time. Pfeiffer explained that she rarely accepts glamorous roles because she finds few of them interesting, opting to play characters that [...] "move" [...] her instead: [...] "I know that if I can hear the character as I'm reading, it's made some connection [...]" [...] A film critic once summarized the actress as [...] "a character actress in a screen siren's body", a sentiment with which her Scarface co-star and friend Al Pacino agrees. Pfeiffer is often commended for her ability to disguise her true feelings and emotions, a technique she frequently uses to her advantage in period films; playing roles in period costume {{has become something of}} a trademark of hers. Pfeiffer herself has admitted to being skilled in this particular area but at the same time believes that hiding one's true feelings is not uncommon, speculating, [...] "that's how most people behave. We may not be as mannered or as proper as people were in the 19th century, but very rarely are we talking about what we're really thinking." [...] Pfeiffer has called acting a [...] "sadomasochistic" [...] profession due to how [...] "brutal" [...] the process can be at times. She is often praised for her acting abilities by various directors with whom she has collaborated over the years. Director Martin Scorsese described Pfeiffer, who he directed in the period drama The Age of Innocence (1993), as [...] "an actress who could portray inner conflict with her eyes and face better than any other film star of her generation." [...] Jonathan Demme (Married to the Mob, 1988) declared “It’s hard for me to <b>imagine</b> <b>anyone</b> who, on a level of quality, would have an edge on her." ...|$|E
