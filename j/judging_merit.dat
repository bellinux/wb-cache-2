40|$|Portfolio {{assessment}} is an increasingly common trend in educational settings. Educational institutions ranging from elementary schools to major research universities are implementing portfolios as both an instructional tool {{as well as}} a means of student and program assessment (Gelinas, A., 1998). As computer access increases and as students and teachers become more comfortable with electronic technology in their classrooms, traditional means of assessment are being moved into an electronic platform. One such example is the recent emergence of an electronic portfolio (Lankes, A. D, 1995). A portfolio is a purposeful collection of student work that exhibits to the student and/or to others the student’s efforts, progress, or achievement in a given area. This collection must include student participation in the selection of portfolio content, the criteria for selection, the criteria for <b>judging</b> <b>merit</b> and evidence of the student’s self reflection (Meyer, Schuman, & Angello, 1990). Portfolio {{assessment is}} a specific form of performance assessment or authentic assessment that attempts to measure higher level thinking skills (Miller & Legg, 1993). Portfolios differ from a simple collection o...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{methods of}} testing which still prevail in our system of {{education}} mean that {{there is very little}} time for conversational English in the tests-driven in classrooms, despite of the emergence of recent advances in language testing methodology. This paper suggests to examine and understand how and why a portfolio can be used as an alternative and authentic tool of oral assessment. We believe that through this testing technique and with the investment and commitment of the pedagogical team, {{we will be able to}} develop genuine oral communication in the learners and promote a new vision of measurement. 1 - What is a Portfolio? Portfolio assessment is increasingly used in classrooms across the world. From its origins in the arts to its evolution through writing classes to foreign language classes, portfolio assessment is becoming nowadays a powerful tool for evaluating language skills. A portfolio is a form of assessment that students do together with their teachers. According to Paulson and Meyer (1991 : 61), it is: A purposeful collection of student work that exhibits the student’s efforts, progress and achievements in one or more areas. The collection must include student participation in selecting contents, the criteria for selection, the criteria for <b>judging</b> <b>merit</b> and evidence of student self-reflection...|$|E

One indicator of a constructive evaluation is that it promotes learning and that the results are used to guide change. This paper suggests that a key to successful evaluation in NRM is in the mindset of the researcher. We discuss the contribution of four factors to a reflective learning process that is necessary in integrated NRM. They are: stakeholder participation, systems approach to evaluation, timing of the evaluation and an iterative approach to investigation...|$|R
