But intergovernmentalism has failed: since 2008 the crisis keeps getting worse. Intergovernmentalism is leading towards the EU’s disintegration.

While much of the contemporary literature has stressed the ultimate rise of intergovernmentalism, here we propose a more open reading. We describe a chaotic evolution characterised by two sets of contradictions : between <b>intergovernmental</b> and Community <b>methods</b> (with recent institutional developments based on both EU and international law), and between the leading role of national governments and a context marked by a disguised and unbalanced federalism. All this implies major risks {{for the future of}} the EU...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{advocacy}} strategies {{and influence of}} interest groups in EU foreign policy. It examines in particular the impact of institutional factors on the strategies and lobbying outcomes. Conceptually, it {{contributes to the literature}} on interest groups and lobbying in the EU and to the study of non-state actor participation in international organisations. Conceptualising EU foreign policy as multi-level and multi-pillar, the study inquires into the relationship between policy regime (ranging from the Community method to the <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>method,</b> as these predominate in different areas of EU external relations) and the degree and type of interest group influence. To this end the thesis compares three examples of EU foreign policy: visa liberalisation towards the Eastern neighbours; sanctions towards Belarus; and CSDP missions in Georgia and Palestine. The research reveals that interest groups engage in multi-level lobbying even in those policy areas that are ruled by the <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>method.</b> Intergovernmentalism limits formal access to policymakers, but groups and policymakers build channels for informal access. To some extent contrary to the predications of established theories, this allows interest groups to exert some degree of influence even on policy dossiers in which intergovernmental arrangements prevail. In such policy domains, groups opposing change do not always succeed, despite the veto opportunities that intergovernmentalism provides. While this is a significant finding, the thesis also notes how interest group influence is most commonly exerted upon relatively technical issues and at later stages of the policy cycle. Moreover, the study emphasises that institutional structures are not the only relevant factor in explaining group influence. Group-level characteristics, including material resources, condition groups’ ability to adapt to complex decision-making in EU foreign policy. The thesis concludes that a combination of factors is required to capture the influence of interest groups over EU foreign policy...|$|E

It highlights four factors that quickly made the newly-created institution both indispensable and stable, despite concerns over the excessive reliance on the <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>method</b> in European cooperation processes. These factors were the rise of globalisation in its multi-faceted policy dimensions; a satisfactory new-found institutional balance; the public impact of/societal actors’ connections with regular and frequent heads of government’s meetings; and the democratic legitimacy issue in European integration. The article further argues that this period witnessed the de facto emergence of the three-pillar Maastricht structure, and shows how the study of {{the early days of the}} EEC can shed light on the current development of the EU and the European Council after the 2009 Lisbon Treaty...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction. The Treaty on European Union, {{also known}} as the Treaty of Maastricht or the Maastricht Treaty, created the European Union (EU) from the {{existing}} European Economic Community (EEC.) It was signed by the member states on February 7, 1992, and entered into force on November 1, 1993. 1 Among its many innovations was the creation of European citizenship, which would be granted to any person who was a citizen of an EU member state. Citizenship, however, is intertwined with immigration, which the Treaty also attempted to address. Policy on visas, immigration and asylum was originally placed under Pillar 3 of the EU, which dealt with Justice and Home Affairs. In 1997, however, the Amsterdam Treaty moved these policies from Pillar 3 to Pillar 1, signaling “a shift toward more supranational decision-making in this area,” as opposed to the <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>method</b> of Pillars 2 and 3. ...|$|E
40|$|What {{level of}} policy {{convergence}} {{has been achieved}} by EU member states on immigration, borders and asylum? Although this question may sound rather theoretical, in practice it has profound consequences on the everyday life of individuals and {{the very nature of}} the EU. Common action in this field is exacerbated by the significant obstacles that negatively impact the quality of policies and the success of their implementation. Together with the tense EU struggle between the <b>intergovernmental</b> and community <b>method</b> of governing, these factors are detrimental to an EU-wide policy for promoting freedom, justice and stability in an enlarging Union. In response, authors Thierry Balzacq and Sergio Carrera undertake a critical analysis of the most recent policy developments in this politically sensitive domain. They investigate persistent barriers to harmonisation and suggest how the EU may achieve policy optimalisation. Their work progressively develops a set of recommendations, aimed at overcoming current vulnerabilities in policy approximation and achieving the most appropriate action to ensure equal treatment and social cohesion in the EU...|$|R
40|$|The current paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} deciding {{the question of whether}} any given stage in the budget process {{is an example of the}} "political" or the "bureaucratic" model. We then use it to study local government spending on education. The basis for our method is the important difference between the effect of intergovernmental aid that is implied by the political budget model and by the bureaucratic budget model. According to the bureaucratic model, the effect of inter-governmental aid on each category of educational input (e. g., teachers' salaries, books, etc.) depends only on the change in total educational spending induced by the aid and not on the type of aid that causes the change in spending. In contrast, the political budget model implies that the overall expenditure increase is the result of separate decisions on each of the expenditure categories and that the changes in these expenditure categories will depend on the form of the <b>intergovernmental</b> aid. Our <b>method</b> of exploiting this difference is presented in detail below. ...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION I {{was asked}} to make some remarks about the concept of‘consultation’ in the {{proposal}} for Indigenous constitutional recognition put forward by the Cape York Institute (‘CPI’). My understanding of what presently is proposed is taken from the two submissions by the CPI to the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples (‘Joint Committee’) 1 and from Anne Twomey’s very helpful piece in The Conversation, translating these proposals into constitutional form. The essential elements, as I understand them, are these: 	 	An Indigenous body would be required by the Constitution, with its composition, roles, powers and procedures provided in legislation. 	 	 	The body would provide ‘advice’ to the Commonwealth Parliament and government on what are described as ‘matters relating’ to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. 	 	 	The advice {{would be required to}} be tabled in the Parliament as soon as practicable, by the Prime Minister or the Speaker (in principle, I prefer the latter). 	 	 	Both Houses would be required to ‘give consideration’ to the advice in debating proposed laws with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. 	 	 	The ‘advice’ would not be binding and the provisions would be drafted so as to be non-justiciable (although without expressly  saying so). 	 	 	The Indigenous body could be proactive as well as reactive, in the sense of offering advice on any matters as it considered fit. 	 	 	This new provision would be added to the Constitution in a new Chapter IA, immediately following the chapter on the Parliament and preceding the chapter on the Executive. 	 OBSERVATIONS In my view, this is a helpful and constructive proposal, offering a new and quite different approach to constitutional recognition, which has some potential to be both effective and broadly acceptable.

40|$|The {{abolition}} of the ‘third pillar’ of the European Union has apparently reinforced the ‘Community method’ in the external dimension of the Area of Freedom Security and Justice (AFSJ). However, the objectives of this Area are pursued through several activities, characterised by different procedures and actors. This contribution intends {{to demonstrate that the}} creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS) can enhance the coherence of the external dimension of the AFSJ, because the Service is tasked with the coordination of the entire external action. It is submitted that the EEAS can foster the effectiveness of the law-making and policy implementation phases and it can ensure the unity of the EU’s diplomatic representation. The potential of the EEAS is particularly evident with respect to security, because the Service can effectively coordinate the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and non-CFSP aspects of the EU’s security management. However, the EEAS is largely influenced by the <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>method,</b> and its involvement in non-CFSP initiatives may perpetuate the intergovernmental approach to the external dimension of the AFSJ...|$|E
40|$|The EBU {{represents}} a clear investment in administrative integration with clear {{implications for the}} constitutional features of the EU. This paper aims to give {{an analysis of the}} administrative arrangements, through which the functions of supervision and resolution are affecting the single financial market. This case study is very interesting because these functions represent a genuine novelty in the history of financial integration since they are pre-ordained to a specific public interest: financial stability. Particularly, they cause a shift in the decision gradient from the technical to the political, as market integrity is less and less the key interest compared to financial stability. However, this wider discretionary power is not adequately counteracted by checks and balances in favour of accountability. As a result, the EBU makes a new contribution to the well-known ‘fragmentation of the executive power’ of the EU by introducing a new governance tool positioned between the Communitarian and <b>Intergovernmental</b> <b>Method,</b> but its development is still full of uncertainties given that constitutional equilibrium is far from being definitively reached...|$|E
40|$|The European External Action Service (EEAS or Service) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} and most debated innovations introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. This analysis intends to explain the anomalous design of the EEAS in light of its function, which consists in the promotion of external action coherence. Coherence is a principle of the EU legal system, which requires synergy in the external actions of the Union and its Members. It can be enforced only through the coordination of European policy-makers' initiatives, by bridging the gap between the 'Communitarian' and intergovernmental approaches. This is the 'Union method' envisaged by A. Merkel: "coordinated action in a spirit of solidarity - each of us in the area for which we are responsible but all working towards the same goal". The EEAS embodies the 'Union method', since it is institutionally linked to both Union organs and Member States. It is also capable of enhancing synergy in policy management and promoting unity in international representation, since its field of action is delimited not by an abstract concern for institutional balance but by a pragmatic assessment of the need for coordination in each sector. The challenge is now to make sure that this pragmatic approach is applied with respect to all the activities of the Service, in order to reinforce its effectiveness. The coordination brought by the EEAS is in fact the only means through which a European foreign policy can come into being: the choice is not between the Community method and the <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>method,</b> but between a coordinated position and nothing at all. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{new tool}} for the Union: the European External Action Service A new {{tool for the}} Union: the European External Action Service One of the main {{provision}} introduced by the Lisbon Treaty consists in having gathered, within the concept of external action, the activity done by the Union at international level. The European Council shall - {{on the basis of}} the principles and objectives set out in Article 21 of the TEU - identify the strategic interests and objectives of the Union. Furthermore it was decided to entrust the coordination between actions carried out with the <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>method</b> and actions which were part of the so-called EC external relations, to a single body, the High Representative for the CFSP / Vice President of Commission. For that purpose, the High Representative shall be assisted by the European External Action Service (EEAS) which, as already established in the Treaty, was set up by Council Decision. n. 427 of 26 July 2010. The EEAS is made of permanent officials drawn from the European Commission and the Secretariat General of the Council of the European Union and from national diplomats. This article deals with the legal nature of the EEAS and the doubts, nowadays still existing, concerning the attribution of its powers with regard to those of the Commission, especially in the field of development cooperation. A further problem concerns the procedure of democratic control that the European Parliament intends to exercise on the activity of the EEAS. In conclusion, an evaluation on the effectiveness of the EEAS is premature, since it has effectively entered into force only in 2011. However, in the same year it was presented a first report on this topic which demonstrated the persistence of serious problems and the search for a more proactive role in the development of the external action able to ensure its consistency.

40|$|The chapter scrutinizes {{the most}} recent {{evolutions}} of EU’s modes of governance since the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty. The focus of her study lies on {{the examination of the}} resilience of EU’s modes of governance in the light of new conceptualizations in EU studies: the new intergovernmentalism and the new supranationalism. While the first sections looks at the <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>method,</b> the second section deals with the community method and the last one with the open method of coordination (OMC) and the European Semester, which is the instrument designed {{at the onset of the}} Eurozone crisis for the coordination of macro-economic policies. The contribution shows that EU policy-making witnessed several transformations since the 1990 s and that the intensity of change has been fuelled by the Eurozone crisis, which put the decision-making process under considerable strain. In 2010, when it was unclear how to respond appropriately to the problems of the Eurozone both in terms of process and in terms of solutions, Coman argues, EU institutional actors reacted rapidly to reassure the markets and to save the euro. The decisions taken from 2010 to 2012 altered prevailing modes of governance as the crisis forced the EU to adjust the decision-making process. At the onset of the Eurozone crisis the intergovernmental methods prevailed; as soon as the crisis entered in its “slow-burning phase,” supranational institutions and actors regained power and visibility in the decision-making process. The overarching aim of Coman’s contribution is to capture incremental changes in the power relations between the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Council and the European Council and to show how they have remodelled pre-existing modes of governance. The chapter illustrates the “adaptability and resilience” of the EU policy-making in face of new challenges (cf. Pollack, Wallace and Young 2010 : 482; Schmidt and Thatcher 2013), that is the ability of EU institutions to adapt to incremental change and sudden disruptions. In doing so, it scrutinizes institutional empowerment in EU decision-making both de iure and de facto. On the one hand, EU institutional actors are granted new attributions in the formulation, decision-making and implementation of EU public policies and, on the other, they perform new functions through their dynamic interactions. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} the White Paper on European Governance in the EU legal policy {{environment}} has definitely added a brand new legitimate procedure to the complex process of European integration. This refers to the direct dialogue between the European institutions and the structures of civil society. According to the European Commission, civil society should {{play an important role}} in the development of the EU policies. Institutions and Member States should enhance their political will in order to improve consultation with the stakeholders on EU policies. To this end, the European Parliament plays a key part, given its role as representative actor of the society. The Lisbon Treaty strengthens the democratic equality among the participants in the European integration process by introducing as well the meaning of the European Citizens' Initiative. Article 11 on participatory democracy provides that, with the initiative of at least one million EU citizens, from a significant number of Member States, the Commission may be invited to submit appropriate proposals on matters were citizens considered that a legal act from the Union was necessary. Through this latest revision, the registered Union Treaty makes a new constitutional framework respectable, particularly through the establishment of multileveled governance. This institutional development suggests, on the one hand, a more practical involvement in the decision making bodies, such as the Committee of the Regions that used to have a supporting role, and on the other hand, a more practical respect for the principles, such as subsidiary, which contribute substantially to the decentralization at a community level. Initially this multileveled governance reflects the necessity of running the partnership as a focal point of the community (<b>intergovernmental)</b> <b>method</b> and the starting process of European integration. In addition, however, it contributes to the cultivation of a common public sentiment in the community governance framework, which can be expressed either through European solidarity or European citizenship, since the direct link between these processes is social and economic development. The above considerations allow the case of European citizenship to be a central issue in the creation a common European future. Citizenship is considered, not randomly, as a crucial tool for the constitution of a common political consciousness and also of a European identity that is founded on the community of rights and values, between different perceptions and interpretations of the strategies and modalities that the political actors invoke. (Fritz Scharpf : 1999, 16 επ.). Consequently, the uptake of this option indicates the true scope of a joint intention towards a bi-national based community, which does not correspond in any way to the recognition of a community population, state or even nation.
