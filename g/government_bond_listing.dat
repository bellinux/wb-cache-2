5000|$|... 12 Nov: Eurogroup and IMF will on {{the basis}} of the Troika report and the {{recently}} passed laws in the Greek parliament, consider to approve a revised bailout plan. It is rumoured the 2-year extension of the bailout plan will cost the Troika an additional €30bn. To help reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, the Troika currently consider different proposals. The idea of another haircut or debt-write-off has been rejected by the Eurogroup. Instead the Eurogroup consider to offer [...] "Prolonged maturities and lower interest rates on existing loans", and/or a [...] "debt-buy-back" [...] of the remaining privately held Greek <b>government</b> <b>bonds,</b> currently <b>listed</b> with a face value of €63bn (of which €22bn are held by local banks and social security funds), effectively reducing the debt as their current market price is only 1/4 of the face value. In case of the launch of a debt-buy-back, this would in practical terms mean that the Troika for additional bailout funds should buy all the remaining privately held bonds at a fixed offered price close to the market price; an operation that essentially will also need the acceptance of private investors to sell their Greek <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> at the offered price. If all private investors accept a debt-buy-back at 30% of the face value (being the expected average offer price according to Commerzbank), it would require the Troika to issue €18.9bn of new debt to finance the transaction, resulting in a net debt reduction for Greece at €44.1bn (equal to a debt-to-GDP ratio decline of 23%).|$|R

30|$|All the <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> indices {{in these}} 39 {{countries}} {{can be classified}} into 4 types, according to their data source. Firstly, the <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> indices in most developed markets are the EFFA <b>Government</b> <b>Bond</b> Indices, which are calculated by value weights and the liquidity consideration of Bloomberg. Their value reflects the value-weighted clean prices of most liquid <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> with the related maturity. The second type of index is the inflation-adjusted <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> index for Latin American countries. This index was chosen for Latin American countries {{because of the high}} inflation in those countries. Therefore, the inflation-adjusted <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> are more popular and liquid in Latin America. There are no EFFA <b>Government</b> <b>Bond</b> Indices for certain Southeast Asian countries or regions in the Bloomberg database. In this case, we chose the value-weighted return of the <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> and generated the clean price indices for these countries. Finally, there are no reliable <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> indices for Russia and Mainland China in the above three categories. Thus, we have taken into consideration the exposure-weighted <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> index for Russia and Zhongzhai All-value <b>Government</b> <b>Bond</b> Index for China, respectively.|$|R

30|$|From {{most of the}} {{estimated}} results from Formula (2), the short-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets are positively correlated with stock markets in the same country during non-crisis periods. Furthermore, their interdependence becomes negative {{for most of the}} 39 countries during crisis periods, which is consistent with the definition of flight to quality. Unlike the short-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets, the long-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets are negatively correlated with the stock markets. This pattern is more significant for developed markets; however, the interdependence between the stock markets and the long-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets becomes positive for most countries during crisis periods. This is noteworthy, since the Subprime Crisis and the European Debt Crisis are not only financial crises, but also economic crises. Once a depression appears, the quality of the long-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> will be more affected than the short-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> because short-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> are more liquid. The performance of the developed American market is different from most of the other regions. The short-term and the long-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets are both negatively dependent on the stock markets, since America dominates the market and its <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> are regarded as the country’s least risky financial asset, even though the U.S. was the source of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis. Therefore, some investments flow into the U.S. <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> market from the stock market as a result of risk aversion.|$|R

30|$|To begin with, the {{coefficients}} of short-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> are positive during non-crisis periods, while become significantly more negative {{during the crisis}} period for most regressions.

Even for those regressions, {{the coefficients}} of short-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> remain positive, while the coefficients of short-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> are also somewhat smaller than the related coefficients during the non-crisis period, which means the interdependence between the stock markets and the short-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets become negative or less positive during the crisis period, though they are positive during the non-crisis period. This suggests that more investments flow from the stock markets to the short-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets during a financial crisis due to the higher quality of short-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> when compared to those of stocks in the same country.|$|R

30|$|In {{comparison}} to the short-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds,</b> {{the performance of the}} long-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> relies more on the long-term economic trend of the related countries rather than the investor’s emotion.

30|$|To make {{different}} region’s markets more comparable, {{the number}} of the countries is standardized by dividing the total sample number in different regions. The flight to quality occurs from the stock markets to the long-term and short-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets in a majority of selected developed countries. However, regarding the emerging markets, in Asian countries the flight to quality only occurs between the stock markets and the long-term markets. Furthermore, in emerging European counties and a few developed European countries (i.e., Italy and Greece), regardless of whether the market is developed or emerging, the negative spillover only happens between the stock markets and the <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets. The negative spillover in Europe suggests that the investors lost their confidence in the recovery and solvency of the European countries during the Subprime Crisis and the European Debt Crisis periods. In addition, there is no flight from quality or positive spillover in these two crises. To summarize, all the negative spillovers occurred between the stock markets and the long-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets while the flight to quality emerged between the stock markets and the short-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets. For example, the remarkable flight to quality between the stock market and the long-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> market appears in the American market because the U.S. <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> is considered to be the safest asset in times of crisis. The long-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> are less liquid than the short-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds,</b> such that the flight to quality between the stock market and the short-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets is of great significance, which proves that Hypothesis 3 is true.|$|R
