40|$|Energy {{balance is}} {{relevant}} to diverse issues in ecology, physiology, and evolution. To determine whether lizards are generally in positive energy balance, we synthesized a massive data set on the proportion of individual lizards (N = 18223) with <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> (127 species), representing nine families distributed on four continents, primarily in temperate zone deserts {{but also in the}} neotropics. The average percentage of individuals with <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> is low (13. 2 %) across all species, even among desert lizards, suggesting that most lizards are in positive energy balance. Nevertheless, species vary substantially in this regard (among all species, 0 % to 66 % of individuals have <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs).</b> Several patterns are detectable among species with unusually high frequencies of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> In particular, nocturnal lizards “run on empty” more often on average than do diurnal species (24. 1 % vs. 10. 5 %); and this pattern holds even for nocturnal vs. diurnal geckos (21. 2 % vs. 7. 2 %, respectively). Several (but not all) top predators have a higher frequency of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> than do species that feed at lower trophic levels. Diet breadth and body size appear unrelated to frequency of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> Widely foraging species sometimes have a high frequency of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> relative to sit-and-wait species, but patterns vary among continents and appear to be confounded by phylogeny and trophic level. Ant-eating specialists have uniformly low frequencies of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> Diurnal termite specialists also have low frequencies of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs,</b> but nocturnal ones have high frequencies. Lizards from certain families (Gekkonidae [including Pygopodidae], Gymnophthlamidae, and Varanidae) {{are more likely to have}} <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> than are those of other families (Agamidae, Iguanidae, Lacertidae, Scincidae, and Teiidae) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the feeding {{of the dominant}} small pelagic fish—herring Clupea harengus membras and three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus—in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea) in the summers of 1999 – 2014. The share of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs,</b> stomach fullness and taxonomic composition of fish diet was analysed. On average, large herring had the highest (19 %) and small herring the lowest (6 %) share of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> Small (< 1 mm) cladoceran Bosmina spp. {{was the most important}} prey for three-spined stickleback; preying on small (< 1. 5 mm) copepod Eurytemora affinis was the most efficient for small herring, while Bosmina spp. and E. affinis were equally important for the large herring, followed by the large (mean body length < 2. 0 mm) non-indigenous cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi. The number of prey taxa per stomach exhibited significant differences between the fish groups studied; the highest mean value was recorded for small herring and the lowest for three-spined stickleback (2. 1 and 1. 4 taxa, respectively). Although present, the fish group-specific spatial dynamics in feeding parameters (share of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> and feeding intensity) were weak compared to the observed interannual variation...|$|R
40|$|Many authors {{state that}} cod (Gadus morhua) do not feed during the {{spawning}} period. However, this {{more or less}} established fact has rarely been investigated in the field. Here, the content of stomachs from Northeast Arctic cod (NEAC) and Norwegian coastal cod (NCC) sampled from the spawning ground in Lofoten were examined over a 10 -year period (1996 – 2006). The occurrence of food in the stomachs of spawning cod, stomach fullness, diet composition, and variation in these variables between NEAC and NCC, year, and sex were analysed and compared. The analysis shows that cod do feed, {{even when they are}} in a spawning state. NCC had a lower proportion of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> and the stomachs were fuller than those from NEAC. Females had a lower proportion of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> than males and their stomachs were in general fuller. Herring (Clupea harengus) dominated the diet of cod. However, cod consumption of herring on the spawning grounds seems to be a minor source of mortality on herring. Although spawning cod do feed, the proportion of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> was higher and stomach fullness was lower than in stomachs of NEAC from the Barents Sea...|$|R

50|$|Nile {{crocodiles}} are apex predators {{throughout their}} range. In the water, this species is an agile and rapid hunter relying on both movement and pressure sensors to catch any prey unfortunate enough to present itself inside {{or near the}} waterfront. Out of water, however, the Nile crocodile can only rely on its limbs, as it gallops on solid ground, to chase prey. No matter where they attack prey, this and other crocodilians take practically all of their food by ambush, needing to grab their prey {{in a matter of}} seconds in order to succeed. They have an ectothermic metabolism, so can survive for long periods between meals—though when they do eat, they can eat up to half their body weight at a time. However, for such large animals, their stomachs are relatively small, not much larger than a basketball in an average-sized adult, so as a rule they are anything but voracious eaters. Young crocodiles feed more actively than their elders according to studies in Uganda and Zambia. In general, at the smallest sizes (0.3 - 1 m), Nile crocodiles were most likely to have full stomachs (17.4% full per Cott); adults at 3 - 4 m in length were most likely to have <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> (20.2%). Interestingly, in the largest size range studied by Cott, 4 - 5 m, they were the second most likely to either have full <b>stomachs</b> (10%) or <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> (20%). Other studies have also shown a large number of adult Nile crocodiles with <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> For example, in Lake Turkana, Kenya, 48.4% of crocodiles had <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> The stomachs of brooding females are always empty, meaning that they can survive several months without food.|$|R

40|$|Our study {{investigated}} the diet of the southernmost gecko in the world, Homonota darwini. Fifty-three specimens were captured during spring and summer in four locations in Patagonia, Argentina. The stomach contents of the specimens were identified, {{and we found that}} prey consisted of six main groups: Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Homoptera and Araneae, and the adults and larvae of moth Lepidoptera. Lepidoptera was the major dietary component. The presence of ants and moths as common prey suggests an ambush feeding strategy. In spring, females consumed more ants than males although no other dietary differences between males and females were evident. We found nine geckos with <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> and six parasitized by nematodes. Presence of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> corroborates previous observations of other nocturnal geckos and non-gecko lizards. Reduced foraging success of nocturnal lizards could be due to difficulty in prey detection due to dim light, reduced or erratic activity of insect prey at night, or shorter activity times of geckos relative to diurnal success. Sex and season were not associated with the incidence of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> Principal component analysis showed that four food alternatives correlated with season. The constraint of nocturnality, coupled with low night-time temperatures restricting feeding to only a few hours after sunset, appear to have caused a generality of diet which may limit energy acquisition. We conclude that H. darwini is an arthropod generalist and likely an ambush forager, as are many other nocturnal gekkonids [Current Zoology 56 (4) : 406 – 410, 2010]...|$|R

25|$|Azithromycin is an acid-stable antibiotic, {{so it can}} {{be taken}} orally with no need of {{protection}} from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on an <b>empty</b> <b>stomach.</b> Time to peak concentration (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days.|$|E
25|$|Lactase enzymes {{similar to}} those {{produced}} in the small intestines of humans are produced industrially by fungi of the genus Aspergillus. The enzyme, β-galactosidase, is available in tablet form {{in a variety of}} doses, in many countries without a prescription.

Unfortunately, too much acid can denature it, so it should not be taken on an <b>empty</b> <b>stomach.</b> Also, the enzyme is ineffective if it does not reach the small intestine by the time the problematic food does. Lactose-sensitive individuals can experiment with both timing and dosage to fit their particular needs.|$|E

25|$|Anterograde amnesia {{can also}} be caused by alcohol intoxication, a {{phenomenon}} commonly known as a blackout. Studies show rapid rises in blood alcohol concentration over {{a short period of}} time severely impair or in some cases completely block the brain's ability to transfer short-term memories created during the period of intoxication to long-term memory for storage and later retrieval. Such rapid rises are caused by drinking large amounts of alcohol in short periods of time, especially on an <b>empty</b> <b>stomach,</b> as the dilution of alcohol by food slows the absorption of alcohol. Alcohol-related anterograde amnesia is directly related to the rate of consumption of alcohol (and is often associated with binge drinking), and not just the total amount of alcohol consumed in a drinking episode. Test subjects have been found not to experience amnesia when drinking slowly, despite being heavily intoxicated by the end of the experiment. When alcohol is consumed at a rapid rate, the point at which most healthy people's long-term memory creation starts to fail usually occurs at approximately 0.20% BAC, but can be reached as low as 0.14% BAC for inexperienced drinkers. The exact duration of these blackout periods is hard to determine, because most people fall asleep before they end. Upon reaching sobriety, usually after waking, long-term memory creation is completely restored.|$|E
