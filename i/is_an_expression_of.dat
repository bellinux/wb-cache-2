5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{measures}} the traffic volumes on its highways using a calculation called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This value <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> {{the number of}} vehicles that use a section of roadway on any average day of the year. When the department surveyed M-247 in 2009, the southernmost section near M-13 carried 6,135vehicles; the remainder carried 6,224vehicles. As a subset of these figures, 190commercial vehicles used the trunkline on average. This was an overall increase from 2008 when the sections carried 5,031and 5,573vehicles respectively, but a decrease from the 214commercial vehicles.|$|E
5|$|M-64 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state trunkline highways. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the highway. These traffic counts are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This number <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the traffic that uses a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT's surveys showed that the highest AADT along M-64 was 3,333vehicles daily on the Ontonagon River Bridge; the lowest traffic was between US2 and the Gogebic–Ontonagon county line at 418vehicles per day. The only segments of the trunkline that have been included on the National Highway System (NHS) are the US2 and M-28 concurrencies. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's defense, economy and mobility.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} politicized {{versions}} of naturalism have arisen in the Western world, most notably Marxism in the 19th century and Objectivism in the 20th century. Marxism <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> communist or socialist materialism within a naturalistic framework. Objectivism <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> capitalist idealism within a naturalistic framework. Most proponents of metaphysical naturalism in First World countries, however, are neither Marxists nor Objectivists, and instead embrace the more moderate political ideals of secular humanism or cultural moral relativism.|$|E

25|$|Although myth was {{traditionally}} {{transmitted through}} {{the oral tradition}} on a small scale, the film industry has enabled filmmakers to transmit myths to large audiences via film. In Jungian psychology myths are {{the expression of a}} culture or society’s goals, fears, ambitions and dreams. Film <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the society in which it was produced and reflects the culture of its era and location.|$|E
25|$|Chinese Garden – The Chinese Garden {{is a gift}} by Zürich's Chinese partner town Kunming, as remiscence for Zürich's {{technical}} and scientific assistance {{in the development of}} the Kunming city drinking water supply and drainage. The garden <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> one of the main themes of Chinese culture, the «Three Friends of Winter» – three plants that together brave the cold season – pine, bamboo, and plum.|$|E

25|$|Keshō, kabuki makeup, {{provides}} {{an element of}} style easily recognizable even by those unfamiliar with the art form. Rice powder is used to create the white oshiroi base for the characteristic stage makeup, and kumadori enhances or exaggerates facial lines to produce dramatic animal or supernatural masks. The color of the kumadori <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the character's nature: red lines are used to indicate passion, heroism, righteousness, and other positive traits; blue or black, villainy, jealousy, and other negative traits; green, the supernatural; and purple, nobility.|$|E
25|$|Several north-trending felsic dikes, {{composed}} {{mainly of}} feldspar and quartz-feldspar, are located {{north of the}} former Temagami garbage dump. These dikes are not known to extend across the Link Lake Deformation Zone, suggesting that they might represent the feeders of a minor volcanic vent, manifest now by felsic lava flows. Because certain lithologies can be correlated through the Link Lake Deformation Zone, {{it is unlikely that}} the lack of felsic dikes south of the former town dump area <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> displacement along the deformation zone.|$|E
25|$|While {{the theory}} of FEM can be {{presented}} in different perspectives or emphases, its development for structural analysis follows the more traditional approach via the virtual work principle or the minimum total potential energy principle. The virtual work principle approach is more general as it is applicable to both linear and non-linear material behaviours. The virtual work method <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> conservation of energy: for conservative systems, the work added to the system {{by a set of}} applied forces is equal to the energy stored in the system in the form of strain energy of the structure's components.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} expressionist use of {{monolithic}} materials was by Erich Mendelsohn at the Einstein Tower. Not {{to be missed}} was a pun on the towers namesake, Einstein, and {{an attempt to make}} the building out of one stone, Ein stein. Though not cast in one pour of concrete (due to technical difficulties, brick and stucco were used partially) the effect of the building <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the fluidity of concrete before it is cast. 'Architecture of Steel and Concrete' was the title of an 1919 exhibition of Mendelsohn's sketches at Paul Cassirer's gallery in Berlin.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} {{microscopic}} interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics, entropy {{is the amount}} of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its thermodynamic specification. Understanding the role of thermodynamic entropy in various processes requires an understanding of how and why that information changes as the system evolves from its initial to its final state. It is often said that entropy <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of our lack of information about it. The second law is now often seen as an expression of the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics through the modern definition of entropy.|$|E
25|$|Porosity (n) is a {{directly}} measurable aquifer property; it is {{a fraction}} between 0 and 1 indicating {{the amount of}} pore space between unconsolidated soil particles or within a fractured rock. Typically, the majority of groundwater (and anything dissolved in it) moves through the porosity available to flow (sometimes called effective porosity). Permeability <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the connectedness of the pores. For instance, an unfractured rock unit may have a high porosity (it has lots of holes between its constituent grains), but a low permeability (none of the pores are connected). An example of this phenomenon is pumice, which, when in its unfractured state, can make a poor aquifer.|$|E
