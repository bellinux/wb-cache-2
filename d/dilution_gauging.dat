40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> {{data from}} the San Pedro River east of Sierra Vista., Arizona {{in an attempt to}} quantify temporal and spatial fluctuations in groundwater baseflow to the stream. <b>Dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> measures volumetric discharge of a hydraulic system by determining the degree of dilution of a tracer solution input to the system. The basic equations of <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> had to be modified to acknowledge conditions of unsteady flow and unsteady tracer flux by adding consideration of traveltime. The resulting hydrographs indicated that during wintertime conditions, the stream did not derive a great deal of its flow from the groundwater system. As the summer progressed and vegetative activity increased, the relative amount of discharge originating from the subsurface increased and the stream became more responsive to stresses from vegetative transipiration. This project was part of the Semi-Arid Surface- Land-Atmosphere (SALSA) program, a multidisciplinary effort to better understand the hydrology and ecology of semi-arid basins. This research was part of the 1997 SALSA research focus on riparian systems...|$|E
40|$|A study {{reach in}} a {{mountain}} stream highly influenced by groundwater was selected to test common data collection strategies used to characterize and quantify groundwater exchange processes necessary to predict solute transport. The data types collected include: high frequency discharge estimates {{with the use of}} rating curves, <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> techniques with instantaneous tracer experiments, groundwater table and stream water surface elevations, vertical head gradients, and hydraulic conductivity estimates. The first two data types were categorized as stream gauging and the remaining three data types as site characterization. The stream gauging data were used to quantify net changes in stream discharge at a reach scale with rating curve predictions and <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging.</b> Each method resulted in opposite net changes at this scale. An error analysis regarding rating curve predictions and <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> suggested that neither method detected groundwater exchange at this scale due to discharge estimates being statistically the same. The error in rating curve predictions was estimated using a 95 % joint confidence region of model parameters and the error in <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> was estimated using a first order error analysis. <b>Dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> was also performed at a sub-reach scale to quantify net changes and indicated the groundwater exchange was highly spatially variable, which was not concluded at the reach scale. To quantify a water balance more representative of the exchanges occurring, gross gains and gross losses were quantified by measuring tracer mass recoveries and were found to occur in every sub-reach. However, the error analysis concluded that nearly half of the changes were not significant, which emphasized the importance of quantifying error in stream gauging techniques used to understand surface water-groundwater interactions. The site characterization data were used to test and verify the water balance results by providing information regarding general trends and spatial variability of surface water-groundwater interactions. This study proved that one data type is not adequate to clearly characterize and quantify surface water-groundwater interactions and researchers must exercise caution when interpreting results from different data types at varying spatial scales...|$|E
40|$|To improve water {{management}} design, particularly in irrigation areas, {{it is important}} to evaluate the baseline state of the water resources, including canal discharge. Salt <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> is a traditional and well-documented technique in this respect. The complete mixing of salt used for <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> is required; this condition is difficult to test or verify and, if not fulfilled, is the largest source of uncertainty in the discharge calculation. In this paper, a geophysical technique (FERT, fast electrical resistivity tomography) is proposed for imaging the distribution of the salt plume used for <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> at every point along a sampling cross section. With this imaging, complete mixing can be verified. If the mixing is not complete, the image created by FERT can also provide a possible guidance for selecting water-sampling locations in the sampling cross section. A water multi-sampling system prototype aimed to potentially take into account concentration variability is also proposed and tested. The results reported in the paper show that FERT provides a three-dimensional image of the dissolved salt plume and that this can potentially help in the selection of water sampling point...|$|E

40|$|Today's {{society is}} full of {{instructions}} and mandatory actions relating to safety or the anticipation of danger. Countless security instructions detail procedures to avoid any risk in the public space while double door entrances control access to {{a growing number of}} places. Our faces, bodies, fingerprints and pupils are repeatedly scanned. Western society is moving towards ultra-security, towards a refusal of the unexpected and an absolute desire for anticipation. The Safe and sound exhibition addresses this phenomenon through design, objects from everyday life, photography and contemporary art in four themes: security, fear, protection and surveillance. Mixing objects that meet a specific need for protection and the points of view of designers and artists, more critical and distanced but not devoid of humour, Safe and sound provides an exciting insight into this facet of our society.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{based on the premise that}} the {{distribution}} of discharge source areas in relation to the channel network may have a significant effect on the form of the basin hydrograph, and that, in consequence, it is of value to investigate routing models for application to the channel networks of upland catchments. The channels of such networks are generally small, steep and rough with complex flow through a sequence of pools and riffles or rapids. The gulp <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> method provides a useful technique for investigating the bulk properties of flow over complete channel reaches. At least for low to medium flows it is shown that average flow velocities increase nonlinearly both downstream and with increasing discharge, in a manner that is not compatible with traditional analysis in terms of uniform flow equations. The <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> measurements may be used to provide parameters for a nonlinear kinematic routing model. The model is applied to channel networks of two small British basins (=; 8 km 2) and the response to different hydrograph magnitudes is explored. The model provides a suitable compromise between the requirements of simplicity and the inclusion of the nonlinearity in channel response, but, at the scale of application, the model parameter values derived from the field measurements may overestimate velocities at high discharges.

40|$|The {{response}} {{of a river}} to a pollution incident is heavily influenced by the river's flow rate. To capture {{the full range of}} this response, tracer experiments are often used. The paper discusses how the concept of similarity of temporal concentration profiles can be used to better exploit the information content of such experiments. Examples are given showing that poor quality tracer data that might be thought to be of little use may yet contain valuable information. Extracting this information has the potential of improving predictions of pollutant travel times, in particular, as well as offering the prospect of improving estimates of flow rates (via <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging)</b> and dispersion coefficients (via several methods) ...|$|E
30|$|<b>Dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> method {{measures}} streamflow on {{the basis}} of rate of diffusion of a tracer that can be either a chemical or a radio isotope (Comina et al. 2014; Dingman 2015). Chemical tracers, such as common salt (NaCl), can be used by using an electrical conductivity (EC) meter or an ion electrode (Flury and Wai 2003; Otz et al. 2003). Streamflow is calculated by multiplying average cross section area and velocity of the flow. The method is inexpensive. It is an absolute method because the discharge is computed from volume and time only (Herschy 2008). It is used in turbulent flow conditions where conventional methods are difficult to apply (Gordon et al. 2004). However, the method can report erroneous results due to the loss and incomplete mixing of the tracer arising from the difference in velocity in the upper and lower surfaces of the stream. Special training is needed to apply this method in the field. In certain areas, it is difficult to obtain the permission to inject tracers into streams as it can pollute water (Moore 2004).|$|E
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of complex surface water-groundwater interactions has made progress in recent decades; however, information regarding seasonal fluctuations is currently limited. Investigating both the seasonal and spatial variability of these interactions can support more accurate predictions of pollutant transport and, therefore, {{the effects of}} anthropogenic activities. A case study was performed on a 515 meter reach at Curtis Creek to investigate these types of variability. Curtis Creek is a perennial groundwater fed mountain stream located in Northern Utah. Two study periods were selected at different flow regimes in the early summer and late fall. <b>Dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> was used to directly estimate groundwater exchange in terms of gains and losses within three sub-reaches that constitute the entire study reach. Supporting data were collected to determine the difference in head between surface water and groundwater. These include high-frequency discharge estimates at the sub-reach boundaries, stream water surface elevations at various locations within the reach, and depth to groundwater in the adjacent shallow aquifer. We found that one sub-reach showed concurrent gains and losses during summer flows and only a gain during the fall, but exchanges were consistently diminished during fall conditions for all sub-reaches. Funding was provided by EURP...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> techniques to {{rivers and streams}} and other variable flows incurs a systematic error caused by the change in discharge with time. The discharge calculated from dilu-tion gauging results may be considered as {{an estimate of the}} stream discharge at the injection section or the sampling section, and the magnitude and sense of the error vary according to this choice. On the recession limb of a hydrograph and in other cases where the discharge may be expected to change smoothly and gradually, the equations derived from the residence time model previously proposed by the author may be linearized, and formulae of general applicability developed. In this paper formulae are presented for the error arising {{in the case of a}} constant rate tracer injection, and examples are given of their application to results from a number of different flow systems. It is shown that the error may be significant in two situations: where the rate of change of discharge is high and where poor mixing necessitates long gauging reaches and hence long tracer injections.

30|$|Monitoring {{hydrological}} regimes {{has gained}} importance {{with the increasing}} concern for impacts of climate change. Stream monitoring forms a critical basis for water resource management. The volume and functions of the streams are controlled by hydrologic processes that can be defined by the geology, topography and climate of the area, along with impact of human activities. Understanding the streamflow and the hydrological processes determining the streamflow is critical for the efficient and optimum allocation of water resources, so as to realize their maximum social and economic value. Information generated through regular monitoring of natural streams/rivers encourages sustainable use of water resources and also facilitates {{development and implementation of}} economic tools such as payments for ecosystem services (Fig.  1). A river/stream can be monitored using a method that is appropriate for the objective of the study, resources and expertise availability, stream size and terrain. On the basis of review of literature and qualitative index developed (Table  3), we concluded that, for monitoring small mountain streams, timed volume method is apt and provides a high degree of accuracy. For mountain streams with large quantity of water, weir and flume methods are more efficient and can be used for a long term study. For small streams in flat terrain, float method can be used, whereas, for larger streams, <b>dilution</b> <b>gauging</b> is a better method if tracer is properly added to all the surfaces of the stream and if tracer does not alter water quality (Table S 2). The current meter and PIV can be used for more accurate results, although this requires specialized training (Table  2). The present study suggests that the selection of a method for monitoring streamflow may be based on volume of stream, accuracy of the results, accessibility of the terrain and financial and physical resources available.|$|E
