40|$|The {{localized}} corrosion of pure aluminum, AA 2024 -T 3 alloy, and {{in particular}} the behavior of the intermetallic particles in AA 2024 -T 3 were studied using a technique of scratching the surface with atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips. In situ AFM scratching provides information regarding the protectiveness of the surface film. Scratching of aluminum by rastering the surface with the AFM tip in contact mode in 0. 5 M NaCl resulted in accelerated uniform dissolution in the rastered area. Slow pumping of the solution through the AFM cell during scratching, however, resulted in the development of sustained localized corrosion. Scratching in a stagnant 0. 5 M NaCl solution containing 10 - 4 M Na 2 Cr 2 O 7 also resulted in the development of large pits. For higher dichromate concentrations (0. 005 and 0. 05 M), neither accelerated dissolution nor pitting was observed, most probably because of the formation of <b>harder</b> <b>chromium</b> containing surface oxide. AFM scratching of AA 2024 -T 3 in 0. 01 M NaCl resulted in the immediate dissolution of the Al-Cu-Mg particles because of a destabilization of the surface film during light scratching. The addition of very dilute concentrations of dichromate (10 - 4 M) to 0. 5 M NaCl completely suppressed the corrosion of the Al-Cu-Mg particles during AFM scratching, but breakdown in the matrix occurred in a similar fashion as for pure aluminum.

In recent years, substantial efforts were undertaken in order to replace corrosion protection systems on the basis of chromium(VI) -containing connections by other procedures.

Modern electrolytes are available, which allow the deposition of thin and decorative chromium layers in galvanic processes. Nevertheless, the deposition is limited to a maximum layer thickness of 10 µm and a corresponding hardness of 900 HV.

Thin films of functional oxides can be routinely produced, but there lacks a standard technique for establishing nanoscale freestanding structures on insulating substrates.

A <b>chromium</b> <b>hard</b> mask is patterned and deposited using electron beam lithography (EBL) and lift off. The pattern is transferred to an underlying carbon layer by oxygen reactive ion etching (RIE). Hard masks with hallbar patterns have been structured on 5 × 5 mm samples with thin films of La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 (LSMO) and BaTiO 3 (BTO) on (111) -oriented SrTiO 3 (STO) substrates. The hallbars have widths from 11 µm and down to 130 nm, which are connected to 200 × 200 µm contacts pads.

Label-free optical biosensing with high sensitivity, throughput, compactness, and low cost, {{plays an important role}} to resolve these diagnostic challenges and pushes the detection limit down to single molecule. Optical nanostructures, specifically the resonant waveguide grating (RWG) and nano-ribbon cavity based biodetection are promising in this context. The main element of this dissertation is design, fabrication and characterization of RWG sensors for different spectral regions (e. g. visible, near infrared) for use in label-free optical biosensing and also to explore different RWG parameters to maximize sensitivity and increase detection accuracy. Design and fabrication of the waveguide embedded resonant nano-cavity are also studied. Multi-parametric analyses were done using customized optical simulator to understand the operational principle of these sensors and more important the relationship between the physical design parameters and sensor sensitivities. Silicon nitride (SixNy) is a useful waveguide material because of its wide transparency across the whole infrared, visible and part of UV spectrum, and comparatively higher refractive index than glass substrate. SixNy based RWGs on glass substrate are designed and fabricated applying both electron beam lithography and low cost nano-imprint lithography techniques. A <b>Chromium</b> <b>hard</b> mask aided nano-fabrication technique is developed for making very high aspect ratio optical nano-structure on glass substrate. An aspect ratio of 10 for very narrow (~ 60 nm wide) grating lines is achieved which is the highest presented so far. The fabricated RWG sensors are characterized for both bulk (183. 3 nm/RIU) and surface sensitivity (0. 21 nm/nm-layer), and then used for successful detection of Immunoglobulin-G (IgG) antibodies and antigen (~ 1 μg/ml) both in buffer and serum. Widely used optical biosensors like surface plasmon resonance and optical microcavities are limited in the separation of bulk response from the surface binding events which is crucial for ultralow biosensing application with thermal or other perturbations. A RWG based dual resonance approach is proposed and verified by controlled experiments for separating the response of bulk and surface sensitivity. The dual resonance approach gives sensitivity ratio of 9. 4 whereas the competitive polarization based approach can offer only 2. 5.

The zinc immersion layer chemically displaces the oxide film on Al 1050 and Al 6061 and then zinc is deposited followed by nickel and chromium electrodeposition. Superior adhesion was associated with uniform, thin and fine grained deposits from Bondal solution which exhibited rapid and complete coverage of both aluminium samples. The metallurgical characteristics of the aluminium alloys and the processing sequence developed had a significant influence on the growth and morphology of the deposits from the Bondal solution and affected subsequent adhesion of electroplated nickel and chromium. This engendered the treated surface with sufficient catalytic nature to be able to receive a subsequent electroless nickel layer together with finishing layers of electrolytic nickel and chromium respectively. Due to the favourable physical properties of aluminium and its alloys (density, strength to weight ratio), there is a growing demand for nickel/chromium coated aluminium components for automotive and other applications. The most common method currently is to directly electroplate nickel onto the aluminium substrate. However, this can lead to problems with components having complex geometry in that chemical attack on the pretreated aluminium can occur in low current density areas before the substrate can be completely covered with nickel due to the acidic nature and high temperature of the nickel electroplating process. One way of preventing this current density related problem is to use an electroless nickel undercoat before the nickel/chromium deposit is applied. The mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood and it is an objective of the current research to investigate the mechanism of nucleation of the electroless nickel layer on zincated aluminium. Results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the zincated layer was dissolved in the electroless nickel bath but zinc was detected below 10 nm from the top surface of the homogenous nickel phosphorus film, while aluminium and alloying elements from both alloys have diffused into the film. Hexavalent chromium electroplating from chromic acid is under pressure due to its health hazard and environmental problems and is subjected to increasingly stringent control and legislation. Health and safety considerations have prompted the electroplating industry to consider alternatives to coating processes that involve hexavalent chromium. It is a further objective of the research to compare the properties of nickel/chromium coated aluminium with top coats of chromium deposited from hexavalent and trivalent (chloride based) electrolytes. Duplex nickel and chromium electrodeposition were modified with an electroless nickel undercoat, thus four coatings were studied for the aluminium samples. Results obtained from the hardness measurements of Al 1050 and Al 6061 were compared for four coatings. Hardness tests profiles obtained for Al 1050 and Al 6061 show that deposits from trivalent chromium electrolytes were not as <b>hard</b> as hexavalent <b>chromium</b> deposits. However, the hardness of duplex nickel/chromium coatings was improved by use of an electroless nickel undercoat. Scratch adhesion tests were focused on the failure mode of coatings evaluated on the basis of scratch channels, frictional force and acoustic emission signals. The adhesion test showed buckling and chipping of the coatings with no sign of spallation or delamination. Four coatings exhibited a higher critical load for both aluminium alloy samples. This confirmed that failure occurred within the coatings, rather than adhesive failure at the coating/substrate interface. Results obtained from copper acetic acid salt spray and electrochemical corrosion tests for Al 1050 and Al 6061 exhibited excellent corrosion resistance. Scanning electron microscope images showed initiation and propagation of small pits which did not coalesce to form large and deep craters that could result in the eventual failure of the coatings. Micro discontinuous chromium deposits spread the corrosion current, thus improving corrosion performance. Icorr values obtained from linear polarization corrosion tests show higher values for duplex nickel/chromium coatings on Al 1050 than Al 6061. Icorr values show similar trends for duplex nickel/chromium coating on Al 1050 and Al 6061 modified with an electroless nickel undercoat. In conclusion results showed a significant improvement in the chromium electroplating characteristics of Al 1050 and Al 6061 with an electroless nickel undercoat...|$|R
