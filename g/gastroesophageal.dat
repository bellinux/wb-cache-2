5|$|The lower esophageal sphincter, or <b>gastroesophageal</b> sphincter, {{surrounds}} {{the lower part}} of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach. It is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter, named from the adjacent part of the stomach, the cardia. Dysfunction of the <b>gastroesophageal</b> sphincter causes <b>gastroesophageal</b> , which causes heartburn and if it happens often enough, can lead to <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease, with damage of the esophageal mucosa.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of {{bacteria in the}} stomach may be beneficial, reducing the prevalence of asthma, rhinitis, dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease, and esophageal cancer by influencing systemic immune responses.|$|E
5|$|Children {{may have}} {{behaviors}} that are easily mistaken for epileptic seizures but are not. These include breath-holding spells, bed wetting, night terrors, tics and shudder attacks. <b>Gastroesophageal</b> reflux may cause arching of the back and twisting of the {{head to the side}} in infants, which may be mistaken for tonic-clonic seizures.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis. Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome. The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30minutes of {{the completion of a}} meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastroesophageal</b> reflux {{disease is}} {{relieved}} {{in almost all}} patients.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastroesophageal</b> reflux {{disease can}} cause acid {{erosion of the}} teeth and halitosis.|$|E
25|$|Omeprazole {{can be used}} in the {{treatment}} of <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, erosive esophagitis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and eosinophilic esophagitis.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{reports of}} {{selected}} patients undergoing Sugiura procedure reported that recurrence of <b>gastroesophageal</b> variceal bleeding occurs in only 2.3% of patients.|$|E
25|$|Barrett first {{described}} the columnar metaplasia in 1950. An association with <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux {{was made in}} 1953. An association with adenocarcinoma was made in 1975.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastroesophageal</b> reflux {{disease can}} also lead to enamel loss, as acid refluxes up the {{esophagus}} and into the mouth, occurring most during overnight sleep.|$|E
25|$|Instant coffee has {{a greater}} amount of {{acrylamide}} than brewed coffee. It was once thought that coffee aggravates <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease but recent research suggests no link.|$|E
25|$|Emergency Sugiura {{procedure}} is indicated when Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhotic patients are acutely bleeding from <b>gastroesophageal</b> varices {{that are not}} responsive to medical or radiological therapies.|$|E
25|$|Esomeprazole {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Nexium (or Nexum) among others, is a proton-pump {{inhibitor}} which reduces stomach acid. It {{is used in the}} treatment of dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) {{block the}} gastric {{hydrogen}} potassium ATPase (H+/K+ ATPase) and inhibit gastric acid secretion. These drugs {{have emerged as}} the treatment of choice for acid-related diseases, including <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{foods and}} {{lifestyle}} {{are considered to}} promote <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux, but most dietary interventions have little supporting evidence. Avoidance of specific foods and of eating before lying down should be recommended only to those {{in which they are}} associated with the symptoms. Foods that have been implicated include coffee, alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods, acidic foods, and spicy foods. Weight loss and elevating the head of the bed are generally useful. A wedge pillow that elevates the head may inhibit <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux during sleep. Stopping smoking and not drinking alcohol do not appear to result in significant improvement in symptoms. Although moderate exercise may improve symptoms in people with GERD, vigorous exercise may worsen them.|$|E
25|$|Tom Johnston {{was forced}} to miss several shows in late summer and early fall of 2007 {{following}} surgery for <b>Gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease. Upon his return, he received vocal assistance from Simmons and McFee on certain tunes that he traditionally sang in their entirety.|$|E
25|$|Type III: Type III hernias have {{elements}} of both types I and II hernias. With progressive enlargement of the hernia through the hiatus, the phrenoesophageal membrane stretches, displacing the <b>gastroesophageal</b> junction above the diaphragm, thereby adding a sliding element to the type II hernia.|$|E
25|$|A {{history of}} heartburn, <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease (GERD) {{and use of}} certain forms of {{medication}} can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer. Medicines associated with peptic ulcer include NSAIDs (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase, and most glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone and prednisolone).|$|E
25|$|The primary uses of esomeprazole are <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease, {{treatment}} {{and maintenance of}} erosive esophagitis, treatment of duodenal ulcers caused by H. pylori, prevention of gastric ulcers in those on chronic NSAID therapy, and treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|Oesophageal {{diseases}} {{include a}} spectrum of disorders affecting the oesophagus. The most common condition of the oesophagus in Western countries is <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease, which in chronic forms is thought to result in changes to the epithelium of the oesophagus, known as Barrett's oesophagus.|$|E
25|$|In the Western world, between 10 and 20% of the {{population}} are affected by GERD. <b>Gastroesophageal</b> reflux (GER) once in a while, without significant symptoms or complications, is more common. The condition was first described in 1935 by the American gastroenterologist Asher Winkelstein. The classic symptoms had been described earlier in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Specialty {{professional}} organizations recommend that people take the lowest effective PPI dose {{to achieve the}} desired therapeutic result when used to treat <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease long-term. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has advised that {{no more than three}} 14-day treatment courses should be used in one year.|$|E
25|$|Omeprazole, {{sold under}} the brand names Prilosec and Losec among others, is a {{medication}} {{used in the}} treatment of <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. It is also used to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people who are at high risk. It can be taken by mouth or injected into a vein.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease (GERD) is a {{condition}} in which the digestive acid in the stomach comes in contact with the esophagus. The irritation caused by this disorder is known as heartburn. Long-term contact between gastric acids and the esophagus can cause permanent damage to the esophagus. Esomeprazole reduces the production of digestive acids, thus minimizing their effect on the esophagus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease (GERD), {{also known}} as acid reflux, is a {{long-term}} condition where stomach contents come back up into the esophagus resulting in either symptoms or complications. Symptoms include the taste of acid {{in the back of}} the mouth, heartburn, bad breath, chest pain, vomiting, breathing problems, and wearing away of the teeth. Complications include esophagitis, esophageal strictures, and Barrett's esophagus.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparing}} tissues for histology or histopathology, d-limonene {{is often}} used as a less toxic substitute for xylene when clearing dehydrated specimens. Clearing agents are liquids miscible with alcohols (such as ethanol or isopropanol) and with melted paraffin wax, in which specimens are embedded to facilitate cutting of thin sections for microscopy. In traditional medicine, d-limonene is marketed to relieve <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease and heartburn.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of Freeman–Sheldon syndrome include drooping {{of the upper}} eyelids, strabismus, low-set ears, a long philtrum, gradual hearing loss, scoliosis, and walking difficulties. <b>Gastroesophageal</b> reflux has been noted during infancy, but usually improves with age. The tongue may be small, and the limited movement of the soft palate may cause nasal speech. Often there is an H- or Y-shaped dimpling of the skin over the chin.|$|E
25|$|A hiatus hernia {{is a type}} of hernia {{in which}} {{abdominal}} organs (typically the stomach) slip through the diaphragm into the middle compartment of the chest. This may result in <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease (GERD) or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) with symptoms such as a taste of acid {{in the back of the}} mouth or heartburn. Other symptoms may include trouble swallowing and chest pains. Complications may include iron deficiency anemia, volvulus, or bowel obstruction.|$|E
25|$|Other {{characteristics}} of BS include learning disabilities, {{an increased risk}} of diabetes, <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux (GER), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). GER may also lead to recurrent infections of the upper respiratory tract, ears, and lungs during infancy. BS causes infertility in males and reduced fertility and early-onset menopause in females. In line with any RecQ-associated PS, people with BS have {{an increased risk of}} developing cancer, often more than one type.|$|E
25|$|The Sugiura {{procedure}} was originally developed to treat bleeding esophageal varices and consisted mainly of an esophagogastric devascularization. It {{was developed in}} Japan in 1973 as a nonshunting technique that achieved variceal bleeding hemostasis by interrupting the variceal blood flow along the <b>gastroesophageal</b> junction. The procedure consists primarily of paraesophagogastric devascularization achieved by dividing the perforating veins of the esophagus and the stomach while maintaining the plexus of collaterals that connect the coronary gastric vein to the azygous system.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} 15 children, aged 2–12 years old who all had {{multiple}} episodes of severe esophageal bleeding varices, and a mean follow-up time of 10 years 4 months, demonstrated 0% mortality and 80% resolution with {{disappearance of the}} varices and no evidence of recurrent bleeding. No cases of esophageal stenosis, <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease, hiatal hernia, encephalopathy or hepatic dysfunction were documented. The Sugiura procedure is a safe and effective surgical treatment of esophageal varices in the pediatric population.|$|E
25|$|Acid reflux, or <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease, {{can greatly}} {{exacerbate}} the mouth-alcohol problem. The stomach is normally {{separated from the}} throat by a valve, but when this valve becomes herniated, {{there is nothing to}} stop the liquid contents in the stomach from rising and permeating the esophagus and mouth. The contents—including any alcohol—are then later exhaled into the breathalyzer. One study of 10 individuals suffering from this condition did not find any actual increase in Breath Ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases are}} caused by a viral infection. Strep throat is the cause in about 25% of {{children}} and 10% of adults. Uncommon causes include other bacteria such as gonorrhea, fungus, irritants such as smoke, allergies, and <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease. Specific testing is not recommended in people who have clear symptoms of a viral infection such as a cold. Otherwise a rapid antigen detection test (RAPD) or throat swab is recommended. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include epiglottitis, thyroiditis, retropharyngeal abscess, and occasionally heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Chewing gum {{is used as}} a novel {{approach}} for the treatment of <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease (GERD). One hypothesis is that chewing gum stimulates the production of more bicarbonate-containing saliva and increases the rate of swallowing. After the saliva is swallowed, it neutralizes acid in the esophagus. In effect, chewing gum exaggerates one of the normal processes that neutralize acid in the esophagus. However, chewing gum is sometimes considered to {{contribute to the development of}} stomach ulcers. It stimulates the stomach to secrete acid and the pancreas to produce digestive enzymes that aren't required. In some cases, when consuming large quantities of gum containing sorbitol, gas and/or diarrhea may occur.|$|E
25|$|Intestinal gas is {{composed}} of varying quantities of exogenous sources and endogenous sources. The exogenous gases are swallowed (aerophagia) when eating or drinking or increased swallowing during times of excessive salivation (as might occur when nauseated or {{as the result of}} <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease). The endogenous gases are produced either as a by-product of digesting certain types of food, or of incomplete digestion, as is the case during steatorrhea. Anything that causes food to be incompletely digested by the stomach or small intestine may cause flatulence when the material arrives in the large intestine, due to fermentation by yeast or prokaryotes normally or abnormally present in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} erosive {{effects of}} acid reflux (an extremely common condition, {{also known as}} <b>gastroesophageal</b> reflux disease or GERD) have been strongly linked {{to this type of}} cancer. Longstanding GERD can induce a change of cell type in the lower portion of the esophagus in response to erosion of its squamous lining. This phenomenon, known as Barrett's esophagus, seems to appear about 20 years later in women than in men, maybe due to hormonal factors. Having symptomatic GERD or bile reflux makes Barrett's esophagus more likely, which in turn raises the risk of further changes that can ultimately lead to adenocarcinoma. The risk of developing adenocarcinoma in the presence of Barrett's esophagus is unclear, and may in the past have been overestimated.|$|E
