40|$|AbstractGeothermal {{resource}} evaluation {{was accomplished}} for the Baja California Peninsula hydrothermal systems. Numerous geothermal areas were identified {{along the eastern}} coast of the Peninsula, which are related with the Gulf of California opening process.

The southern part of the Peninsula also has abundant geothermal resources related with local grabens. The <b>heat</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> evaluation was accomplished for five geothermal areas where geophysical data were available to estimate the reservoir volume. The minimum calculated potential is more than 400 MWe.

40|$|Deep onshore Mesozoic basins have {{favourable}} geothermal aquifers {{at depth}} comprising basal Permo-Triassic sandstones. The principal basins are the Wessex and Worcester (southern England), Cheshire (northwest England), Eastern England, Larne and Lough Neagh (Northern Ireland). Measured temperatures {{are up to}} 80 °C and could reach 100 °C in the deepest parts {{of some of the}} basins. Porosity and permeability data from depth are limited, but values high enough to allow adequate yields have been measured in many of the basins. Productive sandstones vary from a few tens of metres to hundreds of metres thick resulting in productive transmissivities. The estimated <b>heat</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> (Inferred Geothermal Resource) has been calculated as 201 [*]×[*] 1018 to 328 [*]×[*] 1018 J.

Within the Carboniferous and Devonian there are thick sequences of deeply buried arenaceous deposits. Some productive local aquifers occur at shallow depth, but most depend on fissure flow that is anticipated to diminish rapidly with depth. The exception may be the Carboniferous Limestone where warm springs and a pronounced thermal anomaly in Eastern England demonstrate groundwater flow at depth, possibly along pathways of many kilometers...|$|E

In addition, we present a set of highly favorable geothermal areas, but without enough data in order to quantify the resource. Information regarding geothermal systems was gathered and ranked to assess Indicated or Inferred resources, depending {{on the degree of}} confidence that a resource may exist as indicated by the geoscientific information available to review. Resources were estimated through the USGS <b>Heat</b> <b>in</b> <b>Place</b> method. A Monte Carlo approach is used to quantify variability in boundary conditions. Estimates of total Indicated resource are confined to 3 geothermal systems; Apacheta, El Tatio and Tolhuaca, yielding a total value of 228 +/- 154 MWe. The estimates of the total Inferred resources for Chile include 6 geothermal systems and yield a total value of 431 +/- 321 MWe. Standard deviation reflects the high variability of reservoir specific parameters for each system. A set of 65 favorable geothermal areas are proposed as the most likely future development targets. Eight of them have initial exploration results that suggest they are highly favorable targets as potential geothermal resources.

40|$|International audienceMethodology for {{estimation}} of the geothermal potential in a limited area. This method {{is applied to the}} Upper Rhine Graben, for the resource located in clastic formation of the lower Triassic unit, namely the Buntsandstein. The methodology is based on Muffler & Cataldi works (1978) and the computation of the <b>heat</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> and exploitable heat. A 30 km x 35 km area located between Strasbourg and Obernai in France has been investigated. Based on a detailed geological study combining data derived from 13 previous oil boreholes and 143 km length of seismic profiles, the main sedimentary interfaces including geological layers and faults have been interpreted between the outcropping Quaternary layers and the deeper parts made of Permo-Triassic formations. From that interpretation, 3 D geological models have been yielded based on different hypotheses. These models, constructed with the GeoModeller software developed by BRGM, allow calculating the volume of modelled silicoclastic formations. According to the modelling results, different reservoir volumes have been computed which impacts the {{estimation of}} the overall geothermal potential. Temperature conditions derived from BHT (Bottom Hole Temperature) data in boreholes reaching the Buntsandstein sandstones, show a high average geothermal gradient (between 50 °C/km and 58 °C/km), which tends to indicate a significant geothermal potential. In the investigated area, the volume of the Buntsandstein reservoir is about 300 km 3 and the exploitable heat quantity is around 350 GWth. year ± 5 %. For the future, we start a characterization of the Buntsandstein formation in terms of petrophysics to better assess the quality of the geothermal resource and to define exploitation targe...|$|E

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{regarding the}} dimensions and exact {{location of the}} geothermal resource, along {{with the cost of}} drilling process of geothermal wells, are usually two factors that hinder the wider use of high enthalpy geothermal energy to generate electricity. In the first half of 2018, the Costa Rican Institute of Electricity (ICE) will begin to develop the Borinquen geothermal zone (drilling). In order to increase the probability of success in this phase, based on the experience acquired during the exploration and development of geothermal energy in Costa Rica, a methodology is proposed in which geospatial techniques are used to design an initial development strategy. This is achieved by combining available topographic, geological, geophysical and thermal gradient data, together with a conceptual model of the hydrothermal system. As a result, we obtain a suitability model that allows us to identify the most appropriate locations for drilling pads, zoning the high enthalpy geothermal resource, and to identify the areas to be used as production and reinjection poles of geothermal fluids. In addition, we use the USGS <b>Heat</b> <b>in</b> <b>Place</b> volumetric method and the Monte Carlo simulator to estimate the electrical energy that will be produced by the geothermal reservoir. The results obtained reveal that this zone has sufficient extractable energy potential to install a geothermal power unit with a capacity of 50 MWe for a period of useful life of 30 years, and we propose a preliminary viable development strategy {{as the basis for the}} sustainable exploitation of the Borinquen geothermal field. © 2017 Elsevier LtdWe would like to thank the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) for its support and help in undertaking this research and for giving us permission to publish the data.

40|$|A {{resource}} {{assessment methodology}} {{has been developed}} to designate prospective high permeable clastic aquifers and to assess the amount of potential geothermal energy in the Netherlands. It builds from the wealth of deep subsurface data from {{oil and gas exploration}} and production which is publicly and digitally available. In the resource assessment various performance indicator maps have been produced for direct heat applications (greenhouse and spatial heating). These maps are based on detailed mapping of depth, thickness, porosity, permeability, temperature and transmissivity (methodology presented in other papers in this NJG issue). In the resource assessment analysis 14 lithostratigraphic units (clastic aquifers) have been considered, ranging in age from the Permian to the Cenozoic. Performance maps have been made which include a) the expected doublet power (MWth) to be retrieved; b) the number of houses or hectares that can be heated from one doublet; and c) a potential indicator map, which provides insight in subsurface suitability for specific applications from a techno-economic perspective. To obtain a nationwide overview of the resource potential in terms of recoverable geothermal energy, a progressive filtering approach was used from total heat content of the reservoirs (<b>Heat</b> <b>In</b> <b>Place</b> – HIP) via the heat that can potentially be recovered (Potential Recovery Heat – PRH) to energy maps taking into account a techno-economic performance evaluation (Recoverable Heat – RH). Results show that the HIP is approximately 820, 000 PJ which is significantly more than previous estimates of around 90, 000 PJ. This considerable increase in geothermal energy potential is the result of accurate geological mapping of key reservoir properties and the development of state-of-the-art techno-economic performance assessment tools that performs Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, for the previous estimates boundary conditions were set with the aim to compare the geothermal potential between different EU countries (Rijkers & Van Doorn, 1997). Taking into account techno-economic aspects, the RH is in the order of 85, 000 PJ. This is equivalent to 70...|$|E
