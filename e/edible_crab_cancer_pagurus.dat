60|$|In {{the higher}} {{crustaceans}} the anterior legs are developed into chelae or pincers; {{and these are}} generally larger in the male than in the female,--so {{much so that the}} market value of the male <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> (<b>Cancer</b> <b>pagurus),</b> according to Mr. C. Spence Bate, is five times as great as that of the female. In many species the chelae are of unequal size {{on the opposite side of}} the body, the right-hand one being, as I am informed by Mr. Bate, generally, though not invariably, the largest. This inequality is also often much greater in the male than in the female. The two chelae of the male often differ in structure (Figs. 5, 6, and 7), the smaller one resembling that of the female. What advantage is gained by their inequality in size on the opposite sides of the body, and by the inequality being much greater in the male than in the female; and why, when they are of equal size, both are often much larger in the male than in the female, is not known. As I hear from Mr. Bate, the chelae are sometimes of such length and size that they cannot possibly be used for carrying food to the mouth. In the males of certain fresh-water prawns (Palaemon) the right leg is actually longer than the whole body. (10. See a paper by Mr. C. Spence Bate, with figures, in 'Proceedings, Zoological Society,' 1868, p. 363; and on the nomenclature of the genus, ibid. p. 585. I am greatly indebted to Mr. Spence Bate for nearly all the above statements with respect to the chelae of the higher crustaceans.) The great size of the one leg with its chelae may aid the male in fighting with his rivals; but this will not account for their inequality in the female on the opposite sides of the body. In Gelasimus, according to a statement quoted by Milne Edwards (11. 'Hist. Nat. des Crust.' tom. ii. 1837, p. 50.), the male and the female live in the same burrow, and this shews that they pair; the male closes the mouth of the burrow with one of its chelae, which is enormously developed; so that here it indirectly serves as a means of defence. Their main use, however, is probably to seize and to secure the female, and this in some instances, as with Gammarus, is known to be the case. The male of the hermit or soldier crab (Pagurus) for weeks together, carries about the shell inhabited by the female. (12. Mr. C. Spence Bate, 'British Association, Fourth Report on the Fauna of S. Devon.') The sexes, however, of the common shore-crab (Carcinus maenas), as Mr. Bate informs me, unite directly after the female has moulted her hard shell, when she is so soft that she would be injured if seized by the strong pincers of the male; but as she is caught and carried about by the male before moulting, she could then be seized with impunity.|$|E

To gain first insights which effect these substantial changes in habitat structure and diversity might have on faunal stocks settling on hard substrata, we compared the mobile demersal megafauna associated with the common types of wind turbine foundations ('jacket', 'tripod' and 'monopile with scour protections of natural rock') in the southern German Bight, North Sea. Monopiles with scour protection were mostly colonized by typical reef fauna.

40|$|Dinoflagellates of the genusHematodinium infect over 40 {{species of}} marine crustaceans. Since the initial {{description}} of this parasite in France in the 1930 s [1], {{it appears to}} have spread glob-ally, causing economic loss in some species, including Tanner crabs (Chionoecetes bairdi) in Alaska [2], blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) in the United States [3], <b>edible</b> <b>crabs</b> (<b>Cancer</b> <b>pagurus)</b> and Norway lobsters (Nephrops norvegicus) in Europe [4 – 7], sand crabs (Portunus armatus) in Australia [8], and Chinese swimming crabs (Portunus trituberculatus) in northern China [9]. Because this disease is thought to be fatal, it may be of great significance to the sus-tainability of both captive shellfish fisheries and aquaculture [10, 11]. For instance, the decline in blue crabs from the Atlantic to Gulf Coasts in the US appears to be linked to epizootic out-breaks of disease caused byHematodinium [12]. Similarly, the reduction in velvet swimmer crab (Necora puber) numbers in Brittany in the 1980 s has been attributed to the high preva-lence of such infections [13]. Finally, the recent reports ofHematodinium infections in crabs and shrimp raised under aquaculture conditions in China [9, 14, 15] highlight the danger to ad-ditional, cultured crustacean populations. The number and host range of species ofHematodinium is unclear. Chatton and Poisso...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{injection}} of extracellular products (ECP) of Pseudoalteromononas atlantica isolated from shell disease-infected <b>edible</b> <b>crabs</b> (<b>Cancer</b> <b>pagurus)</b> into healthy <b>crabs</b> causes rapid death. In this study we examined the nature of the active lethal factor(s) in ECP. Injection of ECP into crabs caused a rapid decline in the total number of circulating hemocytes (blood cells), and the crabs died within 60 to 90 min. The individuals that died showed eyestalk retraction, limb paralysis, and lack of antennal sensitivity, suggesting that the active factor(s) targeted the nervous system. Histopathological investigations showed that affected crabs had large aggregates of hemocytes in the gills, and there was destruction of the tubules in the hepato-pancreas. The active factor in ECP was not sensitive to heat treatment (100 °C for 30 min) and proteinase K digestion. As lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was a potential candidate for the lethal factor, it was purified from whole P. atlantica bacteria or ECP and subsequently injected into crabs. These crabs had all of the external symptoms observed previously with ECP, such as limb paralysis and eyestalk retraction, and they died within 90 min after challenge, although no significant {{decline in the number of}} circulating hemocytes was observed. Similarly, in vitro incubation of hemocytes with purified LPS (1 to 20 g) from P. atlantica did not result in the clumping reaction observed with ECP but did result in a degranulation reaction and eventual cell lysis.

50|$|Declawing of crabs is {{the process}} whereby one or both claws of a live crab (including king crabs) are {{manually}} pulled off and the animal is {{then returned to the}} water. It occurs in several fisheries worldwide, such as in the Florida stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) fishery, the north-east Atlantic deep-water red crab (Chaceon affinis) fishery and in southern Iberia, where the major claws of the fiddler crab Uca tangeri are harvested. Around Northern Europe, an extensive fishery exists for claws of the <b>edible</b> <b>crab,</b> <b>Cancer</b> <b>pagurus.</b> The practice is defended because some crabs can naturally autotomise (shed) limbs and then about a year later after a series of moults, regenerate these limbs. It is argued that declawing therefore provides a sustainable fishery. Claw removal is also promoted to assist in handling of animals, and to decrease losses through entanglement in nets and cannibalism. Declawing crabs is legal in the UK since revocation in 2000 of the Crab Claws (Prohibition of Landing) Order 1986. One crab that is subject to widespread declawing is the Florida stone crab, for which tourist information is provided.|$|E

The stock structure of the <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> (<b>Cancer</b> <b>pagurus</b> L.) in the Kattegat and Skagerrak was investigated using eight microsatellite DNA loci. Replicate samples, collected 4 - 6 years apart, were derived form the Kattegat (Grove Bank, 57 degrees N) and the Skagerrak (Lunneviken, 59 degrees N), plus a geographical outgroup sample from the Norwegian Sea (Midsund, 62 degrees N). Genetic differentiation among samples, estimated as global F(ST) = 0. 002, was significant (p = 0. 03) when the statistical test was based on allele frequencies, but not when based on genotype frequencies. Moreover, all single- and multilocus pairwise tests between samples were non-significant. An analysis of molecular variance, AMOVA, did not reveal significant differentiation between spatial (Kattegat vs. Skagerrak) or temporal (2001 / 2002 vs. 2006 / 2007) groups of samples. Power analysis suggested that the loci and sample sizes employed conferred a power of > 90 % of detecting even low (true F(ST) = 0. 0002) levels of population structure. Low spatial and temporal genetic structure might be explained by either or both of (i) high levels of contemporary gene flow in the area attributable to adult migration or larval dispersal or both factors taken together, and (ii) patterns of historical gene flow persisting among recently founded large populations.

However, stress-evoked in vivo release resulted in apparent non-stoichiometric circulating peptide profiles. This phenomenon is explained by notable differences in clearance rates of the peptides in haemolymph. In contrast to cHH, CPRP is very slowly degraded in vivo.

40|$|The {{influence}} of temperature on larval survival and development was {{studied in the}} <b>edible</b> <b>crab,</b> <b>Cancer</b> <b>pagurus,</b> from a population off the Island of Helgoland, North Sea. In rearing experiments conducted at six different temperatures (6 °, 10 °, 14 °, 15 °, 18 °, 24 ° C), zoeal development was only completed at 14 ° and 15 ° C. Instar duration of the Zoea I was negatively correlated with temperature. A model relating larval body mass to temperature and developmental time suggests that successful larval development is possible within a narrow temperature range (14 ° ± 3 ° C) only. This temperature optimum coincides with the highest citrate synthase (CS) activity found at 14 ° C. A comparison for intraspecific variability among freshly hatched zoeae from different females (CW 13 - 17 cm, N = 8) revealed that both body mass and elemental composition varied significantly. Initial larval dry weight ranged from 12. 1 to 17. 9 µg/individual, the carbon content from 4. 6 to 5. 8 µg/individual, nitrogen from 1. 1 to 1. 3 µg/individual, and the C:N ratio from 4. 1 to 4. 4.

Previous research on intertidal rocky shores has indicated that mobile predators influence patterns within intertidal community ecology.

Species collected during both low and high tide were the shore crab Carcinus maenas, the <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> <b>Cancer</b> <b>pagurus,</b> and velvet swimming crab Necora puber. Greater abundances of all crab species were found for low tide transects than within experimental traps during high tide. However, the size of crabs collected at low tide was consistently smaller than crabs collected from traps, at both exposed and sheltered shores. C. maenas and N. puber were more abundant at sheltered shores than exposed shores, on both midlittoral and infralittoral shore levels. Of the crab species collected during high tide, A^. puber was further assessed for diet characterisation. N. puber had diverse prey items within their guts, such as chitons, barnacles, algae and crabs. There were significant differences {{between high and low}} tide collection, in terms of size and abundances. The diet composition of N. puber indicates that more research including animals active during high tide is needed in order to get an appropriate understanding of how predation, especially animals migrating from sublittoral zones, in fact shape intertidal prey communities.

40|$|Sea {{ranching}} of {{the great}} scallop (Pecten maximus) may have a high potential for future aquaculture in Norway. The <b>edible</b> <b>crab</b> (<b>Cancer</b> <b>pagurus)</b> and starfish (Asterias rubens) {{have been identified as}} the major predators, causing great losses of released scallops. In order to reduce predation by these species, a functional fence was designed to protect scallop sea ranches. The fence has greatly improved the survival rate. However, fish are not obstructed by a fence and ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta) have been observed nabbing and eating on spat at a ranching site. The present study demonstrates that ballan wrasse (sized 22 to 40. 5 cm) prey on cultivated scallop spat (15 - 34 mm) and show that the predation is size specific. It is shown that ballan wrasse prefer scallops smaller than 25 mm in shell height, and that larger scallops only to a small degree is preyed. It is suggested that the spat are not protected from predation by ballan wrasse when the scallops recess into the sediment. These findings are important for optimising fenced sea ranching in Norway. An intermediate culture has traditionally been necessary for protection from predators during outgrow of spat to a size of about 50 mm. However, this phase is expensive and labour intensive. Results from the present study suggest that scallop spat can be seeded in a fenced area on the seafloor at a size of 25 - 30 mm in shell height, without suffering severe losses due to predation by ballan wrasse...|$|E

40|$|Predation on hatchery-reared {{lobsters}} (Homarus gammarus) in {{the wild}} was studied {{in order to identify}} predators in southwestern Norway on rocky and sandy substrates in winter and summer. Lobsters of 12 – 15 mm carapace length were tagged with magnetic microtags. About 51 000 juvenile lobsters were released on 10 occasions at three locations. Predator samplings were by trammel nets, eel traps, and videorecordings during the 24 h immediately following the releases. In summer, loss to predators occurred on both rocky and sandy substrates. The loss was lower in winter when lobsters were found as prey in predators caught on sand. The risk of fish predation was highest in the first hours after release, when the lobsters were out of shelter. The wrasses Labrus bergylta and Labrus mixtus were the major predators of lobsters, while Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius), and <b>crab</b> (<b>Cancer</b> <b>pagurus)</b> were mainly winter predators. Winter predators were never as abundant as summer predators. To minimise predatory loss of reared and costly lobsters, they should be released onto rocky substratum in winter. Due to the damage to the predated lobsters, {{it was not possible to}} correlate survival against lobster size...|$|R
40|$|Endoparasitic {{dinoflagellates}} of {{the genus}} Hematodinium have recently gained attention as significant pathogens of the brown <b>crab</b> <b>Cancer</b> <b>pagurus</b> in Ireland. Patent infections, which are characterized by a hyperpigmented carapace and moribund condition, are limited to the discrete periods when macroscopic identification is possible. Three methods are assessed for diagnosing Hematodinium sp. infections in brown crab at the times when macroscopic identification is not always possible. Haemolymph smears, histological sections of gill, heart, midgut, hepatopancreas, muscle, and gonad, and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay provided virtually equivalent accuracy in gauging infection prevalence, regardless of season. Sequences of PCR amplicons from the 18 S ribosomal RNA gene confirmed {{the identity of the}} parasite as belonging to the genus Hematodinium. Infection intensity values (, 1 – 87 %) obtained from haemolymph smears underscored infection levels within tissues, 90 % of which contained advanced levels of infection. Alterations to tissues of infected crabs included haemocytopoenia, oedema, which caused dilation of the haemal sinuses resulting in pressure necrosis to the connective tissues around the oocytes, myocardial bundles, and hepatopancreatic tubules. The claw muscle of infected animals contained the fewest parasites...|$|R
