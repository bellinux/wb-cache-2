In order to find a steam-resistant insulation system that includes magnet wire, groundwall and phase insulations and <b>impregnating</b> <b>resin,</b> accelerated aging tests were carried out applying small-scale models. Eight different insulation systems were constructed on these models, and seven different wire insulations were tested. The specimens were immersed in hot, pressurized water, which influenced the material instead of steam. Suitable materials for {{each part of the}} insulation system of a low-voltage, random-wound machine were found. Taking into account the thermal conductivities of each insulating material, the heat transfer of the machine was calculated for all the tested insulation systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{spraying}} of an impinging jet is {{an effective}} way to cool heated surfaces. A numerical model has been previously developed to predict the heat transfer with phase change between a hot plate surface and a two-phase impinging jet. This Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is applied here for studying the spray cooling of conventional and impregnated coil windings of electric motors. The numerical results are compared with measurements obtained on an experimental test bench. The confrontation numerical/experimental is carried out by comparing the distribution of temperature inside the coil windings. This study has confirmed the interest of the cooling spray technique. The interest to fill coil windings with <b>impregnating</b> <b>resin</b> of good thermal conductivity is less obvious. When using spray cooling, the lowest temperatures are reached within conventional coil windings...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} {{transmission}} electron microscopy to study catalysts comprising nanoparticulate gold dispersed on a highly porous nanoparticulate TiO 2 (anatase) support. The similarity of the morphology of the two phases, and the low number density of gold particles (1 in 65, 000) makes this challenging. Diffraction contrast imaging could not differentiate the two phases, since TiO 2 oriented at strong Bragg conditions, produced similar contrast to the Bragg/mass-thickness contrast of the gold. Mass-thickness contrast imaging allowed gold to be differentiated from TiO 2 only in the thinnest regions, where the mass-thickness of TiO 2 was low. Plasmon imaging, using an energy loss of 24 eV and an energy window width of 5 eV, was very effective at locating gold. Both the TiO 2 and <b>impregnating</b> <b>resin</b> produced a strong plasmon signal, while the much weaker signal from the gold made it appear dark. This permitted the gold particles to be readily located, irrespective of whether they were located in the thin or thick regions of the TiO 2 support...|$|E

40|$|The {{geometry}} of multiaxial multiply carbon reinforcement under shear deformation is studied. A description {{based on the}} distortions of the fibres bundles, induced by the stitch yarn is proposed. These distortions are recognised to be dominant for the impregnation behaviour and the damage initiation, since they form flow channels for the <b>impregnating</b> <b>resin</b> and resin rich zones after impregnation, respectively. The centers of the distortions, referred to as Stitch Yarn induced fibre Distortions (SYD), are located on an equidistant grid, which cell length and width {{is determined by the}} needle spacing and the stitch distance in machine direction. The dimensions of the distortions are analysed and presented as averaged values plus a distribution. The distribution of the measured dimensions of the SYDs are found to be lognormal rather than normal. A stepwise function is proposed to describe the relation between fabric shear deformation and the width of the SYDs. No significant changes in the length were observed.

Closite 25 A nanoclay loads of 2, 5, and 10 wt% are mixed by sonication with a low-viscosity epoxy resin prior to filling the mold cavity containing 13. 6 % E-glass preform by volume. A disk without nanoclay is also molded. Once the molded composites are cured, voids on radial composite samples are evaluated via microscopic image analysis. The addition of nanoclay is found {{to result in a}} significant increase in the apparent viscosity of the clay-epoxy mixture, thus increasing the molding pressure. Void occurrence is observed to increase considerably with increasing nanoclay content, from 2. 1 % in the composite without nanoclay to 5. 1 and 8. 3 % in the composites molded with 5 and 10 wt% nanoclay, respectively. However, the composite with 2 wt% nanoclay yields the lowest void content of 0. 7 %. Voids are observed to be, in average, smaller after the addition of nanoclay at all nanoclay concentrations. Presence of nanoclay in the <b>impregnating</b> <b>resin</b> induces at least 60 % reduction in voids located inside fiber tows, which are trapped by the fluid front motion during impregnation.

The cables were subjected to a room-temperature-applied uniaxial pressure of 12 MPa that was maintained during the reaction heat treatment (RHT), then vacuum impregnated with CTD 101 epoxy, and repressurized to 100 MPa during AC-loss measurement. The measurements were performed at 4. 2 K in a sinusoidal field of amplitude 400 mT at frequencies of 1 to 90 mHz (no DC-bias field) that was applied both perpendicular and parallel to the face of the cable (the face-on, FO, and edge-on, EO, directions, respectively).

40|$|The typical hydrometallurgical {{processing}} of nickel and cobalt ores involves {{the precipitation of}} a mixed nickel-cobalt intermediate product. Alternatively, cobalt could be separated from nickel while in the aqueous phase using solvent extraction. However, solvent extraction has some problems including the need for considerable area for the separators, management of fire hazard, and operational issues such as contamination with organic cross-over with sequential solvent extraction unit operations. The use of an ion exchange resin can mitigate some of these issues; however, conventional cation exchange resins are not sufficiently selective for cobalt over nickel. Solvent <b>impregnated</b> <b>resin</b> offers the engineering advantages of ion exchange resin and the chemical selectivity of the solvent extraction process. This paper describes key properties of a new commercial solvent <b>impregnated</b> <b>resin,</b> Lewatit TP 272, including cobalt and nickel loading {{as a function of}} pH and cobalt loading isotherms at pH 5. 5 and 5. 0 which are identified as the ideal conditions to recover cobalt. The chemical degradation of this solvent <b>impregnated</b> <b>resin</b> was also determined by exposing the resin to greater than pH 6 solutions, which are conditions outside the recommended operating range for this resin. The capacity of the degraded resin was restored by reimpregnating the resin using a Cyanex (R) 272 -ethanol-water mixture.

In a batch method the adsorption behavior of Tb,Dy and Ho with the solvent <b>impregnated</b> <b>resin</b> is quite similar to the extraction behavior with solvent extraction.

The {{aim of this study}} was to select the most suitable resin for this application. While in the literature there are mainly two types of resins used, MPP and Amberlite XAD type, a comparative study has not yet been conducted. In this study, a series of <b>resins</b> were <b>impregnated</b> with the solvent and applied in sorption experiments to study on the effect of the resin properties on the capacity, selectivity and mass-transfer rates of the solvent <b>impregnated</b> <b>resins.</b> It was found that the capacity could be estimated accurately with the previously developed liquid–liquid extraction equilibrium model. Additionally, the selectivity was determined by the solvent properties, and hardly affected by the resin matrix.

Using a solvent <b>impregnated</b> <b>resin</b> (SIR) eliminates the problem of emulsification encountered in liquid-liquid extraction. Impregnated MPP particles and impregnated XAD 16 particles are successfully used for phenol extraction. Impregnated MPP particles are preferred, as impregnated XAD 16 particles show less mechanical strength and are more expensive. Impregnated MPP particles perform better compared to other synthetic adsorbents and basic ion exchangers. The maximum phenol capacity of impregnated MPP particles with 0. 99 mol Cyanex 923 kg- 1 SIR is 4. 1 mol kg- 1 SIR (386 mg g- 1 SIR) and of MPP particles containing 1. 47 mol Cyanex 923 kg- 1 SIR it is 5. 08 mol kg- 1 SIR (478 mg g- 1 SIR). The regenerability of impregnated MPP particles is easy and complete, and the particles are stable during several cycles. The equilibrium constants for the extraction of phenol are determined as Kchem = 37 L mol- 1 and Kphys = 18 (mol L- 1) (mol L- 1) - 1.
