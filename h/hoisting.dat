5|$|Flag <b>hoisting</b> {{ceremonies and}} {{cultural}} programmes {{take place in}} governmental and non-governmental institutions throughout the country. Schools and colleges conduct flag <b>hoisting</b> ceremonies and cultural events. Major government buildings are often adorned with strings of lights. In Delhi and some other cities, kite flying adds to the occasion. National flags of different sizes are used abundantly to symbolise allegiance to the country. Citizens adorn their clothing, wristbands, cars, household accessories with replicas of the tri-colour. Over a period of time, the celebration has changed emphasis from nationalism to a broader celebration of all things India.|$|E
5|$|A Balloon Site, Coventry (1942) – shows a team {{of women}} <b>hoisting</b> a barrage balloon into {{position}} with the chimneys of industrial Coventry in the background surrounding the spire of Coventry Cathedral. WAAC commissioned the work as a propaganda tool to recruit women for Balloon Command, and Knight's composition succeeds in making the work appear both heroic and glamorous.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{also worked}} in Bacton, Norfolk, further up the coast, where night-flying was {{conducted}} {{and was later}} involved in supporting anti-submarine patrols. A typical patrol would {{last two or three}} days and would involve the manual labour of <b>hoisting</b> a seaplane {{in and out of the}} water by means of a deck-mounted derrick.|$|E

50|$|New {{friction}} <b>hoists</b> {{are less}} expensive than new drum <b>hoists,</b> and the lead time for delivery may be shorter as there is more competition for manufacturing. Multi-rope friction <b>hoists</b> have a larger lift capacity than a drum <b>hoist.</b> A friction <b>hoist</b> is smaller in diameter than a drum <b>hoist</b> for the same service, {{making it easier to}} ship and install than a drum <b>hoist.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>hoist</b> {{controllers}} {{for modern}} electric mining <b>hoists</b> have long included such features as automatic starting of the <b>hoist</b> when {{the weight of}} coal or ore in the skip reaches a set point, automatic acceleration of the <b>hoist</b> to full speed and automatic deceleration {{at the end of}} travel.Hoist controllers need both velocity and absolute position references taken, typically taken from the winding drum of the <b>hoist.</b> [...] Modern <b>hoist</b> controllers replace many of the mechanical analog mechanisms of earlier controllers with digital control systems.|$|R
5|$|February 16 in Lithuania {{is now an}} {{official}} holiday. On this day various ceremonies are hosted all across Lithuania. The 2014 commemoration included laying flowers at the signatories’ graves in Rasos Cemetery, awarding the Lithuanian National Prize, the <b>hoisting</b> of the three Baltic States’s flags at Daukantas Square, dedicated concerts at Cathedral Square in Vilnius and at the Lithuanian National Philharmonic Society hall, and the lighting of 16 fires along Gediminas Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The deck of {{the bridge}} was formed by pre-casting {{individual}} concrete units on the southern river shore, then <b>hoisting</b> them into place on temporary timber staging in the river. The units were then structurally joined by strands of high-tensile wire and stretched with a hydraulic jack. These pre-stressing strands were anchored in reinforced concrete blocks {{at the ends of}} the spans. The new bridge had a traffic capacity of 6,000 cars per hour in each direction, over a total of six traffic lanes.|$|E
5|$|A superstition that is {{prevalent}} among many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist the Wales (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell (Western Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus {{it should be the}} only trophy that they should be <b>hoisting.</b> Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well. However, there have been other teams who have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophies, sometimes going on to win the Cup anyway.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hoist</b> {{controller}} is {{the controller}} for a <b>hoist.</b> The term is used {{primarily in the}} context of electrically operated <b>hoists,</b> but it is apparent that the control systems of many 20th century steam <b>hoists</b> also incorporated controllers of significant complexity. Consider the control system of the Quincy Mine No. 2 <b>Hoist.</b> This control system included interlocks to close the throttle valve at the end of trip and to prevent opening the throttle again until the winding engine was reversed. The control system also incorporated a governor to control the speed of the <b>hoist</b> and indicator wheels to show the <b>hoist</b> operator the positions of the skips in the mine shaft.|$|R
50|$|Yo-yo, pile-up, or pilewind, <b>hoists</b> use yo-yo type devices {{instead of}} {{helically}} grooved drums. The yo-yos lines are coiled into overlapping layers of cable {{in the narrow}} slots. The pile-up drum <b>hoists</b> are usually used in low load. As the <b>hoists</b> are narrower than helically grooved drum <b>hoists,</b> these {{can be used in}} the places with limited space. Pile-up drum <b>hoists</b> can be mounted in many locations including ceiling, floor or wall mounting. Typical applications are to have a pile-up drum <b>hoist</b> with many pulleys to control a batten. Since the line is piled up on itself, this type of drum <b>hoist</b> provides a zero fleet angle solution.|$|R
25|$|The general {{parts of}} a flag are: canton—the upper inner section of the flag; field or ground—the entire flag except the canton, and the field and <b>hoist</b> ends; fly end—the furthest edge from the <b>hoist</b> end; and <b>hoist</b> end—the edge used to attach the flag to the <b>hoist.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{mandated}} by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred. Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The ceremony typically starts with the <b>hoisting</b> of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theatre representative of its culture. The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100million, {{with much of the}} cost incurred in the artistic segment.|$|E
5|$|In September 1645 a Parliamentary army {{under the}} command of Lord Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell {{advanced}} into Somerset, taking Sherborne, Cary and Shepton Mallet before turning to Nunney. Two regiments of soldiers with cannons surrounded the castle on 18 September; when Richard Prater refused to surrender, the cannons opened fire {{on the north side of}} the castle, breaching the castle wall. Richard continued to resist, <b>hoisting</b> a flag with a Catholic crucifix on it above the castle to taunt the besiegers, but two days later the garrison surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 1999–2000 season, Niedermayer was {{involved}} in a violent incident with Peter Worell of the Florida Panthers. After being elbowed by Worell, Niedermayer responded by swinging his stick at his opponents head. Worell suffered a concussion and missed six games, while Niedermayer was suspended for ten games – nine in the regular season, and New Jersey's first playoff game. After returning from his ban, Niedermayer's steady defensive contributions in the playoffs helped the Devils win their second Stanley Cup by defeating the Dallas Stars in six games in the 2000 Stanley Cup Final. While celebrating his day with the Cup, Niedermayer took the trophy to Fisher Peak, overlooking his hometown of Cranbrook and was famously pictured <b>hoisting</b> it over his head.|$|E
5000|$|In {{underground}} mining a <b>hoist</b> or winder {{is used to}} raise and lower conveyances within the mine shaft. Human, animal and water power were used to power the mine <b>hoists</b> documented in Agricola's De Re Metallica, published in 1556. Stationary steam engines were commonly used to power mine <b>hoists</b> through the 19th century and into the 20th, as at the Quincy Mine, where a 4-cylinder cross-compound corliss engine was used. [...] Modern <b>hoists</b> are powered using electric motors, historically with direct current drives utilizing solid-state converters (thyristors); however, modern large <b>hoists</b> use alternating current drives that are variable-frequency controlled. There are three principal types of <b>hoists</b> used in mining applications, Drum <b>Hoists,</b> Friction (or Kope) <b>hoists</b> and Blair multi-rope hoists.Hoist {{can be defined as}} anything that used to lift any heavy materials.|$|R
5|$|In 1890 movable tipping <b>hoists</b> {{mounted on}} rails were {{installed}} so that coal could be loaded simultaneously into one hold from a fixed <b>hoist</b> and another hold from the movable <b>hoist.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{questionnaire}} on patient <b>hoists</b> was circulated to all 220 qualified nurses {{working in}} a geriatric department. A survey of the provision and state of repair of the <b>hoists</b> was carried out on the unit. Despite being aware {{of the value of}} <b>hoists,</b> 41 % of the 134 nurses who responded to the questionnaire never or rarely used them. An important reason for this was inadequate instruction in <b>hoist</b> use, 65 % of nurses feeling that their instruction had been inadequate. Instruction in <b>hoist</b> use had rarely been given by occupational therapists or physiotherapists. Thirty-five per cent of nurses were unaware of any of the basic safety factors in <b>hoist</b> operation. Those who considered their instruction to have been inadequate {{were more likely to have}} unfavourable impressions of <b>hoists</b> (p < 0. 01) and more likely to be unaware of safety factors (p < 0. 01). There was a nonsignficant trend to a greater prevalence of previous back injury in nurses who never or rarely used <b>hoists.</b> The <b>hoists</b> themselves were generally in reasonable working order, although minor faults were found in 60 % of the 22 <b>hoists</b> surveyed. They were generally used (with rigid seats) as bath <b>hoists</b> only, and the provision of appropriate slings might greatly increase their usefulness at minimal extra expense...|$|R
5|$|On {{the night}} of 28 January, Surcouf {{captured}} the 12-gun Diana, loaded with 6000 bags of rice. The next day, Cartier met a 26-gun Indiaman, Triton, armed with 12-pounders and a 150-man crew; having decided to attack, and recognising only too late the overwhelming superiority of his opponent, Surcouf, feeling threatened and unable to flee, decided to board her with his 26 men. After haranguing his men, he approached under a British flag, before <b>hoisting</b> French colours {{at the very last}} moment and launching a violent assault. In the ensuing 45-minute battle, Triton suffered 5 wounded and 10 killed, including her captain, Captain Burnycat, and the first officer, Picket; The prisoners were transferred to Diana, which Surcouf released against a 30,000 rupee ransom.|$|E
5|$|The {{first six}} seasons {{featured}} sixteen fighters, in either {{one or two}} weight categories. The first two seasons, however, were very different from each following season. The original format for The Ultimate Fighter saw each team compete in challenges, such as <b>hoisting</b> their respective coach up on their shoulders and sprinting down a beach, or a team tug-of-war. These challenges resulted in eliminations of fighters who hadn't fought, {{until late in the}} season when the challenge incentive was to select the next fight where fighters would be eliminated, having lost the fight. In the first two seasons, fighters would also leave the house for good upon losing and this often resulted in odd numbers for teams, which forced the moving of fighters to opposing teams.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion that}} the ship would have nailed her flag and never surrendered, as Barère claimed, is never {{accounted}} {{in any of the}} reports. Though Jean François Renaudin never explicitly states that he surrendered, he does mention that he had his flag flown half-mast in distress when he was surrounded by British ships, indicating that he was requesting assistance from the enemy. Griffiths observes that Vengeur was dismasted to the point that there would have been nothing on which to nail a flag anyway, and James makes mentions of Vengeur <b>hoisting</b> the Union Jack in submission.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The rear {{multi-stage}} cylinder direct-acting hydraulic body <b>hoist</b> {{mechanism is}} widely used in mining dump truck. The working principle of the body <b>hoist</b> mechanism is introduced. The dumping process is simplified through the introduction of “dumping line ” and the variation of ore mass and <b>hoist</b> torque are analyzed. The optimization design {{of the position of}} body <b>hoist</b> mechanism is done using Maple software on the basis of direct search method aimed at minimizing the initial <b>hoist</b> force and the stroke of cylinder and maximizing the <b>hoist</b> force arm when the second stage cylinder starts to stretch out...|$|R

The McKirdy family were significant promoters of Toyne’s <b>hoists</b> until the 1960s. They established Toyne’s Rotary Clothes <b>Hoist</b> Pty Ltd and McKirdy’s son also patented and marketed several of his own clothes <b>hoists</b> designs.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} flag code of India did {{not allow}} private citizens to fly the national flag except on national days such as Independence Day or Republic Day. In 2001, Naveen Jindal, an industrialist used to the more egalitarian use of the flag in the United States where he studied, flew the Indian flag on his office building. The flag was confiscated and he was warned of prosecution. Jindal filed a public interest litigation petition in the High Court of Delhi; he sought to strike down the restriction {{on the use of}} the flag by private citizens, arguing that <b>hoisting</b> the national flag with due decorum and honour was his right as a citizen, and a way of expressing his love for the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper station}} of the incline has {{a gift shop}} that sells souvenirs and snack foods; a visitor center is also located {{adjacent}} to the station. The mechanical room housing the incline's electric motor and <b>hoisting</b> mechanism can be viewed from windows in the gift shop and {{the lobby of the}} visitor center. An observation deck providing views of the incline, the city, and the valley is located {{on the opposite side of}} the station from the visitor center. Two hiking trails allow visitors to walk the slope. One is a sculpture trail, with works created in 1989 by local artist James Wolfe, who used remnants of the Bethlehem Steel factory in Johnstown.|$|E

25|$|Before mid-1943, the M6 was not {{equipped}} with a spare tire and had a Beebee <b>hoist,</b> while after mid-1943 the Beebee <b>hoist</b> was replaced with either a Holan <b>hoist</b> or {{a modified version of}} the Braden winch. With the winches and <b>hoists,</b> the M6 could haul up to five M5 Bomb Trailers at once around airfields.|$|R
50|$|Drum <b>hoists</b> take up {{more space}} than a {{friction}} <b>hoist</b> {{for the same}} service as all of the haulage cable must be accommodated on the drum when the <b>hoist</b> is fully raised. Drum <b>hoists</b> require rapid fluctuations in power demand, which can pose a problem if power is generated on site rather than provided through the main power grid.|$|R

5|$|While his {{subordinates}} were on constant patrol, the Bearer of the Mace personally inspected the city three times each month. He {{was responsible for}} the military arsenal as well as disaster relief efforts during floods and fires. The Bearer of the Mace had a large staff of subordinates during Western Han, whose posts were abolished or transferred elsewhere during Eastern Han. This included the abolition of the Captains of the Standard Bearers, and the emperor's entourage became responsible for clearing the roadways when the emperor left the palace and <b>hoisting</b> colored standards to signal his return.|$|E
5|$|According to the Coat of Arms Act, {{everyone}} {{can use the}} Polish flag, especially during national and cultural events, {{as long as it}} is done in a respectful manner. This liberty in the use of national colors is a relative novelty. Until 2004, Polish citizens were only allowed to fly the Polish flag on national holidays. The use of both variants was restricted, but only flying the flag with coat of arms was, from 1955 until 1985, punishable by a fine or arrest for up to one year. After 1985, unauthorized use of any national symbols was an infraction. A possible explanation to such harsh measures was the fact that the officially-promoted holiday of May 1st was separated by only one day from the pre-war (and current) national holiday of Poland, the anniversary of signing of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. While <b>hoisting</b> a flag on May 1 was acceptable, no later than the following day it must have been hidden.|$|E
5|$|Low's tactics {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} <b>hoisting</b> false colours and approaching an unsuspecting vessel. Off {{the coast of}} St John's, Newfoundland, Low mistook a fully armed man-of-war for a fishing boat, and barely escaped. He moved on to Conception Bay, capturing a number of boats around the Grand Banks southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the Azores. There, he captured a French (or Portuguese—sources differ) pink, a narrow-sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the Rose Pink. He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard. Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them back down from the yard arm several times, until they died. He {{moved on to the}} Canaries, Cape Verde and then back across to the coast of Brazil, where he was driven back by foul weather.|$|E
