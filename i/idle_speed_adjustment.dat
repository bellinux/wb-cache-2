5000|$|<b>Idle</b> <b>speed</b> (<b>idling,</b> or idle) is the {{rotational}} speed {{the engine runs}} on when the engine is uncoupled to the drivetrain and the throttle pedal isn't depressed (generally measured in revolutions per minute, or rpm, of the crankshaft of a combustion engine). The idle differs in two ways engine idle and vehicle <b>idle.</b> At <b>idle</b> <b>speed,</b> the engine generates enough [...] power to run reasonably smoothly and operate its ancillaries (water pump, alternator, and, if equipped, other accessories such as power steering), but usually not enough to perform useful work, such as moving an automobile. For a passenger-car engine, <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> is customarily between 600 rpm and 1,000 rpm. For buses and trucks it is approximately 540 rpm. In case of many single-cylinder motorcycle engines, <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> is set between 1200-1500 rpm.|$|R
50|$|Most engine {{systems have}} <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control {{built into the}} ECU.

Early carburetor-based systems used a programmable throttle stop using a bidirectional DC motor. Early Throttle body injection (TBI) systems used an idle air control stepper motor. Effective <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control must anticipate the engine load at idle.|$|R

It seems that the traditional PID controller is powerless owing to nonlinear and time-varying of the engine system.

There are three methods of PID tuning applied: heuristic tuning, self-tuning by pole placement, and also iterative learning algorithm (ILA).

This paper applies a recently proposed linear time varying model predictive approach for the <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control of ultra-lean burn internal combustion engines. Unlike conventional gasoline engines, the approach uses fuel flow as the primary control variable to compensate for sudden fluctuations in engine load resulting in a fuel assisted <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control strategy. Simultaneously, the spark angle is maintained at a value so as to yield maximum brake torque while the emissions are reduced to negligibly low levels by constraining the engine operation to ultra-lean burn mode.

40|$|Model Predictive Control (MPC) can enable {{powertrain}} {{systems to}} satisfy more stringent vehicle requirements. To illustrate this, we {{consider an application}} of MPC to <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> regulation in spark ignition engines. Improved <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> regulation can translate into improved fuel economy, while improper control can lead to engine stalls. From a control point of view, <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> regulation is challenging, since the plant is subject to time delay and constraints. In this chapter, we first obtain a control-oriented model where ancillary states are added to account for delay and performance specifications. Then the MPC optimization problem is defined. The MPC feedback law is synthesized as a piecewise affine function, suitable for implementation in automotive microcontrollers. The obtained design has been extensively tested in a vehicle under different operating conditions. Finally, we show how competing requirements can be met by a switched MPC controller...|$|R
