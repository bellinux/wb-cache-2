50|$|The <b>daylight</b> <b>credit</b> was updated in LEED v4 {{to include}} a {{simulation}} option for daylight analysis that uses Spatial Daylight Autonomy (SDA) and Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE) metrics to evaluate daylight quality in LEED projects. SDA is a metric that measures the annual sufficiency of daylight levels in interior spaces and ASE describes the potential for visual discomfort by direct sunlight and glare. These metrics are approved by IES and described at the LM-83-12 standard. LEED recommend a minimum of 300 lux for at least 50% of total occupied hours {{of the year for}} 55% or more square meters (square feet) of the floor occupied area. The threshold recommended by LEED for ASE is that no more than 10% of regularly occupied floor area can be exposed to more than 1000 lux of direct sunlight for more than 250 hours per year. Additionally, LEED requires window shades to be closed when more than 2% of a space is subject to direct sunlight above 1000 lux. According to Reinhart the direct sunlight requirement is a very stringent approach that can disable good daylight design from achieving this credit. Reinhart propose the application of the direct sunlight criterion only in spaces that require stringent control of sunlight (e.g. desks, white boards and etc.).|$|E

40|$|Settlement risk is {{the risk}} that a bank {{will be unable to}} repay other banks for <b>daylight</b> <b>credit,</b> meaning the net amount (payments minus receipts) owed for a day's {{transactions}} on a payment system. Payments volumes have been growing rapidly on Fedwire and even more rapidly on privately operated systems. This growth highlights the need for management of settlement risk exposure. One vital ingredient of settlement risk management is the ability to control <b>daylight</b> <b>credit</b> extended or used by a bank across the various payment systems. Equally vital is the need for banks and their customers to recognize who is at risk in making and receiving largedollar payments...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the LEEDTM <b>Daylighting</b> <b>Credit</b> (IEQ 8. 1) is {{examined}} {{with reference to}} currently accepted calculation techniques in daylighting. A review of the derivation {{and use of the}} Daylight Factor requirement reveals that the LEEDTM use of the metric is not well defined or constrained to the useful scientific understanding of the term. The Apple Flagship Store in Los Angeles, California, is used to develop a comparative example for four compliance documentation procedures. The quantitative daylight factor results from the LEEDTM spreadsheet calculations are presented in detail and compared with results from a RADIANCE computer simulation, physical model testing in a calibrated mirror box sky, and on-site measurements. The conclusions firmly indicate that the LEEDTM spreadsheet method significantly over-predicts the levels of daylight due to problematic modifications in the Daylight Factor rules of thumb developed by R. G. Hopkinson. The RADIANCE and physical models are both in line with expected levels and distributions of daylight intensity, while the on-site measurements are similar to the software and physical model simulations, but skewed by changing exterior sky conditions...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{and visual}} comfort are often listed by {{occupants}} {{as the most}} important requirements for indoor environmental quality. Leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED), as an internationally recognized rating system for sustainable buildings, defines credits for the indoor environmental quality including thermal and visual comfort qualities. New designs, pursuing <b>daylighting</b> <b>credits,</b> draw on high window to wall ratios in order to provide natural light, which has also caused glare, closing the blinds, and consequently using artificial lighting during daytime. The high window/wall ratio increases the heat loss, resulting in cold spaces, and increases solar gains, resulting in overheated spaces during the hot seasons. The actual performance of LEED buildings should be assessed in order to define the gap between designed and actual levels of performance. This study, through questionnaire survey and onsite measurement, evaluates the visual and thermal comfort in four classrooms of different window sizes, locations, and orientations in two LEED buildings on the campus of Texas A & M University. The students' actual perceptions are compared through measurements and simulations with metrics proposed in LEED v 2, v 3, and v 4, showing satisfaction with the thermal, though not the visual environment. The results have been discussed for improving the quality of visual environment in university classrooms...|$|R
40|$|The {{monetary}} and payment system {{consequences of the}} September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks are reviewed and compared to selected U. S. banking crises. Interbank payment disruptions {{appear to be the}} central feature of all the crises reviewed. For some the initial trigger is a credit shock, while for others the initial shock is technological and operational, as in September 11, but for both types the payments system effects are similar. For various reasons, interbank payment disruptions appear likely to recur. Federal Reserve credit extension following September 11 succeeded in massively increasing the supply of banks ’ balances to satisfy the disruption-induced increase in demand and thereby ameliorate the effects of the shock. Relatively benign banking conditions helped make Fed credit policy manageable. An interbank payment disruption that coincided with less favorable banking conditions could be more difficult to manage, given current <b>daylight</b> <b>credit</b> policies.

40|$|We provide {{empirical}} evidence, {{based on}} tick-by-tick {{data for the}} e-MID euro area interbank market covering 2003 and 2004, that the overnight interest rate shows a clear downward pattern throughout the operating day.

Such a pattern was not detected in the mid- 1990 s: we explain this evolution as an outcome of the recent trend toward real-time settlement.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the potential of the}} daylighting systems used in the indigenous architecture of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), located in Dubai (latitude 25 ? N longitude 55 ? E). The analysis tested the lighting performance of three daylighting systems under UAE climatic conditions. The purpose of this research was to investigate the daylighting performance of three of the most common daylighting systems found in the indigenous buildings of the UAE, traditional windows (Dreeshah), gypsum decorative panels and wind tower (Barjeel). The lighting performance of each of the three lighting systems was examined. The lighting performance parameters examined were illuminance level, light distribution, uniformity, and glare. IESNA standards, CIBSE guidelines and LEED 2. 2 <b>daylighting</b> <b>credit</b> and recommendations were used as the minimum recommended level for all analyzed variables. On-site measurements (illuminance and luminance) were conducted to compare measured versus simulated measurements inside the space. Desktop Radiance 2. 0 Beta was used as the lighting performance analysis tool under clear sky conditions. Results have shown that the gypsum decorative panel performs better than the other two systems in terms of light uniformity and distribution, regardless of a lower illuminance level. The double panel window prototype has poor lighting performance in terms of glare, light distribution and uniformity. Wind tower performed well under the area of the wind tower itself. Apart from that it also had a poor lighting performance in terms of glare, light distribution, and uniformity...|$|R

40|$|Properly {{designed}} wholesale payments {{system can}} make {{a significant contribution to}} enhancing market discipline in the financial sector, reducing the risk of systemic disturbance and permitting a less extensive safety net for financial institutions. The objective of these reforms has been to achieve a reduction of the credit risk associated with the growth in intraday credit exposures that arises in net settlement systems and in real-time gross systems when the central bank provides daylight overdrafts. Intraday payments-related credit in net settlement systems has been reduced by restructuring payment systems into real-time gross settlement systems with collateralized overdrafts, while in the existing real-time gross settlement systems, the risk-abatement program currently in effect has taken the form of caps and charges on uncollateralized <b>daylight</b> <b>credit.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Credit {{extensions}} {{to banks}} using the Fedwire Funds Service-the Federal Reserve's real-time gross settlement (RTGS) payments system-can reach intraday peaks {{as high as}} $ 86 billion. This article evaluates the effectiveness of alternative methods of settling Fedwire payments in reducing intraday credit extensions. The authors simulate three deferred settlement mechanisms that complement RTGS systems: one-hour netting, six-hour netting, and a mechanism called a receipt-reactive gross settlement (RRGS) system. Their results suggest that in conjunction with RTGS systems, the RRGS mechanism could significantly reduce <b>daylight</b> <b>credit</b> extensions while modestly delaying the average time of payment settlement. Moreover, certain features of RRGS systems may encourage banks to submit payments earlier in the day. Further research on RRGS systems may shed light on whether they {{could prove to be}} a true liquidity-saving complement to real-time gross settlement systems.

40|$|One of the Federal Reserve's roles is {{to provide}} payment {{services}} to depository institutions and to the U. S. Treasury. Many of the nation's transfers of funds [...] whether they are large-dollar payments for financial market transactions or small-value business and consumer payments [...] settle through depository institutions' accounts held at the Federal Reserve for reserve-maintenance purposes and transaction processing. If a depository institution has insufficient balances during the day to cover its debits, it will run a negative balance or "daylight overdraft" in its Federal Reserve account until sufficient funds are received later in the day. Because depository institutions generally hold a relatively small amount of funds overnight in their Federal Reserve accounts {{in relation to the}} trillions of dollars of payments processed by the Federal Reserve each day, the Federal Reserve extends intraday credit to ensure the smooth functioning of the U. S. payment system. To reduce the risks that depository institutions present to the Federal Reserve through their use of <b>daylight</b> <b>credit</b> and to address the risks that payment systems, in general, present to the banking system and other sectors of the economy, the Federal Reserve Board in 1985 developed a payments system risk (PSR) policy. One of the primary goals of the PSR policy is to control depository institutions' use of Federal Reserve intraday credit, and as the policy has evolved, the Board has adopted specific methods for controlling daylight overdrafts. The history of the Board's PSR policy, trends in daylight overdraft and payment activity, and a possible future policy direction are discussed in this article. Overdrafts; Payment systems...|$|E
