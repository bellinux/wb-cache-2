The difference in their ranksNiven was a lieutenant-colonel and Ustinov a privatemade their regular association militarily impossible; to solve the problem, Ustinov was appointed as Niven's batman. He also appeared in propaganda films, debuting <b>in</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Aircraft Is Missing (1942), {{in which he was}} required to deliver lines in English, Latin, and Dutch.

500|$|In the beginning, Margaret Weis had {{problems}} depicting Tanis Half-Elven in the novels. Tracy Hickman finally told her [...] "He's James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise." [...] After that explanation, Margaret {{had no more}} difficulty writing about Tanis. Other noteworthy antagonists, and sometimes protagonists, are the Death Knight Lord Soth and Kitiara Uth Matar, the half-sister of Raistlin and Caramon, and leader {{of one of the}} Dragonarmies of Ansalon. According to Hickman, Lord Soth is the most unpredictable character to write about, saying [...] "Every time that character made an appearance <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> books he would try to run off with the story." ...|$|E
500|$|Tite and Cubitt's {{design was}} based around a three-storey main building, {{separated}} from the LSWR's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC's twin rail lines. The private access road was intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly, and to avoid the need for hearses to stop in the public road. The ground floor contained a grand entrance hall and staircase for mourners attending first and second class funerals, a smaller entrance hall and staircase for those attending lower classes of funeral, and two mortuaries which occupied {{the majority of the}} floor. A large room adjacent to the mortuary held a reserve stock of around 300 coffins. [...] Most mourners would have commissioned their own coffins, or used coffins bought by the deceased during their lifetime but, explained an official of the LNC (in 1898) the reserve of coffins was kept so that [...] "should a guest die in a hotel, and the landlord wished to keep it quiet, we are notified, {{and in the middle of}} the night we come for the corpse, and take it away <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> ready-made wooden overcoats". The first floor held the LNC's boardroom, the LNC's funerary workshops, a series of separate waiting rooms for those attending second and third class funerals, and the building's main toilets. The second floor, level with the LSWR railway line, held the train shed covering the two private rail lines and the single platform at which the trains stopped, eight or nine waiting rooms for first class mourners, and further toilets for their use. A steam-powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors to the platform level. A glass roof was positioned in order that no shadow be cast on the hearse carriage waiting at the platform at the time the trains were scheduled to depart, and the western wall was windowless to avoid passengers using the LSWR station being able to see into the Necropolis station. Glass panels inset between the two rail lines allowed sunlight through to the private access road below. Unlike most railway stations of the period, the designs of the first, second and third class waiting rooms were largely identical with only superficial differences.|$|E
