The experimental results suggested {{that the use of}} the novel reverse-cycle hot gas <b>defrosting</b> method for the experimental ASHP unit was able to help shorten the <b>defrosting</b> time by ∼ 3 min or 38 %, and minimize the risk of shutting down the ASHP unit due to low suction pressure through increasing the compressor's suction pressure by about 200 kPa, when compared {{to the use of the}} traditional standard reverse-cycle hot gas <b>defrosting</b> method. In addition, when the TES based reverse-cycle hot gas <b>defrosting</b> method was used, the mean indoor coil surface temperature during <b>defrosting</b> was about 25 K higher than that when the traditional standard reverse-cycle hot gas <b>defrosting</b> method was used.

40|$|Abstract: Air/water {{heat pumps}} for heating systems are {{becoming}} increasingly popular. A major challenge for these systems is the formation of ice and frost in the fin-tube evaporator. <b>Defrosting</b> is usually accomplished by the reverse-cycle or hot-gas <b>defrosting</b> technique. In both <b>defrosting</b> modes, the compressor is in operation. An alternative method is ambient-air <b>defrosting,</b> where the heat pump’s compressor is simply turned off and <b>defrosting</b> is achieved by exposure to ambient air, which is conveyed through the fin tube evaporator by the fan. A model has been developed which permits the calculation of the simultaneous heat and mass transfer during the melting of ice and frost deposits. The theoretical results have been validated by numerous <b>defrosting</b> experiments. The theoretical and experimental investigations revealed that both temperature and humidity of the ambient air strongly influence the total heat flow and the time needed for <b>defrosting.</b> Already at an ambient air temperature of 2 °C and a dew point temperature of 0 °C, the heat flow of ambient-air <b>defrosting</b> is {{comparable to that of}} hot-gas defrosting; energy consumption is decreased by a factor of 8 – 10, however. On the other hand, ambient-air <b>defrosting</b> is less effective at air conditions below the extended fog-isotherm at 0 °C. The application of this technique can significantly reduce <b>defrosting</b> energy consumption and improve the overall efficiency of air/water heat pumps...|$|R

Reverse cycle <b>defrosting</b> is the most widely used standard <b>defrosting</b> method. A previous related study reported that downwards flowing of melted frost due to gravity over a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil would decrease the reverse cycle <b>defrosting</b> performance.
