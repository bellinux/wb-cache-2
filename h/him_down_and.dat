5|$|Bomar, of Vanderbilt, is only shaded {{a little}} by two other ends, largely through the {{experienced}} gained by his rivals against stronger opposition. He weighs 200 pounds, is tremendously fast, and a hardy, defensive player. On attack {{he is able}} to pick the forward pass out of the air on the full run, and, running with a high-knee action quite like that of the redoubtable Ted Coy, if he cannot get by his man, runs <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> goes on over him, still on his feet.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the airstrike, Diệm became hostile towards the American {{presence}} in South Vietnam. Diệm claimed that the American media was seeking to bring <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and political association. The media speculated that the United States would use the incident to justify the deployment of combat troops to South Vietnam in the event the U.S. remained circumspect. Domestically, the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by his officers.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more indifferent to these ideals. The events embittered his last years and he declared in his autobiography that the controversy broke <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> that he admitted it with anger. It is clear {{that he began to}} identify himself with the work and it is possible that he also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E

During an autograph signing session in the schoolyard, Bart is approached by a spokesman for an Internet entertainment site. He wants to make Angry Dad into an online animated cartoon series, and Bart agrees in exchange for stock.

5|$|Darlington {{were the}} first to settle with Gary Bannister a {{prominent}} player in midfield, but Plymouth Argyle eventually found their rhythm and had the first real goalscoring opportunity after ten minutes. Adrian Littlejohn found space after a one-two with Michael Evans, but his first touch let <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> the opportunity was not taken. Darlington's main threat was coming from attacking full back Appleby and he had their best chance of the match midway through the first half. He carved out the initial chance, having carried the ball half the length of the pitch, but team-mate Steven Gaughan was unable to convert. The hasty clearance from Argyle found its way back to Appleby but he sent his shot over the crossbar with goalkeeper Cherry completely exposed.|$|E

5|$|The next night, the ghouls {{leave the}} belfry and float into town {{accompanied}} by their straitjacketed, deformed minions. They {{knock on the}} door of a student. When he opens it, aroused from sleeping, they hold <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream. At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to explain to the others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.|$|E

He tried to pin Yokozuna, although pinfalls are not counted during a Royal Rumble. Yokozuna pushed Savage off of him so hard that Savage flew over the top rope and onto the arena floor.
