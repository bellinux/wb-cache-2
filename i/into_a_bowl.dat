5|$|Teapot: The teapot {{was invented}} during the Yuan Dynasty, tea {{preparation}} in previous dynasties did not utilize a teapot. In the Tang Dynasty, a cauldron {{was used to}} boil grounded tea, which was served in bowls. Song Dynasty tea was made by pouring water boiled using a kettle <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> with finely ground tea leaves. A brush was then used to stir the tea. The innovation of the teapot, a vessel that steeps tea leaves in boiling water, occurs during the late Yuan dynasty. Written evidence of a teapot appears in the Yuan Dynasty text, Jiyuan Conghua, which describes a teapot that the author, Cai Shizhan, bought from the scholar Sun Daoming. By the Ming Dynasty, teapots were widespread in China.|$|E
5|$|The {{ritual is}} {{the central part of}} the celebration. Vespers vary from place to place with respect to the time of the {{beginning}} of the service, its length and structure. The laying of badnjak on the fire usually comes after the service, and is done by a priest or by a respected parishioner. Before the burning, the tree may be processionally carried around the church. In the case of more than one badnjak, the trees are placed in the shape of a cross. The assembled devotees throw then into the fire their twig bunches, each representing a small badnjak. The consecration or blessing is performed by a priest: he strews wheat grains over the badnjak, censes it while singing the Troparion of the Nativity, and as he intones prayers, he pours wine and spreads honey on it. Instead of applying wine and honey, holy water may be sprinkled on the tree by dipping a bunch of basil <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>bowl</b> with the water. This rite is generally performed after the placing on the fire, although it may happen before, in which case the consecration may be performed in the church itself or in its yard.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} styles of {{mandolin}}, but three are common, the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin, the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin.

Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music. Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music. Carved-top instruments are common in American folk music and bluegrass music. Flat-backed instruments are commonly used in Irish, British and Brazilian folk music. Some modern Brazilian instruments feature an extra fifth course tuned a fifth lower than the standard fourth course.|$|E
