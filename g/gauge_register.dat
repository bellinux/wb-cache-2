40|$|Brass {{player and}} teacher usually stress the {{importance}} of the applied mouthpiece force while playing the instrument. First publications by Barbenel et al (1986) and Petiot (2003) proved some myths wrong: Wind musicians are not aware of the real magnitude of this pressure. Its range is between 5 N and 40 N depending on dynamic range and pitch. Today brass player are interested in real-time feedback. In this paper a new transducer for measuring the static forces a player applies to his lips (characterizing his embouchure) is introduced. Three strain <b>gauges</b> <b>register</b> not only axial but also bending forces between mouthpiece and lead pipe. Due to the specific design of the device, the musician can use his own instrument and mouthpiece. Measurement results are captured during a musical performance and simultaneously displayed with the real time waveform. The data acquisition software allows to record the applied forces along with the played sound to facilitate subsequent correlation analysis. The measuring device consists of three strain gauges which are placed radial in 120 ° distance around the axes of the mouthpiece. This gives insight into the 3 -dimensional nature of bending and shear forces eventually created by musicians during playing...|$|R

Background: The CCT {{has been reported to}} be highly sensitive (. 87 -. 89) and specific (. 93 - 1. 0) in the diagnosis of CTS when it is done with thumb pressure. The accuracy of measurements with the Durkan CTS gauge, however, has not been established and the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the CCT when the gauge is used has not been independently confirmed. Methods and Measures: The study sample included 33 women and 19 men, aged 18 to 85 years (45. 7 ± 13. 5 years). The accuracy of the gauge was determined with a force dynamometer and holding frame. Standard nerve conduction studies (NCS) and the CCT were performed on the symptomatic extremity of all subjects. A compatible history and the NCS results were used to confirm CTS. Results: The Durkan <b>gauge</b> <b>registered</b> pressures of 11. 94 psi and 15. 25 psi at the 12 and 15 psi gauge marks, respectively.

A scaled up Derwent would have a 60-inch diameter. The compressor casing was based on Whittle's Type 16 W.2/500 compressor case which was more aerodynamically efficient than that on the Derwent but also eliminated cracking. Other design advances included nine new low pressure-drop/high efficiency combustion chambers developed by Lucas and a small impeller for rear bearing and turbine disc cooling. The first engine start was attempted on 27 October 1944. A number of snags delayed the run until nearly midnight, when with almost the entire day and night shift staff watching, {{an attempt was made}} to start the engine, without the inlet vanes, which had not yet been fitted. To everyone's dismay the engine refused to light - positioning the igniter was a trial-and-error affair at the time. On the next attempt, Denis Drew unscrewed the igniter and as the starter motor ran the engine up to speed, lit the engine with an oxy-acetylene torch. The engine was run up to 4,000 lbf and more, and a cheer went up around the assembled personnel. Upon Hooker's arrival next morning, and informed that the inlet vanes had been fitted during the night, Hooker was satisfied to see the thrust <b>gauge</b> needle <b>registering</b> 5,000 lbf, making the B.41 the most powerful jet engine in the world.

40|$|In several European countries, dental {{composites}} are replacing mercury- containing amalgams as {{the most}} common restorative materials. The problems with dental composites are that they can induce pain for the patient, fracture in the tooth, and gaps between the tooth and the filling which will induce secondary caries. One reason for these problems is residual stress. The factors affecting residual stress are known; it is Young's modulus, volume change, stress relaxation, light absorption, and geometrical constraint, but their relative importance is unclear. A combined modeling and characterization approach has been chosen to determine and quantify the main factors. The material studied was a model composite of known methacrylate resin composition, where the filler fraction was varied. An experimental set-up to measure residual stress was developed based on the bimaterial experiment. The dental composite is cured on an aluminum substrate and two strain <b>gauges</b> <b>register</b> strains in the substrate. From this experiment, the residual stresses in the composite during curing are determined. The numerical master model is divided in submodels. The first one is the cure kinetics model, {{in order to obtain}} the degree of conversion of the matrix as a function of time. From this sub-model, the volume change and the Young's modulus of the matrix are obtained from separate submodels. Micromechanical models are then used to determine composite shrinkage and Young's modulus. From composite properties, substrate properties, and geometry, the stresses in the composite can be predicted from a stress model. To simplify the problem isothermal conditions were supposed. Modeling of the vitrification event is critical as well as the influence of geometrical constraint on vitrification, through free volume. For this reason, special efforts have been put to accurately describe the influence of vitrification on the different submodels. For this reason, a modified pseudo-autocatalytic model was used for the cure kinetics model. A chemical shrinkage model based on viscoelasticity was developed in order {{to take into account the}} non-linear shrinkage with degree of conversion during vitrification. A viscoelastic model for the Young's modulus is also needed, which was obtained using the time-cure superposition principle. The good agreement between experimental data and the model predictions support our model and indicates that the essential physics of the residual stress development process has been captured. The model shows the necessity of a non-linear shrinkage model and the influence of free volume induced by geometrical constraints on all the others properties during vitrification. The parametric study shows the complex interactions between cure kinetics, volume change, modulus development, free volume effects, and rate of volume change. Obviously, shrinkage, modulus, and geometrical constraint are important parameters. But the width of the relaxation spectrum has also strong effects. Light power density has also some effects on the stress level, but much less than expected. This is due to the complex interactions between the different submodels and the fact that some factors, like light absorption or non-isothermal conditions, are not taken into account. The influence of the cavity design and the filling procedure were not studied. I. P. Lingois and L. Berglund, "Modeling Elastic Properties and Volume Change in Dental Composites" submitted to J. Mat.

40|$|To be able {{to monitor}} forces acting on objects is {{important}} {{for a lot of}} dierent applications. In this case the object is a big steel disc and the forces to be monitored are those acting {{on the rim of the}} disc. This is done with strain <b>gauges</b> that <b>register</b> changes in the internal strain eld. This is then run through a system model that outputs the equivalent force for that strain eld. The system model is created through a static system identication consisting of a series of test pushes on the rim of the disc. This method of system identication has a series of problem mainly that it is time consuming. The thesis presents a proof-of-concept of a dynamic system identication method. Instead of pressure applied while stationary the pressure is applied by rotating the disc against another smaller steel disc and performing the system identication on this continuous data. An algorithm to use the data is tested in simulation and the results are analyzed and proven successful. Then a experiment is performed, recording data and running the algorithm. The dynamic system identication is shown to give almost equal results to the static one. The dierence can be accounted for as problems with the force measuring or that the dynamic system identication is actually more accurate than the static one. The algorithm is concluded to work and give an advantage over the old algorithm in form of the time it takes to perform it. It has a possibility to be more accurate and also to {{be able to}} identify forces in more directions than straight into the disc...|$|R

Cultivation of sea objects uses special hydrobiotechnical constructions. As the practice showed, cultivation of seafood is commercially impossible without solving the questions of calculating and designing such constructions. In special literature these questions are poorly covered or not considered at all. In the article the results of theoretical and pilot studies of waves influence on hydrobiotechnical constructions is provided, in particular on underwater fish-breeding cages. This article offers the theoretical {{solution to the problem}} of determining the efforts of the ropes holding the fish tank under wave influences. In order to solve this problem, the equations of hard drives movements were set up and the differential equations of free oscillations of buzz were obtained. When determining the horizontal movements, the four different configurations of connections and the system motion directions in general are possible in case of waveoscillations. Next step is the solution of the differential equations and determination of natural oscillation frequency in the direction of the vertical axis. Defining efforts in the ropes from their own weight (static calculation) is self-explanatory, it should be noted that accounting for the weighing influence of water on such structures does not have significant influence.

40|$|A {{study was}} made that is logically divided into two parts, both {{involving}} radiation damage effects. The first is {{a study of the}} effects of neutron and gamma radiation on the dimensions of two borosilicate glasses, Pyrex® and Hova SD- 2 ®. These two glasses are commonly used as substrates for silicon microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices, and radiation-induced compaction in a substra. te can have deleterious effects on device performance. Results are presented for density changes induced in both glasses by neutron irradiation. Pyrex was shown to compact at a rate of (in [delta]p[rho]/p[rho] per n/cm 2 Ì) 8. 14 x 10 -Ì 20 (thermal) and 1. 79 x 10 -Ì 20 (fast). The corresponding results for Hoya SD- 2 were 2. 21 x 10 -Ì 21 and 1. 71 x 10 -Ì 21, respectively. On a displacement per atom (dpa) basis, the compaction of the Pyrex was an order of magnitude greater than that of the Hoya SD- 2. Our results are the first reported measurement of irridiation-induced densification in Hoya SD- 2. The compaction of Pyrex agreed with a previous study. Our results for gamma irradiations were unexpected. Silicon MEMS strain gauges mounted on glass wafers were gamma-irradiated to hundreds of Mrad. Based on expectations from the literature, the Pyrex was supposed to compact to a level easily measurable by the MEMS strain gauges. Almost no substrate compaction registered in the strain gauges, however. It is hypothesized that the anodic bonding process (by which a silicon wafer was bonded to the glass before etching to create the MEMS strain gauges) was responsible for either 1) changing the bulk radiation response of the glass or 2) creating a layer near the bond interface which somehow prevented the MEMS strain <b>gauges</b> from <b>registering</b> the compaction that was occurring in the glass substrate. While not yet understood, this null result for apparent substrate compaction is of great importance to the problem of mechanically rad-hard MEMS, since it indicates that the response of an anodically bonded Si-glass system to radiation is not simply the sum of the effects on the unbonded materials. To investigate this further, glass samples were prepared in various stages of the anodic bonding process (which involves heating in the presence of an electric field), then irradiated with neutrons. No difference in bulk compaction was noted among the(cont.) treated samples or the untreated glass, but this result may have been influenced by the high temperature at which the glass was irradiated; however, temperature alone could not have annealed away all the effects of treatment. We conclude that the unexpected results of the MEMS strain gauge experiment were caused by surface layer phenomena at the bonding interface, though we do not currently understand the exact mechanism for this. The second major topic of this study is the effect of neutron irradiation on the Young's modulus of silicon, the constancy of which is key to the operation of many MEMS devices. The elastic constants of defected and amorphous silicon simulation cells were calculated using EDIP. Simulation cells included some containing randomly generated defect distributions, as well as several that were completely amorphous and one containing a small amorphous region.
