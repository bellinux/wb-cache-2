40|$|Open {{spaces in}} {{tropical}} climates are highly exposed to solar radiation. These conditions will influence the outdoor energy budget, {{leading to an}} increased heat island effect and reduced human thermal comfort. Trees, however, can influence the microclimate through radiation control that indirectly reduces direct radiation uptake and glare by humans and buildings. This condition affects building energy budget and human thermal comfort. This study compares the effectiveness of Mesua ferrea L. and Hura crepitans L. in shade creation and radiation modification in improving human thermal comfort. The study employed two methods: (i) a field measurement procedure and (ii) a computer-based sun-shading analysis using ECOTECT. The {{results from this study}} indicate that both M. ferrea L. and H. crepitans L. contribute significantly to direct thermal radiation modification below their canopies. The average solar filtration under the tree canopy for M. ferrea L. was 93 %, with 5 % canopy transmissivity, 6. 1 % of leaf area index (LAI) and 35 % of shade area. For H. crepitans L. the average <b>heat</b> <b>filtration</b> under the canopy was 79 %, with transmissivity of 22 %, LAI of 1. 5 and 52 % of shade area. Thus, the study found that M. ferrea L. was more significant as a thermal radiation filter than H. crepitans L., due to the former's denser foliage cover and branching habit. This significant filtration capability contributes to reduce more terrestrial radiation, cooling the ground surfaces by promoting more latent heat, reducing air temperature by promoting more evapotranspiration and effectively improves outdoor thermal comfort in tropical open spaces...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{have generated}} great interest within the {{many areas of}} nanotechnology due to their superior and outstanding physical properties. However effective dispersion in many solvents has imposed limitations upon the use of CNTs {{in a number of}} novel applications. Functionalization presents a solution for CNTs to be more soluble which make them integrate well into any organic, inorganic or biological systems. CNTs can be easily functionalized using cyclodextrin (CD) treatment. The CD modification of carbon nanotubes is both simple and effective. It requires no prolonged <b>heating,</b> <b>filtration</b> and washing which can severely damage the small diameter nanotubes. The formation of surface functional groups and changes of nanotubes structures of functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs) were monitored by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), respectively. From the TGA results, the amount of weight loss of the f-CNTs in varying ratios indicated the amount of CD that was functionalized. It was also noted that the FTIR spectra showed the presence of functional groups associated with CD in the f-CNTs. As a result, the cyclodextrin groups were found to be possibly adsorbed at the surface of the nanotubes walls. The f-CNTs showed substantial solubility in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) which helps in a better distribution of the CNTs in the mixed matrix membrane (MMM) prepared. Hence, the influence of the f-CNTs in the polymer matrix will give rise to enhanced physical properties of the MMM suitable for applications in gas separations. ...|$|R

Infusion of large quantities of make-up air to code based on zone requirements 2. Maintenance of tight wet bulb and dry bulb temperature tolerances within zones based on use 3. Energy management and cost containment 4. Control of mold and mildew and the damage they cause Historically, total air management of sensible and latent <b>heat,</b> <b>filtration</b> and zone pressure was brought about through the implementation of non-integrated, composite systems. Composite systems typically are built up of multi-vendor equipment each of which perform specific, independent functions in the total control of the indoor air environment. Composite systems have a high up-front cost, are difficult to maintain and are costly to operate. Today, emerging technologies allow the implementation of fully integrated system for total building air management.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} antimicrobial properties of honey. In most honey samples, antimicrobial activity {{is due to the}} generation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) by the bee-derived enzyme glucose oxidase, however the amount of H 2 O 2 produced can vary greatly among samples. In addition, honey is a complex product, and other components may contribute to or modulate this activity, which may be further affected by processing procedures used in large-scale commercial production. In this study we examined honey derived from three native Australian floral sources that had previously been associated with H 2 O 2 -dependent activity: spotted gum (Eucalyptus maculata), red stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorrhyncha) and yellowbox (Eucalyptus melliodora). Antimicrobial activity was measured using standardized assays against the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Antibacterial activity was only seen in four of the six red stringybark samples and ranged from 12 - 21. 1 % phenol equivalence. No antibacterial activity was detected in the spotted gum or yellowbox samples. Antifungal activity ranged from MIC values of 19 - 38. 3 % (w/v), and although all samples were significantly more active than an osmotically equivalent sugar solution, most had relatively low activity. All honey samples were provided unprocessed and underwent standard <b>heating</b> and <b>filtration</b> procedures (45 ˚C for 8 hours followed by filtration with a 100 &# 181;m filter), allowing the effects of commercial <b>heating</b> and <b>filtration</b> methods on antimicrobial activity and H 2 O 2 levels to be assessed. Average antibacterial and antifungal activities decreased, but while processing was usually detrimental, occasionally the reverse was seen and antimicrobial activity increased.

40|$|Abstract: The normal {{physiology}} of conditioning of inspired gases is altered {{when the patient}} requires an artificial airway access and an invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The endotracheal tube (ETT) removes the natural mechanisms of filtration, humidification and warming of inspired air. Despite the noninvasive ventilation (NIMV) in the upper airways, humidification of inspired gas may not be optimal mainly due to the high flow that is being created by the leakage compensation, among other aspects. Any moisture and heating deficit is compensated by the large airways of the tracheobronchial tree, these are poorly suited for this task, which alters mucociliary function, quality of secretions, and homeostasis gas exchange system.

Working with these smaller volumes has increased the efficiency of experiments by accelerating the typically time consuming processes of <b>heating,</b> <b>filtration,</b> and drying. Furthermore, when working with hazardous materials, smaller scales minimize the exposure of a chemist to toxic materials and enable easier containment of potentially flammable or explosive systems. The use of microfluidic devices has shown several improvements when compared to traditional batch synthesis. The precise control of reaction conditions enabled within the microreactor format has proved advantageous {{for a wide range of}} single and multiphase reactions. Also, unlike conventional bench-top batch reactions, continuous microreactors are capable of producing both analytical and preparative quantities of material by simply changing the amount of reactor effluent collected. (cont.) The aim of this work was to harness the microsystem advantages of improved safety and process intensification while demonstrating both improved quality and speed of data collection, especially for chemistries that were challenging to explore using standard laboratory techniques. This work required improvements to reactor design, packaging technologies, and experimental techniques in order to use microreactors as a platform for rapidly determining optimum reaction conditions as well as reaction kinetics. Three model reactions were selected to highlight the advantages of microchemical laboratory tools. The synthesis of oligosaccharides served as an example of rapid profiling of the effects of temperature and reaction time. Microreactors improved reaction optimization by reducing waste and dramatically increasing the rate of data collection. High-pressure carbonylation of aryl halides was also explored to characterize the effects of pressure, temperature, and various substrates on product yields. With microreactors, previously inaccessible reaction conditions were explored thus obtaining improved insights into the reaction mechanism. (cont.) Finally, the production of sodium nitrotetrazolate was used to demonstrate the improved flexibility and safety of a modular microchemical system.

However, when compounds with a very low molecular weight need to be separated, very dense PI membranes are required that generally have very low fluxes.

In this work, PI membranes were prepared containing different amounts of gold nanoparticles and the membranes were locally <b>heated</b> during <b>filtrations</b> by irradiation with continuous green laser light. The gold nanoparticles and the membrane structure were thoroughly characterized by UV–visible spectroscopy and diffuse reflection spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The photothermal heating effect on the temperature and the permeance behavior of the membrane depended on the concentration of gold nanoparticles in the membrane, their aggregation and on the laser intensity. It was shown that {{the effect on the}} permeance was higher for membranes with an intrinsically lower flux, due to a lower energy loss by convection in the membrane pores and/or free volume.

Ethylene oxide is highly reactive chemically, and its reactions with many of the components of complex biological fluids cannot be fully anticipated. Regardless of the chemical changes produced, ethylene oxide did not permanently alter the essential qualities of the growth factors in broth and milk which are required by fastidious organisms such as group A streptococci and others. However, its effect on the biological activity of any particular organic compound should be assayed before it can be assumed not to have a deleterious effect. The sterilization of media by ethylene oxide is accompanied by a rise in pH. Fluids which have a relatively high initial pH may require adjustment with sterile acid to return them to the optimal pH for bacterial growth. A mixture of ethylene oxide and broth was toxic to mice for 6 hours after admixture. Toxicity disappeared on incubating the mixture longer, and no residual toxicity could be demonstrated after 6 hours, even on repeated intraperitoneal inoculations. As a means of sterilizing bacteriological media and other biological fluids, ethylene oxide deserves consideration when <b>heat</b> and <b>filtration</b> cannot be used...|$|R
