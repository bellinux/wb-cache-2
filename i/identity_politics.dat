5|$|With {{regard to}} sexual {{orientation}} categories, asexuality may be argued {{as not being}} a meaningful category {{to add to the}} continuum, and instead argued as the lack of a sexual orientation or sexuality. Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one's natural sexuality, and that it is a disorder caused by shame of sexuality, anxiety or sexual abuse, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner. Within the context of sexual orientation <b>identity</b> <b>politics,</b> asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a sexual orientation identity category.|$|E
25|$|Linking the {{political}} and intercommunal schism in <b>Identity</b> <b>politics</b> was criticized by conservative intellectuals. It was argued that Mizrahi identity is an anachronism which endangers the Israeli melting pot.|$|E
25|$|Foucault's {{approach}} to sexuality, which {{he sees as}} socially constructed, has become influential. Foucault's resistance to <b>identity</b> <b>politics,</b> and his rejection of the psychoanalytic concept of object choice, stands at odds with some theories of queer identity.|$|E

25|$|Diprose's {{recent work}} takes {{advantage}} of Merleau-Ponty's conception of an intercorporeity, or indistinction of perspectives, to critique individualistic <b>identity</b> <b>politics</b> from a feminist perspective and to ground the irreducibility of generosity as a virtue, where generosity has a dual sense of giving and being given.|$|E
25|$|Shenhav focuses his multiculturalist program {{mostly on}} around the postcolonialist discourse, but also {{includes}} the postmodernist and feminist ones. For Shenhav, identity is a dynamic, constructivist, random and non-primordial concept, and seeks to deconstruct {{the social and cultural}} constructions (which he sees as basically European) in order develop a perspective that would advance <b>identity</b> <b>politics.</b> Shenhav admits the existence of an asymmetry between the way in which he negates a substantive identity and criticizes the formation of a Hegemonic identity, while encouraging the formation of another substantive identity he wants to liberate within his <b>identity</b> <b>politics.</b> In his opinion, this can be morally justified since an analogy cannot be made between the oppressors and the oppressed and between the rulers and the ruled.|$|E
25|$|While {{initially}} {{used only}} {{to refer to}} radical homosexuals, opinions on the range of what queer includes can vary. For some people, the non-specificity of the term is liberating. Queerness thus becomes a path of political resistance against heteronormativity as well as homonormativity while simultaneously refusing to engage in traditional essentialist <b>identity</b> <b>politics.</b>|$|E

25|$|From a postcolonial and {{epistemological}} perspective obligating <b>identity</b> <b>politics,</b> Shenhav {{believes the}} Israeli society must become multi-ethnic and therefore multi-culturalist. Among his publications {{on the subject}} is the anthology Coloniality and the Postcolonial Condition which included translations of founding texts by writers such as Frantz Fanon, Homi K. Bhabha and Edward Said.|$|E
25|$|By {{destroying}} {{state institutions}} {{and establishing a}} sectarian-based political system, the 2003 US-led invasion polarized the country along Sunni-Shia lines {{and set the stage}} for a fierce, prolonged struggle driven by <b>identity</b> <b>politics.</b> Anger against the United States was also fueled by the humiliating disbandment of the Iraqi army and the de-Baathification law, which was first introduced as a provision and then turned into a permanent article of the constitution.|$|E
25|$|Views on {{the nuclear}} program of Iran vary greatly, as the nuclear program of Iran is a very {{contentious}} geopolitical issue. Uriel Abulof identifies five possible rationales behind Iran’s nuclear policy: (i) Economy, mainly energy needs; (ii) <b>Identity</b> <b>politics,</b> pride and prestige; (iii) Deterrence of foreign intervention; (iv) Compellence to boost regional influence; and (v) Domestic politics, mitigating, through ‘nuclear diversion’ the regime’s domestic crisis of legitimacy. Below are considerations of the Iranian nuclear program from various perspectives.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, Coloured <b>identity</b> <b>politics</b> {{have grown in}} influence. The Western Cape has been a site {{of the rise of}} {{opposition}} parties, such as the Democratic Alliance (DA). The Western Cape is considered as an area in which this party might gain ground against the dominant African National Congress. The Democratic Alliance drew in some former New National Party voters and won considerable Coloured support. The New National Party collapsed in the 2004 elections. Coloured support aided the Democratic Alliance's victory in the 2006 Cape Town municipal elections.|$|E

Chatterji's {{research}} is closely related to her advocacy work and focuses mainly on India. An anthropologist by profession, she has studied majoritarianism, gendered violence, and human rights in Indian Kashmir and communal violence in Orissa. In the context of the United States, she has researched issues related to diaspora and <b>identity</b> <b>politics</b> in American society.

25|$|Decolonized people {{develop a}} postcolonial {{identity}} {{that is based}} on cultural interactions between different identities (cultural, national, and ethnic as well as gender and class based) which are assigned varying degrees of social power by the colonial society. In postcolonial literature, the anti-conquest narrative analyzes the <b>identity</b> <b>politics</b> that are the social and cultural perspectives of the subaltern colonial subjects—their creative resistance to the culture of the colonizer; how such cultural resistance complicated the establishment of a colonial society; how the colonizers developed their postcolonial identity; and how neocolonialism actively employs the Us-and-Them binary social relation to view the non-Western world as inhabited by The Other.|$|E

25|$|LGBT {{movements}} have often adopted {{a kind of}} <b>identity</b> <b>politics</b> that sees gay, bisexual and transgender people as a fixed class of people; a minority group or groups, {{and this is very}} common among LGBT communities. Those using this approach aspire to liberal political goals of freedom and equal opportunity, and aim to join the political mainstream on the same level as other groups in society. In arguing that sexual orientation and gender identity are innate and cannot be consciously changed, attempts to change gay, lesbian and bisexual people into heterosexuals ("conversion therapy") are generally opposed by the LGBT community. Such attempts are often based in religious beliefs that perceive gay, lesbian and bisexual activity as immoral.|$|E
25|$|The {{status of}} Taiwanese culture is debated. It is disputed whether Taiwanese {{culture is a}} {{regional}} form of Chinese culture or a distinct culture. Reflecting the continuing controversy surrounding the political status of Taiwan, politics continues {{to play a role}} in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity, especially in the prior dominant frame of a Taiwanese and Chinese dualism. In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese multiculturalism has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan. <b>Identity</b> <b>politics,</b> along with the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has led to distinct traditions in many areas, including cuisine and music.|$|E

500|$|Hunt's songwriting on {{the album}} is {{characterized}} by resolute lyrics, multi-layered storylines, social commentary, a droll perspective, poetic subtlety, thematic subtext, and whimsy. Songs {{on the album}} are unified by a theme of tension and dissonance in modern life. The songs explore topics and issues in contemporary society and culture, including gentrification, <b>identity</b> <b>politics,</b> and mass consumption, accompanied {{by a sense of}} hope in Hunt's lyrics. Hunt explains the album to have a [...] "loose concept", with songs unified by subject matter concerning [...] "unspoken issues around society", and says of his lyrical sentiments on the album, [...] "It fits my personality that no matter what's going on I'm going to answer it honestly with a wink and a smile. As cliché as it might be, I feel like every situation needs a laugh." [...] L. Michael Gipson of Creative Loafing notes David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz as references points for Hunt's songwriting, and writes that What Were You Hoping For? explores [...] "both sides of the political aisles" [...] with metaphorical songs such as [...] "North Hollywood", [...] "Designer Jeans", and the title track, as well as themes concerning an intimate relationship with the songs [...] "Moving Targets", [...] "Falls (Violet)", and [...] "Cross Dresser".|$|E
