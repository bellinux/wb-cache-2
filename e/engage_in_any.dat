5|$|In {{the third}} week of May 1941 a {{detachment}} of III./JG52, including Graf, was transferred to southern Greece to support Operation Merkur, the German invasion of Crete. The unit flew mostly ground attack and anti-shipping missions during the fortnight it was based there but Graf did not <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> aerial combat.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{official}} Belgian {{withdrawal from the}} Western Alliance, the Belgians refused to <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> official staff meetings with the French or British military staff for fear of compromising its neutrality. The Belgians did not regard a German invasion as inevitable and were determined that if an invasion did take place it would be effectively resisted by new fortifications such as Eben Emael.|$|E
5|$|Jehovah's Witnesses is a Christian {{denomination}} {{whose members}} refuse to <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> political or national practices, such as saluting the flag or performing national service. This was deemed prejudicial {{to the public}} welfare and good order of Singapore, and on 14 January 1972 the Government issued two orders {{to deal with the}} perceived threat to public order. First, Gazette Notification No. 123 of 1972 ("Order 123") was issued by the Minister for Culture pursuant to section 3 of the Undesirable Publications Act ("UPA") to ban works published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society ("WTBTS"), the primary corporation used by Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> {{three or}} {{two forms of}} {{innovation}} has mixed results. For example, the OLS results show that compared to non-innovating firms, <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> either three or two forms of innovation is not associated with labour productivity. <b>In</b> essence, firms <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> three or two forms of innovation are {{not significantly different from}} non-innovating firms in terms of labour productivity. However, in comparison to non-innovating firms, <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> three forms of innovation is weakly associated with an increase in labour productivity among firms with low labour productivity while it is strongly associated with a reduction in labour productivity among firms with high labour productivity. The inverse relationship between labour productivity and innovation is further strengthened among firms with high labour productivity when a firm <b>engages</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> two kinds of innovation.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{suspension}} of NATO flights, former US President Jimmy Carter personally negotiated a four-month ceasefire in Bosnia. Although there were some violations of this ceasefire, most of the parties in the conflict heeded it. NATO ordered its planes back in the air, but due to the diminished hostilities, they did not <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> significant operations {{for the next several}} months. The reduced tensions resulting from the Carter ceasefire and the cessation of NATO air operations also led to the release of most of the UNPROFOR hostages over the next several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women <b>engage</b> <b>in.</b> <b>Any</b> object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E
