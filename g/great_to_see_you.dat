They tried to be intimate and enthusiastic. They appeared to one another exactly as they had in college--as raw youngsters whose present mustaches, baldnesses, paunches, and wrinkles were but jovial disguises put on for the evening. [...] "You haven't changed a particle!" [...] they marveled. The men whom they could not recall they addressed, [...] "Well, well, <b>great</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again, old man.

5000|$|The {{production}} of the film also signaled {{a change in the}} graphic style of Disney's animation. Sleeping Beauty had a more graphic, angular style than previous Disney films, and Dalmatians had an even more stylized look, inspired by British cartoonist Ronald Searle, which would become the norm for Disney animation for years to come. For the movie art director Ken Anderson and color stylist Walter Peregoy worked out a new way of painting backgrounds by leaving out the usual linework. The linework was instead printed on a separate animation cel before being laid over the background. This gave it an appearance similar to the Xeroxed animation. Disney disliked the artistic look of the film and felt he was losing the fantasy element of his animated films. Ken Anderson took this to heart, but Walt eventually forgave him on his final trip to the studio in late 1966. As Anderson recalled in an interview:He looked very sick, I said [...] "Gee it's <b>great</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> Walt", and he said [...] "You know that thing you did on dalmatians". He didn't say anything else, but he just gave me this look and I knew that all was forgiven and in his opinion maybe what I did on dalmatians wasn't so bad. That was the last time I ever saw him. Then a few weeks later I learned he was gone.|$|E

Nevertheless, Wilde still felt indebted to Alexander {{as a result of his}} artistic integrity in producing two of Wilde's plays so successfully. But when Wilde was at the seaside resort in Napoule in December 1898, he suddenly encountered Alexander on a bicycle, as he wrote to Robbie Ross: [...] "He gave me a crooked, sickly smile, and hurried on without stopping. How absurd and mean of him." [...] By the summer of 1900, however, Wilde had forgotten the slight, and greeted Alexander warmly: [...] "It was really a <b>great</b> pleasure <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again, and <b>to</b> receive your friendly grasp of the hand after so many years." [...] Alexander, who bought the rights to Lady Windermere's Fan and Earnest after Wilde was declared bankrupt, voluntarily agreed to spread the payment for the plays over a certain period [...] - [...] to which Wilde responded, [...] "...I know it was dictated by sheer kindness and the thoughtfulness of an old friend." [...] Alexander later willed the rights of the plays to Wilde's son, Vyvyan.|$|R

60|$|This week London {{has been}} {{enormously}} {{excited by the}} Imperial Press Conference. I was rather struck by the extraordinarily small attention, almost amounting to nothing, {{that was given to}} the Dominion that you here are concerned with. No doubt an Imperial Conference raises one or two very delicate questions, as to whether common citizenship is to be observed, or whether the relations between India and the Colonies should remain what they are. I am not going to expatiate upon that to-night, but it did occur to me in reading all these proceedings that the part of Hamlet was rather omitted, because India after all is the only real Empire. You there have an immense Dominion, an almost countless population, governed by foreign rulers. That is what constitutes an Empire. I observed it all with a rather grim feeling in my mind, that, if anything goes wrong in India, the whole of {{what we are talking about}} now, the material and military conditions of the Empire as a whole, might be strangely altered and convulsed. One of the happy qualities of youth--and there is no pleasure <b>greater</b> than <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> in that blissful stage, for one who has passed beyond, long beyond it--is not to be, I think I am right, in a hurry, not to be too anxious either for the present or future measure of the responsibilities of life and a career. You will forgive me if I remind you of what I am sure you all know--that the civil government of 230,000,000 persons in British India is in the hands of some 1,200 men who belong to the Indian Civil Service. Let us follow that. Any member of a body so small must be rapidly placed in a position of command, and it is almost startling to me, when I look round on the fresh physiognomies of those who are going out, and the not less fresh physiognomies of those who have returned, to think of the contrast between your position, and that, we will say, of some of your Oxford contemporaries who are lawyers, and who have to spend ever so many years in chambers in Lincoln's Inn or the Temple waiting for briefs that do not come. Contrast your position with that of members who enter the Home Civil Service, an admirable phalanx; but still for a very long time a member who enters that service has to pursue the minor and slightly mechanical routine of Whitehall. You will not misunderstand me, because nobody knows better than a Minister how tremendous is the debt that he owes to the permanent officials of his department. Certainly I have every reason to be the last man to underrate that. Well, any of you may be rapidly placed in a position of real command with inexorable responsibilities. I am speaking in the presence of men who know better than I do, all the details, but it is true that one of you in a few years may be placed in command of a district and have 1,000,000 human beings committed to his charge. He may have to deal with a famine; he may have to deal with a riot; he may take a decision on which the lives of thousands of people may depend. Well, I think that early call to responsibility, to a display of energy, to the exercise of individual decision and judgment is what makes the Indian Civil Service a grand career. And that is what has produced an extraordinary proportion of remarkable men in that service.|$|R
60|$|Madam, says Mrs. Bargrave, I am {{surprised}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> {{you have been}} so long a stranger; but told her, she was glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her, and offered to salute her; which Mrs. Veal complied with, till their lips almost touched; and then Mrs. Veal drew her hand across her own eyes, and said, I am not very well; and so waived it. She told Mrs. Bargrave, she was going a journey, and had a <b>great</b> mind <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her first. But, says Mrs. Bargrave, how came {{you to take a}} journey alone? I am amazed at it, because I know you have a fond brother. Oh! says Mrs. Veal, I gave my brother the slip, and came away because I had so <b>great</b> a desire <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> before I took my journey. So Mrs. Bargrave went in with her, into another room within the first, and Mrs. Veal sat her down in an elbow-chair, in which Mrs. Bargrave was sitting when she heard Mrs. Veal knock. Then says Mrs. Veal, My dear friend, I am come to renew our old friendship again, and beg your pardon for my breach of it; and if you can forgive me, you are the best of women. O, says Mrs. Bargrave, do not mention such a thing; I have not had an uneasy thought about it; I can easily forgive it. What did you think of me? said Mrs. Veal. Says Mrs. Bargrave, I thought you were {{like the rest of the}} world, and that prosperity had made you forget yourself and me. Then Mrs. Veal reminded Mrs. Bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days, and much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of their adversity; what books they read, and what comfort, in particular, they received from Drelincourt's Book of Death, which was the best, she said, on that subject ever written. She also mentioned Dr. Sherlock, the two Dutch books which were translated, written upon death, and several others. But Drelincourt, she said, had the clearest notions of death, and of the future state, of any who had handled that subject. Then she asked Mrs. Bargrave, whether she had Drelincourt. She said, Yes. Says Mrs. Veal, Fetch it. And so Mrs. Bargrave goes up stairs and brings it down. Says Mrs. Veal, Dear Mrs. Bargrave, if the eyes of our faith were as open as the eyes of our body, we should see numbers of angels about us for our guard. The notions we have of heaven now, are nothing like what it is, as Drelincourt says; therefore be comforted under your afflictions, and believe that the Almighty has a particular regard to you; and that your afflictions are marks of God's favour; and when they have done the business they are sent for, they shall be removed from you. And, believe me, my dear friend, believe what I say to you, one minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your sufferings. For, I can never believe, (and claps her hand upon her knee with great earnestness, which indeed ran through most of her discourse,) that ever God will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted state; but be assured, that your afflictions shall leave you, or you them, in a short time. She spake in that pathetical and heavenly manner, that Mrs. Bargrave wept several times, she was so deeply affected with it.|$|R
