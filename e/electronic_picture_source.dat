The researcher used the ranking lists search and browsing in the Apple Store for browsing various <b>electronic</b> <b>picture</b> books in great number. In the final stage, we screened out six different models {{to be used in}} iPad <b>electronic</b> <b>picture</b> books and conducted the analyses of usability. We selected by purposive sampling 15 adults (including eight teachers and seven mothers) and six six-year-old children (3 boys and 3 girls) who had experiences of using iPad. The subjects at first browsed six <b>electronic</b> <b>picture</b> books. Then 15 adults filled out the questionnaires, six children were interviewed and their operations were observed to understand their preferences and the uses of the products. The research found that the commonalities of the design of iPad <b>electronic</b> <b>picture</b> books a) dominated by page style; b) focused on linear development; c) most of interactive designs of story contents are clicking the objects on the screen; d) provided different languages and audio versions; e) most of them adopted the design of limited animation in which they used zoom-in and zoom-out and diversion techniques to show animations. The recommendations for future publishers and designers were: a) increase the interactions of story content; b) increase traditional Chinese subtitles and voice; c) integrate picture book platforms.

In order for this to work, the exact telecine pattern must be known or guessed. Unlike most other deinterlacing methods, when it works, inverse telecine can perfectly recover the original progressive video stream.|$|R

40|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} stipulations that Congress {{inserted}} into the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA- 97) was the mandate that schools must give students with disabilities access to the very same standards-based curriculum as their non-disabled peers. Just as Universal Design emerged as a paradigm in architecture to meet the physical 2 ̆ 2 access for all 2 ̆ 2 mandates of the Americans with Disabilities Act earlier that decade, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) arose {{as a framework for}} providing students with disabilities entry points to the General Education curriculum. ^ However, since extant examples of curricula designed according to UDL principles are not comprehensive across all content areas, this study inquires into the process one group of educators, serving students with diverse mild through severe special needs, undertook in designing an <b>electronic</b> <b>picture</b> book based on a passage from Whitman 2 ̆ 7 s Leaves of Grass and linked to a specific standard in English/Language Arts. The study documents how the UDL team at this New York City school co-constructed the <b>electronic</b> <b>picture</b> book with students and created challenging opportunities for these students so as to demonstrate the competencies their disabilities so often obscure. ^ Despite having neither explicit knowledge of Lev Vygotsky 2 ̆ 7 s concept of the Zone of Proximal Development nor of Paulo Freire 2 ̆ 7 s critical pedagogy, the educators in this study applied principles that correlate with those advocated by these two theorists. Findings in the study also illuminate new potential for electronic media in the education of students, with and without disabilities, even while revealing that tensions can exist in valuing and evaluating work completed independently and interdependently. The findings also show how the distinction between 2 ̆ 2 teacher 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 student 2 ̆ 2 can at times be blurred in Freirian fashion. ^ In its conclusion, the study argues against one UDL premise, namely that retrofitting curricula necessarily results in an inferior product. Since the medium of an <b>electronic</b> <b>picture</b> book can be expanded {{to address the needs of}} populations beyond those envisioned during the design of the initial versions, retrofitting may not be problematic to the degree that some proponents of UDL suggest. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary-This paper {{considers}} {{a class of}} information sources consisting of text and pictures. The text is English language text appearing in scientific and technical documents. The <b>picture</b> <b>sources</b> are the largely schematic pictures {{that occur in the}} same class of documents. However, the discussion is broadened slightly to include other <b>picture</b> <b>sources.</b> For a tiny fragment of English, the paper shows how the syntactic structure of text may be described, and then goes on to suggest that a similar analysis may be performed on the class of pictures under study. The description of these two kinds of information sources with a single class of descriptive techniques is suggested {{as an alternative to the}} synthetic approach in which artificial languages are specified and then learned and used. The major reason for doing syntactical analysis of such sources discussed here is that several information processing operations, amounting to the interpretation of the information sources looked upon as languages, can be done by the technique of syntax direction which uses the results of syntactic analysis to mediatq subsequent processes for manipulat-ing the information tokens. The paper concludes with an illustration of an algorithm for matching the sentences given by a simple grammar against the class of simple pictures which these sentences purport to describe...|$|R

NMR results on purple bacterial antenna complexes show how the packing of the protein and the pigments inside the light-harvesting oligomers induces mutual conformational stress. The protein scaffold produces deformation and electrostatic polarization of the BChl macrocycles and leads to a partial electronic charge transfer between the BChls and their coordinating histidines, which can tune the light-harvesting function. In chlorosome antennae assemblies, the NMR template structure reveals how the chromophores can direct their self-assembly into higher macrostructures which, in turn, tune the light-harvesting properties of the individual molecules by controlling their disorder, structural deformation, and electronic polarization {{without the need for}} a protein scaffold. These results pave the way for addressing the next challenge, which is to resolve the functional conformational dynamics of the lhc antennae of oxygenic species that allows them to switch between light-emitting and light-energy dissipating states...|$|R
