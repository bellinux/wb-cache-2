5000|$|The {{horse was}} an {{essential}} part of a man-at-arm's equipment. The type of horse, however, varied according to wealth and status. Andrew Ayton in an in-depth study of English warhorses of the 13th and 14th centuries has shown that three types predominate: the destrier, the courser and an animal simply known as a [...] "horse" [...] (L:equus Med Fr : chival). Destriers were both rare and expensive, making up 5% of men-at-arms horses. [...] Ayton also calculated the value of the average man-at-arm's horse in thirteen campaigns between 1282 and 1364, showing it varied between £7.6 and £16.4. In only two campaigns in the mid-14th century did the majority of horses cost more than £10. [...] The horse was, therefore, a major <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the equipment of a man-at-arms. It has been calculated that a French gendarme's horse in the mid-15th century cost the equivalent of six months' wages.The cost of horses meant that the professional soldier might not wish to risk his expensive asset in combat. A system evolved in the 13th century for employers to compensate for horses lost in action. In England this was called by the Latin name restauro equorum and similar systems were in use in France and Italy. In order to secure this insurance scheme, the man-at-arms had the value of his horse assessed and details of its appearance recorded. The assessment system also allowed employers to insist on a minimum value (and hence quality) of horse be presented at muster. In 14th-century England, the minimum value appears in most cases to be 100 shillings (£5).|$|E

The Royal Household was the third most important <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> that the State Treasury financed, after the Army and Navy and the National Debt. On studying spending control in the Royal Household, we have rejected the idea, often advanced by historiography, that there was no spending control within this institution. On the contrary, treasurers and accountants were only able to release funds for expenditure purposes on the basis of prior authorization. However, the efficiency of spending control was very limited due to technical, administrative and, above all, social and political elements.

Selection rules are set for sending and receiving activities for different wireless technologies and according to traffic requirements. Other important parameters are not neglected including the energy associated to the scanning and association phases. Performance evaluations of the proposed mechanism show that less energy can be consumed if appropriate decisions are made. These results are obtained without QoS degradations.

The data consist of supplements to the Danish Household Expenditure Survey (DHES), which is a traditional nationally representative diary-based survey of expenditures. We collect supplementary data of two kinds for all couples (with or without children) in the survey. The first set of additional information is that respondents report on the intra-household allocation of each <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> recorded in the diary. The allowed assignments are 'the whole family', 'the wife', 'the husband', 'the children', 'others', and 'not assignable'. The second addition is an extra set of 'sociological' questions concerning household financial management, autonomy, and family background. We focus on the survey design and give some descriptive statistics from the survey. We also show how the distribution of expenditure on clothing, which is often used to look at intra-household allocation, is related to the distribution of expenditure on other goods. The paper concludes that it is feasible to collect information on 'who gets what' within the household and that some sociological questions provide valuable supplementary information for some issues of interest...|$|E
40|$|This study evaluates food {{expenditure}} {{patterns in}} South Africa using the Engel framework {{which states that}} proportions spent on food fall with income. Non-parametric methods are used to estimate Engel curves, and regression analysis to evaluate the effects of several variables on shares of total expenditure on food using the Working-Leser model. Pooled OLS is {{used to compare the}} exposure and sensitivity to changing expenditure capacity between waves. We find that households were spending proportionally less on food in 2008 compared to 2010 and 2012 and that food is the most important <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> in most households by looking at budget shares. The sensitivity of the share of total expenditure dedicated to food varies with expenditure capacity. The effect of food price inflation on all households in South Africa is conjectured to contribute markedly to this trend, though we cannot confirm that hypothesis with NIDS data alone. The implications for food security is fertile ground for further research on this issue.
