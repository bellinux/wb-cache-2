5|$|In January 1957, Diefenbaker {{took his}} place as Leader of the Official Opposition. In February, St. Laurent {{informed}} him that Parliament would be dissolved in April for an election on June 10. The Liberals submitted a budget in March; Diefenbaker attacked it for overly high taxes, failure to assist pensioners, {{and a lack of}} aid for the poorer provinces. Parliament was dissolved on April 12. St. Laurent was so confident of victory that he did not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> to make recommendations to the Governor General to fill the 16 vacancies in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|Adad-nirari III died prematurely in 783 BC, {{and this}} led to a period of true stagnation. Shalmaneser IV (783-73 BC) seems to have wielded little authority, and a victory over Argishti I, king of Urartu at Til Barsip, is {{accredited}} to a general ('Turtanu') named Shamshi-ilu who does not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> to mention his king. Shamshi-ilu also scored victories over the Arameans and Neo-Hittites, and again, takes personal credit at the expense of his king.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} twenty years Delaware {{politics}} were not unlike those of a state in the Deep South. In spite of a large minority of Republicans in New Castle County, hatred of the Republicans and their policies of racial equality, ran high {{throughout the rest of the}} state. There were years when the Republicans were unable to elect anyone to the General Assembly and years when they did not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> to nominate a candidate for Governor.|$|E

50|$|Angel's {{worried by}} {{the notion of an}} impersonator, but Cordy's just curious why he didn't {{impersonate}} more worthy celebrities. Meanwhile, Lorne reports some bad mojo from Caritas, and needs help. Something is getting under local demons' skins, and <b>even</b> <b>bothering</b> Angel, heightening the aggression of normally rather pacifistic demons.|$|R
50|$|The {{next section}} shows {{a handful of}} {{cartoons}} that his editors rejected (or, in a few cases, that he never <b>even</b> <b>bothered</b> submitting), usually because they were considered in poor taste. Larson responds to everyone who's taken the trouble to complain, with a large print of a boy making a face.|$|R
25|$|The {{next day}} they find a small faerie (who Nick has seen days before) playing with a message that Taloa had left for them, saying she had gone look for her {{surviving}} sisters alone. They catch the little faerie, whom Laurie names Sandspur and assumes to be a hobgoblin, based on the Field Guide. Later that day, two giants start fighting near their house. They escape with Jules, who can see the giants, {{but most of the}} development is destroyed. They go to Jack's house for help, but instead meet Jack's son (simply called Jack Junior), who tells them that he's taking his father to live with him and his wife. Noseeum Jack apologizes to Nick for not helping them and tells him he kept something for them in his backyard, which Nick doesn't <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> to investigate.|$|E
25|$|The events {{behind their}} betrothal began after John William was almost killed by cannon fire and roundshot on two {{different}} occasions. His mother, Henriette Amalia, perhaps realizing how vulnerable her son was, quickly began looking for a suitable bride to ensure an heir. In the end, the choice came down to two German princesses. She apparently informed him that he should think of the choice as between two chairs, {{and that he should}} choose the most comfortable of the two. John duly traveled to Hesse-Kassel and became engaged to the 20-year-old Marie Louise within a week. He did not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> meeting the other candidate. The main factor in this decision was probably that Marie Louise's father was a trusted general under the well-respected Duke of Marlborough. In addition, marriage to a daughter of the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel would also have served to strengthen John William's place among the other ruling houses.|$|E
25|$|This exotic force {{suffered}} from disunity and poor discipline during the preparations {{to invade the}} Nationalist-controlled Inner Mongolian province of Suiyuan in 1936. The majority of them were also poorly armed, with {{only about half of}} them having rifles. They were primarily armed by weapons from the stocks of the defeated Young Marshal, which fell {{into the hands of the}} nearby Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. Among the preparations was the setting up of an air arm for the Inner Mongolian Army, but this air force was a purely Japanese one. It consisted of Japanese aircraft flown by Japanese pilots, who did not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> applying any Mongol insignia to their aircraft and just flew with the original Japanese ones. In total it had 28 planes and were based at a town about forty miles north of Kalgan, the Inner Mongolian capital. They flew several bombing missions against Nationalist targets in an attempt to soften them up for the coming operation.|$|E

Kit is stunned when Dusty hands her a newborn baby and a diaper bag before driving away, not <b>even</b> <b>bothering</b> to tell Kit his name.|$|R
5000|$|Allen {{has written}} that the series was made to answer a {{question}} he had first asked himself when he lost his dog team in the Bering Strait pack ice and his prospects looked grim. Where does the troublesome urge of the British to wander off alone, often without <b>even</b> <b>bothering</b> to give a half-decent excuse, come from? ...|$|R
50|$|Tony also {{realizes that}} despite what Brink's claims, {{there is only}} a 10-cent alarm in the vault room itself, almost {{impossible}} to set off. It appears that Brink's had relied so much on its reputation that it had not <b>even</b> <b>bothered</b> locking the doors. Pino begins to plan a robbery, using the rooftop of a neighboring building as a watch tower.|$|R
25|$|Jake {{constantly}} {{worries about}} Vickie having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent {{in his next}} fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro {{in front of the}} local Mob boss, Tommy Como, and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the middleweight championship title against Marcel Cerdan.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Homer feels bored after Moe {{closed his}} bar to judge {{competitions}} {{and decides to}} spend time with Marge. After his presence at the house becomes too annoying, Marge decides to help him to find a new bar, but when this fails (due to the obnoxious customers), Grampa advises Marge to put Homer in a round of golf, where he will become too distracted to <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> her again. However, before the game begins, Marge meets an elderly man who tells her that he got addictive to golf and barely saw his family again. Marge them realizes that she was going too far and stops Homer from playing, and they both end up having make up sex. In the end, in the reopening of his tavern, Moe explains that he was put on trial and, as punishment for his sociopathic behavior, he is not only banned from California, but is also forbidden from ever judging anything again anywhere in the country (he cannot even express his opinion on how much beer a person could drink before driving). But fortunately for Moe, he is also forbidden from watching the Fox network, something that he acknowledges as being a blessing in disguise, as this leads to an increase of the customers in his bar, including Rupert Murdoch, who asks him to put on The Jay Leno Show.|$|E
500|$|Alec Guinness was {{originally}} offered only four D'Ascoyne parts, recollecting [...] "I read [...] {{on a beach}} in France, collapsed with laughter on the first page, and didn't <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> to {{get to the end of}} the script. I went straight back to the hotel and sent a telegram saying, 'Why four parts? Why not eight!?'â€‰"; he eventually played nine parts.|$|E
5000|$|In {{particularly}} corrupt regimes, {{the voting}} process may {{be nothing more}} than a sham, as officials would simply announce whatever results they want, sometimes without <b>even</b> <b>bothering</b> to count the votes. Such practices tend to draw international condemnation, but voters typically have little recourse, as there would seldom be any ways to remove the [...] "winner" [...] from power, short of a revolution.|$|R
5000|$|The Boston Globe {{reported}} that [...] "His discovery {{is a reminder}} that as specialized as science is, sometimes, a little ignorance may be a virtue. A stem-cell expert would probably never have <b>even</b> <b>bothered</b> to try the experiment Vacanti has been pursuing, on and off, since the late 1990s." [...] However, Vacanti felt that his Harvard team did not get due credit for the origin of the work.|$|R
50|$|Member of Platoon E601 {{with the}} role of sniper. While {{intelligent}} and good at shooting, she's narcissistic to the point of seeing herself as a goddess, not <b>even</b> <b>bothering</b> to practice. It turns out that a lot of her narcissism comes from feeling inferior towards her older sister, but Kanata helps her recover her will to fight. She has feelings for Kanata as well as he accepts her for who she really is.|$|R
500|$|Internal dissent is also {{a regular}} feature of the group. A website {{associated}} with the group describes it as [...] "an Internet gathering" [...] with [...] "a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives". Gabriella Coleman writes of the group, [...] "In some ways, it may be impossible to gauge the intent and motive of thousands of participants, many of who don't <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> to leave a trace of their thoughts, motivations, and reactions. Among those that do, opinions vary considerably." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} Grice's efforts {{the vote was}} held as planned, and to the {{surprise}} of everyone except Dredd, the Democrats actually lost. Democratic government had not existed for over forty years, and most citizens could not remember it. Most did not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> to vote at all, and of those who did, the majority decided to retain the status quo. A two-million-strong mass of democrats marched on the Grand Hall, believing this to be a fix, but Dredd was able to both convince Blondel Dupre that the result was accurate and break her will in front of the others, pressuring her to state in public [...] "you are the law." [...] Discredited and disheartened, mainstream support for democracy faded away.|$|E
500|$|Friday's form {{declined}} {{after his}} strong debut {{and his personal}} life remained troubled and chaotic, leading him to vanish regularly and miss Cardiff matches. He {{was supposed to be}} living in Bristol, but his manager would often find on visiting his house that he had been elsewhere for weeks. Leslie Hamilton, the Cardiff club doctor, later said that he had believed at the time that Andrews was being far too soft on Friday; indeed, according to teammate Paul Went, the forward would simply leave after each match and not be heard of until he returned for the next game. [...] "He wouldn't <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> to have a shower", Went later said, in an interview. [...] "He'd just get dressed, take his carrier-bag with his dry martini and he'd goâ€”no explanation".|$|E
5000|$|Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid {{said that}} the ruling underscored [...] "the {{importance}} of the rules reform Senate Democrats enacted last November." [...] Minority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed with the ruling: [...] "The President made an unprecedented power grab by placing political allies at a powerful federal agency while the Senate was meeting regularly and without <b>even</b> <b>bothering</b> to wait for its advice and consent. A unanimous Supreme Court has rejected this brazen power-grab." ...|$|R
50|$|In another unconstitutional move, Pais on March 11, 1918 decreed {{the direct}} {{election}} of the President by plebiscite, through universal suffrage. Making use of his popularity among Catholics, he was elected on April 28, 1918, obtaining 470,831 votes, an unprecedented number. He was proclaimed President of the Republic on May 9 of the same year, without <b>even</b> <b>bothering</b> to consult Congress, and enjoying direct democratic legitimacy, which he used - unsuccessfully - to crush opposition attempts.|$|R
25|$|He was Liberal {{candidate}} for the Bridgwater Division of Somerset at the 1906 General Election. It {{was the first time}} he had stood for parliament. He was not expected to win as the seat had been Unionist since it was created in 1885. In fact, the Liberal party had not <b>even</b> <b>bothered</b> to field a candidate at the two previous elections. However, in 1906 the country swung behind the Liberals and he gained Bridgwater by the margin of just 17 votes.|$|R
500|$|Marguerite {{remained}} silent of her ordeal for several days, until her husband's {{return on the}} 21 or 22 January. Upon hearing of the encounter, the outraged Carrouges summoned his circle of courtiers and friends, including his mother and most of Marguerite's family, and a council was convened where Marguerite repeated her account of the rape. Carrouges decided immediately to begin legal proceedings against Le Gris but faced great difficulties in prosecuting them as Le Gris was a favourite of Count Pierre, who would act as judge in the case. In addition, the case was weak because the only witness was Marguerite. Indeed, the trial at Argentan was so one-sided an affair that Carrouges and his wife did not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> to attend; Pierre acquitted Le Gris of all charges and furthermore accused Marguerite of inventing or even [...] "dreaming" [...] the attack.|$|E
500|$|For Rise Against, Appeal to Reason {{marked a}} musical {{shift from the}} gritty punk rock that had {{previously}} defined their career, to a more accessible and radio-friendly sound, with greater emphasis on production value. The New York Times felt the album was more tune-oriented than the band's previous works, while John Hanson of Sputnikmusic said that the album is [...] "'appealing' to a larger audience than old fans will be comfortable with". According to Bill Stewart of PopMatters, [...] "Appeal to Reason is a Rise Against album. If you possess {{more than a passing}} familiarity with the band, I wouldn't <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> scrolling through the rest of this review, and I'd certainly avoid checking out the rating at the end of itâ€”because that first sentence, for better or worse, says everything that needs to be said about this album." [...] Critics have characterized the album's music as melodic hardcore and punk rock, with influences of pop punk.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the show, Val was often played up as the good girl character. When asked about whether Val was a weak character, Van Ark said: [...] "God, no. No she wasnâ€™t. For the very reason that she went through so much and landed on both feet. She was strong in a {{realistic}} kind of way. I do remember that TV Guide did a quote that the three of us can be compared to Earth, Wind and Fire. Michele was the Earth, I was the Wind and Donna was the Fire. I think that really captured it." [...] Van Ark was later asked about who she saw Val as today. She said, [...] "Of course the dysfunctional elements would come out. Why <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> otherwise? But of course they would persevere and still be together after all. I think Valene was headed to, and my sisterâ€™s like this, after years of doing everything for her husband and her children, Valene was going to further her achievements in the professional world. I think if you saw Valene today sheâ€™d be much more accomplished as a writer and would be very successful overall." [...] The actress also said: ...|$|E
40|$|Under {{our current}} worldview, it {{is taken to}} be so obvious an {{assumption}} that objects characterized by v = c exist in spacetime {{that it is not}} <b>even</b> <b>bothered</b> to explicitly mention it. This paper will present 4 simple arguments based on the special theory of relativity which at least suggest that this obvious assumption should be put into question. These arguments cannot be considered conclusive, but when considered together they support the case that this question should be seriously investigated...|$|R
5000|$|Richard Bartle {{called out}} as {{advantages}} of permanent death: restriction of early adopters from permanently held positions of power, content reuse as players repeat early sections, its {{embodiment of the}} [...] "default fiction of real life", improved player immersion from more frequent character changes, and reinforcement of high level achievement. Bartle also believes that {{in the absence of}} permanent death, game creators must continually create new content for top players, which discourages those not at the top from <b>even</b> <b>bothering</b> to advance.|$|R

He had not <b>even</b> <b>bothered</b> to read it. A deep, dangerous, dastardly stripling this, who fought to win and only to win. The ticket marked [...] "R. Byng" [...] was in his pocket, and in his ruthless heart a firm resolve that R. Byng and no other should {{have the benefit of}} his assistance.|$|R
500|$|St. Laurent {{was utterly}} {{confident}} {{of an election}} victory, {{so much so that}} he did not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> to fill the sixteen vacancies in the Senate. He had been confident of re-election when Drew led the Tories, and, according to Liberal minister Lionel Chevrier, Diefenbaker's victory in the party leadership race increased his confidence by a factor of ten. At his press conference detailing his election tour, St. Laurent stated, [...] "I have no doubt about the election outcome." [...] He indicated that his campaign would open April 29 in Winnipeg, and that the Prime Minister would spend ten days in Western Canada before moving east. However, he indicated he would first go home to Quebec City for several days around Easter (April 21 in 1957). This break kept him out of the limelight for ten days at a time when Diefenbaker was already actively campaigning and making daily headlines. At a campaign stop in Jarvis, Ontario, St. Laurent told an aide that he was afraid the right-wing, anti-Catholic Social Credit Party would be the next Opposition. St. Laurent denied Opposition claims that he would resign after an election victory, and the 75-year-old indicated that he planned to run again in 1961, if he was still around.|$|E
2500|$|Leland Hoisington, whose 28-year-old daughter, Abbie, {{was killed}} in the fire, told reporters, [...] "I think they should not <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> with a hearingâ€”just let Biechele out... I just don't find him as guilty of anything." [...] The state parole board {{received}} approximately 20 letters, the majority of which expressed their sympathy and support for Biechele, some going as far as to describe him as a [...] "scapegoat" [...] with limited responsibility.|$|E
2500|$|Jim Emerson {{describes}} how the Coens introduced Chigurh {{in one of the}} first scenes when he strangles the deputy who arrested him: [...] "A killer rises: Our first blurred sight of Chigurh's face ... As he moves forward, into focus, to make his first kill, we still don't {{get a good look at}} him because his head rises above the top of the frame. His victim, the deputy, never sees what's coming, and Chigurh, chillingly, doesn't <b>even</b> <b>bother</b> to look at his face while he garrotes him." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{level of}} pain that a baby can handle will be {{different}} for each child. Some may appear to suffer more than others while they are teething. The soreness and swelling of the gums before a tooth comes through is the cause for the pain and fussiness a baby experiences during this change. These symptoms usually begin about {{three to five days}} before the tooth shows, and they disappear as soon as the tooth breaks the skin. Some babies are not <b>even</b> <b>bothered</b> by teething.|$|R
