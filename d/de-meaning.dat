40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{tests for}} (seasonal) unit roots in a univariate time series pro-cess. We construct test statistics which are similar {{with respect to}} both the initial values {{of the process and}} the possibility of (differential seasonal) drift under the (sea-sonal) unit root null. In contrast to existing approaches, where similar inference is obtained by (seasonally) <b>de-meaning</b> and (seasonally) de-trending the process, utiliz-ing all available sample data, we adopt the technique of recursive (seasonal) <b>de-meaning</b> and (seasonal) de-trending of the process. Representations are derived for the limiting distributions of the proposed test statistics under both the (seasonal) unit root null and under near (seasonal) integration. In the non-seasonal case the asymptotic local power of the proposed statistic is compared with the QD de-trended DF tests of Elliott et al. (1996) and Elliott (1999), and found to outperform both of these approaches in the case where the initial observation is drawn from the stationary distribution of the process. We also Þnd in the case of quarterly data that our proposed statistics display superior Þnite sample size and power properties to the conventional seasonal unit root statistics of Hylleberg et al. (1990) and variants of such tests constructed using simple symmetric least squares and weighted symmetric least squares estimation. ∗I am grateful to Peter Burridge, Les Godfrey, Paulo Rodrigues, Richard J Smith, Jeff Wooldridge, an Associate Editor and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper. ...|$|E

We {{show that the}} CCE mean group estimator continues to be valid but the following two conditions must be satis 8 ̆ 5 ed {{to deal with the}} dynamics: a su ¢ cient number of lags of cross section averages must be included in individual equations of the panel, and the number of cross section averages must be at least as large as the number of unobserved common factors. We establish consistency rates, derive the asymptotic distribution, suggest using co-variates to deal with the e¤ects of multiple unobserved common factors, and consider jackknife and recursive <b>de-meaning</b> bias correction procedures to mitigate the small sample time series bias. Theoretical 8 ̆ 5 ndings are accompanied by extensive Monte Carlo experiments, which show that the proposed estimators perform well so long as the time series dimension of the panel is su ¢ ciently large...|$|E
