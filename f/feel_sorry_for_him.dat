5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} the next day, October 1, 2004, with his arm bandaged up, while Kate looks on. She tells Sawyer that she knows {{the letter was written}} when Sawyer was a kid, and also works out that the letter wasn't written to Sawyer, but by him. He tells Kate that his real name isn't Sawyer and that the letter was written to the real Sawyer, a con man, who ruined his family. He ended up {{becoming}} a con man himself, so he took the name Sawyer as an alias. He snatches the letter from Kate and tells her not to <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and to leave.|$|E
25|$|Despite regressing to {{his former}} self, he remembers that he was once a genius. He cannot bear to have his friends and {{co-workers}} <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Consequently, he decides to go to live at the state-sponsored Warren Home School, where nobody knows about the operation. In a final postscript to his writings, ostensibly addressed to Alice Kinnian, he requests that she put some flowers on Algernon's grave in Charlie's former backyard.|$|E
500|$|Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison all later {{stated that}} they regretted {{the manner in which}} Best was sacked. Lennon {{admitted}} that [...] "we were cowards when we sacked him. We made Brian do it." [...] McCartney stated: [...] "I do <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> because of what he could have been on to." [...] Harrison said: [...] "We weren't very good at telling Pete he had to go," [...] and [...] "Historically it may look like we did something nasty to Pete and it may have been that we could have handled it better." [...] Starr, on the other hand, feels he has no apology to make: [...] "I never felt sorry … I was not involved." [...] In 1968, authorised Beatles biographer Hunter Davies wrote: [...] "But for the sake of Pete's career, whatever happened to the Beatles afterward, the handling and especially the announcing of the sacking might have been done more neatly and cleanly. He could have been fixed up with a job in another group before the news was announced." [...] Over twenty years later Mark Lewisohn concluded that [...] "Despite his alleged shortcomings, it was still shabby treatment for Pete, who had served the group unstintingly from their hapless, drummerless Silver Beatles days through three lengthy Hamburg seasons and over 200 Cavern Club performances. He had shared in the heartaches and the headaches, had controlled the Beatles' bookings before Epstein took over, and had made his home – the Casbah – their home. The Beatles had had two years in which to dismiss him but hadn't done so, and now – as they were beginning to reap the rewards for their long, hard slog, with money rolling in and an EMI contract secured – he was out. It was the most underhand, unfortunate and unforgivable chapter in the Beatles' rise to monumental power." ...|$|E
50|$|Afterwards, Malcolm then {{mentions}} {{what happens}} to Spath afterwards and debates whether he <b>feels</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> or not. Dewey, who is under an overturned trash can on which Malcolm is sitting, yells to Malcolm to let him out.|$|R
6000|$|... "She 'asn't got {{the nerve}} to send young Nugent about 'is business," [...] {{explained}} Mr. Kybird; [...] "she <b>feels</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>'im,</b> pore fellow; but 'e's got a loving and affectionate 'art, and she can't bear 'im making love to 'er. You can understand what it is, can't you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The band realises {{that one}} of their songs sums Jeremy up well and they sing [...] "Nowhere Man" [...] about him as he cavorts with their magic. However, as they prepare to leave, Jeremy realizes how {{literally}} empty and lonely his life is and becomes inconsolable. <b>Feeling</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> Ringo Starr offers to take him with them and he gratefully accepts.|$|R
2500|$|Writing for The London Review of Books in February 2017, Michael Wood {{characterized}} {{the film as}} a study of an inherited intergenerational tragedy. He wrote: [...] " [...] there are still ten minutes of late Ingmar Bergman to go. The film keeps showing us Chiron's handsome, inscrutable face. The silence doesn't tell us anything, it just asks us to <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him...</b> All is not lost, though, because as we gaze at Chiron, {{we can think of}} something else: his resemblance to Juan (his father figure). Does it mean that Juan was once a Chiron... Not quite that perhaps, but the last shot of the film is of the young Chiron sitting on the beach... looking out at the ocean... His wide eyes suggest all the desolation and promise that Juan saw in him at the beginning. If we started again, would things be different?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Clarke {{received}} his harshest criticism after first round playoff exits, including {{a string of}} four in five years from 1998 to 2002, and several coaching changes. After Terry Murray was fired following the team's sweep in the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals (some suggested that Murray lost the players' respect by describing the 6-1 loss in game three as a [...] "choking situation"), five more coaching changes {{were made in the}} next five years. Wayne Cashman, Murray's replacement, was replaced three-quarters of the way through the 1997-98, by Roger Neilson due to inconsistent team play. Some suggested Clarke's handling of Neilson, who took a medical leave in February 2000 to undergo cancer treatment and was replaced by Craig Ramsay, was disrespectful. Clarke explained [...] "The Neilson situation - Roger got cancer - that wasn't our fault. We didn't tell him to go get cancer. It's too bad that he did. We <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> but then he went goofy on us." [...] Ramsay guided the team to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2000, but he was fired after a subpar start in 2000-01, being replaced by Clarke's former linemate Bill Barber. Barber was named coach of the year for 2000-01, however under his watch the Flyers suffered two consecutive first round eliminations, as their 2001 playoffs ended with an 8-0 defeat to Buffalo in Game Six, and their offense was held to just two goals by Ottawa during the 2002 playoffs, and this led to calls for Clarke's dismissal after he fired Barber. Clarke hired Ken Hitchcock as head coach for the 2002-03 season and Hitchcock remained until Clarke's resignation four years later, guiding the team to the 2004 conference finals.|$|E
60|$|At {{these words}} Gus began to shed tears. I {{could not help}} but <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and also for my aunt and my cousin Lillian when they should hear the news.|$|E
50|$|In Havana, Cuba, an American dancer called Joe Martin has {{a winning}} lottery ticket. However wealthy socialite Diana Harrison {{also has a}} lottery ticket with the same number. Joe's ticket is {{counterfeit}} so he misses out out on the money. Diana <b>feels</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> an offers to back him in his own night club but then changes her mind after he tries to seduce her.|$|R
50|$|Mike is {{the husband}} of Megan and is {{strongly}} attracted to Alison. While Alison <b>feels</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> because of his loneliness, {{the rest of the}} family find him an annoyance. He is self-pitying, self-righteous, self-indulged and prone to making long drunken diatribes. As David describes him, he is the sort of man who you invite to a party in the hope he can not come.|$|R
50|$|King Arthur - The {{ruler of}} Camelot. He is an {{eccentric}} king who rarely sees his two enemies Sir Rancid and Nanny coming. Nonetheless he is well-meaning and kind as he tolerates Gadabout because he <b>feels</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He underestimates his daughter Elenora {{despite the fact}} she is more than capable of looking after herself. He is occasionally seen with a teddy bear. Played by Kim Wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's pompous and silly," [...] Hilda declared. [...] "Sometimes I <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> {{sometimes}} {{he makes me}} positively wicked; but after all he has his good points. For one thing, he's not afraid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is all}} right," [...] said Clementina's husband. [...] "He is a good man, and he {{is where}} he can do nothing but good. I am glad I needn't <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you knew}} {{just one thing}} I have never told you," [...] she confided, [...] "I think that you would <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> I do, more and more every day, because {{in a way that}} one thing is my fault." ...|$|E
50|$|They {{learn that}} The Wind Boy once owned a horrible mask, but now it's {{in the hands}} of someone else. Now that person is going around scaring children. Until The Wind Boy is able to find and destroy the mask, he cannot have shoes of his own and is the outcast of the Clear Land. Only Gentian, who <b>feels</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> is friends with The Wind Boy.|$|R
5000|$|Frank {{comes across}} another staff party, {{this time for}} a hospital. When asked what his job is {{by one of the}} doctors, Frank lies that he is a {{pediatrician}} at the Death Valley Children's Hospital, working with [...] "snot-nosed kids" [...] and calling himself [...] "Dr. Connors". <b>Feeling</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> the doctor finds him a job at the Atlanta General Hospital, surrounded by nurses who are ready to take the [...] "Doctor's Orders".|$|R
50|$|Lars {{contracts}} {{a concussion}} and a jape on his shoulder. Daan is worse off; once he regains consciousness {{the first thing}} he does is asking for Bo. She's stuck in a guilt-trip and is not allowed to see Marieke's hospitalised brother. Tom, a free agent again, warns Daan that Bo only chose <b>him</b> because she <b>feels</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and that their relationship will not last. Not wanting to lose the both of them, Tom eventually swallows his pride while Liesbeth puts Bo back in action.|$|R
6000|$|Viola again {{seemed to}} dimly divine his thought, for she hesitatingly said: [...] "I am troubled about Mr. Clarke. I must write {{him a letter}} {{and tell him that}} I don't hate him now. I really begin to <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and I wish I hadn't been so hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Codfish is a sneak, {{and always}} was!" [...] burst out Dan Soppinger. [...] "Oh, I know you fellows feel {{inclined}} to {{stick up for}} him," [...] he added, looking at the Rovers; [...] "and {{once in a while}} I <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> myself. But, just the same, he isn't to be trusted." ...|$|E
60|$|VIVIE [rising {{to fetch}} more books] I'm afraid so. Poor Frank! I {{shall have to}} get rid of him; but I shall <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> though he's not worth it. That man Crofts does not seem to me to be good for much either: is he? [She throws the books on the table rather roughly].|$|E
50|$|He {{carefully}} plans his further steps. He {{pretends to}} be the helpless grieving husband of a cancer stricken wife, who won't live much longer. Nirmala <b>feels</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> thus making it easier <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{to get close to}} her. Nobody, not Sharda, not even his closest friend, suspects a thing. One day, Ranjeet bluffs to Sharda that he will be late coming home as he has a meeting. He takes Nirmala out to dinner.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{he assured}} her, [...] "I see. You are crying {{because you feel}} so sorry for him. But I don't <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> Elspeth. If I know {{anything}} at all, it is this: that no man needs pity who sincerely loves; whether that love be returned or not, he walks {{in a new and}} more beautiful world for evermore." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{never spoke}} to him again. Yet I <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> feeble old soul, flitting about in the Illimitable, and always so {{punctual}} to hurry to the telephone, so happy, so feeble-witted and courteous; a better man, perhaps, {{take it all in}} all, than he was in life; lonely, too, it may be, out there in the Vastness. Yet I never called him up again. He is happy. Let him stay.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was exactly}} as Cheeko would have spoken, and I could but <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{even though he}} had insulted me.

60|$|It was {{difficult}} to <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> his own fate appearing to make so little difference to himself. The world was still full of interest to him--not his own particular corner of it: that, he gave me to understand, he had tidied up and dismissed from his mind. It was the future, its coming problems, its possibilities, its new developments, about which he seemed eager to talk. One might have imagined him {{a young man with}} the years before him.|$|E
6000|$|Mary {{remained}} there till lunch was announced {{but refused to}} go down into the parlour, urging that she was expected home for dinner. [...] "And {{there is no chance}} for Mr. Twentyman?" [...] asked Lady Ushant. Mary shook her head. [...] "Poor man!

I don't think girls should ever be in a hurry to marry, and if you can't love him--" ...|$|E
60|$|Lydia still resented Lensky. When {{she thought}} of him, she was always younger than he, she was always twenty, or twenty-five, and under his domination. He {{incorporated}} her in his ideas {{as if she were}} not a person herself, as if she were just his aide-de-camp, or part of his baggage, or one among his surgical appliances. She still resented it. And he was always only thirty: he had died when he was thirty-four. She did not <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He was older than she. Yet she still ached in the thought of those days.|$|E
50|$|Liberty {{begins a}} {{relationship}} with Gabriel, nearly ending her friendship with Parker. Parker and Gabriel butt heads over her, as Parker doesn't believe Gabriel {{is good enough for}} her and even tells him she's only seeing <b>him</b> because she <b>feels</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Parker, who knows Gabriel is a thief and might get her into trouble, tries to talk sense into Liberty. She continues the relationship, believing Parker is making up lies because he is jealous. She nearly sleeps with Gabriel, but stops, telling him she's not ready. Gabriel tells Parker a different story, suggesting they had been intimate several times.|$|R
