Examples of this universality of coverage are national <b>flat-rate</b> <b>pensions</b> available to all once they reached a certain age, regardless of what they had paid into the plan, and national health plans based on medical needs rather than on financial means. In addition, the citizens of the Nordic countries have a legal right to the benefits provided by their welfare systems, the provisions of which were designed to meet what was perceived as a collective responsibility to ensure everyone a decent standard of living.

40|$|The Czechoslovak {{communist}} retirement protection scheme {{resembled the}} Bismarckian earnings-related pensions, with new benefits close to final salaries {{and with their}} insufficient indexation. The aim {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the reform processes in Czechia and the potential for a simple technical reform that would make the public retirement schemes understandable and efficient. In the process of the transition to capitalism under liberal Czech governments, the prevailing concept of the public retirement scheme changed to a Beveridge model of pensions not being related to previous wages. The insufficient valorisation of bend points was the main method of this transition. Modern international pension theory recommends the separation of a solidary pillar and an earnings-related pillar. After the Czech “small” pension reform, a basic technical reform may be simply realised, resulting in a higher <b>flat-rate</b> <b>pension</b> and an NDC pension insurance scheme, convenient to parties with programmes based on three basic welfare regimes.

40|$|Recent {{reforms that}} aim at {{reducing}} the upcoming burdens of population ageing might seriously harm low income individuals. An increase in old-age poverty and disability {{will be the}} result. Under this prospect, the present paper quantitatively characterizes the optimal progressivity of unfunded pension systems in an overlapping generations model with idiosyncratic income, disability and longevity risk as well as endogenous labor supply at the intensive and extensive margin. Focusing on the German pension system, our model features the most recent demographic projections and distinguishes three skill classes with skill-dependent risk profiles. Starting from a baseline path that reflects a purely earnings related pension system, we increase the degree of progressivity and compute the resulting macroeconomic, welfare and efficiency effects. For our most preferred parametrization we find an optimal <b>flat-rate</b> <b>pension</b> share of 40 percent. This indicates that in Germany recent reforms that aim at raising retirement age and cutting benefit levels should be complemented by increases in pension progressivity, since improved insurance provision dominates higher labor supply distortions. In addition, we also find that reductions in the benefit level (i. e. privatization) will only reduce economic efficiency. stochastic OLG model, tax-benefit linkage, endogenous retirement, population ageing...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of non-traditional approach to reforming the pay-as-you-go pension system by introducing {{a link between the}} number of children and the amount of pension, which is known as the Children PAYG. An analysis of the concept in general and of specific proposals for reform with its application is performed in the analytical part. Attention is also given to related topics.

One of the main outputs of this thesis is a summary of positive and negative features of the Children PAYG concept. The concept is considered applicable in domestic conditions based on this analysis. Finally there are two recommended approaches to the Czech pension reform, the first one is based on the concept of Children PAYG with limiting the role of family policy, the second one is based on maintaining current pay-as-you-go system in a limited form of so-called <b>flat-rate</b> <b>pension</b> with strengthening the role of family policy in financing the costs of raising children...|$|E

5000|$|The public {{pension system}} in Japan is obligated to review its own {{financial}} stability {{every five years}} and thus it is reformed to a degree every five years, with some notable reformation years. In 1942 the KNH, Employees Pension Insurance, was formed for private sector employees and in 1954 was rebuilt, replacing the previously established earnings-based pension model with a two-tier model including a basic flat-rate feature. Disparity existed between private and public sector pension plans as public sector pension benefit levels were generally better and more widely covered, and to address the lack of coverage for certain private sector employees the KN, National Pension law, was passed in 1961 which set up a compulsory savings system requiring everyone from self-employers to the jobless to pay a flat-contribution rate {{on an individual basis}} for a flat-rate benefits package. In 1986, women obtained a way into the pension system through their husbands via contributions deducted from his pay, which entitled the wife to a <b>flat-rate</b> basic <b>pension</b> plan.

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{abridged}} {{version of an}} IGPS working paper of the same title published October 2013. The working paper was commenced earlier in the year, but completion became timely after the government put out a discussion document outlining the Flexi-Super concept and invited submissions. Accordingly, {{this is not a}} response to the discussion document per se, but rather a holistic review of the policy option of letting people select starting dates for New Zealand Superannuation (NZS). • Conceptual basis for New Zealand superannuation Behind the idea that individuals can have a choice about the age at which their New Zealand Superannuation commences is the notion that NZS is an individual entitlement: a pot of money, if you will. This is unambiguously wrong. The object of NZS, simply put, is to ensure that all New Zealand residents above a certain age (currently 65) have sufficient income to be able to participate in society, to at least a certain minimum acceptable extent. The level of NZS is therefore intentionally above that which might be considered necessary to alleviate poverty, certainly in the sense of destitution. Behind this policy lies an egalitarian solidarity which requires a minimum equal income to be provided to each and every older New Zealander as of right. 3 It takes the form of an income stream, expressed in statute. A change in statute can change the income, and indeed this has happened at different times in the past. A change can be challenged politically, but it cannot be challenged legally because there is no property right; that is, there is no entitlement enforceable in a court of law. Some countries do offer flexibility of eligibility age and a consequent adjustment in pension payments. However, most of these, such as Sweden, feature an individual pension entitlement based on individual contributions. Only Ireland is like New Zealand in having a level universal pension regardless of paid employment history, and Ireland offers no flexibility. The United Kingdom is moving towards a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>pension</b> (operating alongside a voluntary but strongly tax- favoured private pension system), and has a deferral arrangement which permits any pension not taken to be accumulated and paid later either as a taxed lump sum or as additional pension. The Australian means-tested <b>flat-rate</b> <b>pension,</b> which operates alongside tax-favoured compulsory superannuation savings, can also be deferred. But neither of these state pension schemes is strictly comparable to New Zealand’s, and neither offers early pension at a reduced level. For completeness one should record that there are issues in respect of the affordability of NZS, important to its continuation. These are not, however, the focus here, and Flexi-Super does not purport to address them in any case. In short, there is no legal or moral basis within NZS to posit an individual pension pot to support exercise of choice. Further, the core principle and purpose of NZS would disappear were any group to receive a lower amount of benefit than others, or were any group to receive more...|$|E

This paper uses the IMF''s Global Fiscal Model to compare the macroeconomic effects of different fiscal strategies to accommodate the rise in age-related spending.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{illustrate}} how pension and housing systems together affect poverty among the elderly. We analyse Belgium, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands, each with different combinations of pension and housing institutions. Using EU-SILC data for 2009, we distinguish between income-poverty and deprivation, the former to evaluate the performance of pension systems and the latter to judge how the impact of housing systems on income-poverty translates into deprivation. The focus is on risk groups such as the separated, the widowed, the former self-employed and retirees with short or irregular employment histories. The findings are that pensions, since they often exclude particular groups, such as households with less than 25 years of employment, increase the elderly income-poverty risk for those groups. The risk of being income-poor is somewhat alleviated in the case of a generous <b>flat-rate</b> public <b>pension,</b> but even then households with less than 25 years of employment have higher levels of income-poverty. Outright home-ownership provides households the opportunity to live rent-free and thus yields income-in-kind. Housing systems in which home-ownership is dominant often also have high levels of outright home-ownership among the income-poor elderly, compensating for the low income-in-cash that they receive as a pension, thus reducing deprivation.

50|$|Finland's first {{national}} old-age pension plan dates from 1937, {{but it was}} so poorly funded that a new National Pensions Act was put into effect in 1957. In the late 1980s, this law, somewhat reformed, was still the basis of Finland's National Pension Plan, which was open to all residents over the age of sixteen, even to those who had never paid into it. Even those foreigners not from the Nordic countries were entitled to this pension if they had resided in Finland for at least five years. Those who left for residence in a country outside Nordic Europe, even those who were Finnish citizens, could receive the pension for only one year. The <b>flat-rate</b> national <b>pension</b> could be paid as an old-age pension, once a person reached the age of sixtyfive; as an invalidity pension (either full or partial) to those between the ages of sixteen and sixty-four who were no longer able to work; or, in some cases, to the long-term unemployed who were in their late fifties or early sixties. In addition to these classes of beneficiaries, survivors of those eligible for national pensions who were not themselves eligible for the pensions could receive pensions {{under the terms of the}} Survivor's Pension Plan. Also tied to the National Pension Plan were payments for handicapped children living at home and for some combat veterans of World War II.|$|R
40|$|The pension {{structures}} of the Nordic countries are often described as statist structures. Generous public pensions are supposedly crowding out private pension alternatives (including occupational pensions). It is argued that these systems unite the pension-political interests of workers and marginal groups resulting in stable "pension regimes". This paper questions these statements. It argues that old political tensions are "built into" the institutional designs of the Nordic pension systems. There is a general tendency away from <b>flat-rate</b> "universal" <b>pension</b> arrangements toward dual systems in which the working population receives earnings-related pensions and the non-working (marginal groups) receive means-tested benefits. This development fits in with Gordons (1988) hypothesis that a convergence process {{is taking place in}} industrialized countries toward "two-tier" systems. High tax levels, gloomy demographic forecasts and increased competition at the world market have led the Nordic countries to consider cutbacks in their public pension systems. Tax subsidies to occupational and individual pension plans have also been cut back, partly to increase government revenue and partly to create increased competition in the markets for different types of financial assets. Recent changes in regulation policies also aims at creating increased competition in the private pension sector. If this trend prevails, a larger and more diversified private pension sector is likely to emerge in the Nordic countries in the future...|$|R
40|$|Pension {{systems in}} European {{countries}} are under review due to demographic changes. As {{a solution to}} the graying population, second and third pillar pensions are advocated. However, {{it is important not to}} lose sight of the social consequences of encouraging these private pensions. In this master thesis the paradox of redistribution from Korpi & Palme (1998) is tested on two cases namely Belgium and the Netherlands. Based on micro data on household income as found in the LIS database, pensioners are compared on their poverty rates and inequality. The redistribution paradox states that poverty will be the highest in pension systems that are targeted and will be the lowest in universal systems. In Belgium (targeted minimum pension) poverty rates are much higher than in the Netherlands (universal minimum pension). Poverty rates are higher for elderly women than for elderly men and this gender difference is greater in the Netherlands than in Belgium. The paradox of redistribution further states that inequality will be higher when the first pillar provides flat-rate pensions and will be the lowest for wage coupled pensions that out compete more unequal private pension provisions. In the Netherlands (<b>flat-rate</b> <b>pension),</b> inequality is higher than in Belgium (wage coupled pension) when calculated on the basis of pension income. When disposable income is taken as reference than the inequality is slightly larger in Belgium than in the Netherlands. There is however a much larger reduction in inequality compared to pre-pensioned individuals in Belgium than in the Netherlands. The inequality in income is higher for men than for women both in Belgium and in the Netherlands. In order to minimize poverty and inequality, it is thus advised to further strengthen the pensions systems in both Belgium and the Netherlands not to reduce them...|$|E
40|$|Many {{countries}} are considering far-reaching pension reform. This {{is happening in}} response to growing demographic pressures in some countries (especially in Western and Eastern Europe), to unsustainably generous benefits in others (especially in Latin America), or to failure to ensure the profitable investment of accumulated funds (as seems to be true with national provident funds in African countries). Given the worldwide interest in reform, one could ask: Is there a blueprint for pension reform? Can lessons learned in different countries be combined in a best-practice structure usable in different countries'pension systems? The author reviews the experience of Switzerland, Chile and Singapore, countries with relatively successful economies and pension systems. He suggests a multipillar pension system - which he dubs Swiss Chilanpore - that would blend the hard-headed softness of the Swiss, the expensive yields of the Chilean scheme, and the ruthless efficiency of Singapore. He emphasizes that: there is no perfect pension system - all systems suffer from the problems of moral hazard, adverse selection agency costs, and free riders; and all well-functioning pension systems require good government and good management. All pension systems {{have to cope with}} the problems of long-term uncertainty. For these reasons, the author favors a multipillar approach that diversifies across different providers. Swiss Chilanpore would have two compulsory and two voluntary pillars: a first pillar (drawn from the Swiss model) consisting of two parts, a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>pension</b> proportional to the length of a person's career and an earnings-related pension based on annual actualized lifetime earnings; a second pillar consisting of a central agency, which could be public or private, for record-keeping and other centralized functions, and private fund management companies for investing funds, the point being to keep operating costs down and achieve high investment returns; and third and fourth pillars based on occupational pension schemes and personal savings. The proposed structure would aim to combine the strengths and avoid the weaknesses of the three countries'systems, but the author cautions that no reform proposal would apply equally well in all countries, regardless of local circumstances and conditions.

40|$|Using {{a dynamic}} cohort microsimulation model (LIFEMOD), the authors examine the {{life-cycle}} distributional {{consequences of a}} variety of pay-as-you-go (PAYG) and funded pension systems. This technique allows them to investigate both the socioeconomic characteristics and the number of people affected by a change in contribution or eligibility rules in any pension system. LIFEMOD uses 1985 parameters for the United Kingdom so specific results are not valid for other countries. But winners and losers are likely to be similar across countries. They find the following: Women benefit much more than men in a flat-rate PAYG system. In simulations, 84 percent of surviving women but only 33 percent of surviving men are net beneficiaries, because women have higher life expectancy and lower lifetime earnings. Imposing minimum contributions substantially reduces the number of women who qualify for a pension. Imposing a joint contribution rule on the earnings of married couples significantly increases the number of women qualifying without significantly reducing the proportion of qualifying men. In funded pension systems, on average men accumulate much more pension capital than women do because of men's higher earnings and more continuous paid work. Different rates of real interest and earnings growth affect individuals'fund accumulation differently. Women benefit more from high rates of return and low earnings growth because they tend to receive a higher proportion of their lifetime earnings when young. But some men and many women fail to achieve minimum pension levels. If the pension shortfall is compensated for by lump-sum capital top-ups, women receive 93 percent of top-ups (70 percent if joint contributions are used). In hybrid pension systems that combine both PAYG and funded elements, the higher the proportion of PAYG payments, the greater the replacement rate for people in the bottom 40 percent of the lifetime earnings distribution (the majority of whom are women). But replacement rates for people in the middle of income distribution are insensitive to any variant of the PAYG-funded combination. In short, <b>flat-rate</b> pay-as-you-go <b>pension</b> plans and funded pensions produce very different distributional outcomes, the single most important determinant of which is the different lifetime employment and earnings records of men and women.

But in practice the rates of benefit and pension since the operation of the National Insurance Scheme have not yet reached subsistence level as Beveridge defined it. Year after year rising prices have eaten away the real value of the pension, then nearly a million and more retirement pensioners and their wives are forced to rely on supplementation from the National Assistance Board Why is it? One reason is the increase in prices; another-even more important-is the structure of National Insurance itself. The national contributory pension has always been a flat-rate payment in return for a flat-rate contribution. But the limitations of this system set an important social problem. The contributions must necessarily be fixed at a level which the lower-paid can afford and therefore are not even sufficient to pay for the present level of pensions. Even apart from this the pension scale possible under a flatrate scheme is necessarily restricted. This restriction dose not matter much to the higher-paid worker if he is also getting further pension rights in an occupational scheme. But despite their encouraging growth, occupational schemes do not yet cover much more than one-third of the total working population including half the men and seem unlikely to cover nearly everybody, at any rate for some time to come. The alternative is some graduation of contributions and pensions according to earnings. It has long been known that the Labour Party was preparing a proposal for a new National Superannuation Plan for persons reaching retiring age. This plan of the Labour Party has been maked public in May 1957. The Labour proposes that there shall be a national pension consisting of two parts - a flat-rate part and a part graded as a percentage of earnings. According to the plan, the basic pension payable at 65 to all insured workers would be increased immediately from ￡ 2 to ￡ 3. It would be supplemented by a super-annuation system related to earnings, which would be compulsory for everyone not participating in an approved private scheme or possessing adequate provision for old age. The aim of the plan is to ensure that, in return for extra contributions, a pension equivalent to 'half-pay' at 65 for the average wage-earner is reached. The employee would contribute 3 per cent of his earnings, the employer 5 per cent and the Exchequer 2 per cent of the total earnings of the community. Self-employed persons would contribute 8 per cent. The maximum benefit would be ￡ 750 a year. Payment of pensions might not be, as at present, conditional on retirement. The Labour's national superannuation benefit would be based on life earnings, taking account of their real value from the beginning of the worker's career and of the increase in the national income which had occurred since that time. Contributions in each year of working life would be related to the level of average of national earnings in the year when the pension was assessed. Opposing the Labour's plan, programm Government's programme to put the National Insurance Scheme on a sound financial footing and at the same time to introduce into it a measure of graduated contributions and retirement pensions related to earnings is announced in a White Paper on 14 Oct. 1958. The main features of Government's proposals are. (1) The basic <b>flat-rate</b> <b>pensions</b> would stay as they are now for all contributors, although those earning ￡ 9 a week or less would pay a smaller con- tribution. (2) On earnings between ￡ 9 and ￡ 15 a week workers (and employers) would pay graduated contributions of 8. 5 per cent of earnings, as P. A. Y E. deductions, in return for a wage-related supplementary pension (8) The Exchequer would support the new scheme by a yearly payment of ￡ 170 m. (4) To meet the rapidly rising cost of retirement pensions, contributions would have to be increased at five-yearly intervals during the first twenty years and would not add to graduated pensions. Thus, both the Government's scheme and the Labour's plan take bold step away from the universal flat-rate system, departing from the Beveridge principle of treating all men equally in social insurance irrespective of their rates of wages or other earnings. Both of them envisage adding a new graded superannuation pension to the existing National Insurance pension, while permitting approved private schemes to contract out' on certain conditions. But, on careful comparison, the grading in the Government scheme is a financial device for getting-more money to support the scheme. It looks as if one aspect of it is the purpose of keeping the Exchequer contribution down to a steady ￡ 170 m. In other words, it is a financial scheme even more than a pension scheme. On the contrary, the Labour proposed scheme, though it may be much more costly than envisaged and may be inflationary, leads to a very substantial redistribution of income from the higher-paied skilled worker to the unskilled worker and from the young to the old...|$|R
40|$|The {{old days}} in the now {{transition}} societies were characterized by stagnant incomes, rationed goods, and few civil liberties, but {{a high degree of}} income security. The early days of reform have brought crashing incomes, more goods, civil liberties, and rising insecurity. Most countries are set on a course toward some form of capitalism, which by definition means greater risk-taking, less security, and almost certainly greater inequality in income distribution. Should transfers be used to compensate for increasing insecurity and poverty? The short-run drop in incomes, the heritage of cradle-to-grave state protection, and the Western European vision of the welfare state provide compelling motivation for using transfers. But, argue the authors, there are significant tradeoffs between moving to a welfare state and shifting to dynamic, growing economies. The transition economies do not have the real levels of productivity or the tax bases needed to sustain the kind of tax effort a large-scale system of transfers would require. Short-run gains in security could in the long run mean insufficient private and public capital accumulation and lack of competitiveness. The result could be financial collapse (as witnessed in Ukraine) or an extreme form of Eurosclerosis (a possibility for Hungary or Poland). Under either scenario, those whom the transfers are supposed to protect - the old, the poor, the disabled, and the unemployed - are most likely to suffer disproportionately over the medium to long term, and probably even in the short term. In any viable scenario, transfers are likely to be important for both welfare and political reasons. Some options for providing transfers {{are more likely to be}} consistent with macroeconomic imperatives and to have relatively low adverse-incentive effects - for example, <b>flat-rate</b> (or flatter) <b>pensions</b> at quite low replacement rates, and local rather than general (income-tested) social assistance. The authors recommend using intrisically temporary measures - such as temporary employment schemes - in the transition. This avoids a permanent transfer burden while recognizing the severity of the interim transition period. In sum, the alternative of less reliance on comprehensive transfers puts more pressure on private coping mechanisms and will, in the short run, increase risk. But it may be the price of a viable transition to the growth that is essential to success.
