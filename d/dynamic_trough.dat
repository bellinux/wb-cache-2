The first cruise, included 38 stations and one time series station. The second cruise {{was sponsored by the}} Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANOCEANO) and occupied nine sections along the coast. A total of 86 stations and two time series stations were occupied during the second cruise. CTD calibration and data processing methods are described. The isosteres, current vectors, and salinity distribution from the cruises provide a clear picture of the circulation pattern during the fall 2002. A strong shoreward, anticyclonic meander of the California current was observed. Although the meander itself did not cross the <b>dynamic</b> <b>trough</b> that separated inshore and offshore currents, {{at the point where the}} meander was adjacent to the trough, a ridge formed which transported Subarctic waters into the coastal zone. These fresh waters were advected to the north and south along the coast, depending upon the direction of nearshore currents. The observed mesoscale circulation showed the manner in which waters which are upwelled at the coast in summer are replaced by oceanic waters in the fall and winter. Analysis of the geography of the deep sound channel (DSC) during this period showed that the mean pressure of the DSC was at 586 dbar while the mean sound speed minimum was 1480 m/s. The minimum sound speed varied 3 m/s while the pressure of the minimum varied by 330 dbars. The shape of the pycnocline controlled the pressure and depth of the DSC in the region.

In the absence of detailed field measurements, a quasi steady flow analogy was applied to investigate an undular tidal bore with inflow Froude numbers 1. 6 and 1. 25. Experimental results indicated that rapid flow redistributions occur beneath the free-surface undulations, with significant variations in bed shear stress between wave crests and <b>troughs.</b> <b>Dynamic</b> similarity was used to predict detailed flow characteristics of tidal bores with inflow Froude number between 1. 3 and 1. 6.

40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (FRP) {{are gaining}} increasing popularity for upgrading, repairing and rehabilitation of existing structures thanks to many interesting advantages against traditional structural materials. Composite applications in civil engineering, {{that range from}} embedded non-metallic reinforcements to externally bonded strengthenings, are generally much more recent than other FRP applications, for this reason several questions regarding {{the assessment of the}} strengthening effectiveness as well as long term behaviour and durability of the application remain still unsolved. Elmi-Pandolfi building, an historical structure dated 1600 that was seriously damaged in the earthquake of 1997, has been repaired and retrofitted including carbon FRP (CFRP) strengthenings externally bonded to some vaults and walls. Since an innovative strengthening technique intended to lock-out the possible failure mechanisms with CFRP tapes was used for the vaults, its effectiveness has been experimentally proved <b>trough</b> <b>dynamic</b> testing. Furthermore a fibre optic monitorage network based on distributed Brillouin strain sensing was embedded in the CFRP strengthenings in order to evaluate the durability of the application especially in case of further seismic shocks. In this paper the dynamic tests carried out on the biggest of the repaired vaults and preliminary experimental tests characterizing the Brillouin distributed sensing performances are presented...|$|R
40|$|The Catholic Cathedral is {{classified}} as a category 1 listed heritage building constructed largely of unreinforced stone masonry, and was significantly damaged in the recent Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011. In the 2010 event the building presented slight to moderta damage, meanwhile in the 2011 one experienced ground shaking in excess of its capacity leading to block failures and partial collapse of parts of the building, which left the building standing but still posing a significant hazard. In this paper we discuss the approach to develop the earthquake analysis of the building by 3 D numerical simulations, {{and the results are}} compared/calibrated with the observed damage of the 2010 earthquake. Very accurate records were obtained during both earthquakes due to a record station located least than 80 m of distance from the building and used in the simulations. Moreover it is included in the model the soil structure interaction because it was observed that the ground and foundation played an important role on the seismic behavior of the structure. A very good agreement was found between the real observed damage and the nonlinear <b>dynamic</b> simulations described <b>trough</b> inelastic deformation (cracking) and building´s performance...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al XIX Congreso de la Sociedad Española de Parasitología (II Encuentro Internacional de Parasitólogos de España, Francia, Italia y Portugal), celebrado en Vitoria-Gasteiz del 23 al 25 de julio de 2015. Ticks are blood feeding {{arthropod}} ectoparasites that transmit pathogens causing {{diseases in}} {{humans and animals}} worldwide. Among these vector-borne pathogens, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) has become an important tick-borne pathogen in the United States, Europe and Asia, with increasing numbers of affected people and animals every year. The natural infection cycle of A. phagocytophilum is dependent upon the presence of infected vertebrate reservoir hosts and Ixodid tick vectors. A. phagocytophilum is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium that multiplies within a parasitophorous vacuole or morula inside tick and vertebrate cells. Tick-host-pathogen interactions have evolved <b>trough</b> <b>dynamic</b> processes involving genetic traits of hosts, pathogens and ticks that mediate their development and survival. A. phagocytophilum morulae can be easily observed in human HL- 60 cells, but not in I. scapularis ISE 6 cells, in which A. phagocytophilum appears highly pleomorphic, suggesting that specific strategies are devised by this bacterium when colonizing distinct hosts. However, as discussed here, molecular characterization of the host/tick-pathogen interface has provided evidences that the bacterium uses similar strategies to establish infection in vertebrate hosts and tick vectors. These strategies include remodeling of the cytoskeleton, inhibition of cell apoptosis and manipulation of the immune response. The evolution of similar strategies for A. phagocytophilum infection of vertebrate and tick cells suggest the possibility of developing strategies to control pathogen infection in both vertebrate hosts and tick vectors.

40|$|Ticks are blood feeding {{arthropod}} ectoparasites that transmit pathogens causing {{diseases in}} {{humans and animals}} worldwide. Tick-host-pathogen interactions have evolved <b>trough</b> <b>dynamic</b> processes involving genetic traits of hosts, pathogens and ticks that mediate their development and survival. New approaches for tick control are dependent on defining molecular interactions between hosts, ticks and pathogens to allow for discovery of key molecules that could be tested in vaccines for intervention of tick-pathogen cycles. Tick vaccines offer the important advantages of being a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative with a dual effect reducing tick infestations and preventing ticks from transmitting disease-causing pathogens. The challenge of developing improved tick vaccines arises from the {{need to understand the}} complex molecular relationship between vertebrate hosts, ticks and pathogens which requires a systems biology approach that will allow the integrated analysis of metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and other omics data for discovery of key pathways molecules that mediate tick-pathogen interactions. A vaccinomics approach could then be used to identify and fully characterize candidate protective antigens and validate vaccine formulations, including development of effective screening platforms and algorithms for analysis and validation of data produced by the systems biology approach to tick research. New candidate protective antigens will most likely be identified by focusing on abundant proteins with relevant biological function in tick feeding, reproduction, development, immune response, subversion of host immunity and pathogen transmission. Additionally, the evolution of similar strategies for some pathogens such as A. phagocytophilum to infect vertebrate and tick cells suggest the possibility of developing strategies to control pathogen infection in both vertebrate hosts and tick vectors. Tick vaccines that affect both tick infestations and pathogen infection and transmission could then be developed and used to vaccinate human and animal populations at risk for disease prevention and also reservoir host species in order to reduce tick infections and their vector capacity for pathogens that affect human and animal health worldwide.

40|$|The 2011 Off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku {{earthquake}} (Tohoku earthquake, M_w 9. 0) {{occurred on}} the Japan Trench and caused a devastating tsunami. Studies of this earthquake have revealed complex features of its rupture process. In particular, the shallow parts of the fault (near the trench) hosted large slip and long period seismic wave radiation, whereas the deep parts of the rupture (near the coast) hosted smaller slip and strong radiation of short period seismic waves. Understanding such depth-dependent feature of the rupture process of the Tohoku earthquake is necessary as it may occur during future mega-thrust earthquakes in this and other regions. In this study, we investigate the “characterized source model” of the Tohoku earthquake through dynamic rupture simulations. This source model divides the fault plane into several parts characterized by different size and frictional strength (main asperity, background area, etc.) and is widely used in Japan for the prediction of strong ground motion and tsunami through kinematic rupture simulations. Our characterized source model of the Tohoku earthquake comprises a large shallow asperity with moderate frictional strength, small deep asperities with high frictional strength, a background area with low frictional strength, and an area with dynamic weakening close to the trench (low dynamic friction coefficient as arising from, e. g., thermal pressurization). The results of our dynamic rupture simulation reproduce the main depth-dependent feature of the rupture process of the Tohoku earthquake. We also find that {{the width of the}} area close to the trench (equal to the distance from the trench to the shallow asperity, interpreted as the size of the accretionary prism) and the presence of dynamic weakening in this area have a significant influence on the final slip distribution. These results are useful to construct characterized source models for other subduction zones with different scale of the accretionary prism, such as the Chile subduction zone and the Nankai <b>Trough.</b> <b>Dynamic</b> rupture simulations based on the characterized source model might provide useful insights for hazard assessment associated with future mega-thrust earthquakes...|$|R
