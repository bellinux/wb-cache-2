40|$|Long-time {{monitoring}} of physiological parameters can scrutinize human health conditions {{so as to}} use electrocardiogram (ECG) for diagnosis of some human’s chronic cardiovascular diseases. The continuous monitoring requires the wearable electrodes to be breathable, flexible, biocompatible, and skin-affinity friendly. Weave electrodes are innovative materials to supply these potential performances. In this paper, four conductive weave electrodes in plain and <b>honeycomb</b> <b>weave</b> patterns were developed to monitor human ECG signals. A wearable belt platform was developed to mount such electrodes for acquisition of ECG signals using a back-end electronic circuit and a signal transfer unit. The performance of weave ECG electrodes was evaluated in terms of skin-electrode contacting impedance, comfortability, ECG electrical characteristics, and signal fidelity. Such performances were then compared with the values from Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The test results showed that lower skin-electrode impedance, higher R-peak amplitude, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value were obtained with the increased density of conductive filaments in weave and <b>honeycomb</b> <b>weave</b> electrode presented higher comfort but poorer signal quality of ECG. This study inspires an acceptable way of weave electrodes in long- and real-time of human biosignal monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} {{influence}} of negative oxygen ions fiber content on the released negative oxygen ions concentration of the fabric {{and the effect of}} different organizational structures on wearability of negative oxygen ions fabrics, the blended yarns of modified polyester negative oxygen ions fiber and viscose fiber in different blending ratio were selected, two series of fabrics were manufactured for the experiment. The released amount of negative oxygen ions and wearability of the blended fabrics were tested and analyzed in this paper. The results showed that with the increasing of negative oxygen ions fiber content in fabrics, the released negative oxygen ions concentration had increased. When the blended ratio of negative oxygen ions fiber and viscose fiber in fabric was 50 / 50, the released negative oxygen ions concentration of the fabric reached up to 4810 /cm 3 and was close to that of the field. Wearability of <b>honeycomb</b> <b>weave</b> fabric was best and suitable for home textiles through comprehensive analysis, followed by satin fabric. The conclusion from this research {{can be used as a}} reference to design and develop negative oxygen ions home textiles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of factors on the released anion concentration, the factors include the fiber content of negative oxygen ions, warp and weft density, organizational structure and friction time. Fabrics for A and B series were blended with modified polyester negative oxygen ions fiber and viscose fiber in different blending ratio. The released anion concentration were tested and analyzed. From the test results, following conclusions can be gotten. 1) In the same circumstance of other process conditions, with increasing of negative oxygen ions fiber content, the released anion concentration increased; 2) The <b>honeycomb</b> <b>weave</b> fabric B 5 released the highest anion concentration in the other same process conditions, while plain weave fabric B 1 released the least concentration; 3) More negative oxygen ions were produced when the warp and weft density were greater; 4) As the time of friction increased, the released anion concentration of fabric was increased until it reached a stable value; 5) Organizational structure had a great effect on releasing anion concentration through friction between woven fabric of negative oxygen ions and other knitted fabric. When the organization structure had bumpy effect, it was more conducive to release negative oxygen ions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Honeycomb</b> <b>woven</b> {{fabric is}} a single layer of fabric exhibiting {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) cellular shape on both fabric sides due to the combination of periodic straight yarn floats and partial plain weave. In a fabric weave repeat, the triangle shape of increased yarn floats and crossed diagonal woven lines form two inverted pyramidal spaces on the fabric surfaces and a closed internal space. This particular 3 D architecture is bound to influence the fabric transfer and mechanical properties. This study investigated these properties for <b>honeycomb</b> <b>weaves</b> experimentally, including air resistance, thermal conductivity, water absorption and vapor transmission rate, bending rigidity, compressional energy and tensile behavior. The typical two-dimensional plain woven fabrics with the same yarns and density were set as references and elastic yarns were considered as a factor of effect on the fabric properties. The measurements by the Kawabata Evaluation System and Instron machine show that the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>woven</b> fabric has enhanced air permeability and water absorption, as well as lower thermal conductivity {{compared to that of}} the plain woven fabric. Higher bending rigidity, compressional energy and Young’s modulus are also observed for honeycomb fabrics. The mechanical properties are found to be affected significantly by applying the elastic yarns to the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|<b>Honeycomb</b> <b>woven</b> {{fabric is}} {{considered}} as a single layer fabric produced only using common weaving looms, but it forms a unique three-dimensional (3 D) architecture with inverted pyramidal pits on the fabric surface and repeated tetrahedral-closed space inside the fabric, which is greatly different from the traditional 3 D woven fabrics, such as angle-interlock and orthogonal fabrics, showing good prospect for various applications in fields such as geotextiles, medical textiles, air filter, tower packing and underclothing. This paper proposes an analytical model to characterize the geometrical shape and position of each yarn in a honeycomb fabric unit-cell and {{the volume of the}} internal space. The model {{is based on the assumption}} of fabric thickness in the sum of yarn height and the linear relationship of yarn position and fabric unit-cell dimensions. The model involves geometric parameters, including yarn width, height, spacing, crimp and the number of yarns in a fabric unit-cell. Six <b>honeycomb</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics were manufactured to verify the model. Based on the position and crimp prediction of each yarn node, the architectures of the six fabrics were simulated numerically, which shows close agreement with the observed manufactured fabrics, indicating good accuracy of the geometrical model. A sensitivity study shows that the volume of the internal space decreases with the increase of fabric density, and the application of the elastic yarns to the fabric reduces the volume significantly.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} weaving design method to {{optimize}} the loading capability of microcapsule fabrics of yarns and fabrics, with moxa oil. A complex coacervation method was employed to prepare the moxa oil microcapsules by using gelatin-Arabic gum as wall material. The methods of orthogonal experimental design and analysis of range were used. The woven structure, weft yarn density, and weft yarn count were determined {{as the most important}} factors affecting the moxa oil content of microcapsule fabrics. Nine fabric specimens with respect to L 9 (34) orthogonal design were woven and treated with a moxa oil microcapsule. By the experiment results, the woven structure was found to be the factor that has the most significant effect on the microcapsule content of woven fabrics. In addition, the optimum fabric configuration satisfying the maximum content of the moxa oil microcapsule was determined as A 3 B 1 C 3, which corresponds to a <b>honeycomb</b> structure of <b>woven</b> structure, 230 no. / 10 cm of weft yarn density and 10 s of weft yarn count.
