40|$|A {{method of}} {{identifying}} children with specific reading disabilities by identifying discrepancies between their reading and listening comprehension scores was validated with disabled and nondisabled readers in Grades 4, 5, and 6. The method {{is based on}} a modification of the reading comprehension subtest of the Peabody Individual Achievement Test (Dunn & Markwardt, 1970). In this modification, even-numbered sentences are read by subjects, and odd-numbered sentences are read by the test administrator as subjects listen.

40|$|Early and {{accurate}} measurement of progress {{is crucial for}} the success of a project. Early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> and deviation from the as-planned data allow more time for project participants to identify the best solution. Monitoring the construction progress requires the Project Managers to analyze a lot of as-built data. This time-consuming process is prone to error. To overcome this problem, people have started adopting Building Information Models (BIM) for monitoring the construction progress. In this paper, we have discussed how the site photographs, which are readily available at all project sites, can be effectively used for monitoring the progress. The 4 D as-planned model is prepared {{at the beginning of the}} project. Then, a 3 D model is reconstructed from time-lapsed as-built photos. For any given time, the progress can be tracked by comparing the 4 D model and the 3 D as-built model. The progress data is extracted by superimposing the reconstructed scene over the 4 D as-planned model. The reconstructed model allows the as-built photographs to be geo-registered by the 4 D as-planned model. As a result of this comparison, the progress data is then visualized in an AR environment. Progress is visualized in the 4 D model using a quadrangle visualization scheme. This type of approach presents a realistic understanding of the construction progress and is a very good communication tool between project participants.

40|$|Timbre is {{a multidimensional}} perceptual {{attribute}} of complex tones {{that characterizes the}} identity of a sound source. Our study explores the representation in auditory sensory memory of three timbre dimensions (acoustically related to attack time, spectral centroid, and spectrum fine structure), using the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the auditory event-related potential. MMN is elicited by a discriminable change in a sound sequence and reflects the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>discrepancy</b> between the current stimulus and traces in auditory sensory memory.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the experience of careeroriented activities carried out with students of schools in developed and developing countries. Career Guidance in Russia, despite the vast experience of its implementation, is experiencing serious difficulties. In this regard, it is important to take into account the international experience career-oriented activities, such as in the developed countries of North America and the European Union as well as in several Asian countries with rapidly growing economies and a large demographic potential, taking into account the best variants for the Russian education system.   Methods. The experience of career-oriented work undertaken with pupils of the USA, Canada, Israel, France, UK, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, Singapore, China and India is shown on the basis of the comparative analysis of different publications and information sources. The author has made an attempt to generalize the principles of psycho-pedagogical and administrative assistance in professional self-determination of senior pupils abroad.   Scientific novelty. The approaches to career-oriented activities in countries with different levels of economic development are compared for the first time. Some principles are revealed. Firstly, the higher the income level per capita in the country, the greater attention is given to vocational guidance. The politics in the developed countries is based on interests of the individual: children’s acquaintance with the world of professions begins already at younger school and the moment of definitive selfdetermination is postponed till the end of their senior stage of education; the possibility of direction change of professional preparation in case <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrepancy</b> <b>of</b> qualities of the pupil to originally selected profile is provided. Career-oriented activity in developing countries, on the contrary, is rigidly coordinated to requirements of economy and a labour market; earlier fixing of professional preferences and less flexible relation to an unsuccessful choice of a speciality or profession of the youth is marked there. The most typical characteristics of foreign career-oriented schemes are the following: the organisation of continuous training lasting throughout all school; supervision over students’ achievements, propensities and hobbies; portfolio or cumulative files drafting and recording data of all pupil’s results while professional consulting and selection of entrants for vocational training continuation in colleges or high schools. The author points out the general characteristic: the economy requirement for high quality experts on the basis of selection of the pupils who are able to master high-end technologies and have an obvious potential of professional growth and personal development.   Practical significance.

40|$|PURPOSE: Hereditary {{head and}} neck paraganglioma (HNPGL) syndromes are {{associated}} with mutations in the SDHD(PGL 1), SDHC(PGL 3), and SDHB(PGL 4) genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase subunits. We recently described mutations in a previously uncharacterized human gene, now called SDHAF 2, and showed {{that this was the}} long-sought "imprinted" PGL 2 gene. Here, we present a new branch of the Dutch SDHAF 2 (PLG 2 -SDH 5) family. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The SDHAF 2 family has been collected over a 30 -year period. The family described here was linked to PGL 2 and at-risk family members were invited to participate in this study. Patients were investigated and treated dependent on tumor size and localization. All family members have now been analyzed for the SDHAF 2 mutation status. RESULTS: Among the 57 family members, 23 were linkage positive including 7 risk-free carriers (maternal imprinting). Of the 16 at-risk individuals, 11 had a total of 24 tumors with primarily carotid (71 %) and vagal locations (17 %). Multifocality of tumors was prominent (91 %). Malignancy was not detected. The average age at onset was 33 years, and many patients (42 %) were asymptomatic prior to screening. SDHAF 2 mutation analysis confirmed the findings of the previously performed linkage analysis without <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies.</b> CONCLUSIONS: We established the SDHAF 2 mutation status of PGL 2 family members. Phenotypic characterization of this family confirms the currently exclusive association of SDHAF 2 mutations with HNPGL.

40|$|Stainless steel slags {{are more}} and more being reused in {{construction}} applications, where they can be an economically and ecologically viable alternative to natural minerals. To compete with those natural materials, slags need to comply with standards imposed by slag consumers and ever stricter regulations. Certain mechanical properties, particle sizes and environmentally suitable properties are required. In this work, we investigate several thermodynamic aspects having an effect on the eventual slag properties. First, the phase relations at high temperature were studied by equilibration in controlled reducing atmospheres, followed by quenching and EPMA-WDS analysis. The results were compared with commercially available thermodynamic databases. This lead to the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> at lower basicities, which could be tracked down to missing ternary interactions in the system MgO-CrOx-SiO 2. A new thermodynamic description of the MgO-CrOx-SiO 2 system is pro-posed. Second, the solidification of CrOx containing slags was studied using thermodynamic Scheil modelling. This proved to be a predictive tool for the low temperature mineralogy even after slow air cooling, correctly calculating the presence of Cr metal or 2 CaO. SiO 2 (C 2 S). Third, the modification of slag chemistry during cooling to prevent the destructive C 2 S transformation was studied by experiments and modelling. It was found that 0. 3 wt% B 2 O 3 is capable of stabilizing all slags with basicities lower than 2. The amount needed is, however, strongly dependent on the C 2 S fraction and hence the C/S ratio. To understand the mechanisms behind this, the distribution of boron in the phases present during and after solidification was studied by modelling and EPMA-WDS. The majority of the boron was present in the liquid or CaBxSiyOz phases, which explains the need for a higher boron content than needed for pure C 2 S. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|The {{misinformation}} {{effect is}} elicited by presenting misleading post-event misinformation then testing for {{memory of the}} event. Source confusion is hypothesized to underlie the effect. A framework that combines common explanations for the misinformation by Blank (1998) centers individual assumptions of consistency in information as a link to detecting discrepancies in conflicting information sources. The ability to detect discrepancies between sources can contribute to susceptibility to misinformation. Personality scales or individual difference measures {{used to evaluate the}} individual factors show mixed results in prior research. This study used individual difference tests to assess tendency to assume consistency, ability to detect discrepancies, and tendency toward source confusion. The individual difference measures were: Need for Closure Scale, Interpersonal Trust Scale, Mental Rotations Test, Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire, the Deese-Roediger-McDermott procedure, the Wechsler Symbol Search, and the newly-created Detecting Detail Discrepancies test. Participants viewed 5 films and completed memory questionnaires about the films. Two-thirds of the group received misinformation and the remaining third received consistent information. Half the misinformed group was warned about misinformation. Participants 2 ̆ 7 memories for the film events were assessed in recognition and recall formats. Exit interviews asked about consistency assumptions, <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies,</b> and experience of source confusion. The results showed the expected robust misinformation effect in recognition and recall testing. The early warning did not reduce the effect in recognition tests, and appeared to enhance the effect in recall tests. Warned participants reported more source confusion. Those who reported detecting discrepancies also reported source confusion. Those designated as habitually susceptible from high misinformation recognition scores were not more likely to recall misinformation, but did have lower MRT scores. False memory on DRM did not relate to misinformation responses but did relate to reported source confusion. The DDD related to reported discrepancy detection, but not to misinformation or reported source confusion. Author questions the robustness of habitual susceptibility as a trait, notes tendency for mixed findings in individual difference approach to misinformation, and the unexpected finding of early warning upon misinformation in delayed free recall.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the Central Nervous System (CNS) {{integrates}} visual and inertial information in heading estimation for congruent multisensory stimuli and stimuli with small discrepancies. Multisensory information should, however, only be integrated when the cues are redundant. Here, we investigated how the CNS constructs an estimate of heading for combinations of visual and inertial heading stimuli with a wide range <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies.</b> Participants were presented with 2 s visual-only and inertial-only motion stimuli, and combinations thereof. Discrepancies between visual and inertial heading ranging between 0 - 90 ° were introduced for the combined stimuli. In the unisensory conditions, it was found that visual heading was generally biased towards the fore-aft axis, while inertial heading was biased away from the fore-aft axis. For multisensory stimuli, it was found that five out of nine participants integrated visual and inertial heading information regardless {{of the size of the}} discrepancy; for one participant, the data were best described by a model that explicitly performs causal inference. For the remaining three participants the evidence could not readily distinguish between these models. The finding that multisensory information is integrated is in line with earlier findings, but the finding that even large discrepancies are generally disregarded is surprising. Possibly, people are insensitive to discrepancies in visual-inertial heading angle because such discrepancies are only encountered in artificial environments, making a neural mechanism to account for them otiose. An alternative explanation is that <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> a <b>discrepancy</b> may depend on stimulus duration, where sensitivity to detect discrepancies differs between people...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Control theory {{predicts that}} the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> goal <b>discrepancies</b> initiates ruminative self-focus (Martin & Tesser, 1996). Despite the breadth of {{applications}} and interest in control theory, {{there is a lack}} of experimental evidence evaluating this prediction. The present study provided the first experimental test of this prediction. METHODS: We examined uninstructed state rumination in response to the cueing of resolved and unresolved goals in a non-clinical population using a novel measure of online rumination. RESULTS: Consistent with control theory, cueing an unresolved goal resulted in significantly greater recurrent intrusive ruminative thoughts than cueing a resolved goal. Individual differences in trait rumination moderated the impact of the goal cueing task on the extent of state rumination: individuals who had a stronger tendency to habitually ruminate were more susceptible to the effects <b>of</b> cueing goal <b>discrepancies.</b> LIMITATIONS: The findings await replication in a clinically depressed sample where there is greater variability and higher levels of trait rumination. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that control theories of goal pursuit provide a valuable framework for understanding the circumstances that trigger state rumination. Additionally, our measure of uninstructed online state rumination was found to be a valid and sensitive index of the extent and temporal course of state rumination, indicating its value for further investigating the proximal causes of state rumination...|$|R

By way of performing parameter estimation on the CGBH void model, we show that the Hubble parameter data favors a void with characteristic radius of 2 3 Gpc. This brings the void model closer, but not yet enough, to harmony with observational indications given by the background kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the normalization of near-infrared galaxy luminosity function. However, the test of such void models may ultimately lie in the future <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>discrepancy</b> between longitudinal and transverse expansion rates, a touchstone of inhomogeneous models. With the proliferation of observational Hubble parameter data and future large-scale structure observation, a definitive test could be performed on the question of cosmic homogeneity. Particularly, the spherical LTB void models have been ruled out, but more general non-spherical inhomogeneities still need to be tested by observation. In this paper, we utilise a spherical void model to provide guidelines into how observational tests may be done with more general models in the future. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures; PRD accepte...|$|R
40|$|The authors report {{two cases}} of nodular calcium {{pyrophosphate}} dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition {{close to the}} thoracic neural foramen, which caused chronic radiculopathy. Preoperatively, the lesions were interpreted as calcified disc herniations. Both patients underwent surgery in which an extended transfacet pedicle-sparing approach was used. Incision of the posterior longitudinal ligament released soft degenerated material. In both cases, histological examination showed abundant degenerative debris along with CPPD crystals. Spinal CPPD deposition is a comparatively rare disease that almost invariably involves the posterior aspect of the spinal canal, typically the ligamentum flavum. The exceptional foraminal location of the lesions reported here, combined with the surgical findings, indicated that the CPPD crystals were deposited on a laterally herniated disc fragment. A distinctive feature in both cases was the soft consistency of the resected tissue. The consistency of the disc material {{and the location of}} the lesion in the axial plane (that is, median compared with lateral) are key factors in determining the optimal surgical approach to thoracic disc herniations. In describing consistency, terms such as "calcified" and "hard" have been used interchangeably in the literature. The authors' experience underscores that not all densely calcified herniated discs are hard. Although <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> this <b>discrepancy</b> would have left surgical planning for the lateral disc herniations unchanged, it could have altered planning for centrally or centrolaterally located disc herniations...|$|R
40|$|Judgments {{of agency}} refer to peopleʼs self-reflective assess-ments {{concerning}} their own control: their {{assessments of the}} extent to which they themselves are responsible for an action. These self-reflective metacognitive judgments can be distin-guished from action monitoring, which involves the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> the divergence (or lack of divergence) between observed states and expected states. Presumably, people form judgments of agency by metacognitively reflecting on the output of their action monitoring and then consciously inferring the extent to which they caused the action in question. Although a number of previous imaging studies have been directed at action mon-itoring, none have assessed judgments of agency as a poten-tially separate process. The present fMRI study used an agency paradigm that not only allowed us to examine the brain activity associated with action monitoring but that also enabled us to investigate those regions associated with metacognition of agency. Regarding action monitoring, we found that being “out of control ” during the task (i. e., <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> a <b>discrepancy</b> be-tween observed and expected states) was associated with in-creased brain activity in the right TPJ, whereas being “in control ” was associated with increased activity in the pre-SMA, rostral cingulate zone, and dorsal striatum (regions linked to self-initiated action). In contrast, when participants made self-reflective metacognitive judgments about the extent of their own control (i. e., judgments of agency) compared with when they made judgments that were not about control (i. e., judg-ments of performance), increased activity was observed in the anterior PFC, a region associated with self-reflective processing. These results indicate that action monitoring is dissociable from peopleʼs conscious self-attributions of control. ...|$|R

In general, LiDAR data acquisition is conducted by private companies who are also responsible for processing and quality control. However, in many cases a subsequent quality assessment of overlapping LiDAR strips still reveals apparent horizontal and vertical offsets which are caused by undetected systematic errors (e. g. insufficient calibration and strip adjustment). The presented work covers methods for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> remaining <b>discrepancies</b> in overlapping LiDAR strips with main focus {{on the development of}} a new precise 3 D measurement technique based on intersecting roof ridge lines and roof planes which are automatically reconstructed from the LiDAR point clouds in overlapping strips.

The new 3 D reconstruction method can also take advantage of full waveform measurements like pulse width and intensity which are decomposed from the waveforms. Finally, the LiDAR strips are corrected and validated by checking the correspondence among neighbouring strips. The quality control system has been successfully applied to pre-processed and adjusted LiDAR strips. In general, the results show that significant discrepancies mainly in position still exist.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{studied the}} role of opioid receptors in the midbrain periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), an important structure eliciting conditioned fear responses, in the extinction of Pavlovian fear. Rats received pairings of an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) with a foot shock unconditioned stimulus (US). The freezing conditioned response (CR) elicited by the CS was then extinguished via nonreinforced presentations of the CS. Microinjection of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone into the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) before nonreinforced CS presentations impaired development of extinction, but such microinjections {{at the end of}} extinction did not reinstate an already extinguished freezing CR. This role for opioid receptors in fear extinction was specific to the vlPAG because infusions of naloxone into the dorsal PAG did not impair fear extinction. Finally, the impairment of fear extinction produced by vlPAG infusions of naloxone was dose-dependent. These results show {{for the first time that}} the midbrain PAG contributes to fear extinction and specifically identify a role for vlPAG opioid receptors in the acquisition but not the expression of such extinction. Taken together with our previous findings, we suggest that, during fear conditioning, activation of vlPAG opioid receptors contributes to <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>discrepancy</b> between the actual and expected outcome of the conditioning trial. vlPAG opioid receptors regulate the learning that accrues to the CS and other stimuli present on a trial because they instantiate an associative error correction process influencing US information reaching the site of CS–US convergence in the amygdala.

40|$|A recent {{stacking}} {{analysis of}} Planck HFI data of galaxy clusters (Hurier 2016) allowed to derive the cluster temperatures {{by using the}} relativistic corrections to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE). However, the temperatures of high-temperature clusters, as derived from this analysis, resulted to be basically higher than the temperatures derived from X-ray measurements, at a moderate statistical significance of 1. 5 σ. This discrepancy has been attributed by Hurier (2016) to calibration issues. In this paper we discuss an alternative explanation for this <b>discrepancy</b> in terms <b>of</b> a non-thermal SZE astrophysical component. We find that this explanation can work if non-thermal electrons in galaxy clusters have a low value of their minimum momentum (p_ 1 ∼ 0. 5 - 1), and if their pressure is {{of the order of}} 20 - 30 % of the thermal gas pressure. Both these conditions are hard to obtain if the non-thermal electrons are mixed with the hot gas in the intra cluster medium, but can be possibly obtained if the non-thermal electrons are mainly confined in bubbles with high content of non-thermal plasma and low content of thermal plasma, or in giant radio lobes/relics located in the outskirts of clusters. In order to derive more precise results on the properties of non-thermal electrons in clusters, and in view <b>of</b> more solid <b>detections</b> <b>of</b> a <b>discrepancy</b> between X-rays and SZE derived clusters temperatures that cannot be explained in other ways, it would be necessary to reproduce the full analysis done by Hurier (2016) by adding systematically the non-thermal component of the SZE.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 29) Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) {{technology has}} introduced and opened new domains in electrical and engineering field {{due to its}} performance, reliability, flexibility, long-term maintenance, cost, and time to market. FPGAs have been utilized across most industries such as commercial, military, aerospace, and medical devices. The objective of this project is to establish an automated dynamic test platform to test Xilinx reprogrammable Virtex- 4 FPGAs while the FPGA is being stressed (under 125 degree C temperature). This temperature stress test is called burn-in test. Most FPGA resources e. g. CLBs, Block-RAM, DSP??? are exhaustively tested. The main goal of burn-in test is to detect defective components at {{the early stages of}} their usage by stressing the chips at high voltage and temperatures while the FPGA is powered and performing its customized functions. The unit under test (UUT) is placed inside a chamber while test-vectors are applied through a serial communication (RS- 232) to the FPGA board. The test response is compared with an expected golden-copy of the response by an automated software platform. The may lead to <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> possible <b>discrepancy</b> (fault) between the chip on the FPGA board and the expected response (Gold Copy), and associated error in the FPGA is stored into an XML/Database system to generate further report. In this project, all the information is stored in XML (Extensible Markup Language) file format due to benefit such as ability to communicate between different systems, clear defined set of standards, forming a tree structure where it start at the root and branches to the leaves and to the lowest level of the tree. This attribute makes it possible to divide and break hardware specification into smaller pieces of information while keeping track of a logical relationship of all pieces...|$|R

40|$|The <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> {{intrathecal}} antibody synthesis {{was compared}} by {{the calculation of}} antibody indices (AI) derived from ELISA techniques with the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> virus-specific oligoclonal IgGs by an antigen-mediated capillary blot technique. Twenty-seven paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were examined from 15 immunocompetent patients with herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE) diagnosed by PCR on early CSF samples. These techniques were also applied to paired samples from 20 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, 10 patients with other inflammatory neurological diseases and 10 patients with non inflammatory neurological disorders. There was a good correlation between the results obtained by AI and those obtained by immunoblotting, especially in HSE (2 discordant results out <b>of</b> 27). <b>Discrepancies</b> were more frequent (25 %) in MS patients where a "polyspecific" reaction characterized by low affinity antibodies is known to occur. Some <b>of</b> the <b>discrepancies</b> could, in part, be due to serological cross-reaction with varicella zoster virus...|$|R
