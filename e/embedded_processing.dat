Among the existing image coding methods, wavelet quad-tree is a foundation {{leading to an}} efficient structure to encode images.

In this work, we exploit hierarchical relations of the quad-tree structure in terms of searching entropy and present a quad-tree searching model that {{is very close to}} the searching entropy. By applying this model, our codec surpasses SPIHT [1] by 0. 2 - 0. 4 db over wide code rates, and its performance is comparable to SPIHT with arithmetic coding and JPEG 2000 [2]. With no additional overhead of arithmetic coding, our code is much faster and simpler than SPIHT with adaptive arithmetic coding and the more complicated JPEG 2000 algorithms. This is a critical factor sought in <b>embedded</b> <b>processing</b> in communication systems where energy consumption and speed are priority concerns.
