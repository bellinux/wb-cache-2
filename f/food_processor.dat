40|$|Japanese <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> {{have been}} faced with {{internal}} and external squeezes in recent years. Internally, the industry is faced with an overall demand ceiling due to Engel's law and a rapidly changing demand structure due to the "westernisation" of the Japanese consumers' taste. Externally, the industry is faced with increased import competition {{as a result of}} the liberalisation of the Japanese import market for agricultural and processed food products. Under these pressures, performance of the Japanese <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> in terms of productivity and profitability, is found to be below average, compared with Japanese manufacturing as a whole. Associated with the deteriorating productivity and profitability performance, Japanese <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> have stepped up their foreign direct investment (FDI) activities in the Asia-Pacific region. This development provides both challenge and opportunities for Australian producers and <b>food</b> <b>processors.</b> As most of the Japanese FDIs are either domestic market or export oriented, they are likely to pose serious competition for Australian firms. At the same time, through joint ventures with Japanese firms, the Australian <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> may acquire the inside knowledge of the Asian market which would enable them to capitalise on the enormous opportunities in the Asian food market.

25|$|Pasta is {{generally}} a simple dish, but comes in many varieties {{due to its}} versatility. Some pasta dishes are served as a first course in Italy because the portion sizes are small and simple. Pasta is also prepared in light lunches, such as salads or large portion sizes for dinner. It can be prepared by hand or <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> and served hot or cold. Pasta sauces vary in taste, color and texture. When choosing which type of pasta and sauce to serve together, {{there is a general}} rule regarding compatibility. Simple sauces like pesto are ideal for long and thin strands of pasta while tomato sauce combines well with thicker pastas. Thicker and chunkier sauces have the better ability to cling onto the holes and cuts of short, tubular, twisted pastas. The extra sauce left on the plate after all of the pasta is eaten is often mopped up with a piece of bread. Pasta is largely carbohydrates (mainly as starch), with moderate amounts of protein and manganese.|$|E
