Processes' namespaces can be constructed independently, and the user may work simultaneously with programs that have heterogeneous namespaces.

5|$|Much of the system's core, {{including}} the LWKT subsystem, the IPI messaging subsystem {{and the new}} kernel memory allocator, are lockless, meaning that they work without using mutexes, with <b>each</b> <b>process</b> operating on a single CPU. Critical sections are used to protect against local interrupts, individually for each CPU, guaranteeing that a thread currently being executed will not be preempted.|$|E
5|$|Submarine {{volcanism}} {{is driven}} by various processes. Volcanoes near plate boundaries and mid-ocean ridges are built by the decompression melting of mantle rock that rises on an upwelling portion of a convection cell to the crustal surface. Eruptions associated with subducting zones, meanwhile, are driven by subducting plates that add volatiles to the rising plate, lowering its melting point. <b>Each</b> <b>process</b> generates different rock; mid-ocean ridge volcanics are primarily basaltic, whereas subduction flows are mostly calc-alkaline, and more explosive and viscous.|$|E

5|$|Thirty-two such modules {{were then}} stacked and wired {{together}} with a mass of twisted-pair wires into a single processor. The basic cycle time was 2.11ns, or 474MHz, allowing each processor to reach about 0.948 GFLOPS, and a 16 processor machine a theoretical 15.17 GFLOP. Key to the high performance was the high-speed access to main memory, which allowed <b>each</b> <b>process</b> to burst up to 8 GB/s.|$|E
25|$|A gap {{analysis}} {{can also be}} used to compare one process to others performed elsewhere, which are often identified through benchmarking. In this usage, one compares <b>each</b> <b>process</b> side-by-side and step-by-step and then notes the differences. One then analyzes each deviation to determine if there is any benefit to changing to the alternate process. The results of this analysis (in the context of the benefits and detriments of changing processes) may support the maintenance of the current process, the wholesale adoption of an alternate process, or a fusion of different aspects of <b>each</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|The vector of a plate's {{motion is}} a {{function}} of all the forces acting on the plate; however, therein lies the problem regarding the degree to which <b>each</b> <b>process</b> contributes to the overall motion of each tectonic plate.|$|E
30|$|The two ROI {{data sets}} (manual and automated) {{were applied to}} extract time-activity curves (TACs) from the four dynamic PET images (test and retest <b>each</b> <b>processed</b> with or without realignment) amounting to eight sets of TACs.|$|R

25|$|In 2008 AMD {{spun off}} its chip {{foundries}} into an independent company named GlobalFoundries. This break-up {{of the company}} was attributed to the increasing costs of <b>each</b> <b>process</b> node. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi purchased the newly created company through its subsidiary Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC), purchasing the final stake from AMD in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversity}} of geodynamic settings and {{the properties of}} each plate result from {{the impact of the}} various processes actively driving each individual plate. One method of dealing with this problem is to consider the relative rate at which each plate is moving as well as the evidence related to the significance of <b>each</b> <b>process</b> to the overall driving force on the plate.|$|E
25|$|Random-access {{memory is}} used to store both program {{instructions}} and data. Typically, both need {{to be present in}} memory in order for a program to execute. Often multiple programs will want access to memory, frequently demanding more memory than the computer has available. The kernel is responsible for deciding which memory <b>each</b> <b>process</b> can use, and determining what to do when not enough memory is available.|$|E
30|$|For the videos, the {{processing}} is done frame-by-frame because <b>each</b> <b>processed</b> frame {{provides us with}} different results having single or multiple moving objects. For this specific case, each frame can have a different number of moving objects. In the designed algorithm, firstly, image frames are enhanced and then transformed into hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) color space.|$|R

25|$|The flux of ions {{through the}} {{potassium}} channel pore is regulated by two related processes, termed gating and inactivation. Gating is the opening or {{closing of the}} channel in response to stimuli, while inactivation is the rapid cessation of current from an open potassium channel and {{the suppression of the}} channel's ability to resume conducting. While both processes serve to regulate channel conductance, <b>each</b> <b>process</b> may be mediated by a number of mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|To {{use less}} space, treat {{difficult}} waste, and intermittent flows, {{a number of}} designs of hybrid treatment plants have been produced. Such plants often combine at least two stages of the three main treatment stages into one combined stage. In the UK, where {{a large number of}} wastewater treatment plants serve small populations, package plants are a viable alternative to building a large structure for <b>each</b> <b>process</b> stage. In the US, package plants are typically used in rural areas, highway rest stops and trailer parks.|$|E
25|$|An {{operating}} system kernel contains a scheduling program which determines {{how much time}} <b>each</b> <b>process</b> spends executing, and in which order execution control should be passed to programs. Control is passed to a process by the kernel, which allows the program access to the CPU and memory. Later, control is returned to the kernel through some mechanism, so that another program may be allowed to use the CPU. This so-called passing of control between the kernel and applications is called a context switch.|$|E

25|$|A single-tasking {{system can}} only run one {{program at a}} time, while a multi-tasking {{operating}} system allows more than one program to be running in concurrency. This is achieved by time-sharing, dividing the available processor time between multiple processes that are each interrupted repeatedly in time slices by a task-scheduling subsystem of the operating system. Multi-tasking may be characterized in preemptive and co-operative types. In preemptive multitasking, the operating system slices the CPU time and dedicates a slot {{to each of the}} programs. Unix-like operating systems, e.g., Solaris, Linux, as well as AmigaOS support preemptive multitasking. Cooperative multitasking is achieved by relying on <b>each</b> <b>process</b> to provide time to the other processes in a defined manner. 16-bit versions of Microsoft Windows used cooperative multi-tasking. 32-bit versions of both Windows NT and Win9x, used preemptive multi-tasking.|$|E

The equilibrium ensemble should be invariant {{with respect to}} this transformation because of microreversibility and the uniqueness of thermodynamic equilibrium.

50|$|Additionally, the MAC {{algorithm}} can deliberately combine {{two or more}} cryptographic primitives, so as {{to maintain}} protection even {{if one of them}} is later found to be vulnerable.

50|$|As {{features}} sizes shrink, {{the number}} of incident electrons at fixed dose also shrinks. As soon as the number reaches ~10000, shot noise effects become predominant, leading to substantial natural dose variation within a large feature population.
