40|$|Solar {{activity}} {{has been recorded}} as auroras or sunspots <b>in</b> various <b>historical</b> sources.

In this paper, we suggest the possibility of "unusual rainbow" and "white rainbow" as candidates of <b>historical</b> auroras <b>in</b> oriental <b>historical</b> sources and examine if it is probable. This discovery will help us to make more comprehensive historical auroral catalogues and require us to add these terms to auroral candidates <b>in</b> oriental <b>historical</b> sources.

5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, daffadown dilly and daffydowndilly have {{appeared}} as playful synonyms of the name. In common parlance and <b>in</b> <b>historical</b> documents, the term daffodil may refer specifically to populations or specimens of the wild daffodil, N. pseudonarcissus. H. N.

5|$|From the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) {{until the}} Qing dynasty (1644–1912), the ruling {{head of state}} was known as huangdi, or emperor. In Chinese {{historical}} texts, emperors of the Song dynasty, along with the Tang and Yuan dynasties, are referred to by their temple names. Before the Tang dynasty (618–907), emperors were generally referred to <b>in</b> <b>historical</b> texts by their posthumous names. During the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing dynasties, emperors were exclusively referred to <b>in</b> <b>historical</b> texts by their single era name, whereas emperors of previous dynasties, including the Song, usually had multiple era names. The amount of written characters used in posthumous names grew steadily larger from the Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 220) onwards and thus became overly long when referring to sovereigns. For example, the posthumous name of Nurhaci (r. 1616–1626), {{the founder of the}} Manchu state which would eventually establish the Qing dynasty, contained 29 written characters. By the Tang dynasty, much shorter temple names were preferred when referring to the emperor, a preference that was carried into the Song dynasty. Each emperor also had a tomb name (陵號; linghao) and various other honorific titles.|$|E

The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work <b>in</b> <b>historical</b> principles; their Deutsches Wörterbuch, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.|$|E
