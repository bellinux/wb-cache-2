5|$|Many {{details about}} the anatomy of Lobatus gigas were not well known until Colin Little's 1965 <b>general</b> <b>study.</b> In 2005, R. L. Simone gave a {{detailed}} anatomical description. L.gigas has a long extensible snout with two eyestalks (also known as ommatophores) that originate from its base. The tip of each eyestalk contains a large, well-developed lensed eye, with a black pupil and a yellow iris and a small slightly posterior sensory tentacle. Amputated eyes completely regenerate. Inside {{the mouth of the}} animal is a radula (a tough ribbon covered in rows of microscopic teeth) of the taenioglossan type. Both the snout and the eyestalks show dark spotting in the exposed areas. The mantle is darkly coloured in the anterior region, fading to light gray at the posterior end, while the mantle collar is commonly orange. The siphon is also orange or yellow. When the soft parts of the animal are removed from the shell, several organs are distinguishable externally, including the kidney, the nephiridial gland, the pericardium, the genital glands, stomach, style sac and the digestive gland. In adult males, the penis is also visible.|$|E

The paper discussed National Policy for Information and Communication Technology, the role of ICT in <b>general</b> <b>studies</b> in university education, <b>general</b> <b>studies</b> in university education, university education policies, and approaches to ICT integration in <b>general</b> <b>studies.</b> The study made use of questionnaire as instrument of the study. The population of the study was 48 students in technical education unit of technical and business education department, Delta State University, Abraka. The students attested that some of the ICT facilities are available but not properly utilized in learning <b>general</b> <b>studies</b> in the university. The findings also revealed that there is a significant difference in the perception of students on the extent of availability and utilization of ICT facilities in learning <b>general</b> <b>studies.</b> It was based on these findings that the researcher recommended that <b>general</b> <b>studies</b> should be equipped with ICT facilities to facilitate learning in technical education field among others...|$|R

25|$|It {{is likely}} that the concept of {{fractional}} numbers dates to prehistoric times. The Ancient Egyptians used their Egyptian fraction notation for rational numbers in mathematical texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus. Classical Greek and Indian mathematicians made studies of the theory of rational numbers, as part of the <b>general</b> <b>study</b> of number theory. The best known of these is Euclid's Elements, dating to roughly 300BC. Of the Indian texts, the most relevant is the Sthananga Sutra, which also covers number theory as part of a <b>general</b> <b>study</b> of mathematics.|$|E

25|$|By {{its great}} generality, {{abstract}} algebra {{can often be}} applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning compass and straightedge constructions were finally solved using Galois theory, which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is linear algebra, which is the <b>general</b> <b>study</b> of vector spaces, whose elements called vectors have both quantity and direction, {{and can be used}} to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of geometry and algebra have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. Combinatorics studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of his}} {{overarching}} {{effort to}} understand the unique development of the Western world, Weber produced a detailed <b>general</b> <b>study</b> {{of the city as}} the characteristic locus of the social and economic relations, political arrangements, and ideas that eventually came to define the West. This resulted in a monograph titled The City, which was probably compiled from research conducted in 1911–13, and which was published posthumously in 1921. In 1924 it was incorporated into the second part of his Economy and Society, as chapter XVI, [...] "The City (Non-legitimate Domination)".|$|E
500|$|Von Neumann {{introduced}} {{the study of}} rings of operators, through the von Neumann algebras. A von Neumann algebra is a -algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that is closed in the weak operator topology and contains the identity operator. The von Neumann bicommutant theorem shows that the analytic definition is equivalent to a purely algebraic definition as being equal to the bicommutant. Von Neumann embarked in 1936, with the partial collaboration of F.J. Murray, on the <b>general</b> <b>study</b> of factors classification of von Neumann algebras. The six major papers in which he developed that theory between 1936 and 1940 [...] "rank among the masterpieces of analysis in the twentieth century". The direct integral was later introduced in 1949 by John von Neumann.|$|E

5000|$|The College of <b>General</b> <b>Studies</b> {{evolved from}} the 1908 Downtown Division of the Pittsburgh Academy. [...] It became the Department of Afternoon, Saturday and Evening Studies in 1911 when it moved from Downtown to Oakland and began {{offering}} {{a limited number of}} off-campus courses. By 1920, Pitt had expanded its off-campus offerings to 19 locations in western Pennsylvania and Ohio, including Erie and Youngstown. In 1932, Pitt established the University Extension Division, which became known informally as the evening program, with its director reporting directly to the chancellor. On March 11, 1958, the Pitt Board of Trustees, following a recommendation by then Chancellor Edward Litchfield, approved the establishment of the School of <b>General</b> <b>Studies</b> primarily as an alternative for adults wishing to continuing education. Enrollment in the School of <b>General</b> <b>Studies</b> peaked at 18,930 during the 1974-75 academic year, the vast majority of which were part-time students. In 1981, the School of <b>General</b> <b>Studies</b> was renamed the College of <b>General</b> <b>Studies</b> to reflect that its degree was comparable to an Arts and Sciences degree. In the early 1990s, the College of <b>General</b> <b>Studies</b> offered as many as 30 degree majors, which was downgraded to ten in 1998-99 in order to eliminate duplication with majors offered in other Pitt units. In 2002 the McCarl Center for Nontraditional Student Success open followed by a major restructuring of the College of <b>General</b> <b>Studies</b> in 2003. The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, for those 50 years old and older, and CGSOnline was established in 2005.|$|R

500|$|The {{ambience}} at Eynsford was one {{of alcohol}} (the [...] "Five Bells" [...] public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sex; these years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house have left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional milieu Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in England. He also wrote a <b>general</b> <b>study</b> of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre.|$|E
500|$|From {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s Grainger became {{involved}} increasingly with educational work {{in schools and}} colleges, and in late 1931 accepted a year's appointment for 1932–33 as [...] professor of music at New York University (NYU). In this role he delivered a series of lectures under the heading [...] "A <b>General</b> <b>Study</b> of the Manifold Nature of Music", which introduced his students {{to a wide range}} of ancient and modern works. On 25 October 1932 his lecture was illustrated by Duke Ellington and his band, who appeared in person; Grainger admired Ellington's music, seeing [...] harmonic similarities with Delius. On the whole, however, Grainger did not enjoy his tenure at NYU; he disliked the institutional formality, and found the university generally unreceptive to his ideas. Despite many offers he never accepted another formal academic appointment, and refused all offers of honorary degrees. His New York lectures became the basis for a series of radio talks which he gave for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1934–35; these were later summarised and published [...] as Music: A [...] Commonsense [...] View of All Types. [...] In 1937 Grainger began an association with the Interlochen International Music Camp, and taught regularly at its summer schools until 1944.|$|E
