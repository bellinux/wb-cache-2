25|$|In the United States, {{there have}} been three major {{policies}} addressing special education in the United States. These policies were the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975, the <b>Individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> <b>Education</b> Act in 1997, and the No Child Left Behind in 2001. The development of these policies showed increased guidelines for special education and requirements; such as requiring states to fund special education, equality of opportunities, help with transitions after secondary schooling, requiring extra qualifications for special education teachers, and creating a more specific class setting for those with disabilities. The <b>Individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> <b>Education</b> Act, specifically had a large impact on special education as public schools were then required to employ high qualified staff. For one to be a Certified Autism Specialist, one must have a master's degree, two years of career experience working with the autism population, earn 14 continuing education hours in autism every two years, and register with the International Institute of Education.

40|$|Since the {{landmark}} work A Nation At-Risk (National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1988), school {{systems in the}} United States have been evolving by a myriad of reform efforts, {{particularly with regard to}} the “standards movement. ” Outcomes of standards-based education are measured by accountability and assessment systems. Currently, all states have some kind of assessment system that (1) provides information about individual student achievement and (2) gauges the success of schools and school systems. Conventional wisdom is if standards are raised all students will benefit through greater student achievement and the efforts of educators will, in essence, be validated. All students includes students <b>with</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Their situation is complicated when it comes to accountability testing, particularly for students who are academically-able, like those who are in the high incidence category of learning disabilities. Alternate assessment for students who are severely disabled is even more challenging and comes with an additional set of testing challenges. Efforts to ensure fairness still continue today. These efforts are driven by both legislation and litigation. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), called the Improving America’s Schools Act (IASA), in 1994 mandated fairness in testing students <b>with</b> <b>disabilities,</b> as did the <b>Individual</b> <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> <b>Education</b> Act (IDEA) in 1997.

The most recent reauthorization of the <b>Individual's</b> <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> <b>Education</b> Improvement Act (IDEA, 2004) allows for the expansion of occupational therapy's role in school-based practice to include students who have not been identified for special education through early intervening services such as response to intervention (RtI).
