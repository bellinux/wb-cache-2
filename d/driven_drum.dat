50|$|In its {{simplest}} form {{an engine}} {{is connected to}} a rotating drum {{by means of an}} output shaft. A friction band is wrapped around half the drum's circumference and each end attached to a separate spring balance. A substantial pre-load is then applied {{to the ends of the}} band, so that each spring balance has an initial and identical reading. When the engine is running, the frictional force between the drum and the band will increase the force reading on one balance and decrease it on the other. The difference between the two readings multiplied by the radius of the <b>driven</b> <b>drum</b> is equal to the torque. If the engine speed is measured with a tachometer, the brake horsepower is easily calculated.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Adult emmetropes and myopes {{were tested}} with the Catford drum {{and the results}} {{compared}} with subjective (Landolt C) acuity. For the emmetropes the Catford drum was found to overestimate visual acuity {{by a factor of}} approximately 4. For myopes, and emmetropes viewing through plus lenses, the discrepancies were much larger. Since the Catford drum not only over-estimates acuity but will do so by a factor which varies for different visual disorders, caution is needed in clinical interpretation of results obtained with it. Catford and Oliver ' described an instrument for the objective determination of visual acuity. It consisted of a motor <b>driven</b> <b>drum</b> which could display black dots of various sizes in oscillatory motion against a white background. Acuities were determined by finding the smallest dot which could induce following oscillatory eye movements in the patient.

40|$|A Grapple Hoist Assembly is {{currently}} {{used on the}} Rotary Mode Core Sampling Trucks (RMCSTs) to actuate the sampler and retrieve the pintle rod during sampling operations. The hoist assembly includes a <b>driven</b> <b>drum</b> approximately two inches wide and six inches in diameter that rotates to pay out or reel in the 5 / 32 -in. cable The current Grapple Hoist Assembly, detailed on drawing H- 2 - 690057, is prone to ''bird nesting'' the cable on the drum. ''Bird nesting'' is {{a condition in which}} the cable does not wind onto the drum in a uniformly layered manner, but winds in a random fashion where the cable essentially ''piles up'' inappropriately on the drum and, on some occasions, winds on the drum drive shaft. A system to help control this ''bird nesting'' problem has been designed as an addition to the existing components of the Grapple Hoist Assembly. The new design consists of a mechanism that is timed with, and driven by, the shaft that drives the drum. This mechanism traverses {{back and forth across the}} width of the drum to lay the cable on the drum in a uniformly layered manner. This test plan establishes the acceptance criteria, test procedure and test conditions It also describes the test apparatus necessary to verify the adequacy of the level wind system design. The test is defined as qualification testing (LMHC 1999 b) and as such will be performed at conditions beyond the parameters that the Grapple Hoist Assembly is allowed to operate by the Safety Equipment List (SEL) (LMHC 1998) ...|$|E
40|$|Near-to-reality {{endurance}} {{testing of}} bikes An innovative test setup for complete bikes has been built. It {{consists of a}} three main parts: -	a servo <b>driven</b> <b>drum</b> -	a servo driven brake actuator -	a set of two servo driven “legs” Any type of bike can be tested without modification, just by using a cantilever arm to push the rear wheel of the bike on the drum. The drum is used to drive the rear wheel of the bike and simulate inertia forces, slope of the track, rolling resistance and air resistance. Internal resistance to acceleration of the drum is compensated. Since the drum is servo driven, any net torque {{as a function of}} speed can be applied. The forces applied by the cyclist are reproduced by the servo driven legs and can be alternated with braking forces on the rear wheel. The setup has initially been designed to perform endurance tests on mounted brake systems. The brake lever is pulled and controlled in order to cause a specific deceleration of the bike. After release of the lever the bike is accelerated by the drum and brakes are cooled based on scanned temperature values. The braking cycle is then repeated. For any brake system the number of “cycles to adjustment” and the number of “cycles to failure” can be measured according to the international standard Eumos 40701 - 1. In a second faze the test setup was extended to allow for endurance tests on the driving train of a bike. Each pedal is driven by an independent servo controlled leg. The forces on the pedals can vary {{as a function of the}} position of the pedal and can depend on the actual speed. The drum is used to generate the real life resistance forces. The test is applicable for any type of derailleur system as well as for e-bikes using a rear wheel drive or a crank motor. Right from the first tests it is observed that the frame of a bike is crucial for both types of tests. Forces on pedals do cause global deformation of the bike frame especially during “in the saddle” biking. Real life pedal forces can be measured easily using commer¬cially available sensors. Measured forces are categorized according to conventional theory for accelerated endurance testing. Categorized forces are applied on the pedals. They can be inter¬rupted by simulating an emergency brake if relevant. Unintentionally some poor quality metal frames failed completely. For composite frames an increase in deformation is observed. Therefore it is concluded that this test setup is very suitable for near-to-reality testing of complete bikes. Apparently it is very promising to quantify relevant bike stiffness parameters and their decrease during bicycle life time. However further improvements of the current setup are recommended, e. g. introduction of reaction forces on the steering bar could be important to improve the correlation between lab tests and reality. Ultimately it is expected that the remaining safe life time of a bike will be predictable using the test setup as described. status: submitte...|$|E
40|$|Several {{significant}} design improvements {{have been}} incorporated into the second-generation full-scale ELMS unit. A major improved design accomplishment was the increase of the load carrying capacity of elastic loops without severe weight or stress penalties. Redesign of the loop form and size, plus selection of a more advanced titanium alloy, resulted in performance characteristics representing a marked improvement over the first-generation unit. Another important design improvement was the shaping of the loop's footprint into a favorable form for uniform pressure distribution. Other improvements {{are associated with a}} more efficient drive torque transmission from the internal <b>drive</b> <b>drums</b> to the elastic loop which are expected to reduce the internal losses of the drive system. The new ELMS unit will be capable of being integrated, on a modularized basis, with a multi-loop articulated ELMS test vehicle as the next logical step {{in the development of the}} mobility concept...|$|R
50|$|These {{superseded}} wrap-spring single-revolution clutches in page printers, such as teleprinters, {{including the}} Teletype Model 28 and its successors, {{using the same}} design principles. IBM Selectric typewriters also used them. These are typically disc-shaped assemblies mounted on the driven shaft. Inside the hollow disc-shaped <b>drive</b> <b>drum</b> are two or three freely floating pawls arranged {{so that when the}} clutch is tripped, the pawls spring outward much like the shoes in a drum brake. When engaged, the load torque on each pawl transfers to the others to keep them engaged. These clutches do not slip once locked up, and they engage very quickly, on the order of milliseconds. A trip projection extends out from the assembly. If the trip lever engaged this projection, the clutch was disengaged. When the trip lever releases this projection, internal springs and friction engage the clutch. The clutch then rotates one or more turns, stopping when the trip lever again engages the trip projection.|$|R
