5|$|By 1606 {{the missionaries}} had {{concentrated}} many Manche Ch'ols in nine new mission towns, and {{had started to}} penetrate {{the territory of the}} neighbouring Mopan Maya, who were on the borders of the fiercely independent Itza of central Petén.

5|$|The US {{plan had}} been delayed by the wartime {{need to build}} smaller vessels. Nevertheless, <b>estimates</b> <b>by</b> the Admiralty were that by the early 1920s the Royal Navy would be behind in ships.

Seven more were intended to be laid down in 1920–21, six of these were the very large and powerful , armed with twelve 16-inch guns. The Japanese had finished one battleship {{since the end of the}} war and had three more under construction. To correct this state of affairs, the Admiralty initially planned to build three battleships and one battlecruiser in Fiscal Year (FY) 1921–22 and again in FY 1922–23, but this was changed to four s to be built first, presumably to be followed by the same number of battleships the following year.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of Tropical Storm Earl {{is attributed to}} a low-latitude, vigorous tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa and into the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August10. As the disturbance moved towards the west, satellite imagery revealed a much better structure with much-improved banding features and fair upper-level outflow, leading to the {{formation of}} Tropical Depression Five at 1800UTC on August13, situated roughly 1000mi (1610km) east of the Lesser Antilles. The depression progressed rapidly towards the west-northwest the following day, embedded and under the influence of a deep easterly flow around the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the cyclone's north. A combination of improved banding features and satellite intensity <b>estimates</b> <b>by</b> the afternoon of August14 led to the subsequent upgrade of the system to Tropical Storm Earl. At this time, the cyclone was situated about 325mi (525km/h) east of Barbados.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of April 18, 1906, a large {{earthquake}} with an epicenter {{near the city of}} San Francisco hit the region. Immediate casualty <b>estimates</b> <b>by</b> the U.S. Army's relief operations were 498 deaths in San Francisco, 64 deaths in Santa Rosa, and 102 in or near San Jose, for a total of about 700. More recent studies estimate the total death count to be over 3,000, with over 28,000 buildings destroyed. Rebuilding efforts began immediately. Amadeo Peter Giannini, owner of the Bank of Italy (now known as the Bank of America), had managed to retrieve the money from his bank's vaults before fires broke out through the city and was the only bank with liquid funds readily available and was instrumental in loaning out funds for rebuilding efforts. Congress immediately approved plans for a reservoir in Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park, a plan they had denied a few years earlier, which now provides drinking water for 2.4 million people in the Bay Area. By 1915, the city had been sufficiently rebuilt and advertised itself to the world during the Panama Pacific Exposition that year, although the effects of the quake hastened the loss of the region's dominant status in California to the Los Angeles metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Several {{authorities}} who accepted the structure's interpretation as a Roman road {{attempted to make}} more precise estimates of the date of its construction by identifying periods of Roman military activity in the region, since the majority of Roman roads were of military construction. Historian Albert Norman, writing in 1960, states that the Wheeldale structure most probably dates from either the first or fourth century AD but most sources appear to favour a first-century date: both historian Brian Hartley and Hayes & Rutter estimate around 80 AD; and Elgee estimates 86 AD. The earlier, first-century, estimates assume that the road is Roman and that Roman road-building in the region occurred around the time that Gnaeus Julius Agricola was the Roman governor of Britain. Agricola made {{a concerted effort to}} expand and consolidate Roman control over lands of the Brigantes tribes in the North York Moors area in the 80s AD and is thought to have ordered the construction of nearby Lease Rigg fort. The fourth-century <b>estimates,</b> <b>by</b> contrast, assume that the tribes in the North York Moors area were either bypassed or subdued in the first century but that, being of little importance strategically, their lands were not subject to Roman occupation or construction until the fourth century. A second wave of Roman military activity appears to have occurred in the region during this later period in response to new military incursions and raiding by Saxons, Picti, Scoti and Attacotti. The east coast of the North York Moors area formed the northern flank of the Saxon Shore defences believed to have been constructed against this perceived threat.|$|E

A ship about 105mi (165km) {{from the center}} reported sustained winds of 48mph (77km/h), supporting an upgrade to Tropical Storm Greg by 18:00UTC on September5. In spite of dissipating banding features, a large mass of extremely deep convection developed near the center that night.

Six hours later, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 986mbar (hPa; 29.12inHg). Greg maintained its status for many more hours, even though outflow became restricted to the northeast and low-level cloud lines near the storm's eye became exposed.|$|E
5|$|The first F-111C {{was officially}} {{delivered}} in 1968, finally giving Australia an aircraft that could fly to Jakarta, drop bombs, and return without refueling. (The RAAF only acquired air-to-air refueling for the F/A-18, possibly to avoid causing difficulties with other Asian countries {{by increasing the}} F-111C's already great range.) Training began in 1967, with RAAF personnel seeing terrain-following radar and other sophisticated equipment for the first time. However, development delays and structural problems delayed acceptance of aircraft by the RAAF until 1973. These issues were mainly {{to do with the}} wing attach points, and the redesign of the F-111 engine intakes. Completion of contractual requirements to the satisfaction of Australia also took time, damaging the morale of the hundreds of trained RAAF personnel who had little to do. The program costs, during 1963–1967, grew at an alarming rate; <b>estimates</b> <b>by</b> the USAF {{at the start of the}} program was placed at US$124.5 million, but by April 1967 had risen to $237.75 million. While the initial price of US$5.21 million per aircraft was capped at US$5.95 million, R, labor, and other costs were not. The rising price, three unexplained losses of USAF F-111As in Vietnam during their first month of deployment, and the British and U.S. Navy's orders' cancellations caused further controversy in Australia during 1968. By 1973, however, when the F-111A had accumulated 250,000 flight hours, it had the best safety record among contemporary aircraft, which presaged the F-111C's own excellent record.|$|E
