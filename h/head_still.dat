The next day the narrator sees him crawling along {{the road in the}} noon sun, with his hat off and gone mad. The narrator sends him to the local asylum. When he inquires two days later, he learns that Carnehan has died of sunstroke. No belongings were found with him.|$|E

500|$|The {{first series}} also sees {{a number of}} {{recurring}} characters and guest appearances. Rory MacGregor appears in two episodes as Colin Wells, an MI5 technical officer. American actress Megan Dodds appears in the first episode as CIA liaison Christine Dale. The producers were impressed enough by Dodds' performance that they wished to see her return in the second series. Kevin McNally appears as Robert Osbourne, the antagonist of the second episode. The producers felt the actor was suitable for the role, {{as was the case}} with Debra Stephenson, who played his wife Claire. In the fourth and fifth episodes, Hugh Laurie appears as Jools Siviter, a department head of MI6, an organisation depicted as [...] "" [...] compared with MI5. Laurie based his performance on Barry Foster's portrayal of the head of MI6 in Sweeney!. Meanwhile, also in episode four, Anthony Head, best known for his work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer at the time, played Peter Salter. Despite his status as a former Buffy regular, <b>Head</b> <b>still</b> had to earn the role from his audition.|$|E
500|$|The {{special effects}} were simple and {{limited by the}} budget. The {{on-screen}} blood was real in some cases, such as the scene in which Leatherface feeds [...] "Grandpa". The crew had difficulty getting the stage blood {{to come out of}} its tube, so instead Burns's index finger was cut with a razor. Burns's costume was so drenched with stage blood that it was [...] "virtually solid" [...] by the last day of shooting. The scene in which Leatherface decapitates Kirk with a chainsaw worried actor William Vail (Kirk). After telling Vail to stay still lest he really be killed, Hansen brought the running chainsaw to within [...] of Vail's face. A real hammer was used for the climactic scene at the end, with some takes also featuring a mock-up. However, the actor playing Grandpa was aiming for the floor rather than his victim's <b>head.</b> <b>Still,</b> the shoot was somewhat dangerous, with Hooper noting at the wrap party that all cast members had obtained some level of injury. He stated that [...] "everyone hated me {{by the end of the}} production" [...] and that [...] "it just took years for them to kind of cool off." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{encroachment}} {{continued into}} the 16th century until the western area of the square (where the Dark Lantern public house is today) was a complex of alleys and lanes. [...] This curious maze-like complex existed until the 1960s redevelopment of the town, and the King's <b>Head</b> <b>still</b> appears to be partially hidden by buildings in front of it.|$|E

50|$|Until 1958 {{he was a}} School of Paris {{painter of}} figures, <b>heads,</b> <b>still</b> lifes and interiors. However, his later {{paintings}} were abstracts, and he was quickly {{recognized as one of}} Australia's few superlative abstract expressionists. His work has been compared favourably with that of Jackson Pollock.|$|R
5000|$|Ribeiro's {{creative}} life spanned half a century, {{during which}} time he became known for a [...] "huge body" [...] of figurative and abstract work. Among his artistic productions were portrait <b>heads,</b> <b>still</b> lifes, landscapes, and pigment experiments {{dating back to the}} early 1960s which [...] "lead to works of peculiar brilliance and transparency." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2007, Lee {{collaborated with}} Burton on , playing {{the spirit of}} Sweeney Todd's victims, called the Gentleman Ghost, {{alongside}} Anthony Head, with both singing [...] "The Ballad of Sweeney Todd", its reprises and the Epilogue. These songs were recorded, but eventually cut since Burton felt that the songs were too theatrical for the film. Lee's appearance was completely cut from the film, but <b>Head</b> <b>still</b> had an uncredited one-line cameo. In 2008, he was offered the role of King Balor in Guillermo del Toro's , but had to turn it down due to prior commitments.|$|E
2500|$|In Act 3, Scene 3, after Warwick {{has joined}} the Lancastrians, he vows to Margaret [...] "to force the tyrant from his seat by war" [...] (l.206), and {{promises}} [...] "I'll uncrown him ere't be long" [...] (l.232). He also muses to himself [...] "I was the chief that raised him to the crown,/And I'll be chief to bring him down again" [...] (ll.263–264). In Act 4, Scene 6, after Warwick has successfully deposed Edward, Henry says to him, [...] "Warwick, although my <b>head</b> <b>still</b> wear the crown,/I here resign my government to thee" [...] (l.24). Finally, upon meeting Richmond (the future Henry VII), Henry proclaims, [...] "His head by nature framed to wear a crown,/His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself/Likely in time to bless a regal throne" [...] (ll.72–74).|$|E
2500|$|Objects {{viewed in}} a (plane) mirror will appear {{laterally}} inverted (e.g., if one raises one's right hand, the image's left hand will appear {{to go up}} in the mirror), but not vertically inverted (in the image a person's <b>head</b> <b>still</b> appears above his body). However, a mirror does not usually [...] "swap" [...] left and right any more than it swaps top and bottom. A mirror typically reverses the forward/backward axis. To be precise, it reverses the object in the direction perpendicular to the mirror surface (the normal). Because left and right are defined relative to front-back and top-bottom, the [...] "flipping" [...] of front and back results in the perception of a left-right reversal in the image. (If you stand side-on to a mirror, the mirror really does reverse your left and right, because that's the direction perpendicular to the mirror.) ...|$|E
50|$|According to {{the notes}} {{preceding}} the ballad, {{the well of}} Vänge (Vänge brunn), which appeared {{at the spot where}} the young maidens lost their <b>heads,</b> <b>still</b> existed in the 17th century, according to a manuscript from 1673, and an old smithy in the forest nearby was held to be haunted at midnight by the apparitions of the young girls.|$|R

60|$|There was no {{help for}} it, {{and with their}} <b>heads</b> <b>still</b> in a whirl, the Rovers and Stanley were taken to two rooms not used {{by any of the}} other students.

2500|$|The rise of this [...] "most celebrated of the parvenues" [...] (Charles Brand) to such power, his haughtiness and ruthlessness, and his {{complicity}} {{in the murder of}} Alexios II and in Andronikos' increasingly tyrannic rule, with its bloody purges of the aristocracy, combined to make Hagiochristophorites an object of hatred for the traditional elites, as attested in the writings of contemporaries and subsequent historians. Choniates describes Stephen's role in the proscriptions as the [...] "ringleader and chief" [...] of Andronikos' partisans, [...] "whose thunderous voice crashed through the palace, sweeping away [...] all who were deemed suspect by Andronikos." [...] Indeed, Choniates records that his surname, literally meaning [...] "Holy Bearer of Christ"—although originally probably reflecting a place of origin dedicated to Saint Christopher—was popularly changed to Ἀντιχριστοφορίτης, Antichristophorites, literally meaning [...] "bearer of the Antichrist", for, in the words of Choniates, [...] "he was the most shameless of Andronikos' attendants, filled with every wickedness". Likewise, Niketas' brother, the Archbishop of Athens Michael Choniates called him [...] "the iron nerve of tyranny", while a [...] "dialogue of the dead" [...] written after Andronikos' overthrow depicts him, <b>head</b> <b>still</b> cloven in two, trying to tax the dead in Hades in order to pay for his passage on Charon's boat.|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} of head movements to sound localisation of loudspeakers in a listening room was investigated. An experiment was done where listeners either were requested {{to keep their}} <b>heads</b> <b>still</b> while sound was being presented or were allowed to move freely while seated on a chair. The results give {{an indication of how}} well listeners can perform the task and what contribution head movements has. The same localisation task was performed while listeners were presented with a simulation of the loudspeakers implemented by means of binaural synthesis. As in the “real life ” case listeners either had to sit still or were allowed to move their heads. The binaural synthesis was implemented by means of measured binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs), for which the direct sound was updated according to the head position of the listener. Pilot experiments showed that localisation generally improves when head movements are allowed, compared to when listeners keep their <b>heads</b> <b>still</b> during sound presentations. This encouraging result lead to the design of a full-scale experiment that is currently under way. The results will be reported at the ICAD 2000 conference. 1...|$|R
